Texto completo: House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff pressed the intelligence community to let him know if Attorney General William Barr declassifies any documents pertaining to the Russia investigation over their objections.
Last week President Trump delegated Barr "full and complete authority to declassify information" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House also instructed several agencies to cooperate with Barr's inquiry, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Department, the State Department, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
In a letter Friday to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Schiff wrote that Trump's memo "perniciously" seeks the intelligence community's help to "politicize the IC and law enforcement, to delegitimize the well-founded investigation into the President, and and to attack the President's political enemies."
Schiff demanded Coats keep him apprised of the intelligence community's activities, including "any declassification that has been or will be made over IC objection," and set a deadline of June 6 to hear back.
Coats has already spoken out about Trump's order. In a statement, he offered some reassurance about the limited scope of what can be made available to the public due to national security concerns.
"Much like we have with other investigations and reviews, the Intelligence Community will provide the Department of Justice all of the appropriate information for its review of intelligence activities related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election," Coats said Friday. "As part of that process, I am confident that the Attorney General will work with the IC in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk."
Over the weekend, Schiff predicted Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel will resist Trump's move to declassify intelligence related to the Russia investigation.
Should pressure from Trump become too great, Schiff suggested this pair of intelligence leaders follow the example of former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and resign. “If it gets to a point they are asked to do things that are unlawful or jeopardize the men and women that work within the IC, they should speak out,” the California Democrat told the New York Times, “and, if necessary, follow the example of Secretary Mattis.”
Mattis resigned late last year in protest of Trump's plan to pull U.S. troops out of Syria and Afghanistan.

Texto completo: The New York Times is clamping down on its reporters appearing on opinionated cable news shows to avoid the appearance of “bias.”
The newspaper recently blocked its finance editor David Enrich from appearing on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show to talk about his reporting on President Trump’s finances and Deutsche Bank, according to according to Vanity Fair. The paper has also placed Lawrence O'Donnell’s show on MSNBC and Don Lemon’s show on CNN on its blacklist.
“In deciding whether to make a radio, television or Internet appearance, a staff member should consider its probable tone and content to make sure they are consistent with Times standards.” the New York Times ethics guide states. “Staff members should avoid strident, theatrical forums that emphasize punditry and reckless opinion-mongering."
Reporters with the New York Times have been able to turn their reporting into numerous hits on MSNBC and CNN, boosting their brand and sometimes landing lucrative contributor contracts. It’s unclear how the New York Times’s recent enforcement of its ethics rules may affect those contributor contracts and the paper’s relationship with the networks.
The New York Times’s Maggie Haberman, Julie Davis, Patrick Healy, Caitlin Dickerson, Astead Herndon and others are paid contributors to CNN. Michael Schmidt, Nicholas Confessore, Jeremy Peters, Mike Isaac, Megan Twohey, and others have similar contracts with MSNBC. No New York Times reporters are contributors to Fox News.

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — Some U.S. citizens struggling under the weight of student loan debt have packed their bags and fled to countries with a lower cost of living and no debt collectors, according to a recent report by CNBC.
“It may be an issue we see an uptick in if the trends keep up,” Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, told CNBC.
Student loan debt in 2019 is the highest it has ever been in the United States, Forbes reported in February. More than 44 million borrowers owe $1.5 trillion collectively to the U.S. government alone, making it the second highest consumer debt category behind mortgage debt.
Borrowers in the class of 2019 owed $28,650 on average, Forbes said. Furthermore, 11.4 percent of borrowers are more than 90 days delinquent on their payments. And the problem seems to only be worsening, according to Business Insider.
As a result of growing concern among students, recent graduates and parents, Business Insider believes that student debt will be at the forefront of discussion in the 2020 presidential race. Here is what some candidates have pitched as their solutions to the crisis:
Donald Trump, Republican incumbent
President Donald Trump, who is running for re-election in 2020, released some major changes to the way student loans would be managed in his 2020 budget proposal. The proposal indicated a $7.1 billion (10 percent) decrease compared to the funding allocated to the U.S. Department of Education in 2019. The main changes he plans to make include:

Ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program

Reducing the number of income-driven repayment plans for federal student loans to one and offering student loan forgiveness for both undergraduate and graduate loans. He would do this through capping monthly loan payments at 12.5 percent of the person’s income and forgiving their debt after 15 years for undergraduate students. For graduate student loans, payments would also be capped at 12.5 percent of income, and remaining student loan debt would be forgiven after 30 years of monthly payments.

Ending subsidized student loans, which traditionally means that the federal government covers the cost of interest while the borrower is still in school.


William F. Weld, Republic candidate
Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld was the first Republican to challenge President Trump for the 2020 election and has been a vocal critic of the president, according to the New York Times. Weld tends to be liberal on many social issues while being highly conservative fiscally, and has previously identified with the Libertarian party.
In terms of education, Weld told Boston.com that though he thinks the U.S. should consider abolishing the Department of Education to shift towards local and charter-controlled schools, he believes in-state tuition ought to be free at two-year post-secondary schools for displaced workers. He also wants to encourage online classes to help mitigate the costs of room and board.
Weld says students should be able to refinance their college loans. “If we don’t do this, the door to the middle class may be closed to the working poor,” he told Boston.com. “That would be an endgame that we as a society cannot afford.”
Joe Biden, Democratic candidate
Former Vice President Joe Biden's position toward education and student loans has consistently been tumultuous. He was a significant force behind a bankruptcy reform bill when he was a Delaware senator that led to the act of discharging private student loan debt in bankruptcy becoming nearly impossible, according to Politico.
That said, Biden has changed his tune in recent years and has endorsed free college, according to Vox. His campaign language has not addressed student loans in specific.
Kamala Harris, Democratic candidate
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has been heavily involved in making education more affordable during her time as a senator. She co-sponsored Bernie Sanders’ College for All Act, according to Forbes, and she has been an instrumental player in reintroducing the Debt-Free College Act, which would reverse the growing student debt crisis in the U.S.
Harris recently tweeted out her support of debt-free education, adding that student loan debt is now higher than credit card debt.
Beto O’Rourke, Democratic candidate
Beto O’Rourke, a former congressman from Texas, hasn’t presented much in the way of education and student loan proposals. As a Senate candidate in 2018, he suggested giving debt forgiveness to students moving home to struggling areas so that they don’t have to seek employment in big cities in order to pay off their loans, Forbes reported. He also suggested giving loan forgiveness to teachers but didn’t clarify details.
Bernie Sanders, Democratic candidate
Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., has a goal of delivering free education to all, according to his website. He believes all students deserve to receive a high-quality education at an affordable cost, for anything from early schooling to advanced education.
Sanders’s 2020 campaign centers on the following in regards to education:

Free tuition for all public colleges and universities. He plans to cover the cost of free tuition completely through what he calls a “Robin Hood” tax on Wall Street that would add 0.5 percent fees onto investment houses, hedge funds and other stock trades, in addition to a 0.1 percent fee on bonds.

Student loan interest rates should be heavily reduced. In his College for All Act, Sanders’ promised to cut student loan interest rates in half.


Elizabeth Warren, Democratic candidate
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., believes that as president she could wipe out student loan debt for millions of U.S. citizens, according to a blog post she published in April.
In the post, Warren said, “We got into this crisis because state governments and the federal government decided that instead of treating higher education like our public school system  —  free and accessible to all Americans  —  they’d rather cut taxes for billionaires and giant corporations and offload the cost of higher education onto students and their families. The student debt crisis is the direct result of this failed experiment.”
In response, Warren is calling for the cancellation of up to $50,000 in student loan debts for around 42 million U.S. citizens. Her proposal laid out in the blog post also seeks to increase wealth for “Black and Latinx families” and reduce wealth gaps as well as provide an “enormous middle-class stimulus that will boost economic growth, increase home purchases, and fuel a new wave of small business formation.”
Warren went on to describe how a student debt crisis can be avoided in the future through giving every American the ability to attend two- and four-year colleges with no tuition or fees, and through making free college truly universal.
She plans to achieve this through the “Ultra-Millionaire Tax," according to the blog post. This tax manifests as a 2 percent annual tax on families with $50 million or more in wealth.
“For decades, we’ve allowed the wealthy to pay less while burying tens of millions of working Americans in education debt,” Warren said. “It’s time to make different choices.”

Marc Thiessen: Julian Assange is a spy, not a journalist

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called WikiLeaks a “nonstate hostile intelligence service.” Apparently Julian Assange agrees. In its new 18-count indictment of Assange for multiple violations of the Espionage Act, the Justice Department notes that Assange told former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning that WikiLeaks had originally described itself as an “intelligence agency” for the people.
Now, at long last, the head of that enemy intelligence agency is facing a possible 175 years in a federal penitentiary for his theft of American secrets.
The damage Assange has done is unfathomable. In 2010, he exploded what he called his “thermonuclear device” — releasing a tranche of more than a quarter of a million classified State Department diplomatic cables, all unredacted. According to the indictment, those cables “included names of persons throughout the world who provided information to the U.S. government in circumstances in which they could reasonably expect that their identities would be kept confidential. These sources included journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates, and political dissidents who were living in repressive regimes and reported to the United States the abuses of their own government, and the political conditions within their countries, at great risk to their own safety.”
The indictment cites specific examples of sources WikiLeaks burned inside China, Iran, Iraq and Syria. Moreover, Assange’s decision to release 90,000 Afghanistan war-related activity reports also revealed the identities of at least 100 Afghans who were informing on the Taliban. The indictment quotes a New York Times interview with a Taliban leader who told the paper, “We are studying the report. We knew about the spies and people who collaborate with U.S. forces. We will investigate through our own secret service whether the people mentioned are really spies working for the U.S. If they are U.S. spies, then we know how to punish them.”
Assange’s stolen classified documents didn’t just find their way to the Taliban; the indictment points out that WikiLeaks copies were also found in Osama bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. During the raid that killed the al-Qaida leader, U.S. forces recovered “a letter from bin Laden to another member of the terrorist organization al-Qaida in which bin Laden requested that the member gather the DoD material posted to WikiLeaks” as well as a response from that al-Qaida operative providing him with the secret U.S. government documents Assange had provided.
Indeed, Assange’s disclosures nearly blew the bin Laden operation. Just one week before the raid, Assange released his “Gitmo files “which contained information that could have tipped off bin Laden that the CIA was closing in on him. One of Assange’s stolen documents — the file on Abu Faraj al-Libi, al-Qaida’s captured operational commander — revealed that Faraj had “reported on al-Qaida’s methods for choosing and employing couriers, as well as preferred communications means”; that he had “received a letter from UBL’s designated courier” who was “the official messenger between UBL and others in Pakistan”; and that “in mid-2003, [Faraj] moved his family to Abbottabad, and worked between Abbottabad and Peshawar,” Pakistan. The CIA tracked bin Laden down to Abbottabad by following his courier, thanks, in large part, to information provided by Faraj. Had bin Laden read that document detailing what Faraj had told the agency, he could have known that the United States had made the connection between his courier and his Abbottabad hideout. Fortunately, U.S. Special Operations forces did not give bin Laden time to figure it out.
The indictment leaves out much of the damage Assange did, such as his 2014 release of classified CIA documents exposing how CIA operatives maintain cover while traveling through airports; his 2016 release of documents detailing European Union military operations to intercept refugee boats traveling to Europe from terrorist-infested regions along the Libyan coast; and his 2016 exposure of top-secret documents describing NSA intercepts of foreign government communications.
Some are concerned that the newest Assange indictment will help set a precedent to go after investigative journalists who publish classified information. But as I wrote in 2010, unlike “reputable news organizations, Assange did not give the U.S. government an opportunity to review the classified information WikiLeaks was planning to release so they could raise national security objections.” So responsible journalists have nothing to fear.
Regardless, Assange is not a journalist. He is a spy. The fact that he gave stolen U.S. intelligence to al-Qaida, the Taliban, China, Iran and other adversaries via a website rather than dead-drops is irrelevant. He engaged in espionage against the United States. And he has no remorse for the harm he has caused. He once called the innocent people hurt by his disclosures “collateral damage” and admitted WikiLeaks might get “blood on our hands.” Sorry, he does not get to aid and abet our enemies, put countless lives at risk and then hide behind the First Amendment. The Justice Department is right to indict him for his crimes.

Trump disses Harriet Tubman

Texto completo: Maybe Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin is correct when he says the reason for delaying the long-planned Harriet Tubman $20 bill is that he’s got his hands full at the moment fighting counterfeiting. It’s possible, right?
What is far more probable is that President Donald Trump’s notorious petulance kicked in – or at least Mnu- chin thought it might, so he made sure the Tubman bill would not replace the Andrew Jackson bill for now.
Tubman was the ex-slave and abolitionist whose image was chosen to bump Jackson’s after an extensive public campaign to redesign the bill. The release date was to be next year, on the 100th anniversary of the constitutional amendment that acknowledged a woman’s right to vote.
Trump hated the idea. The proper place for Tubman, Trump said, was not the $20, but the rarely used $2 bill. You know – out of sight, out of mind.
The New York Times quoted senior Treasury officials as saying that Mnuchin feared Trump might cancel the Tubman bill, so he opted to avoid the outcry by delaying the release of the bill from next year to 2028.
That will mean that Jackson, who led the deportation of Native Americans from their homes in the Eastern U.S. to Oklahoma and other territories, and to whom Trump compares himself, will continue to be in circulation without any competition.
It will also mean that for another eight years, the mini hall of fame that is the nation’s paper currency will continue to be exclusively white and male. That’s shameful. And it’s petty.

Texto completo: As news of Bill Buckner’s death spread Monday, reports chronicled his impressive 2,715 career hits — and revisited the error that would come to overshadow his accomplishments.
It was 1986, Game 6 of the World Series. Buckner, then playing for the Boston Red Sox after years as a Chicago Cub, let a ball roll through his legs, allowing the Mets to score and go on to win the series.
Yes, the error hit hard in a town that had not won a World Series since 1918. But the response was far more tragic than the error: Buckner received death threats and ultimately had to move his family out of Massachusetts.
Today, with the ease of the internet and the sting of social media, it likely would have been worse. To those who don’t understand the fervor surrounding professional sports — who find the culture at times distasteful — the Buckner incident goes a long way toward illustrating why.
In this country, we are too quick to turn athletes into heroes — and too quick to turn away from them when their talents, or bodies, fail them. And too often, we are just as fickle with people in other professions and even with ourselves.
We all make mistakes in our professional lives. And we all dread making one that will define the careers we work so hard to build.
As the Daily Herald’s own sports columnist Barry Rozner pointed out, Buckner finished his career with 2,715 hits, 498 doubles, 1,208 RBI and only 453 strikeouts in 10,000 plate appearances. In a perfect world, those are the numbers that should shape his legacy, rather than a single error.
At a news conference years after the World Series play, Buckner called the spotlight on his error "the ugly part of sports," The New York Times reported. "I don’t think that in society in general that’s the way we should operate," he said at the time. "What are you teaching kids? Not to try because if you don’t succeed, then you’re going to be buried, so don’t try?"
It’s a fair and important question, one given added emphasis as we glance over the pictures of high school graduates that have filled this newspaper’s pages and Facebook feeds in recent days.
Those graduates will venture out into the world. Some will start work after tossing their caps into the air. Others will head off to college. A select few will try their luck in professional sports.
Every one of them will make mistakes.
A verbal beating like the one Buckner took should never discourage them from chasing their dreams, but it should make them think twice before publicly trashing a colleague — or a stranger — for a mistake.
And they should take notes on how Buckner moved on from his. He didn’t pass blame. He didn’t give up. He soldiered on with grace.
Ultimately, that is the lesson we can all draw on, whatever our station or profession.

Liberalism challenged worldwide

Texto completo: In Australia on May 18, the party of the left lost an election it was supposed to win, to a conservative government headed by an evangelical Christian who won working-class votes by opposing liberal climate policies. In India last week, the Hindu-nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, won an overwhelming electoral victory. And Europeans just elected a Parliament that promises to have more populist representation than before.
The global fade of liberalism, in other words, appears to be continuing. Right-wing populism struggles to govern effectively, but it clearly has a durable political appeal - which, as Tyler Cowen points out in a Bloomberg column, has not yet been counteracted by the new socialism, the new new left.
The global context is useful for thinking about how American liberals understand their own situation. Since the shock of Donald Trump's election, many liberals have decided that their own coalition is the real American majority, victimized by un-democratic institutions and an anti-democratic GOP. Their mood is one of anger at the System, and confidence in their unacknowledged, temporarily-impeded mandate: They've got the structures, but we've got the numbers.
But what if American liberals, while unfortunate in the Electoral College, are luckier than they think in other ways? The fact that populism is flourishing internationally, far from the Electoral College and Fox News, suggests that Trump's specific faults might actually be propping up American liberalism. If we had a populist president who didn't alienate so many persuadable voters, who took full advantage of a strong economy, and who had the political cunning displayed by Modi or Benjamin Netanyahu or Viktor Orban, the liberal belief in a hidden left-of-center mandate might be exposed as a fond delusion.
That liberal belief may also misunderstand the real correlation of forces in our politics. We had an example last week on our op-ed podcast, The Argument, where my colleague and co-host David Leonhardt interviewed Pete Buttigieg, the Midwestern mayor running for president with promises to build bridges between the heartland and the coasts. Leonhardt pressed Buttigieg on whether that bridge-building might include compromise on any social issues, and the answer seemed to be "no" - in part because Mayor Pete argued that on abortion and guns and immigration most middle Americans already agree with Democrats, that the liberal position is already the common ground.
The strategic flaw in this reading of the liberal situation is that politics isn't about casually held opinions on a wide range of topics, but focused prioritization of specifics. As the Democratic data analyst David Shor has noted, you can take a cluster of nine Democratic positions that each poll over 50% individually, and find that only 18% of Americans agree with all of them. And a single strong, focused disagreement can be enough to turn a voter against liberalism, especially if liberals seem uncompromising on that issue.
A pattern of narrow, issue-by-issue resistance is also what you'd expect in an era where the popular culture is more monolithically left-wing than before. That cultural dominance establishes a broad, shallow left-of-center consensus, which then evaporates when people have some personal reason to reject liberalism, or confront the limits of its case.
None of this needs to spell doom for liberals; it just requires them to prioritize and compromise. If you want to put climate change at the center of liberal politics, for instance, then you'll keep losing voters in the Rust Belt, just as liberal parties have lost similar voters in Europe and Australia. In which case you would need to reassure some other group, be it suburban evangelicals or libertarians, that you're willing to compromise on the issues that keep them from voting Democratic.
Alternatively, if you want to make crushing religious conservatives your mission, then you need to woo secular populists on guns or immigration, or peel off more of the tax-sensitive upper middle class by not going full socialist.
But the liberal impulse at the moment, Buttigiegian as well as Ocasio-Cortezan, is to insist that liberalism is a seamless garment, an indivisible agenda that need not be compromised on any front. And instead of recognizing populism as a motley coalition united primarily by opposition to liberalism's rule, liberals want to believe they're facing a unitary enemy - a revanchist patriarchal white supremacy, infecting every branch and tributary of the right.
In this view, it's not enough to see racial resentment as one important form of anti-liberalism (which it surely is); all anti-liberalism must fall under the canopy. Libertarianism is white supremacy, the NRA is white supremacy, immigration skepticism is white supremacy, tax-sensitive suburbia is white supremacy, the pro-life movement is white supremacy, anxiety about terrorism is white supremacy ... and you can't compromise with white supremacists, you can only crush them.
Which liberals may do in 2020, because Trump remains eminently beatable. But in the long run, the global trend suggests that a liberalism that remains inflexible in the face of variegated resistance is the ideology more likely to be crushed.

Adequate public investment would be best gift to Class of '19

Texto completo: Around the turn of the last century, the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie paid to build 1,689 libraries across the United States. Many are still in use, celebrated as monumental works of philanthropy.
They should be seen as monuments to the failure of public policy. The United States could have built a lot more libraries by taxing the incomes of Carnegie and his fellow Gilded Age plutocrats but, at the turn of the last century, there was no federal income tax.
A new generation of plutocrats has amassed great fortunes, in part because the federal government has minimized the burden of taxation. Americans once again are reduced to applauding acts of philanthropy necessitated by failures of policy.
Robert Smith, a wealthy financier, announced during recent graduation ceremonies at Morehouse College that he would repay the student loans taken by the 396 men in this year's graduating class. The promise, which may cost Mr. Smith up to $40 million, was an act of generosity gratefully received by the new graduates of the historically black, all-male Atlanta college.
But their gratitude underscores the reality that hundreds of thousands of other members of the class of 2019 will be carrying unrelieved burdens of debt as they begin their adult lives. On average, recipients of bachelor's degrees in 2016 left school owing about $30,301, according to the most recent federal data. Parents, on average, incurred another $33,291 in debt.
The substitution of philanthropy for public policy is most glaring in the realm of health care, where it has become appallingly common for Americans to beg friends and strangers for the money necessary to pay for treatment. The fund-raising website GoFundMe estimates that it hosts about 250,000 fund-raisers for medical expenses each year.
The same dynamic is at work in higher education. Since 2001, a handful of elite institutions led by Princeton University have committed to tap their endowments to provide funding for students to graduate without loans. Last year, Michael Bloomberg pledged $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins to reduce the reliance of Hopkins students on borrowed money. But most American colleges, including Morehouse, lack the resources to make such a commitment.
A number of the Democratic candidates for president have proposed large increases in federal funding for higher education to offset the rise of tuition costs and the decline of state funding.
The problem facing policymakers is not merely a lack of will, but also a lack of money. The federal government collected 16.5 percent of the nation's economic output last year — well below the 17.4 percent average federal share over the last half century. The primary reason for the shortfall, of course, is the steady reduction of income taxation. No one has benefited more from that trend than financiers like Morehouse College's 2019 graduation speaker.
Mr. Smith co-founded the private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, which invests in software companies, and he has amassed his fortune thanks in part to a provision of federal tax law known as the "carried interest loophole" — a provision he has publicly supported.
The loophole is projected to cost the government about $15.6 billion in lost revenue between 2016 and 2025. President Trump promised to close it during the 2016 campaign, and he promised to close it as part of his 2017 tax bill. But he did not keep that promise. Instead, the White House and congressional Republicans honored the wishes of the finance industry.
Closing that loophole would be a much better graduation present for the class of 2019.

Texto completo: The Democrats running the House of Representatives have gone insane — and they prove it every day.
Despite the conclusions of the Mueller Report, Nancy Pelosi and her Deranged Democrat underlings in the House have not given up their fight to depose President Trump. They have six kangaroo committees in the House subpoenaing anyone who ever played golf with the president and looking everywhere they can for whatever financial or personal dirt they can find to use against him and his administration.
The Mad House Democrats don't care what irresponsible charges they make. When it comes to Trump, all's fair in hate and war.
Meanwhile, while they make fools of themselves and waste time trying to over-ride the Mueller Report, the Deranged Democrats refuse to do a single thing about the invasion of migrants on our southern border.
No Democrat would be caught dead calling it "an invasion." Neither would any journalist or pundit employed by CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times or the Washington Post. But when you have thousands and thousands of Central American asylum seekers over-running our border every day and overwhelming our ability to process and properly care for their families, it's an invasion.
Overcrowding is so bad now at the Texas border that the Border Patrol has had to fly or bus migrant families to processing centers in towns like Santa Fe, Denver, San Diego, San Bernardino and Murrieta, a city of about 100,000 between LA and San Diego.
No one is quite sure where they go after they are processed, but it could be anywhere. And they have little or no money, no food, no place to stay — just a slip of paper telling them to show up at their asylum hearing two years from now.
There's nothing planned.
The mainstream liberal media are especially at fault because they have done such a biased, half-butted job of covering the migrant invasion. They've shown us every misery suffered by the poor migrants after they get to American soil. And they've made sure the whole country knows the details about the separated families and the tragic deaths of six kids in U.S. custody — all of which, of course, are entirely the fault of a man named Trump.
They have consistently underplayed the scope of the invasion problem, its economic and social costs, its causes (bad immigration laws and a chicken Congress) and ignored its many other victims — the American ones.
The migrant invasion has hurt the overworked border patrol officers, the people and property owners in the towns at the border, American taxpayers and the poorest citizens of the USA whose unskilled jobs are most likely to be taken by migrants.
Now we have cities and towns far from the border becoming the latest victims of Washington's failure to fix immigration. It's their citizens who are going to have to pay for a lot of the food, housing, policing, education and healthcare of the migrants.

QUESTIONS ARISE ABOUT AUTHENTICITY OF PETER MAX'S RECENT ART

Texto completo: The owner of a company that organized a Pittsburgh gallery's exhibit this month of the artwork of Peter Max disputes claims in a New York Times story that the famed, 81-year-old pop artist is suffering from "advanced dementia" and has not "painted seriously in four years."
"I was just with him two weeks ago and I saw him paint," said Nim Vaswani, owner of Road Show Company, which organized the exhibit at Christine Frechard Gallery in Lawrenceville. "We did a show in his studio. We do one every month."
Mr. Vaswani, who has worked with Max for 22 years, said he has clearly slowed down and "sometimes repeats himself," but "he knows who he is."
"When he first saw me [two weeks ago], he called out to me, 'Nimski!' like he always does," he said.
The story in the Times on Tuesday is just the result of "legal problems going on," Mr. Vaswani said. "There's a lot of mudslinging."
"I think it's grossly exaggerated, from what I read," he said.
Witnesses told the Times that a frail Max was seen scribbling his name on artworks being churned out of his studio by painters recruited off the street in an operation run by his estranged son, Adam, and three business associates. These business dealings are the subject of a recent lawsuit over his artwork filed by his daughter, Libra.
In her Times story about new legal battles over Max's artwork, reporter Amy Chozick describes an encounter with him in April, writing, "I told Mr. Max that I was a Times reporter - and that two family friends had suggested that I stop by - but he didn't seem to understand. He just shrugged, asked me several times what year it was and then told me that he had spent his childhood in Shanghai."
Mr. Vaswani said that similar concerns about Max and his operation started to be raised about three years ago in other articles but, "It blows over."
Neither Mr. Vaswani nor Christine Frechard had yet received any calls of concern from people who bought some of Max's paintings.
Fox Chapel resident Lori Merlot, who, with her husband, Vincent, has bought multiple Max paintings from Road Show, said she had no concerns about the paintings. That's because she and her husband visited him in his studio last June and spent time with Max talking about his work and having him sign books and pieces she bought.
"He's engaging. He signed everything we bought, sometimes drawing sketches on the back. And I have tons of pictures with him and my husband," said Ms. Merlot, who, with her husband, owns a truck tarp company in Verona.
"So when I read the [Times] article, I'm like, 'I don't get this.' I met the man. I talked with the man. He didn't seem incapacitated at all," she said. "He seemed fine. He did seem tired, but he seemed tired from the event."
Ms. Frechard said 10 to 14 Max paintings were sold at the two-week exhibit in her studio that ended last week. It was titled, "PETER MAX: The Retrospective 1960 to 2019 Collected Works from the Studio of America's Iconic Pop Artist."
The paintings for sale - with prices ranging from $5,000 to $69,000 - were technically being sold by Road Show Company, but Ms. Frechard receives a commission from each sale, she said.
Max is a major part of Road Show's business, and he is one of four featured artists -Salvador Dali is another - on the company's website: roadshowcompany.com.
Max did not come to the exhibit's opening this time, however, like he did at an exhibit there five years ago, Ms. Frechard said.
"I asked why he couldn't come this time and they said, 'He's not doing well,'" she said.
Mr. Vaswani said that is true and Max stopped traveling very far for exhibits about two years ago, though he will go to exhibits that are just a car ride away, as he did for the July 2018 opening of an exhibit at the Hard Rock Cafe in Atlantic City, N.J.
Another concession to his aging, Mr. Vaswani said, is that he does get assistance from staff in preparing a canvas before he begins the final painting.
"Does he paint from start to finish? No. He has staff who prepare the canvas for him and he finishes it, just like many big artists like [Andy] Warhol did," he said.
"Warhol had something called 'The Factory'" to help produce art, Mr. Vaswani said. "Warhol didn't do any painting himself. Peter does."
What also was different from this last Pittsburgh exhibit, is that Max did not do a phone interview for publicity, though he did do a cover artwork for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
In advance of the opening in early May, a representative from his studio reached out to the Post-Gazette, offering to design the cover of the newspaper's Weekend Magazine, as Max did for a show here back in 2003.
The Post-Gazette Arts&Entertainment department agreed, and Max's representative, Ann Taylor, wrote, "Peter is excited to create cover art for your weekend cover of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette for the weekend of May 10-12."
She asked for the cover specs and the logo, writing "Peter uses [it] for placement as he creates the cover and will colorize it as well." She also asked for "a cover art theme you would like him to work from." The Post-Gazette suggested he play off of the fountain at Point State Park or PPG Place.
Unlike the phone interview the Post-Gazette did with the artist in 2004, she offered an email interview. The questions were sent to her on April 26 and she replied, "Peter always has a way of surprising with his stories and memories, so I'm sure he will give you colorful and interesting answers!"
In light of the Times story, the Post-Gazette has attempted to contact Ms. Taylor regarding the authenticity of the artwork and the interview responses but has yet to hear back.
Mr. Vaswani said he understands that Max also gets assistance with interviews. "Somebody will read a question [from an email] to him and he gives an answer and they type it for him," he said.
Mr. Vaswani said that he sees Max at least once every month at exhibits in his New York City studio that are the result of an idea Max had when he decided that he could no longer fly to exhibits.
At Max gallery shows like the one in Pittsburgh, if a buyer pays $8,000 or more to buy a painting, the sale also includes a plane ticket to New York, one night in a hotel and dinner, before a visit with Max the following morning in his studio.
"This was his idea," Mr. Vaswani said. "It was his way of saying, 'I can't go there. But let them come here.'"
Ms. Merlot said she and her husband were invited back for a second meeting with Max this July, and they are headed back to New York because she believes Mr. Vaswani.
"Nim would not invite us back if he was going to pay us to go, put us up in a hotel, and take us to the [Max] studio if he was going to say at the last minute, 'Oh, he can't be there,'" she said.

Texto completo: Headnote TECH TIP
No matter what you call it - chroma key, green screen or blue screen - it's the film and video technique that gives your local TV weatherperson something in common with the "Avengers" movies: artificial backgrounds inserted behind the action.
You simply record your subject in front of a solid green or blue screen, and then add a touch of software magic to change the background.
Dozens of free or inexpensive apps allow you to use the technique on your own clips. It's a great way to jazz up your presentations and other videos - or to keep children busy with a weekend project filming their own toys in action scenes. Here's how to get started.
Step 1: Set up your studio
First, you need a big piece of solid green or blue cloth or paper to use as a background when recording. You'll also need a place to hang it and strong lighting aimed at the screen to keep shadows and fabric wrinkles from showing up as blotches in your video.
You can get a few yards of cloth at a fabric store for less than $20, or buy a professional chroma-key backdrop, starting around $30, at a specialty store like B&H Photo Video. If you have a major project, you can also find complete green-screen studio kits (including the backdrop, a frame to hang it on and studio lights) for less than $100 on Amazon and other sites.
Chroma key typically uses green or blue backgrounds because those hues are furthest from human skin tones, making sure that the software doesn't mistake a human for the background. But make sure your subject isn't wearing clothes in the same backdrop color, because otherwise the clothes will disappear and become part of the background in the final video.
Step 2: Get your software
If you plan to do all your recording and editing work on your phone or tablet, pop into your app store and search for a "green screen" or "chroma key" app that suits your tastes and budget. Android Film FX's Green Screen Video app ($2) and Do Ink's Green Screen for iOS ($3) are two inexpensive options. KineMaster for Android and iOS ($5 a month for the full version) can make green-screen videos and do all sorts of other moviemaking tasks.
If you prefer to import the clips and edit on a desktop computer, Movavi Video Editor and Wondershare Filmora9 are both $40, and the industry standard, Adobe Premiere Pro ($21 a month), can also handle green-screen work. All three of those programs work on Windows and Mac systems and include a free trial period - and they have more features.
On a budget? Software like VSDC Free Video Editor for Windows or Apple's iMovie for macOS is free. (The iMovie for iOS app does not include green- or blue-screen controls.)
Step 3: Record the action
Once you hang your backdrop, make sure it's as smooth as possible. Tape and clips can be used to stretch it tight against a wall or counter. Position your subject a few feet in front of the screen to avoid shadows, and begin recording.
You may have to do a few takes to get the action the way you want it, especially when recording with unpredictable pets. If you want to be in the scene yourself, stick the phone or camera on a tripod, which also steadies the recording.
Step 4: Select a new background
If your app does not offer alternative backgrounds to use during your initial recording, you can insert a different scene later. Most programs allow you to choose another video, a photograph or an animation to replace the green or blue screen in the background of your first video.
You can also download green-screen clips and backgrounds online. Sites like Pexels, Pixabay and Videvo offer free or inexpensive content if you just want to play around or add unexpected elements into your video as you edit it together.
Step 5: Fine-tune the scene
Chroma key works the same way in most programs, but check your app's help guide for specific instructions for deleting the green or blue backdrop. If you're using a full video-editing program, you typically have more control and may even be able to compensate for uneven lighting by removing multiple shades of color.
In addition to the chroma-key tool, programs like iMovie and VSDC Free Video Editor let you arrange your clips in different layers on a timeline, trim out the boring parts and add music to your project before you output the project and show off your Hollywood special-effects skills to the world.

Texto completo: Of the 67 tournaments on the 2019 ATP Tour schedule, 38, including the Australian and U.S. Opens and year-end championships, are played on hard courts, both indoors and out.
Twenty-one, most notably the French Open at Roland Garros in Paris, are contested on clay. And eight take place on grass. Wimbledon, the crown jewel of the sport, is one of them.
On the WTA Tour, 37 of the 59 tournaments this year take place on hard courts, 16 on clay and six on grass.
On both professional tennis circuits, players must not only traverse the world, playing in Delray Beach, Florida, one week, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the next and then Indian Wells, California, the following week, but they must also be adept at transferring their skills to the different court surfaces. As Tevye said in "Fiddler on the Roof": It isn't easy.
The way a player adapts depends on the player and the surface. Grass, with its slick veneer and tricky bounces, is friendly to tall players with big serves who don't like long rallies and are comfortable going to the net.
European red clay courts demand peak physical conditioning, the agility to chase drop shots with a millisecond's notice, the dexterity to slide across the baseline and the perseverance to sustain 30-stroke points.
Hard courts, which some players call the great equalizer, offer truer bounces but still favor power hitters with tactical diversity and great foot speed.
The three surfaces require different physical, technical and tactical skills, but clay demands greater mental and emotional stability, especially when a match can last five hours or more.
"I think on clay the mental and physical part come together a lot," said Dominic Thiem, last year's French Open runner-up to Rafael Nadal. "If you know you're fit and you've worked a lot, you know you can play for three, four, five hours or however long it's necessary. So that makes it easier to go into a match. For me, the clay is also easier on the mind because I know if I get down an early break I can always get a chance to break back. On grass, if you have one bad game, especially against a good server, the set can be gone."
The psychological aspect of playing long matches on clay is about to get even more difficult than at the other majors. This year, for the first time, Roland Garros will be the only Grand Slam event that will not use some form of a tiebreaker in the final set. The Australian Open changed formats this year to allow for a super-tiebreaker (the first to reach 10 points by a margin of two) at 6-6 in the fifth set for men and the third set for women.
Wimbledon will use a conventional tiebreaker (first to seven points by a two-point margin) at 12-12 in the final set, ensuring no recurrence of last year's semifinal between Kevin Anderson and John Isner that stretched to a 26-24 fifth-set win for Anderson that required six hours and 36 minutes and left him depleted for his final against Novak Djokovic, who won in straight sets. In 2010, Isner defeated Nicolas Mahut 70-68 in the fifth set in a match that lasted 11 hours over three days.
The U.S. Open introduced the tiebreaker at 6-6 in the final set in 1970.
"Patience is such a big factor on clay," said Chris Evert, a seven-time French Open singles champion. "On a hard court, you could win with power alone. On clay, footwork, placement and thinking are more important. For me, it was all about having that extra second or two because everything was slower. With that extra time, I didn't have to react as fast or rely on twitch muscles. It was a luxury that allowed me more time to contemplate my next move."
Clearly, there are technical advantages that have allowed Nadal to win 57 of his 80 titles on the dirt, including 11 of the last 14 French Opens. Nadal, who grew up on red clay in Majorca, possesses a huge, looping lefty forehand that he can massage into the tiniest openings on the court. The softer surface is gentler on his achy knees and allows him to slide into the ball instead of being forced into abrupt starts and stops. Most important, Nadal said he believed in himself most on clay.
"On clay, there's a mixture of strategic and emotional that you're constantly dealing with," said Allen Fox, a sports psychologist and former top American player. "The strategic is that it's slower, and you have more time to think and be patient. But you don't want to give up the game that you usually play. If you're an aggressive, attacking player, you don't want to suddenly become a body puncher.
"Emotionally, clay is hard because if you're not prepared for the longer points, you'll try to end them too quickly and get into trouble," he said. "Then you're more likely to get frustrated and angry. Once you're unhappy with the surface, your game will deteriorate. And once that negativity takes over, you're done."
Fox, who wrote the book "Think to Win: The Strategic Dimension of Tennis," thinks that Nadal has supernatural powers that allow him to be mentally stronger on clay than just about every other player.
"Rafa can concentrate 100 percent longer than the other guy," Fox said. "He plays every point long and hard and has a marathon mentality. And because time is a factor in tennis, more so than in other sports, a person may be very good for an hour or two, but not so much for three or four hours."
There are plenty of players who have succeeded on all surfaces. Bjorn Borg won six French Opens and five Wimbledons in the 1970s and '80s, three times succeeding at both within weeks of each other.
Evert won seven times at Roland Garros, three at Wimbledon and six times at the U.S. Open, while Martina Navratilova captured nine Wimbledons, four U.S. Opens and two French Opens. Nadal has won Wimbledon twice and the U.S. Open three times, and Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic have wins at every major. Steffi Graf won six French Opens, seven Wimbledons, five U.S. Opens and four Australian Opens.
Then there are those great players who couldn't master all surfaces. John McEnroe won the U.S. Open four times and Wimbledon three times, but couldn't win on the clay at Roland Garros. Neither could Pete Sampras, who won Wimbledon seven times in eight years. It took Roger Federer 11 chances to win the French. Neither Ivan Lendl nor Monica Seles ever won Wimbledon.
"I really think that too much is made of playing on different surfaces," said Lendl, who won the French Open in 1984, '86 and '87.
"I grew up playing on clay, so I didn't know anything else and that was more natural for me," he said. "I understood that the points were longer, there could be bad bounces, that the serve didn't mean as much and that there could be more ebbs and flows in the match.
"But the bottom line is that no matter what surface it is, you just have to execute and playyourtennis," he said. "You can't go on the court with that in your head. You can't over-think everything. That just complicates it. The beauty and genius in this sport is simplifying things. Just get out on the court and play."

Texto completo: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio raked in almost half a million dollars to his federal action committee in the last year, but many of his top donors do not plan on voting for him for president.
“I’m certainly not a supporter of him running for president. I’m not a supporter of anyone at the moment,” billionaire Barry Diller, who donated the $5,000 maximum towards de Blasio’s Fairness PAC last fall, told the New York Times.
One hundred and fifteen people contributed more than $450,000 to de Blasio’s political action committee. Of those, 35 people answered questions about their support of de Blasio, with only five saying they believed the mayor should be president.
“Honestly speaking, I was asked by a co-worker if I can help, and I did,” said Nail Capri, a business executive who also contributed the maximum amount toward the PAC. Capri said he did not support de Blasio for president.
Howard L. Gottlieb, a founding partner of a private investment firm, donated $5,000 to de Blasio and does not even remember his donation.
“Do you think I remember every dime that I’ve ever given to anyone, especially as insignificant as that?” Gottlieb said, saying he was not interested in voting for de Blasio for president.
De Blasio’s lack of support among his own donors compliments low enthusiasm among the general public. His 2020 presidential campaign is polling at 0% according to a poll by Quinnipiac University released last week. His unfavorability rating among voters was 45% with an 8% favorability rating.

Texto completo: “¡Wow, qué es eso, hombre!”, exclamó un piloto, “¡mira cómo vuela!”.
Objetos voladores no identificados (ovnis en español, ufos en inglés) fueron vistos casi a diario entre el verano de 2014 y la primavera de 2015 en los cielos de la Costa Este. Y los testigos no fueron personajes dudosos sino pilotos de élite de la Marina estadounidense , que lo reportaron a sus mandos en el Pentágono e incluso al Congreso.
“ Esas cosas estaban ahí fuera todo el dí a”, explica ahora uno de ellos, Ryan Graves, al diario The New York Times. “Mantener un avión en el aire requiere de una cantidad notable de energía; a la velocidad a la que los vimos, 12 horas en el aire son 11 horas más de las que esperaríamos”, explicó Graves.
Este piloto de cazabombarderos F/A-18, que lleva una década en la Marina, se refería a objetos no identificados de formas extrañas (uno parecía una peonza girando en contra del viento; otro parecía una pastilla contra la tos del tamaño de un avión comercial).
A veces, quedaban grabados en video. En al menos una ocasión, estuvieron a punto de colisionar en el aire contra los cazas de combate. No parece que tengan motor, pero pueden alcanzar los 30,000 pies de altura a velocidades supersónicas. Y nadie dice que sean extraterrestres , pero no siempre parece existir una explicación plausible.
Tanto Graves como otros cuatro pilotos con los que habló el citado diario insisten en que vieron esos objetos durante unas maniobras de entrenamiento con el portaviones Theodore Roosevelt sobre el cielo entre Virginia y Florida. No aportan eso sí ninguna posible explicación.
La Marina tampoco tiene una versión oficial, pero sí ha difundido este año un manual secreto sobre cómo reportar un encuentro de sus pilotos con un ovni.
En algunos casos puede tratarse de drones comerciales , explica un portavoz, Joseph Gradisher, pero en otras ocasiones “no sabemos quién está detrás, no tenemos suficiente información”.
Los avistamientos de 2015 y 2015 fueron reportados a un programa secreto poco conocido del Pentágono “para la identificación de amenazas aeroespaciales”. Su responsable, Luis Elizondo, dimitió en 2017 tras calificarlos como “una sorprendente serie de incidentes”.
Su origen extraterrestre “es tan improbable que compite con otras explicaciones también poco probables y más mundanas”, arguye Leon Golub, astrofísico del centro Harvard-Smithsonian.
Como posibles explicaciones señala a errores en los aparatos de detección de los aviones, efectos o reflejos atmosféricos, o incluso errores en los sentidos de los pilotos debidos a la abundancia de estímulos en un vuelo a alta velocidad.
“La gente lleva décadas viendo cosas extrañas desde aviones militares”, explica el piloto Ryan Graves, “ sería muy gordo que hubiera algo allí arriba”.
Su compañero Danny Accoin afirma que se cruzó en dos ocasiones con estos objetos, capaces de acelerar, frenar y volver a acelerar a velocidad supersónicas como ningún avión conocido .
La primera vez, apareció en su radar pero él no lo pudo ver. Unos días después, uno de sus misiles lo detectó como posible objetivo, y también apareció en su cámara de infrarrojos, aunque él tampoco pudo verlo .
Los pilotos especularon con la posibilidad de que pudiera tratarse de un programa secreto de aviones o drones de última generación.
Pero el hecho de que se rozara una catástrofe cuando uno de esos objetos (descrito por el piloto como una esfera con un cubo dentro) pasó junto a un avión convenció a los pilotos de que un programa así no se permitiría en una zona de maniobras por el peligro que entrañaría.
Además, los ovnis no se comportan como un avión normal. “ La velocidad no mata ”, explica Graves, “frenar o acelerar sí”. Estos objetos pasan de cero a velocidad supersónica de forma casi inmediata, y trazan curvas que van más allá de lo que un piloto podría resistir.
“Cuando la gente dice haber observado fenómenos realmente extraños, a veces vale la pena investigar en serio”, dice la astrofísica Sara Seager, pero “lo que la gente a veces no entiende sobre la ciencia es que a menudo tenemos fenómenos que siguen sin poder ser explicados ”

Texto completo: Las encuestas revelan que la popularidad del presidente Donald Trump está a la baja entre la población en general, pero su base electoral sigue fuerte, lo que mantiene sus fuertes posibilidades de lograr su reelección en 2020.
Sin embargo, lo que motiva a los electores, indican expertos, es que –como se ha señalado en otras ocasiones– la economía es el factor clave al momento de decidir su voto.
El asesor del secretario del Tesoro de la administración de Barack Obama , Steve Rattner , reconoció en un artículo del New York Times que es casi imposible que el mandatario pierda, basado en tres informes sobre modelos de predicción de economistas acreditados que encontraron que el presidente Trump probablemente retendrá su presidencia.
Mark Zand i, economista de Moody’s y crítico del presidente Trump, ha analizado 12 modelos de predicción para 2020 que evalúan las tendencias económicas a nivel estatal y agregan factores políticos como el índice de aprobación de un presidente, reportó el Daily Mail. En todos los modelos ganó el actual mandatario.
“Si las elecciones se llevaran a cabo hoy, Trump ganaría según los modelos y con amplio margen” , dijo Zandi a Politico. “Tiene bajos precios del gas, bajo desempleo y muchas otras variables políticas a su favor. La única excepción es su popularidad, que importa mucho. Si eso cae por un precipicio, sería una gran diferencia”.
Un análisis hecho por el profesor de economía de Yale, Ray Fair , encontró que el presidente Trump podría lograr 56.1 por ciento de los votos, dadas las condiciones económicas, aunque su mayor enemigo es él mismo.
Estos mismos modelos previeron la histórica victoria de Obama en la Casa Blanca en 2008, su reelección en 2012 y la inesperada victoria del republicano 2016.
En las más recientes encuestas sobre tendencias electorales, una de las preguntas a los votantes es sobre los temas que más les preocupan, destacando la situación laboral y económica, así como los servicios de salud.

Texto completo: PARIS -- It has been a frustrating year at the office so far for Serena Williams, filled with old injuries that have resurfaced and new ones that have scuttled her chances. It has been a season where the opportunities to play actual tennis matches and finish the few she has started have been far too rare.
But Williams was back in the public eye and in harm's way at the French Open at age 37 on Monday, even if many other veteran tennis champions would have skipped the experience altogether and started preparing for the grass-court season and Wimbledon, which she has won seven times.
"It crossed my mind every day," she said, when asked whether she had considered it. "But I'm here. And to do the best that I can do."
In the opening set against the unseeded Vitalia Diatchenko on Monday, Williams's best bore no resemblance to her finest tennis. She missed groundstrokes by the bunch and service returns by the bushel. She looked edgy and rusty.
But Williams, the winner of 23 Grand Slam singles titles, is nothing if not a fighter.
Final score of the first-round duel: 2-6, 6-1, 6-0.
"I knew it couldn't get worse," Williams said. "I knew I could only go up. "
[French Open scoreboard: men's singles | women's singles]
For Williams, the challenge, based on this year's struggles, is simply to stay healthy enough to keep competing in the tournament. She has played just one match on clay this season and visited Disneyland Paris last week in a wheelchair to conserve energy and avoid putting added strain on her troublesome left knee, which had caused her to withdraw from the Miami Open and Italian Open this year.
Another withdrawal is hardly unthinkable. She hit a high level quickly last year with just as meager clay-court preparation before withdrawing after three rounds with a pectoral injury.
"This is a much bigger challenge on clay than on grass," Chris Evert, the seven-time French Open champion, said of Williams, noting that fitness and movement are essential here. "I do think she's playing with a little less pressure in Paris because she's a work in progress and knows her preparation hasn't been ideal, and she still has two more Grand Slam tournaments ahead of her this year. She is the underdog in a sense."
It is such a rare role for Williams to play, but she has yet to win a tournament since returning to competition in February 2018 after the birth of her daughter, Olympia. And after scanning her 2019 results, which won't take long, and observing her against Diatchenko, underdog seems just the right word in Paris this year.
After the match, Williams had to navigate another challenge in the interview room. Nike, her longtime sponsor, has used her working motherhood as a feel-good marketing tool: The cape she wore during the warm-up on Monday featured the word mère (French for mother) in its design.
But in articles and videos for The New York Times opinion department over the past two weeks, some of Nike's sponsored athletes in track and field, including the world champion sprinter Allyson Felix, said the company failed to guarantee the same level of income during pregnancy and early maternity.
It is unclear what Nike's policies have been in women's tennis, but after Felix and other prominent runners like Alysia Montaño and Kara Goucher came forward, the company announced last week that it would waive performance-pay reductions for a year for athletes who decide to have a baby.
"I'm glad that statement was made," said Williams, who surely knew a question about Nike's position was coming. "That's what it's about. It's about learning from mistakes and doing better."
Williams's latest French Open outfit by Nike -- a midriff-baring ensemble -- seemed out of context with a chill in the air and an overcast sky over the new-look Chatrier Court. She eventually put on a black Nike jacket. The stands in the 15,000-seat stadium were less than half full.
Williams said she felt as if she was striking the ball cleanly in training ahead of the tournament, but match pressure changed the equation.
She faced her first break points after just three minutes of play. She saved them, but the struggle was real.
Diatchenko, a lean and unorthodox Russian with two-handed groundstrokes, upset Maria Sharapova in the first round of Wimbledon last year. Her flat shots are tricky to read, and she cracked winners off both wings in the early going that left the nervous Williams looking befuddled, flat footed and beside herself.
"Like concrete blocks on my feet," Williams said.
She lost her serve at love in the fifth game and then won only one point on her serve in the seventh game. There were a few boos from the crowd, and after the first set, Williams sat in her chair on the changeover shaking her head and talking to herself. After she fell behind by 15-30 on her serve in the opening game of the second set, she turned to wait for the ball to be delivered by one of the ballpersons and put her head back and screamed in frustration.
"I don't think I have ever done that before," Williams said of Monday's roar. "The past week and half has been really good, and God, it was like, this isn't the Serena I have been practicing with or that I see every day."
Cue catharsis: Williams went on to win the next three points and hold serve.
She would lose just one more game before securing her place in the second round, where she will face either the Japanese qualifier Kurumi Nara, ranked 238th, or Dalila Jakupovic, a Slovenian ranked 105th.
Not a bad draw for someone who has played only 10 matches this year and is trying to work her way into form.
"Look, I would pick the field over her only because of her lack of match play," Evert said. "But nothing would surprise me with Serena."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The Babe, the Red Sox and the 'Ultimate Heartbreaker'

Texto completo: The special agony of the Boston Red Sox continues for at least another day -- or maybe another 68 years.
The collective pain of this franchise and the fans of New England was extended in excruciating and ghastly fashion early this morning, as the Mets scored three runs after two were out in the bottom of the 10th inning for a 6-5 victory that fans will talk about for years -- certainly until the next time these two teams take the field, this evening, weather permitting.
The Red Sox and their fans might have thought they had seen everything since Babe Ruth helped pitch them to a World Series title in 1918 and was sold off a season later, but Bucky Dent's homer in the 1978 playoff, and Country Slaughter's mad dash home with the winning run of the 1946 World Series may now be equaled by this morning's terror.
The Sox began the bottom of the 10th with a 5-3 lead. With two outs, the Mets put together singles by Gary Carter, Kevin Mitchell and Ray Knight for a run. Then it turned ghastly for New England, yet again. Bob Stanley, the relief pitcher, threw a wild pitch near Mookie Wilson's foot as Mitchell scored the tying run.
Bucky Dent and Country Slaughter were in the ozone as Wilson then hit a wobbly grounder down the first-base line. Bill Buckner, playing on grit with a ruined ankle, let it slither through him for the error that could haunt Boston for generations -- the ultimate heartbreaker, at least until tonight.
Driving through New England during the last week, listening to the talk shows and the sports shows, was to hear open veins bleeding.
How could they pitch Nipper? Geez, Boggs is choking. Get that Buckner out of there. That Evans only hits in 9-1 games. Clemens hasn't been the same in a month. Same old Sawx.
New Englanders knew only too well the dreadful burden they carried, heightened by the grim, exacting heritage of the region. Last Tuesday, a fan in Fenway Park carried a banner that said: "I am a Calvinist. The Red Sox are predestined to win" -- presumably a twinning of the relief pitcher, Calvin Schiraldi, and the theologian, John Calvin, who believed that redemption was not achieved through good works.
New Yorkers like to feel we know all about suffering, and of course we do, with our loonies loose on the street and vans running red lights and public officials dividing the loot out in Queens, but there is no one great focus of civic suffering that unites us the way the Red Sox unite Boston.
Not everybody in Boston lives and dies with the Red Sox, thank goodness. We need somebody to have enough psychic energy and civic responsibility to keep Boston the most European, the most civilized, of American cities.
But the tone of the city is set by Mickey the Fan and Ernie the Fan and Vinnie the Fan and Freddie the Fan, who have been letting the Red Sox break their hearts for so long that a great miasma of masochism hangs over the city. It's going to happen again, Boston fans have said, reflecting on the absence of a World Championship since 1918, when Babe Ruth was still a pitcher, when Babe Ruth was still a Red Sox. Betrayal is at the core of every Red Sox fan's psyche.
Four days in Boston convince a visitor that while New Yorkers have opinions and even passions about their sports teams, only Bostonians have complexes. They love their Red Sox so much that they fear the worst. They are jealous lovers.
This conclusion comes after a much-needed 24-hour break from the claustrophobic and often sterile environment of the World Series, described by Russell Baker in his column in Saturday's New York Times. He wrote of the massive overkill of journalists at the World Series, and he was exactly right. Cramped in between respected colleagues, all of them doing their best to fill space, is to bring out the Rabbit Angstrom in some of us.
Remember Rabbit's dashes for freedom in John Updike's "Rabbit Run" -- the cathartic bolting for open space? More than two weeks of postseason baseball, no matter how exciting, can produce that feeling.
Not only a fidgety scribbler feels that way. Dave Johnson, the manager of the Mets, wisely canceled practice in Boston last Monday rather than subject his players to another day in public. They needed the sleep more than they needed the Greek chorus around the batting cage, enumerating their sins.
John McNamara got the point and declined to practice in Shea Stadium on the off day Friday, and Johnson also gave his troops the day off. They did not know it, or care, but they were also making life more livable for the poor drudges who report on this Series.
For this numbed Rabbit, the day off meant a liberating drive down to Cape Cod and then over to New York at the peak of the fall foliage season. As we drove along the Charles River, alongside crews and joggers and cyclists, the Boston radio stations were full of locals, daring to hope that the Red Sox could get appease the ghosts of Pesky and Yaz and Lonnie and Torrez.
Fans called in with that peculiar Boston-fan accent, that sounds like somebody being strangled while trying to sing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" and eating a hot dog. These tortured souls picked apart the home team:
Get Buckner outta there; the poor guy's got guts but he can't move. Let Baylor hit against the lefty. The Sawx will never take the extra base; someday it's gonna kill 'em. Rawger better do it in the sixth because The Can will blow it in the seventh. If it rains on Sunday, they can go with Hurst in the seventh game These gargling sounds of fear and trembling stayed on the car radio all the way down to Provincetown, where there were still signs of Red Sox mania. Two elderly men sitting in the sun on a glorious afternoon discussed how the Red Sox had patiently forced Dwight Gooden to pitch into the strike zone in Thursday night's triumph.
People bought The Globe and The Herald and turned first to the sports pages crammed with Sox stories. Even in artsy-craftsy Provincetown, there were a few Red Sox caps. It is a region starving for redemption, carrying around a scarlet letter "B" for Bucky Dent.
As we drove back along the Cape, we could hear the news broadcasters, disk jockeys, weather persons, sports celebrities, all of them talking about how the Red Sox needed just one more to wrap it up. Just one more. One out of two. Fifty-fifty. Nobody sounded very confident. Red Sox fans have been carrying a lot of heavy baggage on their long pilgrimmage.
Now the pilgrimmage seems longer and more tortuous than ever, and the Sawx and their fans have only a few hours to recover from the brutal turnaround that matched anything Country Slaughter and Bucky Dent ever did to this haunted franchise.

Shield law should protect all journalists

Texto completo: The morning after the tragic death of Jeff Adachi, I received a call from a wellknown local journalist. The person wanted to know if I had any sources who might have the police report describing the scene where San Francisco's celebrated public defender had died the night before.
The journalist asked me to reach out to police contacts I regularly talk to in my leadership role with the community group Stop Crime SF and as a guest columnist for the San Francisco Examiner.
Rumors were swirling about how Adachi died and who was with him. The journalist said they wanted to get the information right. Seeing the police report, which is not a public document, was crucial to their reporting.
I decided not to help. While Adachľs sudden death was newsworthy, I felt the salacious details were irrelevant. They weren't a vital matter of public policy and safety. In due time a coroner's report would be publicly released. We would eventually learn the facts of an accidental mixed-drug overdose that stopped an already damaged heart. And news outlets could publish cautionary tales of drug use in Baby Boomer age men.
Most journalists, however, weren't willing to wait. They aggressively pursued Adachi's police report and obtained it.
News stories that reveal something, especially on a controversial topic, are often the result of an insider sharing - or leaking - non-public information to a reporter. The New York Times wins Pulitzer Prizes because a source literally hands them information.
While the Adachi scoop is far from Pulitzer-worthy material, the same principle applies. That's why it is so disturbing that freelance journalist Bryan Carmody faced a search warrant and raid of his home after he obtained and distributed the Adachi file.
Any police chief would want to stop a leak that put the department in a bad light. But the quest to find the original source of the leak should have been limited to an internal police investigation and not by looking through a journalist's notes via a judge's sealed search warrant
If police felt Carmody was key to the investigation, then there should have been a subpoena so the matter could be handled in open court.
Lots of journalists obtained copies of the Adachi report. But unlike freelancer Carmody, they worked for reputable news outlets and large media companies. Where were their sealed warrants? Why weren't they subject to a raid and confiscation of their computers?
I've won a number of journalism awards for a variety of news outlets as a freelancer. Would I have been targeted if I had received a copy of the Adachi file?
Carmody could be considered a less sympathetic character because he is self-employed and known to purvey sensational news. But the California shield law protects all journalists from search warrants that seek unnamed sources and unpublished material.
Given the well-defined law, it's perplexing that two San Francisco Superior Court judges approved Carmody's search warrant. And it's shocking that most elected officials in San Francisco either vocally supported the raid or stayed silent until public pressure forced them to denounce it.
Supervisor Aaron Peskin provided the voice of sanity by immediately condemning the search warrants while declaring, "A free press is a fundamental pillar of our democracy."
How could our judges and politicians have such a lapse in judgment and understanding of the First Amendment? Perhaps it's a byproduct of the Trump era that even progressive San Francisco has succumbed to the hypnotic drumbeat of "fake news" and demonization of the media.
Adachi was revered for how successfully he defended people accused of crimes. It's understandable people were upset that details of his death were leaked. But it's always dangerous to let anger compromise our ability to allow the local press to report the truth, however inconvenient. Especially in San Francisco, where we hold ourselves to a much higher standard of protecting freedom.
Eroding the First Amendment, even slightly or righteously, only makes life more difficult for journalists when we need them to reveal the truths that really matter.

Texto completo: ALBANY — New York would become one of the first states to outlaw racial discrimination based on natural hairstyles like braids, twists and dreadlocks under a bill introduced at the state Capitol last week.
The proposal from state Sen. Jamaal Bailey, D-Bronx, and Assemblywoman Tremaine Wright, D-Brooklyn, would make clear employers and schools can't discriminate on the basis of someone's hairstyle if it is "historically associated with race."
Practically speaking, the bill would prevent employers and schools from requiring their black employees or students to straighten their hair, or setting a dress code that prevents braids, dreadlocks or similar hairstyles.
The bill was introduced three months after New York City's Commission on Human Rights issued guidelines preventing discrimination based on hair and a month after the California Senate approved a similar measure.
As it stands, New York state law prevents employer discrimination based on a variety of traits, including age, race, creed, sex and color.
Wright and Bailey's bill, which was introduced Thursday, would expand the legal definition of race to include "ancestry, color, ethnic group identification and ethnic background," including any "traits historically associated with race" such as "hair texture and protective hairstyles."
Examples of "protective hairstyles" are braids, locks and twists, among others, according to the bill.
The same definition also would be added to the state Dignity For All Students act, which deals with bullying in schools.
Bailey and Wright could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.
The proposal is similar to a measure approved unanimously by the California Senate on April 22. That measure is awaiting a vote in the California Assembly.
New York City, meanwhile, took the action unilaterally.
The city Commission on Human Rights changing its guidelines in February to make clear city residents have the right to "natural hair, treated or untreated hairstyles such as locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, fades, Afros, and/or the right to keep hair in an uncut or untrimmed state," according to The New York Times.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose wife, Chirlane, is black, said his relationship with his wife dating back to the early 1990s "began my education on the question of hair."
"You know, she told me many, many stories of people, particularly women, being looked down on because they had natural hair, or because they had dreadlocks, or whatever it may be," de Blasio said in February. "And it's appalling to me that that ever went on, but it still goes on to this day."
De Blasio continued: "It's not acceptable. It must end, and we're going to lead the way here in New York City."
New York is considering a bill that would explicitly ban racial discrimination based on natural hairstyle such as braids, bantu knots and locks.

Texto completo: Last summer, my friend Billy Mounger suffered spinal issues. Fortunately, Billy's doctor advised against surgery. Other interventions — acupuncture, massage, physical therapy, and yoga — proved salutary.
Quality medical care involves intelligent scrutiny of options. Failure to educate oneself carries consequences. Assessing one's choices is agonizing absent knowledge. "Images in Mississippi Medicine" by Dr. Lucius "Luke M. Lampton and Karen Evers (Mississippi State Medical Association) offers outstanding opportunities to comprehend the evolution of medicine in the Magnolia State.
The history documents disparate delivery of medical services. Patients were segregated by race at most hospitals for decades. The first African American hospital was in Natchez, in 1852. "African American fraternal orders... played key roles in [erecting] similar hospitals [throughout] the South during... Jim Crow...."
Dr. James Buchanan, at the East Mississippi Insane Asylum — built in 1885 to alleviate crowding at the Jackson Lunatic Asylum (where the University of Mississippi Medical Center sits today) — "wrote extensively on mental illness among African American patients at the institution and his writing on 'Insanity in the Colored Race' provided some of the first serious studies in America on mental illness among African Americans."
Yellow fever was likely introduced into "the new world by A. aegypti mosquito-infested slave ships voyaging from West Africa," and doctors first recognized the disease in the Americas in Yucatán, Mexico, in 1648. "Over the next two and a half centuries, yellow fever erupted with regularity... with hundreds of thousands of deaths, earning the virus deserved recognition as one of the worst plagues... ever...."
Gov. J.P. Coleman championed efforts to replace the racially segregated VA hospital in west Jackson with "the current VA east of UMMC. The Legislature resisted his efforts due to the requirement that it be... integrated.... Coleman, to his credit, stated at that divisive time: 'If we're going to be realistic, we should acknowledge that the federal government is not going to change its policy. The question is whether we want to do it.... I'm in favor of going ahead and giving the federal government permission to construct this facility.' Without Coleman's brave leadership, the new VA facility would not have been constructed."
The first African American Professor at UMMC was Dr. Helen Barnes, in 1969. Dr. Oswald Smith, of Clarksdale, was the first African American elected to the Mississippi State Medical Association in 1956. (An African American medical association, the Mississippi Medical and Surgical Association, existed from 1901). Dr. Smith was the first African American to contribute an article to the MSMA Journal, in 1959. Dr. Claude Brunson became MSMA's first African American President, in 2014.
Apart from Magnolia State medical history, the book provides personal perspective for those with roots here:
"... [T]he Hill-Burton Act (the Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946) would become the most forceful agent of change in the state, and hospitals the first public places integrated. Despite the strong support of Southern white politicians (Hill was an Alabama senator), facilities receiving Hill-Burton funding were not allowed to discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, or creed."
Lister Hill lived opposite my Montgomery maternal grandparents for decades. I knew him and appreciated learning more about his efforts expanding health care facilities in underserved areas. The New York Times noted, on Jan. 27, 1968, that Hill "has done more for the health of Americans in modern times than any man outside the medical profession."
I discovered that the 1903 two-year medical school was not made a four-year facility until 1955, but it attempted briefly to become one, utilizing clinical facilities at the Kuhn Memorial Hospital in Vicksburg, endowed by uncles of my great-aunt.
The historic MSMA gavel is pictured displaying the plate commemorating my oldest friend's namesake grandfather's tenure as MSMA president.
Succinctly put, the volume is pure pleasure, worth anyone's attention.

Texto completo: State Sen. John Pinto, one of the last of the famed Navajo Code Talkers of World War II, died Friday at his home in Gallup. He was 94.
Pinto, a Democrat, also was the longest-serving sitting legislator in New Mexico. He had been a senator since 1977.
Fellow lawmakers, some in their 30s, marveled at working alongside this diminutive, soft-spoken former Marine who was part of the group of Navajos that helped vanquish the Japanese Army.
Before the Code Talkers were deployed, Japanese soldiers had broken many U.S. codes on battle plans in the South Pacific. Pinto and some 400 other Navajos changed all that.
They used more than 200 words of the Navajos' unwritten Diné language to create coded messages that frustrated Japanese interceptors and advanced the American war effort.
On the day that military veterans were honored during this year's legislative session, Pinto stood on the Senate floor and revealed a personal detail many colleagues hadn't known about.
"I'm a veteran of World War II. I served in the South Pacific. That's where I lost my hearing when they started shooting at me," Pinto said.
Most in the chamber knew Pinto was hard of hearing, but they assumed this was a product of age rather than of service in a war 75 years ago.
Code Talkers are legendary in the Southwest. Few were as storied as Pinto. He rarely talked about his service publicly, but he knew the war effort had helped define him, personally and politically.
"He was so proud of being a Code Talker. It was very significant for him," said Sen. Mimi Stewart, D-Albuquerque, one of Pinto's closest friends in the Legislature.
She helped him win one of his greatest legislative victories this year. Pinto for years had sought state funding for a Navajo Code Talkers Museum, but it failed to clear the Legislature during a decade of skinflint budgets.
New Mexico's 42 senators --
26 Democrats and 16 Republicans -- get along well, even in this era of political gridlock. At Stewart's suggestion, senators of both parties this year contributed a total of $550,000 from their individual allocations for public works projects to help fund the Code Talkers museum.
Then Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appropriated $500,000 from her capital construction budget to complete financing for the $1.05 million project.
Pinto, always relentless in advocating for his district in the Four Corners area, had prevailed.
"He was someone you did not want to underestimate. That was true right to the last session," said Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth, D-Santa Fe.
Respect and affection for Pinto were reasons fellow senators contributed money for a project that in some cases was hundreds of miles from their own district. The other deciding factor, Wirth said, was the state this year was flush with money because of an oil boom.
As Pinto learned that funding for his proposed museum was at last falling into place, he could not contain himself.
"The sparkle in his eye -- he was thrilled," Wirth said.
Legislative sessions in New Mexico are brief, either 30 or 60 days a year, but the workload and intensity are matched by few governments anywhere. As a session reaches the frenzy of its final week, it's typical for a workday to last 15 or even
18 hours.
Lt. Gov. Howie Morales, 46, presides over the Senate. A former senator himself, Morales knows the grind.
On the last day of this year's session, Morales told of times when fatigue made it difficult to go on.
"Then I would look over at Senator Pinto," Morales said. "Just seeing him working made the difference. He was such an inspiration."
Morales said even Pinto's annual singing of "The Potato Song," a carryover tune from his days in boot camp, had purpose.
"It was very calculated, a way he brought people together and eased tensions," Morales said. "This is a sad day and an emotional day, but it was a blessing to serve with him and to learn from him."
Pinto was part of the Senate majority, as Democrats usually controlled the chamber. But he identified with the underdog because that's what he was.
Raised in Lupton, Ariz., and Gallup, he attended a Bureau of Indian Affairs boarding school in Fort Defiance, Ariz.
"My career began with sheep herding and washing dishes in the Gallup area," Pinto once said.
But he aspired to be more. After the war, he took the advice of people who said a college education would be his ticket to success.
He moved to Albuquerque to study at the University of New Mexico. It took him four tries, but he passed the English proficiency test. Once admitted to the university, he decided to become a teacher.
He received his bachelor's degree at age 39, an achievement that brought him to tears. Then he went on to earn a master's. Pinto taught for 28 years in the Gallup-McKinley County school system.
A husband and father, Pinto nurtured many more interests outside his immediate family.
He was president of Gallup's Indian community center from 1950-70. Pinto saw one of his primary responsibilities in this role as helping to feed homeless people and others in Gallup who had financial troubles.
"His life was always about helping people," Stewart said.
Politics can be a vehicle to do that, and Pinto knew it. He served two terms as a McKinley County commissioner before deciding to run for the Legislature
He won his first term in the state Senate in 1976. Reelected 10 times, he served on the Senate Education Committee and was chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.
Members of an immigrant advocacy group once approached Pinto, seeking his support on a bill. They knew they had it already, but hearing him talk about human rights always galvanized the organization.
"Never accept discrimination against anyone," Pinto liked to say.
In handling legislation, Pinto dived into details. Education issues can be arcane, even mind numbing. Pinto made a point of studying all the bills, especially the most difficult ones.
As the the decades rolled by, Stewart said, Pinto's skills as a legislator remained as solid as ever.
"Up until the end, he had beautiful handwriting and he spelled every word correctly," she said.
He drove until he was 92. Those who crossed paths with him noticed that he rose every morning during this year's legislative session to read the New York Times in the lobby of his hotel.
On May 17, Pinto received an honorary doctorate degree from Navajo Technical University in Crownpoint.
He had known for months the award was coming, and he enjoyed every second of the buildup.
"I'm a doctor now," he told Stewart. Then, laughing, he said, "Come to my hospital and I'll give you surgery."
But the good-humored senator was getting tired.
Last month, members of Pinto's family phoned Stewart and told her his workload had to be cut. They asked that he be removed from assignments on interim legislative committees.
This brought a predictable reaction from Pinto.
"He threw a little fit," Stewart said.
She said Pinto was absolved from work on interim committees in which he was an advisory member, but he kept all his other assignments.
Pinto's wife, Joann, died in 2017. He is survived by their four children, sons Cecil and Galen, and daughters Flora Dennison and Karen Arviso. More than two dozen grandchildren and great-grandchildren also survive him.
Pinto's successor will be chosen by the governor after she receives nominations from the commissioners of McKinley and San Juan counties, which make up Pinto's Senate District.
Stewart said discussions were underway on a memorial service for Pinto in the Capitol Rotunda. She said there is even a possibility of a caravan from the Four Corners area to Santa Fe traveling through towns and counties at appointed times.
This would allow people along the route to give a final salute to one of the last of the Navajo Code Talkers.

Trump never revoked John Brennan's security clearance

Texto completo: President Trump never revoked former CIA Director John Brennan's security clearance.
The president announced in August that Brennan's security clearance was being stripped due to "erratic behavior" that disqualified him from having access to sensitive information.
But the White House never followed through with the complicated bureaucratic process of revocation, a source told the New York Times.
A CIA spokesperson declined to comment, telling the Washington Examiner the agency does not comment on individual security clearances. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment.
The revelation comes after Trump gave Attorney General William Barr "full and complete authority to declassify information" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. A day later, it was reported the order could put at risk a key CIA informant who provided information about the Kremlin's role in interfering in the 2016 election.
Barr, who asked the White House for the new power, has been reviewing the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign for weeks. Barr tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham with reviewing the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and says he is working closely with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse investigation. Republican allies of Trump say information could soon come out that will show misconduct by Brennan and other former Obama administration leaders.
Although it was widely believed he had lost his clearance, Brennan has on occasion visited Capitol Hill to brief Democrats on national security matters.

Brennan has been an outspoken critic of Trump and his tendency to question the motives of members of the U.S. intelligence community.
He told MSNBC on Friday that Trump's declassification order was an "outrageous move" that could lead to the release of cherry-picked information taken out of context and expressed concern for "sources and methods" being revealed and put in jeopardy and intelligence allies of the U.S. being endangered.
Brennan also said he hopes Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel will "stand up" to Trump's "unprecedented act."
Despite Brennan and the Democrats warning Trump is going too far with his order to declassify sensitive information, Coats offered some reassurance about the limited scope of what can be made available to the public.
"Much like we have with other investigations and reviews, the Intelligence Community will provide the Department of Justice all of the appropriate information for its review of intelligence activities related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election," Coats said in a statement Friday. "As part of that process, I am confident that the Attorney General will work with the IC in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk."

War-crime pardons could be most Nixonian moment yet

Texto completo: If indeed President Donald Trump pardons one or more U.S. military men accused or convicted of war crimes in Afghanistan or Iraq, it could be his most Nixonian moment yet.
On March 29, 1971, a U.S. Army court-martial at Fort Benning, Ga., convicted Lt. William Calley of 22 murders for his part in the massacre of as many as 500 men, women and children by a company of U.S. soldiers in My Lai, Vietnam. The tribunal sentenced him to life in prison.
President Richard Nixon did not see this as an opportunity to drive home the point that U.S. soldiers must follow the laws of war and that deviations are not only morally wrong but counterproductive militarily.
Rather, Nixon decided to exploit a groundswell of sympathy for Calley. In 1971, millions of Americans vilified Calley as typical of a corrupt and violent policy; yet millions more saw him as a dedicated soldier being scapegoated for the failed policies of others.
A song called "Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley" sold more than 200,000 records in the three days after the court-martial ended. "My name is William Calley, I'm a soldier of this land," the lyrics went. "I've tried to do my duty and to gain the upper hand/ But they've made me out a villain; they have stamped me with a brand."
Within days of Calley's conviction, Nixon exercised his authority to have him removed from prison and placed in comfortable house arrest pending an appeal, the first step in a process that would ultimately see Calley, the only American convicted for the atrocities in My Lai, set free after three years.
Now, as in Nixon's era, executive clemency may undercut the results of legal process - but resonate on the populist right. Trump is in touch with the same distrust of elite authority that Nixon was, and he taps the same vein of sympathy for men sent to fight a dirty guerrilla war in which, as "Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley" put it, "It's hard to judge the enemy and hard to tell the good."
Where Trump may break new ground, according to a recent New York Times report, would be by weighing a pardon for one Navy SEAL accused of murder - before he even stands trial.
Edward Gallagher faces a May 28 court-martial on criminal counts that include premeditated murder for allegedly stabbing to death a suspected Islamic State fighter whom Iraqi forces had brought for medical care to Gallagher's SEAL team platoon in Mosul in May 2017. Gallagher, a 19-year veteran of multiple combat tours, also stands accused of firing at civilians indiscriminately, and, in one alleged instance, shot a girl walking along a riverbank.
Gallagher denies the charges and, with the support of more than three dozen Republican members of Congress, began demanding less restrictive pretrial confinement almost as soon as he was arrested last September. Trump granted that demand in March.
The campaign on Gallagher's behalf is smaller in scale than the one waged by Calley's supporters long ago, but similar in spirit.
The SEALs' willingness to blow the whistle on Gallagher may reflect the U.S. military's embrace, since My Lai, of the standard set by Hugh Thompson, a U.S. Army helicopter pilot who was at the village on March 16, 1968, saw what was happening and intervened to save a group of civilian Vietnamese, ordering his crew to fire on U.S. troops if necessary to stop the slaughter.
In 1998, the Army held a special ceremony to present Thompson the Soldier's Medal - an award for heroism not involving conflict with an enemy. This belated recognition of a man who was, in 1968, ostracized for his stand, fit into the armed forces' broader effort to reinforce ethical and humanitarian standards. Thompson even spoke at West Point and other military installations.
Hugh Thompson's legacy, in short, was taking hold; but now the commander in chief himself may be about to repudiate it.

Texto completo: President Iván Duque of Colombia, under fire over concerns that his military may be committing human rights abuses in its pursuit of armed groups, said Friday that he was appointing an independent commission to review orders and operational instructions issued by the army.
The initiative came less than a week after The New York Times disclosed army orders from this year instructing top commanders to "double the results" of their military missions against guerrilla, paramilitary and criminal organizations in Colombia.
The orders have caused unrest among some senior army officers, who said the new pressure to carry out attacks had heightened the risk of civilian casualties and had already led to suspicious deaths by overzealous soldiers.
Mr. Duque said he would create the commission, to be composed of prominent Colombian jurists, to perform a "rigorous analysis of all orders, manuals and operational documents." He said the goal would be to ensure that the military's orders conform to human rights law.
In the early 2000s, Colombia's military unlawfully killed as many as 5,000 people when soldiers were put under pressure to increase their combat body counts. In some cases, peasants were slain and dressed up as guerrillas, or weapons were planted on them, so soldiers could meet their quotas. The crimes were known as "false-positive" killings.
The high-level officers interviewed recently by The Times began their careers during the "false-positive" killings and rose in rank during periods of reform.
They expressed concern that the orders this year had set the groundwork for a new series of illicit killings. They said Mr. Duque's government had promoted a set of commanders who were unrepentant about the previous era.
Colombia's senior army commander, Maj. Gen. Nicacio Martínez Espinel, said in an interview that he had issued the orders intended to double the results of military operations, but that his orders had been misinterpreted by the officers.
In a letter after the publication of The Times article, Colombia's government said the story had incorrectly implied that the military was acting "in the face of international human rights and international law."
But on Tuesday the army walked back part of the orders to step up attacks in the country, a pledge form in which officers were required to list the number of criminals and militants they planned to kill, capture or force to surrender in battle.
An army spokeswoman said the form would be subject to some modifications because of "a possible wrong interpretation" by those outside the military. She did not specify what the changes were. Gen. Martínez was quoted by El Tiempo, a local newspaper, as saying that it would be withdrawn altogether.
Another order, issued this year and apparently still in place, instructs officers not to "demand perfection" in carrying out attacks, even if significant questions remain about the targets they are striking.
"You must launch operations with 60 to 70 percent credibility or exactitude," the order says.

Last known slave ship believed found

Texto completo: Over the years, the hunt for the remains of the last ship known to have brought enslaved people into the United States has been fraught with a mix of tumult and hope.
There was a discovery last year of wreckage that, after much excitement, was determined to be a false alarm. Hopes were raised, then dashed, then raised again - not only among marine archaeologists but also among the descendants of the ship's human cargo, many of whom make their homes in a tiny South Alabama community called Africatown.
Then, on Wednesday, came an announcement from the Alabama Historical Commission: Another shipwreck, one of many marooned under a muddy stretch of the Mobile River, was almost certainly the Clotilda, a wooden vessel of horrors that had carried 110 Africans to the United States in 1860, more than a half-century after the importation of slaves was declared illegal.
The find, historians said, revives a story of unspeakable cruelty but also the story of a people who somehow survived this indignity and many others like it.
The last voyage of the Clotilda, from Benin to Mobile Bay, "represented one of the darkest eras of modern history," Lisa Demetropoulos Jones, the commission's executive director, said in a statement.
"This new discovery brings the tragedy of slavery into focus while witnessing the triumph and resilience of the human spirit in overcoming the horrific crime that led to the establishment of Africatown," she continued.
The discovery was aided by input from the Smithsonian Institution, the National Park Service, the National Geographic Society and the Slave Wrecks Project, a multinational group researching the slave trade, and comes at a moment when civil rights museums have opened across the South. The African-American experience is also finding powerful new expression in the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in Washington in 2016.
But the news is likely to resonate most forcefully in Africatown, a working-class community of about 2,000 people north of downtown Mobile. It was founded by people who had been transported to Alabama in the Clotilda's hull, and it was a place where African languages were spoken for decades.
More recently, the area was hit hard by paper mill closures, but there is a plan to build a welcome center and museum, largely funded by money from a settlement with oil giant BP after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.
Although it was not clear Wednesday whether any of the wreckage could be restored, Councilman Levon Manzie, who represents the area, said he hoped that the ship, or parts of it, would be prominently displayed in Africatown.
"We are incredibly proud as a people and as a community that this link to our history has finally been discovered, and uncovered, and hopefully will be fully appreciated," Manzie said Wednesday evening. His dream, he said, was "to restore it to the degree that's possible and to truly tell this unique American story, this unique Mobile story, in a grand fashion."
After the Clotilda's arrival in the United States, its captain, William Foster, burned the ship in an effort to conceal evidence of the illegal smuggling trip. The Africans aboard were distributed to slave owners, according to the Alabama Historical Commission.
After the Civil War, some of the ship's survivors gathered in hopes of returning to Africa, but they were unable to do so. Instead, they founded Africatown.
Stories of the ship and its survivors were passed down from generation to generation, although doubts lingered given the lack of physical proof.
That changed - or so it seemed - in January 2018, when Ben Raines, a writer and documentarian who was then a reporter for AL.com, published an article in which he said he had found the remains of a ship that appeared to be the Clotilda.
But that March, experts determined that the ship he had found was too big to be the Clotilda. The stories that followed were not so kind. "I was devastated," said Raines, the son of Howell Raines, a former executive editor of The New York Times. "I was sort of this journalistic laughingstock."
The younger Raines persisted, sure that he was on to something. He said he convinced researchers at the University of Southern Mississippi to bring a crew to the area to survey for more shipwrecks. They found many. One initially seemed like a big log pile.
Then Raines discovered a piece of lumber with square nails in it - a telltale sign, he said, of 19th-century construction.
"Guys, we just found a ship from the 1850s," he recalled saying at the time.
The experts returned, led by James Delgado, an authority in maritime archaeology. A painstaking act of detective work followed, involving hunts for archived documents, more dives, X-ray fluorescence tests and comparisons of building materials, dimensions and stories.
"There is nothing definitive in terms of a name on a piece of wood or a bell, so what we had to rely on is a series of pieces of evidence that together would lead you to a conclusion," Delgado said Wednesday.
The pieces started to fall into place. Insurance records said the ship had white oak framing and planking of northern yellow pine. Those materials were found underwater.
The ship was listed as 86 feet long by 23 feet wide with a 6-foot-11-inch depth of hold. Those, too, matched the dimensions of the wreck.
Among other things, the researchers found "deformed, carbonized rounded pieces of wood that come from an intense fire," Delgado said. "We brought in a forensic fire investigator. It was consistent with a fire that had burned for a while."
Many other leads checked out. And although confirmation with complete certainty is impossible, Delgado said he believes they have come close. His team wrote a report and sent it to six scientists for a peer review.
"All of them, to a one," he said, "concluded that this was likely Clotilda."
Now the focus will turn to protecting the ship and deciding whether it can be displayed. More archaeological work is likely, potentially revealing additional elements of the long-submerged story.
For the moment, Raines said, he is feeling a good dose of vindication, and joy for Africatown.
"This," he said, "tells America their story." - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: Some days, the perfect dinner is a hamburger with a side of crispy fries and a cold beer.
Other days, it's a pie from your favorite pizzeria.
But from time to time, dinner should be more of a special occasion. Maybe you're on vacation and are looking forward to a really nice dinner out. Or maybe there's something to celebrate — a new job? A big birthday? A wedding anniversary?
Or perhaps you're just in the mood to treat yourself to a really, really good meal.
When that time comes, here are 15 restaurants that fit the bill.
The Poached Pear Bistro, Point Pleasant Beach Chef Scott Giordano knows what he's not, and that's "over the top, frou-frou style."
But that doesn't mean the chef, who opened The Poached Pear Bistro with his brother, Marc, in 2014, isn't cooking top-notch food.
"I try to keep it simple: a couple elements to the dish, nice flavors, a nice portion," said Giordano, whose menu of elevated comfort food includes duck confit ravioli with blood orange butter; rack of lamb with baby vegetables; and coffee-rubbed New York strip steak with mushroom risotto.
The chef also pays more attention to children's dishes than most restaurants; he feels young diners deserve good food, too. "Little pears," as they are called, will find their favorites, done better: panko-crusted chicken tenders with housemade french fries, petite filet mignon with mashed potatoes, and flatbread pizza.
Go: 816 Arnold Ave.; 732-701-1700, poachedpearbistro.com.
Blu Grotto Ristorante, Oceanport After a day at the races at Monmouth Park Racetrack, head to this restaurant on the grounds — look for the conservatory-style dining room, with floor-to-ceiling windows.
Inside, Chef James Corona prepares modern and classic Italian dishes like short rib meatballs; veal porterhouse with artichokes; lamb chops Milanese with cauliflower caponata; and branzino with chickpeas, Swiss chard and pesto.
Outside the glass-walled dining room, the restaurant has three outdoor patios and a beer garden. Brunch is served on Sundays; dishes include French toast souffle, eggs in purgatory, and skirt steak and eggs.
Go: 200 Port Au Peck Ave.; 732-571-7900, blugrottonj.com.
Pascal & Sabine, Asbury Park In the fall of 2014, nearly a year after Pascal & Sabine brought French food to Bangs Avenue, a reviewer from The New York Times came calling. She tried escargot in garlic butter, coq au vin, steak frites, and milk chocolate pot de crème. Her review declared that the restaurant had "beauty, spirit and, in general, exceedingly good food. For these reasons, it stands out among the state's few, fine French restaurants."
From the highly regarded Smith restaurant group (also the owner of Brickwall Tavern, Porta, The Annex and Little Buddy Hideaway in the city), Pascal & Sabine is a place to savor champagne and Petrossian caviar. The restaurant offers a seven-course chef's table experience complete with wine pairings, plus dishes like chicken liver mousse, country pork pâté, and the hard-to-find Dover sole, which is pan-seared in brown butter, parsley, lemon and capers.
Go: 601 Bangs Ave.; 732-774-3395, pascalandsabine.com.
Osteria Radici, Allentown A little less than two years ago, the husband and wife team of Randy and Ally Forrester opened Osteria Radici, serving modern Italian food in the tiny borough of Allentown.
Since then, their restaurant has garnered two James Beard nominations. The first, which came four months after the opening, was for best new restaurant. Osteria Radici was the only New Jersey restaurant on the list that year.
Not too shabby for the new guy in town.
This year, Randy Forrester was nominated for best chef Mid-Atlantic.
In his kitchen, he makes his own bread and pasta each day. Ally runs the front of house. Their menu, a marriage of traditional Italian cuisine and modern technique, changes daily and includes such dishes as sea trout crudo with caper honey; pressed pork cheek with broccoli rabe; and gnocchi with lamb sausage ragu.
Go: 4 S Main St.; 609-223-2395, osteriaradici.com.
Restaurant Nicholas, Middletown It has been nearly 20 years since Chef Nicholas Harary and his wife, Melissa, opened their fine-dining restaurant a stone's throw from bustling Red Bank, and the accolades for inspired cuisine, exceptional service and truly great wine keep coming. One of the best – and most indulgent – ways to enjoy a meal here is by taking a seat in the kitchen: The chef's table, nestled into an cozy alcove, overlooks the bustling kitchen.
In the dining room, diners choose between three-, four- and five-course tasting menus. Dishes include pickled heirloom beets with mascarpone, butter-poached lobster with pasta, and bourbon-braised suckling pig with apples and maple jus. Dinner also is served in the bar area, called Bar N.

Cartas “no match” del gobierno Trump hacen que cientos de inmigrantes dejen su empleo

Texto completo: El gobierno de Donald Trump reactivó una práctica de 2012 en la que avisa a los empleadores de inmigrates cuando sus nombres y los números de seguro social no coinciden
Por esta razón cientos de trabajadores de todo el país se están viendo obligados a dejar su empleo después de que sus patrones recibieran las llamadas cartas “no match” y no pudieran demostrar su presencia legal en Estados Unidos.
El “bombardeo” de misivas o “cartas de no coincidencia”, que advierten sobre discrepancias entre los registros de la Administración de la Seguridad Social, el nombre de la persona y los números de seguro social que figuran en el Formulario W-2 de un empleado, ha provocado preocupación entre los empresarios.
Por temor a recibir sanciones federales, los empleadores han optado por hacer una “limpieza” de sus plantillas laborales.
“Estas acciones colocan a los empleadores en una situación alarmante, debido a que dependen de la mano de obra de miles de inmigrantes para que sus negocios continúen funcionando en una época de ‘high employment’ (alto empleo”) , dijo a Efe la activista y analista en inmigración Carmen Cornejo.
El dueño de una mueblería en Phoenix, Arizona, quien solicitó el anonimato, recibió dichas cartas recientemente, y ante el temor de ser penalizado por el Gobierno, buscó asesoría legal.
Su objetivo, dijo, era proceder con el despido de sus empleados indocumentados de forma digna y apegándose lo más posible a la legislación.
“Nadie quiere meterse en problemas con el Gobierno federal, nada más quería saber cuáles era mis responsabilidades; no los puedes correr abruptamente, primero tienes que darles la oportunidad de comprobar que están trabajando legalmente”, dijo el empresario a Efe.
En carne propia lo vivió Sofía Andrade, quien trabajaba en una compañía que elabora ensaladas. Andrade narró que su patrón dijo de repente a un grupo que tenían cuatro días para la comprobación de su legalidad en el trabajo y poder conservar el empleo.
“Nos avisaron en una reunión de que tenían un reporte de Inmigración y nos dijo el patrón que le pidieron la lista y el nombre de todos los trabajadores y su seguro social” , explica a Efe Andrade.
“Cerca de 40 personas tuvimos que dejar nuestros trabajos”, comentó la inmigrante, que llevaba seis meses en la compañía.
Ahora, agregó, tiene que trabajar en una fábrica de carpintera con un pago de 11 dólares la hora, bajo condiciones “muy duras” y que considera fuera de la ley.
“El trabajo es muy pesado, el jefe abusa porque a veces trabajamos jornadas de 13 horas al día y no nos las paga (…) completamente, pero me tengo que aguantar, porque no tengo papeles”, indicó Andrade.
Durante el corriente año, la administración Trump, a través de la SSA, ha estado enviando más de 570,000 “cartas de no coincidencia” a empresas en todo el país, de acuerdo con datos del New York Times.
Cornejo señaló que se ha notado el incremento en estas prácticas gubernamentales, ya que frecuentemente recibe llamadas de trabajadores que piden asesoría por los despidos, que consideran “injustificados”.
“No saben exactamente lo que está pasando. Para ellos su prioridad es cumplir con el trabajo, pero tristemente no están cumpliendo con las leyes al ser indocumentados, explicó la activista.
Cornejo mencionó que estas cartas están causando ansiedad a las empresas, principalmente a las de hostelería, agricultura y la construcción, sectores que se han visto más afectados por estas medidas impulsadas por el Gobierno.
“La verdad es que nadie quiere meterse en problemas con el Gobierno federal, aunque sean buenos empleados tienen que corroborar su información y al final la mayoría se va por voluntad propia”, sostuvo.
Cornejo detalló además que las razones de las discrepancias de dichas cartas pueden ser por cambios en los nombres conyugales y errores tipográficos en los formularios, pero que actualmente se están utilizando para escudriñar el estatus migratorio del trabajador.
La SSA suspendió el envío de estas cartas a las compañías en 2012, pero la Casa Blanca reanudó esta práctica en marzo pasado.
Los críticos dicen que la reactivación de las cartas es parte de la línea más dura de la actual Administración republicana y de sus políticas de inmigración.
“Esto es totalmente planificado, las acciones por parte del Gobierno, son deliberadas y van en aumento. No solo están haciendo su trabajo habitual, sino que el Gobierno está exigiendo un incremento en el número de casos”, matizó Cornejo.

Texto completo: Egypt For the first time, Bedouin women are becoming tour guides. Bedouin conservative ideals traditionally have not supported women working outside the home or socializing outside the community. But some women say their need for income to support their families is too compelling for them to stay at home. The women tour guides have faced resistance and are able to guide only under certain conditions: All of the tourists must be women, and the tours cannot go overnight. Attitudes among Bedouin tribes are changing, though, and a tribe member told a reporter that he’s tired of the ideology that a woman’s place is at home. Others observe that young Bedouin girls feel more empowered now and express their desire to follow in these women’s footsteps. (The Associated Press)
Portugal The country led the European Union in lowering carbon emissions. A report released by Eurostat shows that CO2 emissions constitute almost 80% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions and are a significant contributor to the rise in global temperatures. In 2018, the majority of the European Union’s 28 members experienced a decrease in CO2 emissions, and Portugal had the greatest percentage decline at 9%. Along with seven other EU members, Portugal is asking the EU to cut emissions to a net-zero level by 2050. The eight members also want to see 25% of the EU budget spent on fighting climate change and stipulate that the budget “should not finance any policy detrimental to this objective.” (Eurostat)
New Zealand The country’s capital of Wellington is reconnecting with its Maori heritage.  Today, only 3% of the population can speak Maori, even though it is one of the nation’s official languages. But the city hopes to change that. Landmark signs in Wellington are getting Maori names, and existing locations with Maori names that have long been mispronounced with improper phonetic spelling are being corrected. Wellington plans to be bilingual by 2040 and has given a new name to the city square: “Te Ngakau,” meaning “the heart.” There are also plans for a heritage trail that will point out locations of former Maori villages and historical points of interest. (CityLab)
United States Principals across the country are helping their schools heal. The rising number of fatal shootings in schools has prompted principals to form a support group called Principals Recovery Network. After Columbine High School’s principal reached out to a fellow principal in Ohio whose school had just experienced a fatal shooting, the two benefited so much from the connection that they started contacting other principals whose schools had been the scene of shootings. Members support one another and advocate to provide educational resources in schools to promote nonviolence. (The Associated Press)
South Korea Grannies are going back to school. As South Korea’s birthrate declines, schools are looking for ways to keep classrooms filled with students, particularly in rural areas. If schools closed, young families would have to leave. To avoid this, school administrators are turning to an unconventional pool of potential students: older residents, many of whom never learned to read. One grandmother now rides the bus to school with her granddaughter, not to accompany her but as a fellow third-grader. A septuagenarian attending her first day of school told a reporter, “Carrying a school bag has always been my dream.” (The New York Times)

Texto completo: "Watch where you step," John Waters said gleefully, as he opened the door to his West Village apartment. He gestured to the floor, which was arrayed with what looked like construction rubble, a cardboard box with packing peanuts spilling out, a mousetrap. In the corner was a pile of dog poop.
It was all art, of course -- the rubble handmade by the Swiss artists Fischli/Weiss, the box an objet from the New Museum's gift shop, and the mousetrap, one of several trompe l'oeil pieces by Doug Padgett, whose stopped clock and faux light switch also trip up Mr. Waters regularly. The very realistic poop was a must, given Mr. Waters's scatological legacy with Divine in "Pink Flamingos."
He's careful about displays, too. "Whenever I come to my New York apartment, I have to become the installer; I put on my white gloves, take everything out -- because there's a lot of floor art, and it's the enemy of cleaning people," said Mr. Waters, the filmmaker, author, performer and bon vivant of bad taste. He has an expansive, and very seriously considered, art collection -- even if a lot of it is funny and some of it is, in his words, "ugly." (He likes brown art, he said, for that very reason.) "Can you go wrong in collecting monkey art?" he asks, unrhetorically, in a meticulously researched chapter in his new book, "Mr. Know-It-All."
He began collecting as a teenager in suburban Baltimore, where his first pieces included an Andy Warhol print of Jackie Kennedy, purchased in 1964, for $ 100 -- "which was a lot then," he said. "A hundred dollars was like $ 1,000."
Since then, Mr. Waters, 73, has acquired several other (pricier) Warhols, and an insider's knowledge of contemporary art; his own visual work has been exhibited in galleries and in a 2018 retrospective, "Indecent Exposure," at the Baltimore Museum of Art.
His walls -- he has a home in Baltimore and another apartment in San Francisco -- are very nearly overstuffed, "so I only buy little art now," he said. "I don't buy anything if I can't hang it up. I collect to live with it."
Some of it he scoops up gallery-hopping, a favorite pastime. Some is by friends, like the small arch made of pill bottles for H.I.V. medications by the artist Frankie Rice, with whom Mr. Waters said he recently dropped acid. ("We hallucinated for 12 hours" -- it's in the book.)
In a tour one Monday morning, -- dressed for the occasion in pointy ankle boots that his friend Mary Boone, the gallerist-turned-federal prisoner, had given him -- Mr. Waters told typically wild stories about, say, the time that the Republican strategist Lee Atwater ("a huge fan of exploitation movies") led him on a secret tour of the Reagan White House. He's now at work on a novel, the one thing he wouldn't discuss: "It's bad luck to talk about something before you do it."
This painting looks like your apartment.
It's a pretty early Karen Kilimnik piece. I love it for many reasons. A) the artist would have no idea, but it looks exactly like my dining room in Baltimore; B) it's on fire, and our family business was fire protection. I always have a little bit of pyromania in me because my father used to take us to watch people's houses burn down. It was like a family thing -- we'd hear the siren and we'd run out. It was really when I felt close to my father.
Also, I love that it's just off-center. I always think that art is mistakes.
You have a roll of toilet paper in your living room.
That's George Stoll. I had to get the super in the building to approve that I was going to dig into the wall. I don't know what he thought -- like, scat queen, or something -- but I said, "Well, it's art." He was like "yeah, yeah." But it is chiffon, and every time I come in, I have to unwind it.
Are there any pieces that arrived at a meaningful time in your life?
The Warhol [anus] painting. [It hangs in his bedroom, and Mr. Waters correctly predicted that The New York Times would not print an image of it.] I treated myself to that after one movie. And when they did the catalogue raisonné and came and inspected it, they told me -- you see the footprint of Andy's dog that walked across the painting, Archie.
You said some art is best kept in a closet. What constitutes closet art?
A fan gave me this big portrait of Judy Garland and I thought, that is so gay. I put it in my closet behind the coats. So I'm trying to be a closet queen, again, about Judy Garland. It's not a guilty pleasure, because it's in a guest closet. Or kind of a great thrift shop painting -- but behind the clothes, so only I see it.
You travel a lot. How do you deal with the art that you encounter on the road?
Well, I bring art. And sometimes take the art down that's hanging and put mine up. I have the framed medical license of the Baltimore doctor that gave everybody, including me, speed in the '60s and didn't know that it was drugs. He just thought it was a new thing for diets -- but I did weigh 128 and was 6'1," and he gave me like 200 Black Beauty pills.
Besides liking the work, what guiding principles do you follow in collecting?
It has to sometimes, at first, make me angry. It has to delight me and surprise me and kind of like, put me off a little bit at first, and then I embrace it. The kind of art I like is the one that makes people angry, that hate contemporary art -- the ones that easily fall for the bait of it. I always go to that first.
I have a piece called "Contemporary Art Hates You." And it does, if you hate it first. You have to embrace why it hates you. You see it in a different way -- you learn a magic trick. So to me, each one of these pieces relaxes me and makes me tense at the same time -- which is what art should do. All art that works infuriates people at first.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential aspirant Pete Buttigieg said Thursday that he thinks it is "disgusting" that President Trump is reportedly considering pardons for several American military members accused or convicted of war crimes.
Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who served in Afghanistan as a Navy Reserve intelligence officer, said during an appearance at a Washington Post Live event that such pardons would hurt the standing of the U.S. military abroad and make troops less safe.
"My view is it's disgusting," Buttigieg said, adding that it is important to maintain the credibility of the U.S. military justice system. "If the president blows a hole in that, he is blowing a hole in the military, and he is putting troops' lives at risk."
Buttigieg said that during his military service, "the flag on my shoulder represented a country that kept its word. . . . If we lose that, nothing will keep us safe."
Several recent reports have said Trump is considering some pardons of military members on an expedited basis to exercise his power around Memorial Day.
Buttigieg's military service came up at several points during a wide-ranging interview with The Post's Robert Costa.
Buttigieg, 37, the youngest candidate in the Democratic presidential field, referred to his military service when seeking to make the case that he could take on Trump.
"I don't have a problem standing up to someone who was working on Season 7 of 'Celebrity Apprentice' when I was packing my bags for Afghanistan," Buttigieg said, citing Trump's previous NBC reality television series.
Buttigieg also accused Trump of skirting military service in Vietnam for an illegitimate reason.
"I have a pretty dim view of his decision to use his privilege to fake a disability in order to avoid serving in Vietnam," Buttigieg said.
Pressed by Costa, Buttigieg said, "That's exactly what he did."
Trump has said he received a medical deferment in 1968 because he had bone spurs in his feet.
The New York Times reported late last year that the daughters of a deceased podiatrist said it was "family lore" that their father provided the diagnosis as a favor to Trump's father, who owned the building in which the podiatrist practiced.
Buttigieg said the issue is one that "deserves to be talked about."
During the interview, Buttigieg disagreed with Trump on the issue of whether National Football League players should be allowed to kneel during the national anthem. Trump has repeatedly decried that practice, saying it is disrespectful to the U.S. flag and military.
Asked about his view as a service member, Buttigieg said: "I thought I was watching Americans exercise a right that I had put my life on the line to defend."
The players who began the practice in 2016 said they were protesting racial injustice.

Trump's war on numbers

Texto completo: Don't like the numbers? Invent new numbers instead.
Or make it harder to collect trustworthy numbers next time.
Or just put the squeeze on the number crunchers themselves.
Slowly but surely, the Trump administration has been chipping away at the independence and integrity of our federal statistical agencies, whose data is critical to keeping our democracy functioning and our economy healthy. So far as we know, the administration still hasn't managed to pierce the citadel of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the independent agency that releases jobs and inflation numbers) or Bureau of Economic Analysis (the independent agency that tabulates gross domestic product). But around the edges, it's trying to compromise lots of other official government data.
This week, the New York Times reported that the Environmental Protection Agency plans to massage the model it uses to determine how many people die of pollution. The goal is to make the rollback of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan look significantly less deadly than the current models suggest. This is also part of a broader administrative effort to downgrade official estimates of environmental harm resulting from the administration's deregulatory agenda.
It's reminiscent of another proposal the administration made this month, relating to how we measure poverty. That's also a technical, boring- sounding, deep-in-the-weeds change that most of the public won't notice.
At least, not at first.
But over time, the change would reduce the number of Americans officially counted as poor - not because they've started earning more money but because this technical, boring-sounding change would redraw the line for who is in or out of poverty.
If you're a right-wing politician, this change would be a double win. It allows you to claim your policies have lifted families out of poverty, even if they're still struggling. It's also a backdoor way to slash spending on the safety net.
That's because the poverty threshold is used to determine eligibility for lots of safety-net services, meaning those newly defined as not-poor would also become newly defined as not-eligible for food stamps, Medicare's Part D Low- Income Subsidy program and other benefits. After 10 years, for instance, more than 300,000 children would lose comprehensive coverage through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), according to an estimate from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
When directly manipulating official government measures isn't an option, the administration can also mess with the data-collection process.
That's precisely what's behind the Commerce Department's last-minute decision to jam a citizenship question into the 2020 Census, the constitutionally mandated enumeration of all "persons" (not just citizens) in the United States.
Immigrant and ethnic minority populations in this country already have high levels of distrust of government, thanks to xenophobic rhetoric and actions by President Trump (including, at one point, a proposed Muslim registry). Now just imagine what happens if the government suddenly demands that every household in America report the citizenship status of every occupant.
Significant population undercounts and otherwise inaccurate data can be expected to result, and the consequences of these distortions would be far-reaching. An inaccurate count would skew congressional representation and the allocation of hundreds of billions of federal dollars each year. It would also warp the many other public and private data measures that use the census as a baseline.
The Supreme Court will soon decide whether the administration's plans can proceed; three lower courts have blocked the question, on the grounds that the administration's actions violate administrative law or the Constitution.
Finally, there's the Economic Research Service, the independent statistical agency housed within the Agriculture Department.
Its researchers compile and analyze data related to crops, yes, but also poverty, food stamps, trade and climate change, among other politically sensitive issues. And right now these economists and statisticians are quitting in droves. That's because the Trump administration abruptly decided to relocate hundreds of positions. Workers were told that if they want to keep their jobs, they have until the end of September to move their families to . . . a still as-yet-unnamed new city.
The relocation is, ostensibly, to save money. But it sure seems like a backdoor purge of an independent agency that has produced analyses inconvenient to the administration, including on the harms caused by Trump's trade wars and how little the 2017 GOP tax overhaul has helped small farmers.
Presumably the Trump administration has calculated that doctoring statistical models, skewing survey results and trying to strong-arm statisticians will serve its near-term political interests. In the long term, however, sowing distrust in government data only reduces the ability of policymakers, businesses and voters to make informed decisions.
Of course, maybe that was the goal all along.

Texto completo: In the years since World War II broke out in Europe and President Franklin Roosevelt foreshadowed support for France and England in a radio fireside chat, presidents have spoken to the American people at length about conflicts threatening to involve the nation.
As tensions rise precipitously between the United States and Iran — with bombers set on hair trigger alert and naval battle groups on the move — that's not what we're getting from President Donald Trump. Standing in the front door of the White House last week he blurted out, "I hope not," to a reporter's shouted question about the prospect of war with Iran.
Then on Sunday, he seemed to contradict that sentiment in a tweet, "If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!"
As tightening sanctions cripple the Persian Gulf nation, an American carrier group is rushed to the region and nonemergency personnel are evacuated from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. Consulate in Erbil — a step not taken even when Islamic State terrorists were rampaging across Iraq in 2014 — Trump needs to explain what he is trying to achieve.
The commander in chief is preparing the military for the outbreak of violence, but he's not fulfilling his role in preparing the public. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford will brief the House of Representatives in a secure auditorium. The New York Times reports that military officials expect Middle East commanders to ask for a fresh wave of American forces to deter Iran.
The White House and the Pentagon say the moves are a response to intelligence that Iran is planning attacks on U.S. troops in the region. But this conflicts with threat assessments by allies.
Beyond this immediate urgency, confusion persists about the broader endgame behind the Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign of sanctions, levied against Iran ever since Washington last year withdrew from a 2015 agreement that was successfully containing Tehran's nuclear program.
Now Iran threatens to resume stockpiling enriched uranium that could be the precursor to a nuclear warhead.
There's no question Iran is a bad actor in the Middle East, growing its ballistic missile program and using proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen to provoke violence and instability. But how Trump intends to change this is not at all clear.
The sanctions are aimed at making Iran "conform to the normal things that normal nations do," Pompeo said this month. But he clearly doesn't believe this himself. "I just don't see it," the secretary of State said earlier about Iran moderating its behavior.
And Trump's other leading foreign policy consultant, national security adviser John Bolton, has made a career out of advocating force against Iran.
Is regime change the goal? This hasn't worked in Venezuela, where a weaker dictator with a devastated economy still resists U.S.-led efforts to install a new government. And Iran has resisted U.S. efforts to moderate its behavior for 40 years.
Trump, who relishes summitry, has repeatedly offered to meet with Iranian leaders and cut a "deal" to curb their behavior and accept tougher nuclear restrictions. Tehran has thus far shown zero interest.
Trump has long promised to avoid foreign entanglements and has told the Pentagon that his wish is no war with Iran. Then why did he hire Bolton?
And what is the plan?
Soundbites shouted at reporters and belligerent tweets can't convey to Americans the risks Iran poses and what the United States is compelled to do about it.
If there is to be a face-off that includes the prospect of a wider conflict, President Trump owes it to the American people to speak before the saber rattling becomes a sobering reality.

Texto completo: An expert from Harvard and the editor of The New York Times are both sounding warnings that newspapers are ailing and may be perched on the edge of a precipitous decline.
Times editor Dean Baquet predicted at a media conference Friday that “most local newspapers in America are going to die in the next five years, except for the ones that have been bought by a local billionaire."
“The greatest crisis in American journalism is the death of local news," he said at the International News Media Association's World Congress of News Media in New York.
“I don't know what the answer is, but I think that everybody who cares about news — myself included, and all of you — should take this on as an issue. Because we're going to wake up one day and there are going to be entire states with no journalism or with little tiny pockets of journalism. . . . I'm not worried about Los Angeles and New York. I don't know what the model is for covering the school boards in Newark, N.J. That makes me nervous," he said in comments posted by INMA on its website.
The newspaper industry has been declining in recent years. The Associated Press reported in March, based on data gathered by the University of North Carolina, that more than 1,400 cities and towns across the United States had lost a newspaper over the past 15 years. The Wall Street Journal reported that local newspapers are failing to make the digital transition that larger players have — and “time is running out." The Financial Times reports that many are turning into thin “ghost newspapers."
Nicco Mele, a lecturer at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, offered a dire prediction similar to Baquet's.
Mele, a former deputy publisher of the Los Angeles Times, said Tuesday in a telephone interview that he predicts half of all daily and weekly newspapers will disappear by the end of 2021.
The primary reason, he said, will be a decline in revenue from preprints, or inserts, the glossy advertising circulars with coupons that come with newspapers.
The preprints provide a significant amount of advertising revenue to most newspapers, he said, and it's “very clear that almost all of it is going away." Without them, “the economics of the paper get very hard to make any sense."
He said two forces are working against the preprint coupons: shopper reward programs and online shopping that sends people “looking for deals online" rather than carrying coupons into brick-and-mortar stores.
“There's just a tipping point in the economics after which there's a sudden collapse," Mele said.
Mele said the decline of newspapers will be bad for democracy. For example, he said, there are 21 US states that once sent correspondents to Washington that no longer do.
“That's 42 US senators that don't get questions from hometown journalists," said Mele, who is working on a book about the impact of the death of local journalism on politics.
Is there any solution?
“There's a number of people trying to figure out what solutions might look like," he said. “I have confidence in the long run. In the short run, I think it could be kind of brutal."

Texto completo: White House counselor Kellyanne Conway slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after President Trump abruptly shut down an infrastructure meeting at the White House on Wednesday.
“I knew he was looking for a way out,” Pelosi, D-Calif., said when Trump left the room after only three minutes, according to the New York Times. “We were expecting this.”
Conway, who was in the room, replied: “Respectfully, Madam Speaker, do you have a direct response to the president?”
The Times reports Pelosi said she was responding to the president and not his staff.
“Really great,” Conway said sarcastically. “That’s really pro-woman of you.”
"Instead of walking in happily into a meeting, I walk in to look at people that have just said that I was doing a cover-up. I don't do cover-ups,"
After leaving the meeting, which also included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Trump addressed reporters in the Rose Garden and said he was particularly upset about Pelosi suggesting he engaged in a cover-up during special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.
Trump said Democrats would have to drop investigations before he could work with them.

Texto completo: Ana Guerrero, who co-owns Takote, the Latin grocery store and taqueria on the mainland side of Fort Myers Beach, knows what the foodies say: Latin markets are the best place to find authentic Mexican food.
They're right when it comes to Takote. Its kitchen is staffed with well-trained former ranch cooks from a small town in Veracruz, Mexico.
But Guerrero also knows small Latin grocery stores can be intimidating to people who don't speak Spanish or who aren't familiar with traditional Mexican cuisine. So, she made Takote welcoming to all.
"We wanted to make it more friendly for not just Mexicans but other nationalities to experience real Mexican food. It's more modern looking, and it welcomes everybody," Guerrero said.
"People like the feeling of being inside. It has good vibes, but I wanted to keep the tradition of the food. I didn't want Tex-Mex."
The Takote menu includes traditional Mexican favorites such as tacos dorados — rolled, deep fried tacos — and tostadas. The homemade tamales are also a big hit, as are the tortas, Mexican-style sandwiches made with bread that's freshly baked in hourse at Takote.
The restaurant also offers traditional platters with steak, chicken or pork chops plus rice, refried black beans and tortillas.
Breakfast is available all day, including Takote's huevos rancheros — corn tortillas topped with refried black beans, two fried eggs and salsa. And its chilaquiles, a dish made with fried corn tortillas, more fried eggs, onions, cheese, avocado and green or red enchilada sauce.
Takote offers four homemade salsas and three fresh juice blends. The menudo, a traditional soup made with beef stomach, is another customer favorite.
"We make everything to order," Guerrero said.
"Everything is fresh. The tamales are made by scratch. We make the bread. The juices are completely fresh; we use a juicer. Everything that people order is fresh."
The restaurant section of the market has 50 seats and serves beer and wine. Guerrero and her business partner, Steve Ramunni, are also adding a bar area where customers can order mixed drinks such as margaritas, sangria and micheladas, a Mexican drink that combines beer, tomato juice, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce and lime.
The business first opened in 2011 as Latinos Market in a plaza a few blocks north of the current one near Point Ybel Brewing Co. The original owners approached Guerrero about buying the business, and she reached out to Ramunni, who had been her attorney and was looking for an investment project.
"It was a great opportunity," Guerrero said. "We bought it overnight."
The restaurant remained in its original space until 2017 when Hurricane Irma brought down the roof of the plaza.
"It was awful," Guerrero said. "Insurance didn't cover it, and it was a big struggle for 15 months. Luckily, everything worked out."
She reopened Latinos Market as Takote in December 2018. In addition to the restaurant, the market offers dry goods, candies, chips, drinks and sodas, many of the products imported from Mexico.
"Since I was a kid, I have had a passion for business," Guerrero said. "I try to make everybody feel comfortable and to give people what they want."

Pro-Trump Donation Contested

Texto completo: A campaign finance watchdog group filed a complaint on Tuesday against a Canadian billionaire alleging that he violated a federal ban on contributions by foreigners when his United States-based company donated $ 1.75 million last year to a political committee supporting President Trump's agenda.
The complaint was filed by the watchdog group, the Campaign Legal Center, with the Federal Election Commission against Barry Zekelman, the chief executive of Zekelman Industries, North America's largest steel tube manufacturer. Mr. Zekelman has pushed the Trump administration to take steps that help block the import to the United States of steel tube made by his competitors.
Mr. Zekelman, whose efforts to influence federal policy on steel tariffs was detailed in a story in The New York Times, was invited to a dinner with Mr. Trump at the Trump International Hotel in April 2018, after the first contribution to the Trump-affiliated committee, America First Action Super PAC, for $ 1 million.
Two more contributions -- first for an additional $ 250,000 and then $ 500,000 more -- followed during 2018, making Zekelman Industries one of the single biggest contributors to Mr. Trump's political causes.
The contribution was made by Wheatland Tube LLC, a Chicago-based company that is owned entirely by Zekelman Industries, which Mr. Zekelman and his two brothers control. Mickey McNamara, general counsel at Zekelman Industries and president of Wheatland Tube, declined to comment on Tuesday about the Campaign Legal Center's filing.
The Federal Election Commission will review the complaint and decide if it wants to investigate the matter.
Federal law prohibits contributions by foreigners to federal elections, including super PACs. The law says that a "foreign national shall not direct, dictate, control, or directly or indirectly participate in the decision-making process of any person."
Mr. Zekelman, in an interview last month, said that he left it to members of his corporate board, who are either United States citizens or legal residents, to decide on the donations. But he also said that he spoke with Zekelman Industries's general counsel about the matter before the decision was made.
"They contacted our people, our people brought it to me. I said, great, I would love to find a way to support him," Mr. Zekelman said in the interview.
Mr. McNamara, the general counsel at Zekelman, said in a separate, subsequent interview that Mr. Zekelman did not play a role in the decision and that the company had complied with the law.
But Brendan Fischer, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center, said that there is sufficient evidence to suspect that Mr. Zekelman did participate in a way that violated federal law.
"Foreign nations have no right to interfere in U.S. elections and certainly do not have the right to buy the policies that benefit them," Mr. Fischer said Tuesday.
Campaign Legal Center was founded and is still led by a Republican former member of the Federal Election Commission, Trevor Potter. Over the years, it has filed complaints against individuals who have donated to both Republicans and Democrats.
Mr. Fischer said he did not file the complaint against America First -- which was created in 2017 by veterans of Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign -- because he does not have evidence that the organization knew that Mr. Zekelman might have been involved in the donation effort.
America First declined to comment on Tuesday. Kelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for America First, had said earlier that the super PAC had confirmed that Mr. McNamara's name was on the donation document, and that Mr. McNamara is an American citizen.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Crenshaw breaks with Trump on Navy SEAL case: Gallagher should face trial before any war crimes pardon

Texto completo: Freshman Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, says service members who have been accused of war crimes should undergo a war crimes trial before being pardoned by President Trump.
Trump is reportedly weighing pardons on or around Memorial Day for multiple members of the military accused or convicted of war crimes, according to the New York Times. Crenshaw said these pardons should wait until the courts decide the cases.
“These cases should be decided by the courts, where the entirety of the evidence can be viewed,” Crenshaw said in a statement to National Review. “Only after that should a pardon be considered.”
U.S. officials told the Times that the White House made expedited requests to obtain necessary paperwork to pardon service members including Navy SEAL Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, who was charged with shooting unarmed civilians and killing an enemy captive with a knife during a deployment in Iraq.
The officials suspect that among the others who may be pardoned include Army Green Beret Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, who was charged with premeditated murder after he allegedly told the CIA he killed a suspected Taliban bombmaker in 2010. The officials have not seen a final list.
Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., a former Air Force judge advocate general, agreed that military jurors needed to weigh in on the cases before pardons were issued.
“As a former active duty JAG, I know the main purpose of the UCMJ is to impose good order & discipline, which Washington called the soul of an army,” Lieu tweeted. “The charges against Gallagher are deadly serious. @POTUS should not circumvent the court-martial process. Let military jurors decide.”
Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., cast doubt on whether the Navy could conduct a fair trial given the coverage of the case.
“I don’t trust the Navy to give him a fair trial, but I think with all of the focus on this case that he stands more of a chance of getting a fair trial now,” Hunter, who was indicted on federal corruption charges last year, told the Associated Press. Hunter and his wife pleaded not guilty to a 60-count indictment accusing them of misusing campaign funds.
Earlier this month Trump pardoned former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna, who was convicted of murdering an Iraqi prisoner while he was deployed to Iraq in 2007.

Texto completo: La fiscal general del estado Nueva York, Letitia James, y el alcalde de NYC Bill de Blasio, ordenaron ayer la apertura de dos investigaciones sobre “prácticas depredadoras” y presuntas estafas por la financiación irregular a taxistas para la compra de licencias a precios exagerados.
La fiscalía estatal dijo en primer lugar que había abierto una investigación sobre más de una década de prácticas de préstamos que dejaron a miles de taxistas inmigrantes arruinados por las deudas. Y el alcalde ordenó una investigación por separado de los corredores que ayudaron a organizar los préstamos.
Estas investigaciones se producen después de que el diario The New York Times reveló que un puñado de líderes de la industria del taxi inflaba artificialmente el precio del denominado medallón, el codiciado permiso que permite a un conductor poseer y operar un taxi; y facturaron cientos de millones de dólares a costa de la emisión de préstamos a compradores de bajos ingresos.
La investigación también encontró que los reguladores en todos los niveles del gobierno local ignoraron las señales de advertencia, y la ciudad incluso alimentó una desmesurada venta de medallones promocionándolos en anuncios como algo que era “mejor que el mercado de valores”.
El alcalde De Blasio, en plena campaña por las primarias Demócratas, reaccionó rápidamente ayer y emitió un comunicado: “Ordené una investigación conjunta por parte de la Comisión de Taxis y Limusinas (TLC), el Departamento de Finanzas y el Departamento de Asuntos del Consumidor sobre las prácticas depredadoras de los corredores en la industria de los taxis”.
“Una revisión en 45 días identificará y penalizará a los corredores que se hayan aprovechado de compradores y engañado a las autoridades de la ciudad, y establecerá nuevas reglas estrictas que impidan las prácticas de corredores que perjudican a los conductores”, añadió De Blasio.
Para el alcalde, “es inaceptable aprovecharse de los neoyorquinos que trabajan arduamente para apoyar a sus familias y haremos todo lo posible para ponerle fin”.
La información de The New York Times ha causado revuelo entre dirigentes Demócratas de la Asamblea estatal, el ayuntamiento de Nueva York y del gobernador Andrew Cuomo , muchos de ellos críticos con De Blasio.
Our office is beginning an inquiry into the disturbing reports regarding the lending and business practices that may have created the taxi medallion crisis in New York City.
These allegations are serious and must be thoroughly scrutinized.

Texto completo: In the years since World War II broke out in Europe and President Franklin Roosevelt foreshadowed support for France and England in a radio fireside chat, presidents have spoken to the American people at length about conflicts threatening to involve the nation.
As tensions rise precipitously between the United States and Iran — with bombers set on hair trigger alert and naval battle groups on the move — that’s not what we’re getting from President Donald Trump. Standing in the front door of the White House last week he blurted out, “I hope not,” to a reporter’s shouted question about the prospect of war with Iran.
Then on Sunday, he seemed to contradict that sentiment in a tweet, “If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!”
As tightening sanctions cripple the Persian Gulf nation, an American carrier group is rushed to the region and nonemergency personnel are evacuated from the U. S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U. S. Consulate in Erbil — a step not taken even when Islamic State terrorists were rampaging across Iraq in 2014 — Trump needs to explain what he is trying to achieve.
The commander in chief is preparing the military for the outbreak of violence, but he’s not fulfilling his role in preparing the public. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford will brief the House of Representatives in a secure auditorium. The New York Times reports that military officials expect Middle East commanders to ask for a fresh wave of American forces to deter Iran.
The White House and the Pentagon say the moves are a response to intelligence that Iran is planning attacks on U. S. troops in the region. But this conflicts with threat assessments by allies.
OPPOSING VIEW: Donald Trump replaces Barack Obama’s mirage with containment
Beyond this immediate urgency, confusion persists about the broader endgame behind the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions, levied against Iran ever since Washington last year withdrew from a 2015 agreement that was successfully containing Tehran’s nuclear program.
Now Iran threatens to resume stockpiling enriched uranium that could be the precursor to a nuclear warhead.
There’s no question Iran is a bad actor in the Middle East, growing its ballistic missile program and using proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen to provoke violence and instability. But how Trump intends to change this is not at all clear.
The sanctions are aimed at making Iran “conform to the normal things that normal nations do,” Pompeo said this month. But he clearly doesn’t believe this himself. “I just don’t see it,” the secretary of State said earlier about Iran moderating its behavior.
And Trump’s other leading foreign policy consultant, national security adviser John Bolton, has made a career out of advocating force against Iran.
Is regime change the goal? This hasn’t worked in Venezuela, where a weaker dictator with a devastated economy still resists U. S. -led efforts to install a new government. And Iran has resisted U. S. efforts to moderate its behavior for 40 years.
Trump, who relishes summitry, has repeatedly offered to meet with Iranian leaders and cut a “deal” to curb their behavior and accept tougher nuclear restrictions. Tehran has thus far shown zero interest.
Trump has long promised to avoid foreign entanglements and has told the Pentagon that his wish is no war with Iran. Then why did he hire Bolton?
And what is the plan? Soundbites shouted at reporters and belligerent tweets can’t convey to Americans the risks Iran poses and what the United States is compelled to do about it.
If there is to be a face-off that includes the prospect of a wider conflict, President Trump owes it to the American people to speak before the saber rattling becomes a sobering reality.

Movers damaged her grandmother's vintage piano, and she's fighting to get it repaired

Texto completo: When Alanna Ludley was looking for a company to move her belongings — including her grandmother's heirloom piano — from Abington to Hanover last fall, she found Monster Movers, which agreed to do the job for about $1,000.
Ludley asked for four men to handle the 1,000-pound piano, but Monster Movers sent only two. Though they were “very nice and respectful," the job was apparently too much for them. During the move, the upright piano sustained a deep gash at its base.
Initially, the company accepted responsibility and agreed to pay to restore the piano.
But then it ghosted her.
Ludley repeatedly called and e-mailed but got no response.
Finally, Ludley warned that unless the company immediately got in touch with her, she would file a complaint in small claims court.
Still no response.
So Ludley sued the company on Dec. 12, using in her complaint the office address in Marlborough that the company listed prominently in its e-mails with her.
What Ludley didn't realize at the time was that Monster Movers had moved out of its Marlborough office, which, intentionally or not, deprived her of the valid address she needed to collect about $600 to pay for the repair and her court filing cost.
Ludley would soon discover that the company's official corporate filing with the Massachusetts secretary of state's office gave an address in Boylston that is even more out of date than the one in Marlborough. (The company's listing with the state Department of Public Utilities, which regulates the moving industry, is also out of date.)
Later, Ludley found five more addresses for Monster Movers. She did online research, made telephone calls to abutters, and drove by some of the locations; Monster Movers was at none of them.
At a hearing in Hingham District Court on Feb. 15, Ludley received a judgment in her favor, and at a later, second hearing, was granted an “execution on money judgment" that allowed her to hire a sheriff's deputy to demand payment.
But where could the demand for payment be delivered? Two sheriffs' offices she contacted understandably expressed reluctance to take the job without a verified address.
“I had no idea what to do at that point," said Ludley, 51, a registered nurse. “I was just completely stuck."
Ludley came to me in frustration. I'm a big proponent of consumers using small claims court to redress losses in business disputes, having once won a case there myself. (The defendant in my case was an auto dealership, so there was no question where to find him; I also once obtained a settlement on the basis of threatening to take a retailer to small claims court.)
But winning a judgment is no good if you can't get it enforced.
I began my efforts by retracing Ludley's steps but with better luck. When I called the telephone number listed on the company's website saying I needed an address to send a lawsuit, I was given one different from the seven on Ludley's list. That sent me down a winding dirt road in Weymouth, where I found the company's name in tiny lettering on a dilapidated shed. I knocked, but no one answered.
I then left a detailed message for William Antonelli, the company president. He called me back and told me of a personal crisis that had sent his company into a monthslong tailspin.
He promised to pay Ludley. But, just to be safe, I suggested to Ludley that she hire a sheriff's deputy to follow my steps down that dirt road with an official demand for payment.
That stain against Alamo
It certainly sounded silly to me when Alamo Rent a Car claimed something that seems exceedingly improbable: that a customer actually decided to get her rented vehicle washed, during which Alamo claims it was damaged. The company made its claim to explain how the car had supposedly become stained with chemicals, for which it charged the two customers $1,075 in “repair costs."
The women, Caron Welch of Brewster and Robbin Wilson of Connecticut, insisted it was ridiculous to think they decided to get a rented car washed; furthermore, there were no chemical stains on the car when they returned it. They accused the company of trying to take advantage of them after Alamo accepted the returned vehicle without so much as a murmur about chemical stains.
Questioned by me, Alamo quickly agreed to return the money, which I included in my column a couple of weeks ago. But one reader pointed out to me after reading it that there's a saying in economics that goes something like this: “Never in the history of the world has anyone ever washed a rented car."
It's meant to be shorthand for the idea that people will only spend money to maintain property they own.
Larry Summers, the former Harvard president and US secretary of treasury, was once quoted in The New York Times saying it.
It makes me think even less of Alamo, if that's possible.

Trump predicts ‘Failing New York Times will pass away when I leave office’

Texto completo: President Trump slammed the New York Times again in a Monday morning Twitter blast for their story reporting about his business losses.
“The Failing New York Times (it will pass away when I leave office in 6 years), and others of the Fake News Media, keep writing phony stories about how I didn’t use many banks because they didn’t want to do business with me. WRONG! It is because I didn’t need money. Very old fashioned, but true. When you don’t need or want money, you don’t need or want banks,” Trump said. “Banks have always been available to me, they want to make money. Fake Media only says this to disparage, and always uses unnamed sources (because their sources don’t even exist).”
Tweet
“The Mainstream Media has never been as corrupt and deranged as it is today. FAKE NEWS is actually the biggest story of all and is the true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! That’s why they refuse to cover the REAL Russia Hoax. But the American people are wise to what is going on,” Trump added. “Now the new big story is that Trump made a lot of money and buys everything for cash, he doesn’t need banks. But where did he get all of that cash? Could it be Russia?”
Tweet
“No, I built a great business and don’t need banks, but if I did they would be there...and DeutscheBank was very good and highly professional to deal with - and if for any reason I didn’t like them, I would have gone elsewhere....there was always plenty of money around and banks to choose from. They would be very happy to take my money. Fake News!” Trump ended his early morning rant.
Tweet
Earlier this month, the New York Times obtained documents pertaining to Trump’s taxes from 1985 to 1994 showing the president had written off over $1 billion in business losses.
Trump responded initially to the piece, saying that he used “massive write offs and depreciation” which showed losses for “tax purposes.”
“Real estate developers in the 1980’s & 1990’s, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases. Much was non monetary. Sometimes considered “tax shelter,” you would get it by building, or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes,” Trump said. “[A]lmost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport. Additionally, the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!”
Tweet
Trump has admitted before that he had business troubles in the 90s which he later shook off to build a company that was “bigger than it ever was.”

'I didn’t need money': Trump fires off tweets at report Deutsche Bank staff saw suspicious activity

Texto completo: President Donald Trump fired off a series of tweets Monday after a report said anti-money laundering specialists with Deutsche Bank flagged transactions involving himself and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
But Trump did not address the suspicious activity in The New York Times report. Instead, he denied the article's assertion – which has been widely reported previously – that he borrowed from Deutsche Bank when other lenders were unwilling to give him money.
Software designed to identify illegal activity alerted the staff about the transactions, involving the now-shuttered Trump Foundation and business entities owned by Trump and Kushner, the Times reported Sunday, citing five current and former Deutsche Bank employees.
After reviewing the transactions, bank staff prepared to file suspicious activity reports to send to the Treasury Department. But the bank had issued loans worth billions of dollars to Trump and Kushner and bank executives directed the staff not to file the reports, according to the Times report.
"WRONG! It is because I didn’t need money," Trump said. "Very old fashioned, but true. "
"When you don't need or want money, you don't need or want banks. Banks have always been available to me, they want to make money. " Trump said Deutsche Bank was "very good and highly professional to deal with" but "if for any reason I didn't like them, I would have gone elsewhere. "
"There was always plenty of money around and banks to choose from. "
"This is not true," Times reporter David Enrich said on Twitter in response to Trump's tweets. "I have spent a long time looking into this, and @DeutscheBank was the only bank willing to lend to @realDonaldTrump for 20 years because of his pattern of defaults and the bank’s hunger for growth in the US. "
And despite his claims that he did not "need or want money," the president still owes the bank $300 million, according to The Associated Press. And in 2016, the bank lent $285 million to Kushner Companies affiliates.
Tammy McFadden, a former Deutsche Bank anti-money laundering specialist, told the Times that in 2016 she had reviewed transactions Kusnher and Russian individuals. She thought the activity should be reported to the federal government, in part because the bank had already been hit with fines for failing to report Russian money laundering.
Other employees told the Times that the bank's Special Investigations Unit, charged with looking into potential financial crimes, "produced multiple suspicious activity reports involving different entities that Mr. Trump owned or controlled. " At least one involved the Trump Foundation.
But the bank chose not to file the reports with the Treasury Department.
"You present them with everything, and you give them a recommendation, and nothing happens," McFadden told the Times. "It’s the D. B. way. They are prone to discounting everything. "
Deutsche Bank fired McFadden in April 2018 after being transferred for a lack of productivity. But she told the Times that the bank has "attempted to silence" her for asking too many questions about why Trump and other high-profile clients were not being more thoroughly vetted. Two unnamed former managers told the Times that they agreed that she was fired for speaking out.
Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Kerrie McHugh told the Times that "at no time was an investigator prevented from escalating activity identified as potentially suspicious.
"Furthermore, the suggestion that anyone was reassigned or fired in an effort to quash concerns relating to any client is categorically false," McHugh said.
Trump Organization spokeswoman Amanda Miller told the Times that they were unaware of any "flagged' transactions" with the bank.
"Any allegations regarding Deutsche Bank’s relationship with Kushner Companies which involved money laundering is completely made up and totally false. The New York Times continues to create dots that just don’t connect," Karen Zabarsky, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies told the Times.
Although the report did not specify that the transactions connected to Trump involved Russians, but Trump indicated he believed that was the implication.
"Now the new big story is that Trump made a lot of money and buys everything for cash, he doesn’t need banks," Trump tweeted. "But where did he get all of that cash? Could it be Russia? No, I built a great business and don’t need banks, but if I did they would be there. "
Trump and three of his children – Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump –have sued Deutsche Bank in an effort to block it from complying with a congressional subpoena for the family's financial records.
Deutsche Bank has been hit with several fines by regulators in the U. S. and Europe in recent years. In 2015, the bank was fined $258 million for violating sanctions on Iran and other blacklisted nations. In 2017, it finalized a deal to pay $7. 2 billion for misleading investors about mortgage securities and the same year it was hit with $630 million in fines in connection with a Russian money laundering scheme.

Texto completo: My old friend Clarinda signs her e-mails "Hugs, Cl," which I think is a warm and friendly way of closing a letter to people we especially like good friends, specific co-workers, special neighbors - people with whom we have a positive and informal relationship. Since imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery, I have taken to signing many of my e-mails the same way.
Nevertheless, shortly before former Vice President Joe Biden announced his candidacy for president in 2020, two women came forward, claiming that Mr. Biden touched them in the past - on their head, on their shoulder - "invading their personal space," and they were angry! Other women came forward, explaining that Mr. Biden's touching them, hugging them, was comforting and supportive.
On "PBS News Hour," New York Times columnist David Brooks staunchly defended Mr. Biden, saying critics were "trying to impute his character on this. They're trying to insult the dignity and the intention which he goes about his life. And I think it's completely unfair." Mr. Brooks recounted a story of when he was a young reporter on Capital Hill and many Congress members used to touch him - "just put their arms on my shoulders and talk to me." He admitted he was initially taken aback because he was from a different generation and social class than they were, but eventually, he began to see the physicality as "a sign of connection and respect. ... They were really trying to meet me as a person."
Since then, Mr. Biden released a video saying he recognized that "the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset," and he's been noticeably arms-length on the campaign trail - causing one woman in Nevada to holler out "You can hug and kiss me anytime, Joe," at an event earlier this month.
Who knew a hug could cause such an uproar?
Another example of hugging that different sides see as negative or positive is the term "tree hugger," first used, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, in 1965. Its definition: "an environmentalist, an advocate of the preservation of woodlands." Many people, environmentalists, that is, believe in preserving trees and forests, and they enthusiastically espouse the term. However, others, especially developers, would rather cut down trees to build houses, commercial buildings, highways and so on; to them, "tree hugger" is pejorative.
What about the many studies that have proven time and again that infants who are not held closely, hugged and stroked, have trouble developing normally? This early contact promotes healthy psychological and physical development whereas babies not hugged have higher rates of illness and are less likely to thrive.
Further studies show that children as well as adults, especially when faced with stressful situations or actual trauma, benefit greatly from hugs.
Let's not confuse sexual assault with signs of friendship. What is lovelier than seeing an adult and a child holding hands or hugging - or a senior couple holding hands or hugging? Greeting someone you know with a warm encouraging hug is priceless.
As David Brooks said on PBS News Hour: "It wasn't a sexual thing. It was a connection thing."

Texto completo: You’d be hard pressed to find another emotion more responsible than fear for the sour tone of politics and culture today.
So wrote David Brooks in a recent column for the New York Times, saying: “I wonder if we’ve fully grasped how fear pervades our society and sets the emotional tone for our politics. When historians define this era they may well see it above all else as a time defined by fear.” Brooks is right. For many, this started with Sept. 11, before waves of paranoia about shootings, war, crime, cultural change, immigration, climate change, automation, and job displacement. For every fear, there is a politician, media personality, or website there to assure you that your fear is warranted and even righteous. “All we have to fear is fear itself" — aspirational words from President Franklin D. Roosevelt and ones we need to rediscover, lest we let our fear lead us to an even darker place than we currently stand.
Don’t care for FDR? Perhaps Master Yoda is more your speed.
On Sunday, "Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace" turns 20 years old. It’s as good a time as any to reflect on the central warning of the "Star Wars" saga, which technically begins with this 1999 film.
The story of "Star Wars" is set into motion by a young Anakin Skywalker being rescued from slavery to study to become a Jedi. From the beginning, it was doomed to failure. Standing before Mace Windu, Yoda, and the Jedi Council, this young boy was not fit to be a Jedi. They sensed “great fear in him,” and they were right. From Anakin to Luke, and arguably Ben Solo, fear pervades the saga as the single greatest threat to personal and societal peace.
The boy we all knew would become Darth Vader was incapable of controlling his fear and the nagging sense that certain things were out of his control. Relationships, family, work, and status in his life as a Jedi were not things Anakin ever felt comfortable leaving to chance. Yoda knew the risk when he said to Anakin in their first meeting, “Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.” Brooks points out this very same idea in his column, citing Martha Nussbaum, writing that anger is the child of fear. It breeds antisocial attitudes and a capacity for cruelty when it comes to solving social problems.
In a moment of panic about his own growing weakness, Anakin spoke to Yoda about his struggle with dreams of his loved ones dying. Yoda’s response is one of the most important lessons of "Star Wars": “Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.” Obviously, this was not acceptable to Anakin Skywalker. Yoda’s wisdom would also fall on deaf ears with Anakin’s son, Luke, when he too faced visions of those he loved being in peril. Luke only lost a hand when he tried to impose order on the chaos that tormented him; his father lost everything and subsequently projected his pain back onto the galaxy. Fear, unchecked and unchallenged, can indeed lead to great suffering.
In case you haven’t noticed, the rhetoric in politics today is tinged with apocalyptic urgency. If you’re not afraid, you’re accused of indifference or being slow. Even the supposed champions of social harmony who wave signs saying “love trumps hate” subscribe to their own culture of fear, anger, and hatred.
It’s tough to identify at times. Fearmongers can be insidious, and their greatest tool is feigning compassion and validation for a certain audience. You might recall how Palpatine lured Anakin into his grip, by telling him all his suspicions, resentments, and fears were justified and true. It’s why teenagers so often try out risky behavior and new friends. In the height of that angst-ridden period they seek peers telling them they are right and everyone else (parents) just don’t understand.
How many 2020 candidates do you see running for office by telling folks how good they have it in the grand scheme of things? Who could ever win an election by preaching the true story of human progress, wealth, and reminding people that they lived in the physically safest time in known history? No one.
Such a candidate could not win office. This is really just human nature. No one likes to be reminded to be more grateful and calm, even if it’s what they need. That’s not what politics is really for, anyways. Church, faith, community, and family are more able to appeal to that higher self, and sadly, all those arenas have weakened and allowed politics to fill the void.
Now fear is the mood of the day and has been for just shy of 20 years, just as the second "Star Wars" trilogy, with the clearest warnings about fear, is concluding. In the sequence of Yoda’s warning to Anakin, we may well be in the days of hate, corrupted by nonstop waves of fear and appeals to our anger.
"Star Wars" couldn’t be more clear about the path we’re on, and it will end in great suffering, for some, for many, or for us all.

Texto completo: Oakland author Robin Sloan, 39, didn't let Twitter limit his creativity to 140 characters. After stints there and at Current TV, he used Silicon Valley as the setting for his debut novel, "Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore"  and the 304-page work landed on the New York Times best-seller list. His second novel, "Sourdough, or Lois and Her Adventures in the Underground Market," finds his protagonist at the intersection of technology and food culture. It's now out in paperback.
Q Your writing is concise and clever. Did your time at Twitter alter your writing style?
A Definitely! In its heyday, before the character limit was relaxed, Twitter's limitations made it an ideal training ground. A poetry factory.
Q How do Silicon Valley techies respond to your portrayals of them and their world?
A Generally, the reception has been warm. I think satire  good satire  has to be grounded in affection. When our friends make fun of us in a way that says "I know you deeply," it's not unpleasant. It's the opposite a form of love!
Q Where does the inspiration for your protagonists and plots come from?
A My protagonists are all me, or a version of me. The plots come straight out of the Bay Area's natural weirdness and drama, its fusion of technology and craft, wealth and counterculture ... all of it. This place is thick with people who seem like characters out of novels, so I just do the obvious thing and write them in.
W You now produce olive oil in Sunol. How did that get started?
A My partner, Kathryn Tomajan, is an olive miller, and through her work, we were given the rare opportunity to lease a very small grove. So that's become our shared project.
Q So can we expect your next book to be "Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Olive Oil Mill" or "Lois and Her Adventures Dipping Sourdough in EVOO?" Seriously, what's next?
A I'm working on a new novel that's closer to real science fiction than anything I've written before  a story that makes some predictions about the future of California. But, like all my novels, it takes place in a shared universe, so readers can expect to see some familiar characters.
Q Do you have a favorite Bay Area book-related event?
A I'm partial to the deeply weird and wonderful readings organized by City Lights in San Francisco. You can walk up the steps to the Poetry Room and encounter conversations that could happen literally nowhere else.

Med-tech firm makes risky bet on crowd equity

Texto completo: Maybe no one really said equity crowdfunding would one day be bigger than going public on Nasdaq, but whatever the expectation when equity crowdfunding launched a few years ago, the reality has to be disappointing for its champions.
That's what makes VivaQuant -- a medical device maker based in Shoreview now looking to the crowd for equity capital -- a story worth following.
VivaQuant is not anything like the dozen or so Minnesota businesses that have sought funding directly from small investors in the last few years, a list dominated by small craft brewers. VivaQuant doesn't aspire to be a successful small business.
So it is hard to know what somebody with no experience in medical devices and $50,000 to invest would make of VivaQuant. But it is easy to imagine med-tech pros and even venture capitalists giving it a look. It has an experienced team, a big market for wearable health monitoring to get into and what sure looks like a promising solution to a real problem.
And the people involved knew about venture capital, too. They certainly knew it well enough to make a convincing case for passing.
VivaQuant is still small, but the work has been going on since 2009, started by Marina Brockway. She has degrees in math, physiology and business, and experience working with electric signal processing algorithms including with medical device maker Boston Scientific.
The problem VivaQuant plans to solve is in the well-established market of monitoring patients for heart-rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation. What's used are devices roughly the size of a chubby smartphone, with wires spreading out on the torso of a patient with a potential cardiac rhythm problem.
The patient wears this device around when going through the day, and it captures information as episodes occur. One challenge is getting the electrical signal data from the heart amid all the electrical noise around a patient, which also can get recorded, explained Arjun Sharma, a cardiac
electrophysiologist and adviser to the company.
Monitoring center staff can clean up a recording, but it can take a lot of work and false positives also could result. Some segments of the recording might not be usable at all. One solution to all of this is the signal-processing technology developed by VivaQuant that leaves only the electrical signals from the heart.
VivaQuant's technology has been used in drug-research settings, both as a way for the company to pay some bills and gain more experience with its technology. Company CEO Brian Brockway, Marina Brockway's husband, said the device is now in a limited launch with a full launch later this year. The company has been funded so far with about $1.3 million of friends and family investments along with about $1.7 million in research grants.
Among the people Brian Brockway met as they considered options for additional capital was Zach Robins, of the Messerli Kramer law firm in Minneapolis. He has been a high-profile advocate for equity crowdfunding, before and after the 2015 legislation that enabled it in the state. He has since signed on as the company's counsel.
Crowdfunding can include consumer campaigns on sites like Kickstarter, but equity crowdfunding means for-profit companies get to seek investors among the public over internet sites.
Despite some successes, there are plenty of signs that the idea has had trouble taking off. The managers of the offerings were called "portals" through which the crowd found opportunities, and only one portal now seems active in the state.
Robins said, like everything, how you judge progress depends on what expectation you had three or four years ago. He still sounds optimistic, as the capital-raising challenge crowdfunding was meant to help meet hasn't gotten any easier. It has not been practical for a long time to sell shares in an initial public offering to individual investors with nothing but a business plan, the way St. Jude Medical did back in the late 1970s.
Brian Brockway seemed to have learned some of what he knows about capital raising the hard way. He founded a company that was bought in a successful exit, but he also was a CEO who tried and failed to go public in 2008.
Brockway has experience with venture capital, too, and last week he slid a copy of a New York Times article across the table that described why company founders increasingly reject the whole idea of seeking venture money. One understanding and supportive venture investor was quoted in the article, yet he still managed to come across as a person you wouldn't want to meet, saying how he sold "jet fuel," and "some people don't want to build a jet."
The VivaQuant team suspects venture investors will simply want more than seems fair, like preference shares and other terms that let them get paid first.
"I've seen situations where venture capital has come in … and the common shareholders who have worked years and years to build value in the company don't get a lot of money out of the deal when the liquidity event occurs," Brian Brockway said.
The plan, based on the company's offering pitch, is selling enough common stock to reach its target of $500,000 raised from the crowd. If the deal goes well and raises $1 million, the limit of what's allowed, the new investors would get about 7% of the company, valuing the business at $15 million before the investment.
Neither Brian Brockway or crowdfunding champion Robins quite put it this way, but if VivaQuant were based in Iowa this crowdfunding notion probably wouldn't be tried. It seems to work only when the crowd has a real affinity for what's being sold, such as beer, or maybe even knows the people involved.
But what they are counting on here in Minnesota are the employees or investors in Medtronic, local operations now part of Boston Scientific, St. Jude Medical and other medical device success stories.
"There's a lot of civic pride in Minnesota, a lot of people here who made money in the med-tech arena and know what it's like to get into an early stage company," Brian Brockway said. "And the kind of returns they can get."

Texto completo: Los expertos contra el lavado de dinero en Deutsche Bank recomendaron en 2016 y 2017 que las múltiples transacciones de Donald Trump y su yerno, Jared Kushner , se informaran a un funcionario federal sobre delitos financieros.
Las transacciones, algunas de las cuales involucraron a la ya desaparecida Fundación Trump , activaron alertas en un sistema informático diseñado para detectar actividad ilícita, según cinco empleados actuales y antiguos del banco, reportó el The New York Times.
Según el diario neoyorquino, de todas las transacciones involucradas se haría un reporte para la unidad especializada del Departamento del Tesoro , pero dichos análisis nunca fueron enviados.
Partel del personal involucrado en el proceso afirmó que revisó las transacciones, hizo los informes de actividades sospechosas, pero los ejecutivos de Deutsche Bank, no reportaron los actos ocurridos durante los años de campaña, de transición de gobierno y el primer año de la Administración Trump.
Entre las actividades sospechosas se reportan grandes cantidades de en efectivo depositado por entidades o personas extranjeras, una práctica común entre desarrolladores inmobiliarios, como el presidente Trump y el esposo de Ivanka Trump , pero que al mismo tiempo desatan suspicacias sobre lavado de dinero.
El reporte del Times indica que las transacciones del mandatario y su yerno no necesariamente son “actos criminales”, pero la falta de reportes ante el Gobierno desatan todo tipo de dudas, sobre todo porque el presidente Trump se ha negado a dar a conocer sus informes de impuestos.

Texto completo: When Scott Morris started working for the utility, it was called Washington Water Power.
What if - upon the occasion of his retirement as head honcho - the utility decided to return to that fine name? The name that is a part of the city skyline? The name that lived for a century in the Northwest?
The name that has an actual, you know, meaning?
We should not hope for this, of course. It's roughly as likely as Avista deciding to revolutionize executive pay and start compensating bigwigs with sub-million-dollar packages - leading the charge to create a new generation of non-millionaire corporate leaders.
It would be an admirable, honorable move, but Avista is no more likely to take that untraveled road than any other large organization. Continually widening the canyon between queen bee and worker bee is so intrinsic to the hive these days that anything else seems impossible.
And so it is with this wordlike collection of letters, Avista. The utility spent a lot of time and money splashing it all over town and country, based upon presumably expensive advice from "branding experts" about how valuable it is to build a "marketing identity" with unique, wordlike collections of letters. It's not going away.
But in the 20 years since the utility trashcanned its fine, descriptive, utilitarian, century-old name, Avista has become more familiar without improving a lick, in my mind. Meanwhile, the use of invented words as corporate names has become a plague on the linguistic landscape.
The name switch occurred in 1999, and for the usual range of reasons: The utility was growing and changing, engaged in a wider range of activities than simply water power, and doing so in a greater number of places than just Washington. There was a lot of branding talk about the new name - about creating a "national identity," about choosing a name that would "endear" the utility to customers, about organizational evolution.
The utility itself, on its website, acknowledges the change was not immediately popular.
"The company admitted that 'the new name took some getting used to,' and The Spokesman-Review made fun of it mercilessly, saying that 'it sounds like a bad Dean Martin hit,' " the company history says, citing the words of my friend, the not-remotely-merciless former S-R columnist Jim Kershner.
"Yet the name Avista took hold and before long the only remaining vestige of the old name could be found in lights atop the iconic 1909 Post Street Substation."
That's one hell of a vestige remaining. It's the all-caps, bright-green vestige of the better alternative to a bad decision, floating above the river that originally gave the utility both its water and its power. It's a steak hovering before us while we eat our wilted salad.
The move away from the concrete is a style of business-world naming that is ubiquitous and ineradicable - verbal bedbugs in the national mattress. There is an entire industry built upon helping companies come up with names, and increasingly they come up with names that, like erectile-dysfunction drugs or car models, seem built of language that didn't make the cut for the Elvish songs in a Tolkein novel.
Upouria. Finivi. Brillium. These are some of the company names listed on the website of Tungsten Branding, a firm that specializes in naming companies. Tungsten also comes up with other kinds of names, and some very fine ones - such as Bagster, the Dumpster in a Bag - but the invented-word style of name is prominent throughout its client list. Lumagent. Rivion. Wellmara.
Tungsten is no doubt very good at what it does and the companies it names are likely fine, upstanding businesses, firms that do a good job doing whatever it is you can't tell that they do from their names. As Avista does.
This isn't about that. It's about the proliferation of the "Upourian" language in the public sphere. The move away from the descriptive, the historical and the local, to the place-less, the function-less, the history-free. It's the direction the Inland Northwest Community Foundation - a local charity with a long history of positive work in the community - took when it changed its name to the Innovia Foundation.
In 2015, the New York Times profiled a prominent San Francisco "namer," Anthony Shore. He's a linguistics expert who works with companies to develop monikers that will catch on in the public sphere. Many of the names he came up with are notable for their language-like cleverness - their pop! their zing! - and their utter absence of meaning.
Enormo. Spontania. Zact. He also came up with other names, less nonsensy ones. His names are often very good, and when the nonsensy ones catch on, they do become unique identifiers for the companies in question. But for names that don't become well-known and rise above their meaninglessness, they remain nonsensical and opaque. The search for a unique name - a Cher of a name, a Google of a name - is leading us down a silly path.
When the name Avista entered the local language two decades ago, it was a canary in this particular coal mine. It has aged poorly; imagine it in lights, hovering over the river. We should be thankful that there, at least, its big brother is still in place.

Sen. Booker's misleading claim that toy guns are more regulated than real ones

Texto completo: "Most people don't know that consumer product safety literally - one industry that's been exempted is the gun lobby. So we have different regulations for toy guns and no regulations for the weapons on our streets that are killing so many people."
- Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), interview on CNN, May 6
"In the US we have more federal regulation over toy guns than real ones"
- Booker, in a tweet, May 7
"Nowadays, there is more regulation over toy guns than real ones. While medicine, children's toys, and any number of other consumer products are subject to regulation by the federal government, firearms are exempt. In other words, gun manufacturers have little incentive to make their products safer. Cory will work to close this loophole in federal oversight and allow the Consumer Product Safety Commission to ensure gun safety by making safety warnings and issuing recalls for faulty firearms."
- Booker, in a Medium post, May 6

These are three examples of a catchy talking point from the 2020 presidential hopeful - that toy guns are subject to more regulation than real guns. The Medium post is rather specific: The Consumer Product Safety Commission, because of a "loophole," does not assess the safety of guns. But in television interviews and tweets, that nuanced point gets turned into misleading shorthand - there is "more federal regulation" of toy guns, or there are "no regulations" for guns.
Booker's point is not particularly original. Gun-control advocates have been calling for consumer safety oversight of guns for decades. But he veers off course when he compares regulatory oversight of guns and toy guns.
The Facts The website of the CPSC is clear. It oversees the safety of many products, but other agencies are in charge of certain products: "We have jurisdiction over thousands of types of consumer products, from coffee makers to toys to lawn mowers. Some types of products, however, are covered by other federal agencies. For example, cars, trucks and motorcycles are covered by the Department of Transportation; food, drugs and cosmetics are covered by the Food and Drug Administration; and alcohol, tobacco and firearms are within the jurisdiction of the Department of the Treasury."
Although the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is referenced here, a funny thing happens when you click the link that takes you to the page with a list of federal agencies with safety oversight of other products. Guns and ATF are not listed.
Booker's staff says that's the gap the senator is trying to highlight: No federal agency is charged with ensuring a safe design for guns. The Consumer Product Safety Commission Improvements Act of 1976 explicitly said the agency would not have this role: "The Consumer Product Safety Commission shall make no ruling or order that restricts the manufacture or sale of firearms, firearms ammunition, or components of firearms ammunition, including black powder or gunpowder for firearms."
But there are clearly many laws and regulations governing the sale, distribution and use of guns. For instance, federal law bans civilian ownership of machine guns that were not registered before May 1986. (The Fact Checker in 2013 debunked a common claim that there are 20,000 laws governing firearms, determining that there are about 300 federal statues that do so.)
ATF implements gun laws passed by Congress, and sometimes the laws are reinterpreted from a safety or design perspective. Last year, ATF banned bump stocks, for example, saying they fell within the definition of a machine gun under the law.
Jon S. Vernick, who in 2000 co-wrote a University of Pennsylvania law review article calling for a public health approach to firearms oversight, said Booker is correct that no federal agency has authority to regulate the safe design of firearms.
"The ATF has extremely narrow authority regarding firearm design," he said. "In particular, firearms may only be imported if ATF determines that they are 'generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes' (known as the sporting purposes test)."
Still, firearms, like all consumer products, are liable for lawsuits if their products malfunction. (Federal law, however, protects gun manufacturers and dealers from being held liable when crimes have been committed with their products.) Remington, for instance, settled a lawsuit last year from owners who claimed that a defective trigger mechanism allowed the gun to be fired without the trigger being pulled. There are also voluntary industry standards.
The gun industry vigorously disputes Booker's statement that there is "more regulation" over toy guns.
"Our industry is the most heavily regulated industry in the country. No other industry is regulated at the federal, state and local level to the extent our industry is regulated, which include design and performance standards," said Mark Oliva, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association for firearms manufacturers. "The federal agencies that regulate the industry include ATF, FBI, State Department, Commerce Department, IRS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. No other consumer product requires the licensed dealer to conduct a criminal-background check on a prospective purchaser before they can sell the product. Firearm manufacturers can be sued for product defect claims, although such claims are exceedingly rare given that there are over 400 million firearms in civilian possession in the United States."
By contrast, there are no regulations governing the sale, distribution and ownership of toy guns, experts say. The main exception is a 1986 law that requires a blaze orange plug in the muzzle to distinguish toy guns from real guns. (Anecdotally, that's the first thing a kid pulls off when he or she gets a new toy gun.)
Gun rights advocates say that "consumer safety" is a Trojan horse for eventually banning guns. Several pointed to a New York Times opinion article written in 1999 by Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center, calling for health and safety regulation of guns and then noting: "Any rational regulator with that authority would ban handguns." The VPC has long highlighted the fact that the CPSC cannot assess the safety of firearms.
"We don't want unelected bureaucrats to ban handguns," said David Kopel, research director at the Independence Institute, a libertarian think tank.
Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, said there appear to be relatively few cases of people being injured by defects in firearm design or manufacturing.
"My sense is, this is something that is not a material factor in the gun debate," he said. "Certain products are unsafe because of design. Others can be unsafe from misuse."
He places firearms in the latter category. He noted that more people die of alcohol abuse than from guns each year in the United States, including innocent third parties, "but you can't make whiskey safer."
Some states, such as Massachusetts and California, have imposed safety oversight over firearms. California requires that all new models of semiautomatic handguns stamp the handgun's serial number in two locations on each round of ammunition - which apparently is not possible. In effect, that has meant all pistol models created since May 2013 are prohibited from commercial sale in California.
An appeal of a ruling upholding the statute is pending before the Supreme Court. Volokh said he is unaware of any research showing whether state-level safety measures have been effective. Opponents of the California statute argue that, paradoxically, the law has meant Californians are unable to buy newer weapons with safety improvements, such as better ergonomics and reduced recoil.
Advocates of CPSC oversight say it will not lead to a ban, but to better collection of information about gun safety because the agency could analyze data relating to accidental deaths and injuries associated with them. That could also lead to better designs, such as preventing guns from firing when dropped. Moreover, recalls of clearly defective firearms could be accomplished more quickly than waiting for results from litigation. (These points were made in a 2016 blog post by then-CPSC Commissioner Marietta Robinson.)
The Pinocchio Test The Fact Checker obviously has no opinion on whether guns should face regulatory oversight for safety or design. But Booker's comparison of the regulations of toy guns and real guns is specious.
In the Medium post, he made clear that when he said "more regulation," he meant CPSC regulation, not all regulation. The careful language was probably just One or Two Pinocchios. But such nuances were lost when he spoke on television or tweeted about it, pushing himself into the Three Pinocchio range.
The CPSC does not regulate guns, but it does regulate toy guns. That does not mean there are "more regulations" of toy guns than real ones. Firearms, at just about every level, are highly regulated in the United States. Booker is calling for another level of regulation, but he can't suggest toy guns are even more highly regulated. He earns Three Pinocchios.

Tables turn on good Samaritan

Texto completo: The path to Teresa L. Todd's arrest began when three desperate Central American migrants waved frantically at her car on a Texas highway one night in February.
At least one other car had hurtled by, afraid to stop. But for Todd, compassion overrode any fear. "I'm a mom," explained Todd, who has two boys, ages 15 and 17. "And I see a young man who looked the same age and size as my younger son. And if my son was by the side of the road, I would want someone to help."
Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead." (Luke 10:30)
Todd, a single mom who works as a lawyer for a city and county in West Texas, found three siblings: two brothers ages 20 and 22 and their sister, Esmeralda, 18. To escape violence, they fled their native El Salvador years ago and recently Guatemala, where friends were murdered and a gang leader wanted to make Esmeralda his "girlfriend."
Esmeralda was suffering from starvation, dehydration and a potentially fatal syndrome called rhabdomyolysis that can lead to kidney failure. Seeing that Esmeralda was very sick, Todd invited the migrants into her car to warm up, and she began frantically texting friends (including one who is a lawyer for the Border Patrol) for advice about getting Esmeralda medical attention.
"A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side."
A sheriff's deputy pulled up behind Todd's car, lights flashing, and a Border Patrol officer arrived shortly afterward. The officers detained Todd for three hours, confiscating her possessions and keeping her in a holding cell.
By stopping to help a stranger, Todd may have saved a life - but this also got her arrested.
"It was totally surreal," Todd recalled. "Especially for doing what my parents taught me was right, and what I learned in church was right, which was helping people. So finding myself in a holding cell for that, it was hard to wrap my head around."
"But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine."
Esmeralda was hospitalized for four days, and she and her siblings are now in ICE custody. Todd has not been charged with a crime so far, but the authorities seem to have been considering a federal indictment. I reached out to federal and local officials for comment; they did not respond.
Todd told me that she has no regrets. "I think it's the right thing to help those in need," she explained. "That's what I learned from my parents. That's what I learned in church."
"Then he (the Samaritan) put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. Look after him,' he said, and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'"
The arrest of a mom who may have saved a life reflects the increasingly harsh treatment under President Donald Trump of anyone who tries to help migrants. In Arizona, a man named Scott Warren of the aid group No More Deaths/No Más Muertes, which leaves water, blankets and food for migrants, is to go on trial this month on felony charges that in theory carry terms of up to 20 years in prison. That's quite a penalty for trying to save the lives of fellow human beings, and others have been prosecuted for misdemeanor offenses.
"This is all about trying to chill the willingness of people to help others," Todd said. "A friend told me, The other day, someone tried to flag me down by the side of the road and waved an empty water bottle, and I thought about what happened to you and didn't stop.'"
"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?" The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."
Referring to Trump, Michele Bachmann, the former Republican congresswoman, recently said, "We will in all likelihood never see a more godly, biblical president again in our lifetimes."
"Whoever claims to love God but hates his brother or sister is a liar." (1 John 4:20)
I thanked Todd for her humanity, and for helping save a life. She said her assistance had been instinctive.
"I'm simply a mom who saw a child in need and pulled over to try to help," she said. "The whole time I was by the side of the road, I was thinking: What country am I in? This is not the United States."

Texto completo: Former Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum thinks Florida residents should know which counties Russia hacked.
"The governor of this state was informed and then signed a rather untraditional [nondisclosure agreement] apparently with the federal government saying that he would not share which counties in the state of Florida were impacted, and then you’ve had a number of those counties that have been surveyed that have said that they weren’t intruded upon," the Democrat said in a CNN interview Friday.
Russian agents gained access to voter registration information in two Florida counties in 2016, according to recent reports.
"The Russians know what they did, apparently the FBI has some indication of what was done, and the most important people who need to know, which are the voters of the state of Florida, are left in the dark. We don’t know if it was one county, two counties, more counties? Did they enter the system in 2016 and then leave the system in 2018?" he said.
"The Russians know how they hacked our elections," Gillum tweeted while sharing his interview.
Tweet
The New York Times reported the FBI has marked the information classified and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Republican who defeated former Tallahassee mayor Gillum in a hard-fought 2018 gubernatorial race, signed a nondisclosure agreement that prevents him from revealing the two counties. The FBI maintains there is no evidence that the Russian hackers altered any votes.

Texto completo: As people continue to complain about the current season of "Game of Thrones," consider redirecting your attention to another series: the 22nd season of "Arthur."
In the season premiere, which aired Monday, Arthur and the rest of his ageless classmates learn that their third-grade teacher, Nigel Ratburn, is getting married. Good for him!
The episode quickly gained traction online among grown "Arthur" fans, eliciting two major reactions: First, who among the non-parents knew PBS was still airing new episodes? But more importantly, fans joined the Lakewood Elementary kids in being pleasantly surprised by whom Mr. Ratburn had chosen to marry: an aardvark named Patrick.
The kids had worried that Mr. Ratburn, whom they had overheard talking about floral arrangements, was engaged to a bossy stranger named Patty. They spend several minutes of the show channeling their disappointment into playing matchmaker, only to discover at the wedding ceremony that Patty (voiced by Jane Lynch) isn't actually their teacher's fiance, but a sibling. Muffy squeaks the question on all of our minds: "If Patty's his sister, then who is Mr. Ratburn marrying?"
In comes the man of the hour, walking arm in arm with Patrick, a local chocolatier. Cut to the dance floor, where Buster approaches his friends with a plate of "the best cake I've ever had," a nod to Mr. Ratburn's famous love of the dessert.
After Arthur exclaims, "Mr. Ratburn is married! I still can't believe it," Francine responds that it's "a brand-new world." There is no explicit reference made to Patrick's gender, furthering the message of acceptance. GLAAD was among many who congratulated the beloved teacher on Twitter. Several users referred to him as a gay icon.
Mr. Ratburn and "the Special Someone," as Patrick is referred to in the episode's title, join a small group of LGBTQ figures to appear in the "Arthur" universe. In 2005, PBS pulled an episode of the spinoff "Postcards From Buster," which followed Arthur's rabbit friend as he visited cities across North America. Margaret Spellings, a secretary of education under former President George W. Bush, had denounced the episode featuring the children of two lesbians living in Vermont because, according to a New York Times article from the time, she believed many parents wouldn't want to "expose" their children to a same-sex couple.
"I am disappointed by PBS's decision," Marc Brown, author of the "Arthur" books and creator of both television series, said to the Times in a statement. He added that "Postcards From Buster" existed to "connect kids with other kids by reflecting their lives. In some episodes, as in the Vermont one, we are validating children who are seldom validated."
The only sense of discomfort in "Mr. Ratburn and the Special Someone" comes from Francine, and it has nothing to do with her teacher's choice of partner. She looks to the other end of the dance floor and says with wide eyes, "But there's one thing that teachers should never, ever do."
"What?" Buster asks.
"Dance," Francine responds, pointing to Mr. Ratburn and Patrick as they wow the crowd with their moves.

Politics Takes a Toll on the Family Business

Texto completo: When Donald J. Trump became president, he left his eldest sons in charge of his company, with a mandate to continue expanding the family's business and brand -- which they said at the time was "the hottest it has ever been."
Now, more than two years into his presidency, there is growing evidence that the Trump brand is cooling off.
The latest indication was in Mr. Trump's financial disclosure report, made public on Thursday, which showed that revenues across the president's businesses in 2018 were down about 4 percent from the previous year. Many of his biggest revenue generators, like his Doral resort and Washington hotel, had only tiny increases, while revenues from his famed club, Mar-a-Lago, dropped nearly 10 percent.
The New York Times dug through the numbers for clues about how Mr. Trump's businesses are faring just past the midway point of his term in office. Here are five takeaways.
The rest of the world once offered big growth opportunities. Not anymore.
As Mr. Trump was sailing toward the Republican nomination in 2016, he filed a financial disclosure report that showed how his company was eagerly expanding into foreign markets.
The report included new business ventures in Bali, Indonesia, as well as Jidda, Saudi Arabia, and Kolkata, India. His sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. were eagerly talking about even more potential targets, including projects in China and Israel.
Work is still moving ahead in some of the nations where the Trump family had signed deals as of the end of 2016, including residential towers in India.
But the huge global branding expansion that was underway has largely come to a halt because of a self-imposed prohibition on new foreign deals. And that is hurting the family business's pace of growth, the newest financial report shows.
Just a few years ago, the international projects were generally bringing in $ 1 million to $ 5 million a year in new revenue, like the Trump complexes in Istanbul and the Philippines.
Under these deals, the Trumps signed contracts with foreign developers to put the Trump name on high-end building projects, in return for a cut of their sales, while also in some cases hiring the Trump family to help manage the properties once they opened.
New golf course projects in Scotland and Ireland were also pushing up revenue numbers, in an even bigger way.
But no new projects have been added in the last two years, contributing to the flatness in overall revenue growth.
The Trump brand is hurting its remaining hotels
Ask hotel industry experts and they will tell you that the downtown Chicago market continues to grow, with a more than 5 percent increase last year in the revenue per room in the average hotel in the Chicago area.
But at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, the story was different. Management fees collected by Trump Chicago Hotel Manager L.L.C. dropped 5.7 percent last year. And the company confirmed that the average daily rate paid at the hotel declined last year.
Bill Hopping, a Colorado-based hotel industry consultant, said this disconnect between overall market trends in Chicago and Trump management fees strongly suggests that there is some kind of an outside factor affecting sales at the Trump hotel.
"Those are significant differences," he said, adding that there is a similar disconnect in Hawaii between the Trump family property and the overall market. "They are underperforming."
The Trump Organization says the Chicago business had a good year in 2018 and points to new hotels opening in the city creating intense competition, as well as headlines about crime in the city, as factors that might have depressed revenues at its Chicago property.
Mr. Trump often criticizes Chicago, a Democratic bastion, for its high crime rates.
The one major exception to the trend is the hotel in Washington, which in 2018 outperformed the industry average. The Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue pulled in $ 40.8 million in revenue, a much larger figure than in Chicago because the Trump Organization owns and operates the hotel in Washington, instead of just managing it.
Past financial filings for the Washington hotel showed that sales of food and drinks and events at the hotel were helping drive its particularly strong performance, even more than room bookings. The bar is often populated with Republican Party activists and out-of-town visitors who are fans of Mr. Trump. The hotel's banquet rooms have also been rented out by major trade associations -- such as the American Petroleum Institute -- and foreign groups, holding events that might draw the attention of the White House.
The nonprofit group Public Citizen published a report last year called "Hotel Swamplandia" that listed outside groups that were holding events at Trump family properties. The list included 121 political candidates or political groups, 47 businesses or business groups, 12 religious groups, 10 foreign governments or business interests, and eight charities. The largest number of events took place at the Trump hotel in Washington.
Trump is heavily invested in golf, but revenues are sideways
Of total assets of at least $ 1.4 billion listed in the financial disclosure report, more than a third is tied to the Trump Organization's golf clubs and resort business. These businesses generated more than half of the minimum of $ 434.9 million he reported in total revenues.
That means that the Trump business is heavily dependent on the success of the 16 golf clubs it operates, from Scotland to New York to Los Angeles.
In total, revenues rose about 1.5 percent at those properties last year, but half of them saw modest declines. The courses with the biggest revenue drop-offs were the ones near Los Angeles and Philadelphia, and another in Jupiter, Fla.
The four Trump-owned or operated courses outside the United States had revenue growth last year, including at the golf course and resort in Turnberry, Scotland, which had the largest jump in revenues, to $ 23.4 million, up 15 percent. A company official said that the performances at Turnberry and Doonbeg in Ireland were the best since Mr. Trump took them over.
Mr. Trump's course near Washington, which he often visits on weekends, saw revenues rise 4.6 percent.
An expanding area in the U.S.: Knickknacks
When Mr. Trump imposed a ban on new foreign deals during his presidency, the company still thought it would grow domestically. The Trumps were already working on two new midrange hotel brands, with plans of opening them in dozens of cities like Cincinnati, Nashville and Valley Forge, Pa.
That growth never materialized and the Trumps shelved the new hotels this year, citing the political climate. The partners on the only hotel deal they signed, based in Mississippi, are now continuing without the Trumps.
And the Trumps did not have much to show for all of the effort planning the new lines of hotels, which were to be called American Idea and Scion: They collected $ 10,000 in management fees last year connected to the Mississippi deal.
One area where the Trumps have seen revenue growth has been in their sale of Trump-branded ties, golf wear and golf balls and other gifts. In 2017, they opened a Trump-branded online store, and in its first full year of operation, it brought in $ 520,000.
The financial report offers only a limited view
Mr. Trump's financial disclosure spanned 88 pages and listed over 100 lines of business, including hotels, real estate and golf courses. But for all the numbers, the report offers only a limited view of the president's finances. It gives no data, for example, about whether properties are profitable.
Since his campaign, Mr. Trump has refused to release his taxes, which would offer a more in-depth view of his finances. Mr. Trump has been resisting efforts from congressional Democrats to obtain his taxes, which he says are under audit.
The report does include vague details about Mr. Trump's debt, including that he has at least $ 315 million in loans, including new financing for the $ 18.5 million mansion he bought from a sister.
But it also leaves many open questions.

Mark Levin: Media 98% anti-Trump, ‘incestuous’ with Democrats, fake news real

Texto completo: Conservative media mogul Mark Levin is calling for a national debate on the liberal advocacy and bias of much of the media, a growing trend propelled by the election of President Trump that he fears threatens the nation.
518tY0P0EBL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg
With his highly anticipated book, "Unfreedom of the Press," the No. 4 best-seller on Amazon even before its May 21 release, and a planned promotional blitz, the top-rated radio and TV host plans to call out the media’s “army of haters” and urge the public to demand less liberal bias and opinion in the news.
“We have to have a national discussion about this, not with the media, but among ourselves like our founders did, in our homes, our restaurants, in our churches, in our civic groups, at a grassroots level, about what we’re going to do about it, because if we don’t have a free press we cannot sustain our republic,” he told Secrets this week.
Speaking in his Levin TV offices, he said much of the media has given up fairness to take out Trump by any means necessary, including fake and "pseudo" news. “What’s going on today with these attacks on the president of the United States, literally trying to burden him to such an extent that he cannot function, undermines the republic,” said Levin.
"Unfreedom of the Press" is unlike Levin’s recent series of books on liberty and the Constitution, and touches on one of his favorite topics for his nightly radio Mark Levin Show: the media’s liberal bias.
Over 258-pages, he uses history, authoritative studies from organizations such as Harvard University, and admissions from prominent journalists to prove the mass media as leftist and proud of it. He lists dozens of comments, for example, of anti-Trump statements from journalists.
He also takes on the vast swath of reporters and organizations who claim that Trump is the greatest threat to journalism ever. While Trump has often stated that the media is the “enemy of the people,” Levin said the president has done little beyond rhetoric to squeeze the media.
Tweet
By comparison, he cites historical examples of how presidents from John Adams to Barack Obama prosecuted reporters and limited access, much of which was ignored in the liberal newspapers.
The reason, he wrote, is because the Democratic Party and media are in bed. He cited 29 recent examples of media figures going to work for Democrats and party officials joining the media, huge by comparison to the GOP-media revolving door.
“There is a relative handful of media outlets that are trying to balance how they report,” he said of conservative outlets, “and most of them come under attack from the 98% who demand uniformity.”
In that 98% group, he said in the interview, “There’s this constant movement between the Democrat Party and the media, and the media and the Democrat Party, there are family members, there’s incestuous relationships.”
His book cited a report that showed political reporters live in counties Hillary Clinton won in the 2016 presidential election. Another quoted study found that 430 media members gave $382,000 to Clinton.
In trademark style, Levin spares none of his targets, and even devotes a chapter to ripping the New York Times, the crown jewel of media, for its reluctance to focus on the Holocaust during World War II.
His goal is not to destroy the liberal press but to nudge it away from being one-sided and driven to promote progressives and their policies.
“If newsrooms and journalists do not act forthwith and with urgency to ‘fundamentally transform’ their approach to journalism, which, sadly, is highly unlikely, their credibility will continue to erode and may well reach a point soon where it is irreparably damaged with a large portion of the citizenry, and rightly so,” he penned.
He concluded, “The media will not only marginalize themselves but they will continue to be the greatest threat to freedom of the press today — not President Trump or his administration, but the current practitioners of what used to be journalism.”

Trump says those who ‘spied’ on his campaign should be convicted of treason

Texto completo: President Trump said court-ordered FBI surveillance of his 2016 presidential campaign was treason and those connected to it should serve long prison sentences.
“A really bad situation,” Trump tweeted Friday. “TREASON means long jail sentences, and this was TREASON!”
Tweet
FBI Director Chris Wray said earlier this month he did not consider the surveillance to be “spying” and he had no evidence the bureau illegally surveilled Trump’s campaign during its investigation into potential collusion between the campaign and Russia.
[Related: Trump: FBI Director Wray gave a 'ridiculous answer' about spying]
His comments to the Senate Appropriations subcommittee were a split from Attorney General William Barr, who has described the surveillance as “spying.” Barr did not say whether the FBI’s monitoring of the campaign was improper, but Trump has seized on those comments to bolster his claims.
In 2016, the FBI obtained a surveillance warrant to monitor the contacts of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.
The attorney general is investigating whether the FBI abused its power to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation did not conclude there was a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russians during the campaign.
The New York Times reported earlier this month the FBI sent an undercover female government investigator to meet with former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopolous, who was told by a Maltese professor during the campaign that Russia had dirt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Papadopoulos wrote in his book, Deep State Target, that the woman, who said she was a research assistant, asked him whether the Trump campaign was working with Russia.

Texto completo: Anjelica Huston isn't apologizing after making pointed comments about some of her acting contemporaries and past relationships during a press tour for "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum."
Huston has a key role in the Keanu Reeves action movie, which premiered in Hollywood on Wednesday. She's been talking about her past while promoting the movie, making pointed jabs about Robert De Niro's acting choices and a new Diane Keaton movie in the process.
"You know we all live life, and at a certain point you have to claim your life. You know, I could apologize for a lot of things. But you know, all in all I've tried not to hurt people. Once in a while, I think maybe I'm a little politically incorrect - but that's part of who I am," Huston said.
The 67-year-old actress also commented on the size of her ex Jack Nicholson's genitalia during an interview earlier in the week. She says she's happy to keep speaking her mind - but doesn't want to be seen as a role model for younger actresses.
"Oh God, no. I don't want to be an example to anyone who, you know, who doesn't know their own mind yet," she said. "I've always known what I liked and what I didn't like and where I wanted to be. And so far, that served me pretty well."

Big-bucks bunny: A stainless steel sculpture of a rabbit by Jeff Koons has set an auction record in New York, fetching over $91 million. The sale of Koons' 1986 "Rabbit" at Christie's was the most expensive work by a living artist ever sold at auction. The previous record was set by British artist David Hockney. His 1972 "Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)" brought in $90.3 million at Christie's last year. The New York Times says Robert E. Mnuchin, an art dealer and the father of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, was the winning bidder for "Rabbit."
Shakira cleared: A Spanish court has cleared Colombian singers Shakira and Carlos Vives of a plagiarism claim after rejecting a lawsuit brought against them by a Cuban-born singer and producer. Livan Rafael Castellanos had accused Shakira and Vives of plagiarizing his 1997 song "Yo te quiero tanto" in their award-winning hit "La Bicicleta."

Texto completo: Movie Review
★★★½
The Biggest Little Farm
Directed by John Chester. Written by Chester and Mark Monroe. At Boston Common, Coolidge Corner, and Kendall Square. 91 minutes. PG (mild thematic elements: births, deaths, peril, feces).
If you've been paying attention to the news, you know two things: Contempt is alive and well in America. The planet, on the other hand, is dying.
Earlier this month, headlines out of Paris announced sobering, widespread evidence of flora and fauna in rapid decline. Scientists now say that “around 1 million species already face extinction, many within decades." And the “alpha culprit" of this crisis, according to a recent New York Times editorial, is large-scale farming that willfully or ignorantly destroys the very land it aims to cultivate.
This should be reason enough for you to see “The Biggest Little Farm." But writer-director-cinematographer John Chester isn't taking any chances. Just in case you need to be sold on the theatrical entertainment value of a feature-length agri-activism documentary, he's also packaged his film for mass-market appeal.
Think “An Inconvenient Truth" meets “Babe," or “The Good Earth" meets a biodiverse “Marley & Me," with a dash of the Food Network's “Pioneer Woman" tossed in. Among other things, that means furry critters romping to a folksy soundtrack with tubas and banjos employed unironically. It means circle-of-life lessons and sun-dappled everything . It means check your cynicism and snark at the gate, if you dare.
To which I say: OK, Mr. Chester, you got me.
When I first saw this movie near the end of last year's Toronto International Film Festival, I was exhausted and probably starving for a feel-good nibble. That's how I justified falling hard for the sweet autobiographical chronicle of Chester and his wife, Molly, a food blogger and personal chef, who rescue a dog (Todd), move to the untamed hills outside of Los Angeles, and begin a daunting quest to transform 200 spent acres into a model of responsible commercial farming. My critical guard was down. Yeah, that's it.
Then I watched “The Biggest Little Farm" again, recently. Same result.
Maybe this time I noticed a few more layers of polish and genial manipulation, but second viewings always risk exposing the magic trick. I was still charmed and still invested in the journey of these intrepid organic entrepreneurs. How can you not love regular people hellbent on doing a difficult job right, led by an oddball guru named Alan York, who calmly surfs every wave of problems that the land and its inhabitants can conjure?
“Diversify, diversify, diversify," York says. And they do, plowing all of their savings into expensive upgrades and cover crops that only introduce more pests, until one day their endless web of woes becomes a glorious, self-policing habitat.
The soil regenerates. Adorable animals and their less-adorable predators find a way to coexist. And yes, even with so many obstacles, it all might seem too forcibly idyllic at some point. But if you're looking for proof that our ecosystem can survive pretty much anything we humans can throw at it — a reason to believe that the planet's scar tissue might not be 100 percent irreversible — this movie is like 91 minutes of the best kind of church.
It's truly food for the soul.
Sustainable food? Well, the Chesters' Apricot Lane Farms has evolved into a booming business that regularly supplies produce to LA's finest restaurants. Its eggs are so coveted that farmers' market patrons reportedly wait more than an hour to fork over $15 for a dozen. And portly Emma the pig, a breakout star of the film, just got her own children's book.
You can squint and see slick opportunism, if you want. But in Southern California, where advocacy and celebrity often intertwine, that's what they call a grassroots success story.

Texto completo: U.S. Attorney John Durham has already used a grand jury in Connecticut, attorney Joe diGenova said on Tuesday.
It was revealed this week that Attorney General William Barr tasked Durham with examining the origins of the federal Russia investigation.
In a Fox News interview, diGenova said Durham, who is a U.S. attorney in Connecticut, has been working for a couple of months.
"Durham has already used a grand jury in Connecticut, they've already gotten documents, he's already talked to the intel people," he said.
iFrame Object
Durham's effort, described by one New York Times source as currently being a review and not a criminal inquiry, is operating alongside the FISA abuse investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz.
DiGenova said Horowitz has already determined that the three FISA extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained and he is now the brink of finding the first FISA was completely illegal.
Horowitz can recommend that people be prosecuted, and diGenova suggested former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan have the most to fear.
"This is now big time. This is where Brennan needs five lawyers. Comey needs five lawyers," diGenova said. He also said Brennan will probably see prison time.
DiGenova served as an independent counsel in the 1990s for a case on former President Bill Clinton's passport before he was elected. Last year, it was announced diGenova and his wife and legal partner Victoria Toensing were joining Trump's legal team for the federal Russia investigation, but that plan was nixed within days.

Texto completo: When Pete Buttigieg joined Facebook as a Harvard undergrad in 2004, he was the 287th user registered on the site. The social network's founders were friends of friends, and it felt like an insular message board for Harvard classmates, he remembered in an interview in San Francisco last week.
"I don't think any of us could have guessed what implications that technology would have in the long run," Buttigieg said.
Fifteen years and 2.4 billion users later, as Facebook wrestles with cascading scandals over data privacy, misinformation and election meddling on its platform, Buttigieg has become one of several presidential contenders calling for tougher regulation of the company and Silicon Valley's other biggest tech firms.
The debate over Facebook's future took on new resonance last week as one of the company's co-founders, Chris Hughes, published a New York Times op-ed calling for the tech giant to be broken up. Buttigieg said Hughes, his former Harvard classmate, "made a very convincing case" that no company "should have the type of power that  these tech companies have."
But unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he hasn't endorsed breaking up the tech giants, instead suggesting "a spectrum" of regulation that could include fines, blocking new mergers or splitting up companies. That's attracted criticism from some on the left who want the candidates to take a strong stance on issues of corporate power.
Buttigieg's vaguer position comes as the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has courted support from Silicon Valley, attending a packed schedule of fundraisers around the Valley and San Francisco on Friday.
In the first three months of 2019, Buttigieg received at least $27,250 in donations from employees of Facebook, Google,
Apple and Amazon, the fifth-highest total among the Democrats running for president. Hughes also gave him $2,700 (while donating to several other 2020 Democrats as well). Meanwhile, his campaign has spent about $181,000 on Facebook ads, less than a fifth of the amount spent by Sens. Kamala Harris or Warren.
"Here in the Bay Area, we've been waiting for a new generation that is going to redefine politics, and I think Pete's going to do it," said Adam Hundt, a tech worker who met Buttigieg in college and co-hosted one of his fundraisers. "Tech is all about change, and the way Pete has an open mind and embraces change makes him a natural fit."
Buttigieg was two years ahead of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at the Ivy League school, and was a senior when Zuckerberg, Hughes and their co-founders launched the site from a dorm room. Buttigieg's account is the 287th on the network (although a few of those before him were created as tests); if you go to facebook.com/287 while signed into Facebook, the Harvard grad's original page, which he still updates, will pop up.
At the time, following his friends on Facebook felt like "a curiosity," and an improvement over services like MySpace, Friendster or AIM, Buttigieg said. In recent years, he's used his page to share photos from his deployment to Afghanistan in the Navy Reserve and post pictures and videos of life in South Bend. (He has separate pages for his presidential campaign and mayor's office.)
When Zuckerberg embarked on a cross-country trip to see more of the U.S. in 2017 attracting rumors about his own presidential ambitions he stopped by South Bend to meet with Buttigieg, connected by a mutual Harvard friend. The mayor drove the tech mogul on a tour of the city, as Zuckerberg streamed live video from his cellphone on the dashboard of Buttigieg's car.
Zuckerberg and Buttigieg stayed in touch, and they last spoke earlier this year, his campaign said.
As Buttigieg explained to Zuckerberg on the tour, he's also worked to attract tech investment to his Rust Belt hometown, helping open a data center on the site of an abandoned Studebaker plant and transforming other old factories into glassy workspaces for startups.
"What they've done to revitalize the city is pretty remarkable," marveled Matt Rogers, the co-founder of the smart home company Nest and an investor who's been to the city multiple times at the mayor's invitation. "You go out to dinner in South Bend and the streets are full of millennials, and there are great restaurants that feel like you're in San Francisco."
Rogers, who's hosted fundraisers for Buttigieg, said he found the candidate to be "literate, fluent and deeply knowledgeable" about tech issues.
Buttigieg has suggested that that tech know-how is missing in D.C. He criticized the congressional hearings featuring Zuckerberg and other tech executives last year, which he called "political theater where very little actually got achieved."
"What we saw was a spectacle of people in charge of regulating a very powerful force demonstrating that they had no concept of what it was they were in charge of overseeing which is incredibly dangerous," Buttigieg said, arguing that political leaders "need some kind of literacy in these technologies, what they mean and more importantly what they can do, in order to regulate properly."
"This is not necessarily an age thing, although I think it helps to have grown up with these technologies at your fingertips," he added.
Meanwhile, Buttigieg has toed the line between criticizing tech companies and voicing a more sympathetic perspective.
He said Friday that "A lot of people here in the tech sector still have a David mentality when they've increasingly turned into Goliath." But he added that he believes tech companies are making policy decisions "perhaps, not necessarily with bad intentions," and said he was struck by how many of Silicon Valley's executives have "become very introspective" and are "really reflecting on what they wrought."
That more diplomatic approach and Buttigieg's avoidance so far of calling for breaking up companies like Facebook "has been a personal sigh of relief for a lot of people in the tech industry," said Jacob Helberg, a tech policy adviser who's hosted fundraisers for the candidate.
While most of the other top Democrats are also playing coy on the issue, Buttigieg's refusal to be pinned down has frustrated tech critics who see it as a defining debate in the party.
"He is going for Silicon Valley money and he wants to express some nod to the problems but he doesn't want to offend anyone powerful," said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute and an advocate of splitting up the tech giants. "Take a position."

Texto completo: Perhaps you saw the piece in The New York Times about Las Vegas working hard to become a cultural hotspot for writers and artists.
And perhaps you know the Bellagio Las Vegas has been doing its part by mounting exhibits of world-class artwork. Some shows have been winners and some, well, have been less winning.
One recent exhibit (closed now) featured the stunning creations of Yayoi Kusama, a 90-year-old Japanese woman with orange hair and polka-dot clothes. Back in the 1970s she checked herself into a mental hospital and felt so much at home she’s lived there ever since.
But before writing her off as a kook, you should know she’s one of the most popular — and marketable — artists in the world today. And the Bellagio, in a bit of a coup, scored one of her 40 “Infinity Rooms” to display.
Most people who’ve attended a temple open house sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have noticed the two facing mirrors that reflect each other into eternity. Kusama has nudged that notion a step farther by creating entire rooms — floors, walls, ceilings, doors — made of mirrored surfaces and tiny, free-floating orange lanterns.
The effect is startling. But also, as with those temple mirrors, there’s a spiritual element at play. Anyone with religious leanings will find themselves moving from awe to reverence very quickly.
Of course, getting into one of Kusama’s infinity rooms is no easy task. It’s like getting a table at Studio 54 in New York City — on Labor Day weekend.
I had to make an online reservation with the Bellagio a week in advance. When I arrived, I found a long line of folks who’d been given the exact same time as me. We stood along the wall for a half hour while — one by one — we were led to a door by a very official-looking art matron holding a little clock. After some whispered words about photographs, epilepsy, liability and such, the matron let each of us enter the room. We we allowed 45 seconds in the infinity room to swallow the known universe.
I spent my 45 seconds craning my neck to see as far into infinity as I possibly could.
It was like standing on a planet at the center of the cosmos (think Kolob).
It was like being a demolitions expert for the Big Bang.
It was like swimming in matter unorganized, like being in a spiritual “fun house.”
Once back outside, I saw a ledger where I could write my impressions.
I wrote: “I thought I was Adam, standing arm-in-arm with Jehovah on Day One of creation.”
I’m sure Yayoi Kusama will never get the reference.
Many reading this column may not.
But being there at the Bellagio basking in what one art critic called Kusama’s “soul stuff” showed me that St. Augustine got it right when he said, "The world is a God-soaked sponge.”
Even in glaring and shining Sin City, it’s possible to find a little niche filled with the kind of light that can illuminate the face of God.

Texto completo: Most Americans might not realize this, but the democratic process of having your federal government answer tough questions — live, on television — is an act of accountability fast becoming extinct.
Once upon a time, a chief spokesman for the White House or Pentagon or State Department would go before cameras every day, certainly every week, and take any and all questions about government policies impacting millions of American lives.
No more.
Come Friday, it will be 67 days since White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders held a "daily press briefing. " That's a record dry spell. And it has been nearly a year since the last, on-camera news conference by a Pentagon spokesperson. The State Department sometimes goes weeks without a "daily" briefing.
Meanwhile, news cycles keep generating vital questions: Is a New York Times report accurate that plans are being prepared to send up to 120,000 troops — a force like the one used to invade Iraq in 2003 — to counter Iranian threats? Does President Donald Trump expect Americans to endure weeks or months of tumbling stocks and rising prices as his China trade war drags on? Why does he keep saying China pays billions of dollars in tariffs when it's actually American companies and consumers footing the bill?
FORMER WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN: Access to the president is more important
To his credit, media-savvy Trump makes himself available for shouted media questions as he boards Marine One helicopter on the South Lawn or during heads-of-state meetings more than many of the prior presidents. And the Pentagon offers up experts to answer questions on specific topics or does occasional briefings with cameras turned off.
"But access is not the same thing as transparency," says Martha Joynt Kumar, an emerita professor at Towson University who studies the history of presidential press relations as director of the White House Transition Project.
Necessary follow-up questions during Trump's blustering Q&A's are all but impossible. And the absence of regularly scheduled briefings denies reporters the chance to dig deeper into broader aspects of administration policy, forcing the White House to explain its plans and be openly accountable for governing decisions.
The lack of transparency is of a piece with other acts of concealment such as curtailing the release of White House visitor logs, breaking with the norm of releasing tax returns, refusing to make administration officials available for congressional oversight hearings, and denying a government watchdog the necessary metrics for judging the success or failure of the Afghanistan War.
While Trump continues to denigrate the media with his "fake news" mantra, journalists serve a purpose so vital to the Founding Fathers that press freedom was forever enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution.
It's not possible for every American to walk into the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department to ask questions that matter to them. This is why they rely on journalists to do the asking. The least the American people can expect from the Trump administration is to do the answering.

Rutgers' newspaper denied funds by students

Texto completo: For the first time in its history, not enough Rutgers University students voted to fund The Daily Targum, its 150-year-old New Brunswick campus newspaper.
For the vote to pass, at least 25 percent of eligible voters — undergraduate students with 104 or fewer credits — from each of the eight schools at Rutgers-New Brunswick must approve the fee on their bills.The failure to pass the referendum was due to the low turnout.
"There's been a decline in readership of print newspapers across the country, more and more local papers rely heavily on digital subscriptions to keep their papers afloat – and I think that the referendum failure is kind of a culmination of that," said Sandy Giacobbe, the paper's business manager.
Since 1980, when the paper first became independent, the main revenue source for The Daily Targum's daily operation, delivery and print production has come from students through a fee they pay on their semester term bills. Every three years, a referendum vote takes place throughout 10 days in April, when eligible student voters can submit a ballot in favor or against keeping the fee on their bills for the next six semesters.
While the vote has previously failed to pass in some schools, this was the first time the vote failed to pass for at all eight schools: School of Arts and Sciences, Rutgers Business School, School of Pharmacy, School of Engineering, Mason Gross School of Arts, School of Management and Labor Relations, and Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy.
Of the 23,996 eligible voters, only 6,578 participated. There were 4,461 votes for the referendum and 2,117 against it.
Students have the option during the semester to request a refund of the $11.25 fee.
At each school, there were more votes in favor of the funding the paper than against it, but not enough students voted to reach the minimum requirement of 25 percent.
Less than 30 percent of eligible voters turned out to the polls, Giacobbe said. Moving forward, the staff hopes to engage more with students and increase involvement prior to future referendums, he said.
"The majority of our funding comes through the line item on our term bill and it will definitely be affecting our budget going forward," said Giacobbe, a junior at the school studying political science. "We're going to be looking into new ways to obtain funding."
The paper's board of trustees, made up of four alumni members and four active students, planned to meet with staff to explore the possibility of donations, Giacobbe said.
"We do not know what the future holds, but the Targum Publishing Company's Board of Trustees and staff will be working to address this funding crisis," the paper posted on its website.
Supporters and alumni of the college newspaper spoke out on Twitter after the announcement on their willingness to donate to keep the paper operating.
"Not only is the Targum a necessary check on authority at Rutgers, but it's the way young journalists there learn the ropes," said Tom Wright-Piersanti, an editor on the New York Times politics desk.
Asking the university for funding, however, won't likely be the paper's first avenue to obtain the money it needs, Giacobbe said.
"We're a student-run paper at heart and remaining independent is really important to us," he said. "We're really in an uncharted territory now, but the Targum has been around since 1869 – we have 150 years of history – and I don't see that stopping any time soon."

CivilityBrevard event to host both sides of #MeToo debate

Texto completo: Touching the small of someone's back, making unwanted advances or commenting on a woman's body might have been brushed off as "creepy" at one time. Today, such gestures have ended careers.
The #MeToo movement was born less than two years ago, but it's hard to think of a social phenomenon that has turned social norms on their heads as fast it did – or one that has exposed how widespread sexual assault, harassment and misconduct are among all segments of society.
Rules of sexual consent and social interactions are now questioned. Women and men who for decades went silent about their #MeToo experiences have spoken up. Some of our heroes and favorite celebrities, from Morgan Freeman to singer R. Kelly, have faced accusations ranging from unwanted touching and comments to sexual abuse.
With all of this in mind, FLORIDA TODAY's Civility Brevard will host the event "#MeToo: An honest conversation" on May 30 at 6 p.m. at Eastern Florida State College's new Student Union (building 16) in Melbourne, 3865 N. Wickham Road. This is the second event hosted by Civility Brevard, a project to bring people from across the political spectrum to the table to discuss issues of local, state and national relevance. The first one was a mixer of conservatives and liberals.
The event is free and open to the public. Snacks, cookies and beverages will be provided. Please RSVP at bit.ly/321MeToo so we have an accurate headcount.
The point of the May 30 conversation is to bring together different points of view on the benefits of the movement and when and how accusations should be taken seriously. This is a difficult conversation, especially when we're dealing with traumatic experiences, so the goal is to do it in a respectful manner. I'll moderate the discussion and the audience will be encouraged to ask questions and speak up. Our panelists will be:
Eric Hoppenbrouwer, Civility Brevard member and president of Space Coast Young Republicans;
Melissa Martin, Civility Brevard member and former Democratic state Senate candidate;
Monique Miller, a Republican and former candidate for the state House and Senate;
Vicki Impoco, former president of the Brevard chapter of the National Organization for Women.
Each of these people brings a unique perspective to the conversation. Martin is a former Marine Corps judge advocate who knows the challenges of sexual assault cases. Miller brings a female conservative point of view. Impoco has organized local Women's Marches, and Hoppenbrouwer adds a conservative male voice.
Expect us to tackle some difficult questions, such as:
Should we always believe the victim?
Knowing how hard sexual assault cases can be to prove under the law, how can we ensure women feel safe coming forward years after an incident?
Is there forgiveness for people who lost their careers over accusations of sexual harassment, assault or misconduct?
Should the way we educate young people about consent and romantic and sexual interactions change in light of the movement?
This is the most difficult question: Has the pendulum swung too far in terms of believing victims and convicting the accused in the public opinion arena? If it has, how do we swing back that pendulum without going back to a time when victims were chastised for coming forward?
The #MeToo movement was fueled by a New York Times report of allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in the fall of 2017.
More than 250 influential men and women in different industries, from entertainment to politics, have faced similar accusations since April 2017, according to a Vox.com database.
The movement has upended a lot of social norms that have been accepted over the generations: That men should not take "no" for an answer when pursuing women and what sexual consent truly means, especially when the consenting person might have significantly less power than the one asking for consent.
There is no easy answer to any of the questions above and no protocol for how men and women should approach interactions with each other. But I hope our event starts a conversation.

DeSantis: Two counties hacked; Governor says Russians infiltrated state election datatbases in 2016, but no results were altered

Texto completo: TALLAHASSEE - Russian hackers infiltrated the election databases of two Florida counties during the 2016 election, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday, though he was quick to add that no votes were manipulated or results altered.
"Two Florida counties experienced intrusion into the supervisor of election networks," DeSantis said at a news conference. "There was no manipulation or anything, but there was voter data that was able to be got. Now, that voter data was public anyways, [but] nevertheless those were intrusions. It did not affect any voting or anything like that."
The information was part of a briefing that DeSantis and state election and law enforcement officials received from the FBI at the bureau's offices in Tallahassee last week. DeSantis requested the meeting after expressing frustration when the redacted report from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election came out in April, showing the FBI believed "at least one" Florida county had been successfully hacked.
But because of a non-disclosure form he signed with the FBI, DeSantis said he couldn't say which counties were the ones involved.
"I would be willing to name it for you guys, but they asked me to do that so I'm going to respect their wishes," DeSantis said.
Although the hackers didn't have access to vote-counting systems, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio said after the Mueller report was made public that they were in a position to manipulate voter registration data. DeSantis said the FBI told him that didn't occur.
Hackers sent spearphishing emails to more than 120 email addresses at local elections offices around the state, according to the FBI.
One sent to Volusia County officials was disguised as an email from VR Systems, a Tallahassee-based vendor that handled registration software for 52 counties. But Volusia officials have said they did not open the attachments in the email or click links that would have allowed the hackers access to their computers.
When asked if the hacking was related to a vendor, DeSantis said he had to be careful with what he could say, but noted that "the reason why those counties got affected was not necessarily the counties but it was because of a private vendor they were using."
Of the 67 counties asked via a South Florida Sun Sentinel records request whether they received the counterfeit VR Systems email, 11 acknowledged they had received it, 46 replied they had no record of receiving it - though it still could have been blocked from their inboxes due to spam filters - and another 10 have not yet responded to the request made April 24.
Broward elections supervisor Peter Antonacci again insisted Tuesday his county wasn't among the two accessed.
"There was no breach of the Broward Supervisor of Elections of any if its systems in 2015 or 2016," he said.
The briefing appeared to do little to shed light on what state officials knew regarding the hacking and when they knew it.
The FBI held a briefing with all 67 supervisors of elections in September 2016 to warn about Russian hacking attempts. It's still unclear how much local officials were told.
Rubio told the New York Times last month he didn't think "the specific victims of the intrusion have been notified." But DeSantis said Tuesday the FBI was working with them in 2016.
DeSantis also said the leaders of two main state agencies at the time of the hacking, Rick Swearingen, executive director of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and then-Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner, were not told by the FBI of the successful breach.
The FBI maintains that state employees on a task force with the FBI were informed. But DeSantis, who took office in 2019, also said he hasn't spoken about the issue with his predecessor, Rick Scott, now a U.S. Senator.
"We're going to try to figure out what the state was given access to, what we knew, if there were things that we should have known we're going to appeal to the federal government and say 'look, this is a team effort. We have an interest in making sure that this stuff's prevented,'" DeSantis said.
Although he praised the Florida Department of State for being "proactive" about hacking attempts, he warned the threat has not passed and could be tried again in 2020.
"I think that threats evolve and so I don't want to say 'Hey, there's no more threats,'" DeSantis said. "It's just something that you've always got to be vigilant about."

Texto completo: Every time I see the latest economic news, I thank Hillary Clinton.
Every time I see those high GDP numbers (up 3.2 percent last quarter), I thank Hillary.
Every time I see those record low unemployment numbers for blacks, Latinos and women, I thank Hillary.
If she hadn't been such a horrible candidate in 2016, there's no telling what sorry state America would be in right now.
So thank you, Hillary, for being such a loser. You did your country a greater service than you'll ever know.
I don't really blame Hillary too much for refusing to accept her embarrassing defeat and deciding to spend the rest of her public life posing as a professional victim of a conspiracy that never happened. In the pretend world where she lives, the Trump-hating Democrats running the House of Representatives and the Trump-hating Democrats running the mainstream liberal media want to re-investigate the Russian collusion delusion from scratch.
They're still deluding themselves about bringing down Trump and they know it. They know that even if the House impeaches Trump, the Senate won't impeach him in a million years.
In other words, the Democrats know their multiple hearings are nothing but partisan TV stunts designed to constantly smear Trump and his family and discredit Attorney General William Barr before he digs up the dirt about the FBI's rogue spying operation on the 2016 Trump campaign.
The good thing is, you don't have to bother watching the House's hearings live or pay attention to how the committees vote. Everyone already knows exactly what the final scores are going to be — straight party-line votes in favor of the majority Democrats' efforts to impeach, probe or immediately hang the president.
Meanwhile, the liberal media never get around to asking the Democrats in the House why they aren't busy writing new legislation to reform health care or fund infrastructure repair.
Come on, Nancy. It's time to send your new legislation over to the Senate so it can be sent over to be signed by the President. Where is it?
While the liberal media keeps busy finding new ways to hate Trump, a hundred Democratic presidential wannabes who hope to go on their party's suicide mission in 2020 are wandering around Iowa, hating on Trump, doing bad impersonations of socialists and making wilder and wilder promises they can't keep.
"Medicare for all," free college for all, "free" federal money for all deposited in a bank account every year just for being born a future Democrat. Wouldn't it be nice if a journalist at CNN, MSNBC, CBS or the New York Times seriously challenged one of these irresponsible promise-makers?
Instead of the usual softball question, what if Wolf Blitzer threw a surprise fastball at the head of Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren? What if he asked them something complicated like, "What do you think about passing legislation to end the monopoly protections given in each state to healthcare companies and allowing the companies to sell insurance across state lines?"
"I think it's called 'competition,'" Wolf could say. "It allows consumers to shop around for the best deal for themselves and their families. It's worked pretty well with cars, TVs and vegetables. Do you think it might work with health care?"
Don't worry. No one in the mainstream media will ever dare to ask that kind of question to a Democrat. They're only asked questions that can be answered with "I really really hate Trump."
Let's face it, we're going to have this kind of anti-Trump insanity in America for the next 18 months. The deranged mainstream media — electronic and what's left of print — is never going to go back to presenting what we used to call "the news."

Yemen's Houthis Use Drones To Damage 2 Saudi Oil Sites

Texto completo: BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Yemen's Houthi rebels carried out multiple drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities on Tuesday, a day after Saudi Arabia said two of its oil tankers had been damaged in an act of sabotage, ratcheting up tensions in the region.
A Houthi spokesman, Mohammed Abdul Salam, claimed responsibility for the drone strikes on Twitter, saying that they were a response to Saudi "aggression" and "genocide" in Yemen.
Although the Houthis are backed by Iran, it was unclear whether the attacks were related to increasing tensions between Iran and the United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf.
A total of four oil tankers were damaged off the coast of the United Arab Emirates on Sunday in what the Emirati government called acts of sabotage. Though little hard information has emerged about the attacks, American and Gulf suspicions have centered on Iran, in an area already jittery about the prospect of a violent clash with the republic.
The Trump administration has warned of planned aggression by Iran or its proxies, though it has not elaborated on that contention, and it has deployed military forces to the region.
But both sides said Tuesday that they were not looking for a war, even as the threats and counterthreats continued.
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in comments carried on state television that "no war is going to happen," The Associated Press reported.
"Neither we, nor they are seeking war," he said. "They know that it is not to their benefit."
And in a visit to Russia on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, "We fundamentally do not seek a war with Iran."
But the Trump administration has not ruled out further increasing the American military presence in the region.
Responding to a New York Times report that Pentagon officials were drawing up plans to deploy as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East, Mr. Trump called it "fake news" and said that "we have not planned for that."
"Hopefully we're not going to have to plan for that," he added. "And if we did that, we'd send a hell of a lot more troops than that."
The four ships were damaged on Sunday in coastal waters near the Strait of Hormuz, the vital waterway to the Persian Gulf, through which much of the world's oil flows.
The Saudi government said two of the ships were Saudi tankers, identified by industry officials as Al Marzoqah and the Amjad, and a Norwegian shipping company said another was one of its tankers, the Andrea Victory. The fourth was an Emirati tanker.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they were investigating the attacks.
A senior Defense Department official said Tuesday that based on a "holistic assessment," the military believes that "Iran is likely" behind the tanker attacks. However American officials said there was no definitive evidence linking Iran or its proxies to the attacks.
Iran suggested Tuesday that the tanker attacks were a provocation intended to escalate tensions.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran said that it had "previously predicted that such actions would occur to create tensions in the region," according to IRNA, a state news agency.
Speaking in New Delhi, he also warned of the danger posed by "extremist individuals in the U.S. government."
Mr. Zarif and other Iranian officials have sought to portray President Trump's national security adviser, John R. Bolton, as a warmonger eager to push the two countries into conflict.
Mr. Pompeo said Tuesday that the United States was still trying to get more information about the attacks.
"We're working diligently to get answers to what caused those ships to have the problems that they have today," he said at a news conference in Sochi, Russia.
The attack on the Saudi oil facilities added a new element to the tensions.
A Houthi-run television station, Al Masirah, reported that seven drones had "targeted vital Saudi facilities."
The Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said the attacks on two pumping stations had caused "limited damage." He said the government was shutting down a pipeline while it assessed the damage and made repairs.
"The Kingdom condemns this cowardly attack," Mr. Falih said in a statement. "And this recent terrorist and sabotage act in the Arabian Gulf against vital installations not only targets the kingdom, but also targets the safety of the world's energy supply and the global economy."
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are fighting the Houthis in Yemen to restore the government that the Houthis ousted from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. The war in Yemen is viewed as another front in the regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Saudi Arabia considers the Houthis an Iranian proxy. The Houthis receive support from Iran, but deny that they are an Iranian proxy.
The affected pipeline runs from the oil production areas in the eastern part of the country to the Red Sea in the West, where the Saudis maintain export facilities. Those facilities help ensure they can continue to export oil if they have difficulties doing so from the Persian Gulf.
Sadad I. Al-Husseni, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco, said the strikes did not pose a serious risk to the Saudi infrastructure.
"The facilities in the kingdom were designed at a time when there were wars going on in the Gulf," he said. "So everything was redesigned and upgraded in order to take advantage or make allowances for the security aspects."

Texto completo: President Trump said Tuesday he would consider sending many more than the 120,000 troops he reportedly is considering sending to the Middle East to deal with Iran, even as he called the report "fake news."
"Would I do that? Absolutely," Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House when asked about the report. "But we have not planned for that. Hopefully we're not going to have to plan for that. And if we did that, we would send a hell of a lot more troops than that."
The president also blasted the New York Times, which revealed the White House was considering such a move.

"I think it’s just — where was that story, in the New York Times? Well the New York Times is fake news," he said.

Texto completo: Jenna Fischer's two children delighted her this past weekend by taking her order and serving her breakfast in bed.
On the menu: Coffee with milk, scrambled eggs, fresh sour dough toast with butter and jelly and some decorative flowers and balloons. For her reading pleasure: The New York Times.
We know this because "The Office" alum shared the itemized bill her children presented her at the end of her meal.
It's understandable right? That's usually what happens at the end of a meal.
Daughter Harper, 5, and son Weston, 7, cut mom a deal it appears as the bill is ridiculously cheap. They threw in the New York Times for free.
Fischer, 45, said on Instagram "I'm dying laughing. "
The children that Fischer shares with husband Lee Kirk presented the breakfast to her for Mother's Day and to honor the occasion she added on her post, "They said 'The New York Times is not always free, that’s just for Mother’s Day' "
Indeed.

Stern look at liars; Howard tell-all riffs on Weinstein, O'Reilly &amp; Don

Texto completo: Howard Stern wants to set the record straight.
The raucous radio host takes a fresh look at some of his best interviews in his new page-turner, "Howard Stern Comes Again," released Tuesday. He also shines a light on people who weren't altogether truthful while in his hot seat.
That includes Stern himself, who reveals in the book's intro that he uncharacteristically took a day off of his SiriusXM show in 2017 because of a cancer scare he wasn't ready to discuss. (Spoiler alert: It turns out he's fine.)
After getting that confession off his chest, Stern spends the next 527 pages reflecting on guests including Harvey Weinstein, Bill O'Reilly and Donald Trump, who, to varying degrees, turned out to be liars.
"If they'd been that candid, they would have been in jail," Stern told the Daily News of Weinstein and O'Reilly with a laugh. "What we learned about them afterwards, you know ..."
During his January 2014 talk with Weinstein, Stern continually pushed the movie mogul to discuss the infamous casting couch and actresses he's bedded. Weinstein vehemently insisted those stories are from the old days of Hollywood and didn't reflect his experiences in the business. The portly producer, whose filmmaking days certainly seem to be behind him, is accused of sexual misconduct by nearly 90 women and faces criminal sexual assault charges.
"There was something in the ether during the Harvey Weinstein thing where I kept going back to 'What about the casting couch, Harvey?' " Stern, 65, recalled.
"Why was I doing that? Was there something I was picking up? I don't know. Because think about it. It's so relevant now to go there and read it," he said.
Stern said he considered leaving the Weinstein and O'Reilly interviews out of "Howard Stern Comes Again," in part because the men weren't forthcoming. He included them, even though he doesn't count either of those interviews among his favorites, because of how damning those men's words now appear in print.
"Here are two guys who are on top of their game. When they're in front of me they are absolutely delightful, have all the right answers ... [but] they're exposed by these interviews," Stern told The News.
In October 2003, Stern sat down with O'Reilly, who unceremoniously left Fox News after The New York Times revealed in 2017 that the right-wing pundit and the network had settled multiple lawsuits against him dating to 2002. The cases against the Fox News superstar involved various forms of harassment, some of a sexual nature. Yet O'Reilly said on Stern's show that while "everyone has skeletons in their closet," his were "boring." Unlike Weinstein, O'Reilly was never accused of a crime
"Even with O'Reilly I kept hammering away at like 'What's your personal life? Where's your wife? Where are your kids? And how about all those hot girls at Fox?' " Stern told The News. "There was something there, like an itch."
While Stern blatantly caught then-citizen Trump making a demonstrably untrue claim about how he evaded the Vietnam draft, he stops short of calling the president a liar. In fact, Stern found Trump to be a fantastic guest, which he recalls throughout the book in a recurring segment called "And Now a Word From Our President." It consists of 10 chats with Trump, some in person and others by phone.
"It wasn't the honesty so much, it was the sense of camaraderie," Stern said of that relationship. "This is why I felt he won the presidency. The communication is one of ... let's call him a regular guy. As successful or rich as he is, or privileged from having a wealthy family, he understood how to talk like a guy. He would call in and give his opinions, and yes, he was being honest, but look what he was being honest about."
Stern was referring to Trump's willingness to come on his show and talk about women he found attractive, including his own daughter Ivanka, who he told Stern was "a 10" and agreed, in Stern's words, that she was "a piece of ass."
One of the book's highlights, which Stern recalled in amazement, happened in May 2001 when former News columnist A.J. Benza and The Donald got into a bitter argument over a woman they'd both dated. Things got nasty. Benza claimed Trump once called him to brag he'd recently returned from Russia where he had sex with women who "have no morals."
Even then, Trump denied having seedy ties to Russia.
"Russian? Who are you talking about 'Russian?' " Trump defended. "I don't know anything."
Stern can't believe the fortuity of that 18-year-old exchange, where he said "disturbing things" started to emerge.
"It's nuts!" he told The News. "It proves so much."
Stern finds it unfair that critics politicize humorous comments Trump made on his show, like when the former reality-TV star joked that being promiscuous without catching a venereal disease was his personal war in the 1970s.
However, the Long Island native acknowledges that Trump was not being truthful when he claimed to have been "lucky" in steering clear of the actual war in Vietnam. It's since been reported Trump allegedly applied for five deferments to avoid fighting the Viet Cong.
"I got very lucky," Trump told Stern. "I had a very high lottery number. So I've always felt a little bit guilty."
Stern doesn't attempt to defend him.
"That's a lie. Clearly," he conceded.

Texto completo: Julian Assange apparently is prepared to argue that he could not receive a fair trial in the United States because of his fame and his alleged links to political scandals — specifically, that he played a role in helping Russian efforts to hack Democratic computers during the 2016 presidential election.
For some people Assange presents a problem. He obtained top secret files from the U.S. military and diplomatic corps, some of which were embarrassing to the nation and its allies. How, they wonder, does this differ from what Daniel Ellsberg did a half-century ago, bringing to light atrocities and lies concerning the Vietnam War?
The answer lies in process. Ellsberg gave the files he obtained to The New York Times and The Washington Post. Trained journalists know to consider such information against a variety of factors, including its potential harm to innocent people. The Post’s publisher, Katharine Graham, is considered legendary for her deliberations of the merits of publishing what were known as the “Pentagon Papers,” and then her courage in doing so amid government challenges once she had made her decision.
Assange, by contrast, dumped hundreds of thousands of classified documents on the public without a thought toward consequences, and apparently without having read them all himself. He selectively targeted the United States, endangering Americans and many of the nation’s allies, equating U.S. forces to the old East German secret police while ignoring the atrocities committed by the Taliban or other enemies.
He implied in an interview on Dutch TV that Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee worker killed in a robbery, was murdered for providing him stolen information — something for which no evidence exists. The Washington Times recently retracted its stories pushing that conspiracy theory. Assange appears to have been giving cover to Russian efforts to influence the U.S. election.
All this may seem like hair-splitting when it comes to deciding how to define the difference between journalism and espionage. The U.S. Constitution clearly makes it difficult to define who gets to wear the title of a journalist. But in this case, Assange seems to have had little concern about the public good, protecting the innocent or the responsible dissemination and analysis of the information he obtained.
A British judge soon may have to decide whether to extradite Assange to the United States or to send him to Sweden to face rape charges. A rape charge is serious, but sending him to Sweden may make it difficult for him to come to the United States to face charges here.
He is likely to make the claim that the United States wants him mainly for political reasons. That’s unconvincing, considering the Trump administration allegedly gained the most from his work. The United States has consistently sought to try Assange, dating back to the Obama administration.
It’s time for him to come to the United States and defend himself in court. It’s time to hear evidence and, once and for all, determine the truth about his actions and his motives.

Inmigración y delincuencia, ¿se confirma la teoría de Trump?

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump ha hecho, en varias ocasiones, un nexo entre la inmigración y la delincuencia, pero hay varias investigaciones que han demostrado que no existe una conexión real entre un fenómeno y otro en los Estados Unidos.
Incluso, no hay datos que permitan concluir que la inmigración de indocumentados esté relacionado con el incremento de delitos, como lo demuestra un análisis en conjunto entre The Marshall Project y The Upshot, de The New York Times.
El reporte reconoce que es complicado obtener datos sobre los indocumentados, quienes han sido objeto de pocos estudios, incluidos los relacionados con el crimen, pero señala que el Pew Research Center publicó estimaciones de poblaciones indocumentadas clasificadas por área metropolitana, que el Proyecto Marshall ha comparado con las tasas de delincuencia locales publicadas por FBI por primera vez.
Esto dio la oportunidad de un análisis más amplio de cómo la inmigración de indocumentados podría haber afectado los índices de delincuencia desde 2007.
“La mayoría de los tipos de delitos tenían una línea de tendencia casi plana, lo que indica que los cambios en las poblaciones de indocumentados tuvieron poco o ningún efecto sobre el delito en las diversas áreas metropolitanas que se examinaron”, indican las conclusiones publicadas por el Times. “El asesinato fue el único tipo de crimen que pareció mostrar un aumento, pero la diferencia fue pequeña e incierta (efectivamente cero)”.
Indica que una mayoría de las áreas registraron disminuciones tanto en delitos violentos como en aquellos que afectan contra la propiedad entre 2007 y 2016.
Nuevamente, esa disminución no tiene relación alguna sobre el aumento o decremento de la población de inmigrantes indocumentados.
El reporte señala que los indocumentados se arriesgan poco a ser detenidos, ya que “ser arrestados por cualquier motivo significaría enfrentar una eventual deportación y, para algunos, regresar a cualquier peligro o privación que hayan tratado de escapar en su país”.
Es incierto el número de indocumentados que hay en el país, por lo que el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional ( DHS ) y otras instituciones utilizan el método residual, es decir, del último estimado realizan uno nuevo. Actualmente es de 10.7 millones de indocumentados.

Texto completo: Well it looks like the mystery behind President Donald Trump's reluctance to show his tax returns has been solved. He may not be as rich as he wants the world to think he is.
At least that's what a recent New York Times report revealed about the man who was claiming to be a billionaire in the 1980s and 1990s. During a 10-year period spanning both decades, Trump lost more than a billion dollars and during most of that decade he neglected to pay taxes. Isn't that around the same time the president, who campaigned on his business acumen, published the book "The Art of the Deal"? Colin Jost, of "Saturday Night Live," points out the inherent contradiction between Trump's rhetoric and reality in today's Best of Late Night, above.
Comic Bill Maher has a new name for Trump: "reverse billionaire. "

What's the distinction between racing dogs or horses?

Texto completo: Dog racing is on its ignominious final lap, thanks to Florida voters. Sixty-nine percent - a majority beyond even the most fanciful aspirations of the various Homo sapiens on the 2018 ballot - approved an amendment that will shutter the state's 11 greyhound tracks by the end of the year.
Not exactly a photo finish. Clearly, Floridians were disgusted by deaths, doping and cruelties suffered by greyhounds. Just to sustain an anachronistic money-losing sparsely attended, pari-mutuel; hardly more than a poor excuse to operate racinos and poker rooms.
The ballot summary of Amendment 13 read: "Phases out commercial dog racing in connection with wagering by 2020. Other gaming activities are not affected." As if to allow voters to draw a moral distinction between scandal-plagued dog racing and that grander form of animal competition. (You know, the sport of kings - if kings can be defined as lonely old men pouring over racing forms in near empty grandstands.)
Dog racing kills dogs. So we banned dog racing. Never mind that horse racing kills horses.
About 10 race horses die in the U.S. each week, according to the Jockey Club's Equine Injury Database. But a New York Times state-by-state survey five years ago put the fatality rate at 24 a week.
Horseracing Wrongs, an advocacy group campaigning for a national ban on horse racing, records fatalities during racing or training among thoroughbreds, quarter horses and harness racers and claims that the death toll is even higher. Horseracing Wrongs President Patrick Battuello said about 2,000 race horses die every year in America. His operation lists individual horses his unhappy website https://horseracingwrongs.com/.
Dog racing's infamous doping outrages hardly out-scandalize the odious administration of performance enhancing drugs by horse trainers along with the pain killers that allow injured horses to compete, despite the risk of catastrophic breakdowns.
(Not to mention the unseemly sight of jockeys whipping their ponies down the stretch, a practice that outside the racing world that would get someone busted for animal cruelty.)
And like dog racing, horse racing exists as a money-losing façade allowing track owners to fulfill licensing requirements for their lucrative slot machines and poker tables. Yet, only dog racing has been consigned to oblivion.
"The greyhound racing industry is being outlawed because it was incapable of reform, and out of touch with American values about animal welfare," said Christine A. Dorchak, president and general counsel of GREY2K USA Worldwide, which has led the national crusade to ban dog racing. "Rather than welcome fundamental change, dog racers attacked critics and covered up problems."
Those same words could be used to describe horse racing. After the imbroglio at the Kentucky Derby last weekend, the national conversation about track safety referenced the startling number of deaths - 23 - over the previous three months at Santa Anita outside Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the Louisville Courier-Journal counted 43 thoroughbreds killed Churchill Downs since 2016. The Arizona Republic uncovered an Arizona state report that listed 50 thoroughbred fatalities in three years.
Yet the industry has resisted tougher regulation. A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress for several years running would create a uniform national standard for drug testing and medication rules that would be overseen by the United States Anti-Doping Agency. But Churchill Downs opposes the bill. Which means that its all-powerful home-state senator, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also opposes the bill. So much for national reform.
Floridians could take it upon themselves to do something. But no sign of that. Horseracing Wrongs lists 88 horse fatalities at Florida tracks in 2018. Yet there's nothing equivalent to the disgusted public uprising that banished dog racing.
No matter. Patrick Battuello is sure horse racing is headed for a similar demise. He said Americans no longer tolerate the mistreatment of animals for entertainment. "Ringling Brothers is gone. Multiple cities have banned rodeos."
He argued economics; that the hundreds of millions Florida and other states spend regulating horse racing and propping up the industry's money-losing business model ought to be considered corporate welfare; money better spent on education and other public endeavors.
And Battuello argues demographics; that young generations have little interest in pari-mutuels. He counts 37 American horse tracks that have closed since 2000. Horse racing is cited as "my favorite sport" by barely one percent of Americans. And that one percent - horse racing's last hope - is the same dwindling demographic in line for the early bird special at the Olive Garden.

Texto completo: On June 3, arts and culture reporter Bruce Fessier will write his final column.
After 40 years at The Desert Sun, he will retire with a prolific legacy, leaving an indelible mark on this paper, and the way we've covered arts and entertainment.
As he puts a period on his storied career, the public is invited to join in the celebration of his retirement at an open house May 28 at The Desert Sun.
The event will feature a live interview with Bruce by New York Times best-selling author and Coachella Valley local Tod Goldberg, as well as visual displays of Bruce's work and the celebrities and events he's covered, and a chance to meet the man who has seen and covered it all, from mobsters to Hollywood stars to events and festivals celebrating music, movies and desert culture.
For the past four decades, Bruce has taken Desert Sun readers inside the lives of Frank Sinatra, Sonny Bono, Bob Hope, local mobsters and the like.
He has covered every Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival – all 20. And each of the 13 Stagecoach country music festivals. He joined Bono on the founding committee for the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and has covered that event every year since it began in 1989.
He's a regular at local theater and charity events. He co-founded the Desert Theatre League in 1987.
He's also given back.
In 2013, he helped start The Desert Sun's Tachevah Music Showcase to offer local bands greater exposure and connect our valley's musicians with established industry veterans. He wanted to nurture local talent, and the event reflected a change in the Coachella Valley's art scene over the last four decades. While Hollywood A-listers and galas still highlight the season, generator parties have given rise to a more youthful, homegrown movement concentrated in the east valley.
Tickets to the May 28 event are $10 and proceeds will be donated to the Bruce Fessier Journalism Internship Fund at College of the Desert.
Contributions to this fund will enable College of the Desert students to participate in paid internships at The Desert Sun. These internships will allow them to gain experience and expand on skills associated with arts journalism and digital design.
You can purchase online at tickets.desertsun.com.

Texto completo: When Margaret Carnegie was born in March 1897, the only child of Scottish-American industrialist and steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, she entered a life of wealth and privilege. Often cited as one of the richest people in history, the elder Carnegie transformed his early modest existence into a life in which he owned numerous residences, including Skibo Castle in Scotland, a structure that dates to 1212.
On April 22, 1919, just four months before her father's death, Margaret married Roswell Miller Jr. at the Carnegie family home at 2 East 91st St. in New York City. Miller was a successful civil engineer and real estate executive, and the wedding received extensive coverage in The New York Times.
In the mid-1920s, along with other families of wealth in search of upstate property, Miller purchased 700 acres in Millbrook and enclosed the entire parcel with a 12-foot wire fence to protect his private herd of deer and elk. He established two entrances to the estate, one along Route 44 west of the Hamlet of Mabbettsville, and the other on Butts Hollow Road.
In 1927, financed by a gift from Margaret's mother, Louise Whitfield Carnegie, Miller had a 22-room stone and wood mansion built on the estate in the style of Skibo Castle. It was named Migdale after his wife's nickname, Midge.
Guests visiting the expansive, opulent structure arrived at a majestic porte cochere and into a 20- by 30-foot entrance hall that featured a grand staircase leading to the second floor. Entertaining was not a problem in the mansion's 35- by 58-foot living room.
Dinner parties were held in a 20- by 30-foot dining room, and to maintain a tranquil atmosphere for adults, the house was also fitted with a separate dining room for children. And with 10 bedrooms, nine bathrooms and another eight half-bathrooms, overnight guests were well accommodated, perhaps more so than in their own homes.
Each of the first-floor rooms featured exposed beam ceilings and dark oak wood floors. An unusual but welcoming feature in the dwelling was a 30- by 30-foot conservatory, where the Millers housed tropical birds and plants.
"I arrived in Millbrook in 1970 and two weeks before Christmas I received an invitation to attend a carol singalong at Migdale," said David Brinkerhoff. "Apparently, Roswell invited everyone in the community to his annual event. There were 200 to 300 people there and I recall an impressive 6-foot-long fireplace and someone playing an organ while everyone sang. Roswell greeted everyone as they arrived."
The grounds featured a 35- by 75-foot swimming pool with three diving boards. Among the outbuildings on the estate, Miller added a four-car stone garage, an eight-room superintendent's house, a gardener's cottage, three greenhouses and four barns.
While some of the surrounding estate owners used their respective properties for weekend and/or summer getaways, the Millers maintained Migdale as their primary residence. That said they were known to spend long periods at Skibo Castle in Scotland, the very structure after which their home was designed. To facilitate an easy traveling option, following World War ll, Miller had a 2,500-foot landing strip installed on the estate to accommodate private aircraft.
"The Roswells were wonderful people," said John Kading. "They were members of Lyall Memorial Federated Church, where I went, and he invited the Christian Endeavor Society to Migdale for Easter. We were 12-14 years old at the time and it was just wonderful."
Miller and Margaret Carnegie divorced in 1953, with Miller retaining the Millbrook estate and Carnegie relocating to Connecticut. He died in 1983, at 88 years old, while Margaret lived to the age of 93, passing away in 1990.
In 2000, the current owners of Migdale purchased the estate and embarked on a four-year renovation of the four-story residence. The 34,000-square foot home was fitted with a number of modern amenities.
Migdale is at 3872 Route 44, Millbrook.

Texto completo: There are those times when I feel personally connected to someone I have never spoken to or met. Such is the case with Jon Underwood. He lived in London, England, and in 2011 started a social movement that has impacted the world.
Inspired by Swiss sociologist Bernard Crettaz, Jon Underwood thought it was important to develop a forum for public discourse around the taboo topic of death. Adapting Crettaz's model of "Café Mortels," Underwood invited persons for tea and cake and to talk about a matter that is of extreme importance to us all. He coined the name, Death Cafe, and developed a website where people could become affiliate members for free as long as they adhered to the fundamental principles.
Once Death Cafe was picked up by the New York Times, the movement gained momentum. His insistence on a social franchise model rather than any thought of personal gain is remarkable. Now offered in 51 countries, more than 5,000 Death Cafes are operative worldwide to increase awareness of death with a view to helping people make the most of their finite lives.
In Tallahassee, Florida where I live, Big Bend Hospice has sponsored Death Cafes since October of 2013. It has been my privilege to be involved in these community offerings since their beginning.
And that may be why I felt such personal loss to learn that the founder of Death Cafes died unexpectedly on June 27, 2017, at age 44 from a brain hemorrhage attributed to undiagnosed leukemia. Back in 2017, I went to the Death Cafe website to remind myself of the mission statement. It was there that I learned the shocking news that Jon Underwood had died.
A close friend of Jon's, Mark Morris, posted a column about Jon on the Death Cafe website and a brief but remarkable JustGiving video accompanied his post. Jon had quit a comfortable job to focus the last six years of his life on this movement without financial gain, so Morris is concerned for Jon's family.
Jon, who is described as brilliant, humble, and visionary, devoted himself to Death Cafe, believing it could help make the world a better place by changing the way people thought of life and treated each other. The numerous comments on the Death Café website from around the world indicate that he accomplished his goal.
Jon's wife, Donna, wrote of her horrible grief and said, "Through his life he helped tens of thousands of people all over the world to regularly come together, drink tea, eat delicious cake, and take time out to remember what really matters. I don't think it's an overstatement to say he has single-handedly started to change cultures around death and end-of-life awareness, not just in the UK, but across the globe."
The New York Times and Washington Post agree with Donna, as indicated in articles they published about his work.
I loved the song that was the background on the brief video about his life, a song that his 6-year old daughter, Gina, somehow sang. I have not been able to find the name of the song or the composer. It may be original. The message of the song is poignant in ways that relate to the work her father pioneered.
In the simple yet profound act of talking about the one thing that unites us, around the table where we are being nourished, I have witnessed there is more laughter than tears and more conversation about living than dying. By touching on death, our capacity to touch life at its deepest places is increased, the mystery of light and darkness embraced.
The message of the song also relates to her father's unexpected death, the ensuing grief and what it all means. Molly sang:
Before the moon comes out to have her fun/Does she read a bedtime story to the sun?/When the street gets dark outside/Where does the daylight go to hide?/Oh, light and dark you're a mystery to me./Oh, light and dark what a wonderful mystery.
Life and death is a wonderful mystery. Thank you, Jon Underwood.

The W.N.B.A. Thinks It's Found Its Yao

Texto completo: When Yao Ming met Han Xu at the 2018 Asian Games, he learned that they shared an affinity for the Maroon 5 song "Sugar."
Han, a 6-foot-9 rookie center for the Liberty, can relate to Yao -- the 7-6 groundbreaker for Chinese players in the N.B.A. -- over more than Adam Levine's crooning. Although Yao, who retired in 2011, did not broach the topic during their conversation, the demands for Han to follow in his footsteps are evident.
Han, 19, is already being described as a Yao-like figure for women's basketball in China.
During her first game for the Liberty, an 89-71 exhibition win over the Chinese national team at Barclays Center on Thursday, the arena scoreboard repeatedly played ads for Han T-shirts for sale on the concourse. Several large Chinese flags were displayed in the stands.
When Han left the game with 1 minute 29 seconds to play in the fourth quarter, tied with Kia Nurse for a game-high 19 points, Joe Tsai, the Taiwanese-Canadian owner of the Liberty, stood and gave her a high-five.
"Physically and mentally, she's so talented, she can be the best player in the world," said Li Meng, a forward on the Chinese team.
Cultivating a recognizable star from basketball's largest market outside the United States could open up new business opportunities for the W.N.B.A. as it continually seeks more exposure. (Alipay, an online payment platform based in China, was a notable sponsor at Thursday's game.)
"I feel some pressure," Han said. "I represent the whole of China."
The situation did not visibly weigh on Han during a trip to New York for the W.N.B.A. draft last month, when she was selected in the second round.
Han walked the streets of Midtown Manhattan in white Vans, a black accordion skirt, a white turtleneck and a stylish jean jacket. In a day full of touristy visits arranged by the league, Han seemed most invested in an impromptu sojourn into H&M.
She resembled any other teenager, shopping for casual wear and whispering into nooks of Grand Central Terminal. But some people did not treat her that way.
A crew of male construction workers lewdly remarked about her size and her gender. Another man stopped in the middle of a crosswalk on Seventh Avenue and joked flatly, "You must be good at basketball."
Han seemed unaffected by the attention, a demeanor that would bode well for her professional life given the hopes for her in her homeland. Han, who knows some English but is not fluent, kept walking and looking down at her phone even as everyone in the vicinity seemingly looked up at her.
Han was noticeably shy at times but also displayed a quick wit. When asked what her favorite part about the United States was compared with China, Han quipped that it was the air quality.
Before the draft, she was considered one of the most intriguing prospects. Scouts were drawn to her size (she and Brittney Griner are tied atop the league's chart) and her potential; because many of the W.N.B.A.'s top stars play in China during the off-season, Han has regularly faced elite competition.
"She has a high I.Q., incredibly skilled, wants to be one of the best players in the world," said Matt Blue, who coached Han at an academy operated by the N.B.A. in Shandong Province. "I can't think of a better person to usher in the new wave of Chinese players."
Han is from Shijiazhuang, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) southwest of Beijing. Before her, four players from China reached the W.N.B.A -- Zheng Haixia, Sui Feifei, Miao Lijie and Chen Nan. Zheng, whom The New York Times compared to Shaquille O'Neal in 1997, lasted the longest, playing 34 games over two seasons.
Almost a decade had passed since the league had a player from China -- Chen, who suited up for the Chicago Sky in 2009. Another Chinese national team member, Li Yueru, was drafted in the third round this year by the Atlanta Dream.
Two years ago, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver voiced his frustration over the lack of Chinese players competing professionally in North America. In 2016, the N.B.A. opened three academies in China; Han is the first prospect from seven worldwide academies, male or female, to be drafted into the W.N.B.A. or the N.B.A.
"It's no accident China was the first place we went," said Chris Ebersole, the N.B.A.'s director of international basketball operations and elite basketball. "It's a priority market for us as a league. She's going to be big."
It may also seem like no accident that Han was drafted by the Liberty, who in January were bought by Tsai, one of the founders of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group. But Tsai, who is also among the owners of the Nets, said Wednesday: "I didn't make any of this happen. I'm just sort of plopped into the middle of this."
Han was, in fact, on the Liberty's radar for quite some time. Although Blue and Han acknowledged the need for her to get stronger and quicker in lateral movements, Han's talent and range have impressed Tina Charles, the Liberty's star center, who played for a club in Beijing.
They met last September at the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup. In a game against the United States, the eventual gold medal winner, Han led China with 20 points and flustered Charles and Morgan Tuck on both ends of the floor. Although China lost, 100-88, the game was the closest between the two nations in 35 years.
After Charles's team eliminated Han's in the Chinese league playoffs in February, Charles told Han's agent that she would like for the two to train together some day. Now they will be teammates on the Liberty, who were 7-27 last year in the midst of an unsteady ownership situation.
During her sightseeing tour, Han entered the NBA Store and looked blasé while checking out Magic Johnson autographed jerseys or tchotchkes featuring James Harden's beard. But she brightened upon spotting a mural of Charles hidden near a back wall; Han ran up and grazed her hand over Charles's frame, exclaiming, "Whoa, Tina!"
If success follows Han to the United States, she could influence more Chinese players to test the professional waters stateside -- an effect many expected Yao to create as an eight-time All-Star for the Houston Rockets and the first overall pick of the 2002 N.B.A. draft.
Before the draft, ahead of her official entrance into the W.N.B.A. with its great expectations, Han visited the Empire State Building.
After ducking through metal detectors and boarding an express elevator, Han emerged on the 86th floor observation deck. Walking to the skyscraper's western edge, she looked out over Manhattan toward the Hudson River.
"The world is big," Han quietly said to herself. "It's beautiful."

Texto completo: The Boston Celtics slunk out of the 2019 N.B.A. playoffs with a whimper.
There was no switch. There was no extra gear. There was only colossal disappointment. After 82 regular-season contests and nine more in the playoffs, we learned that the Celtics, contrary to all the preseason expectations, achieved exactly what should be expected of a 49-win team: They were good enough to get by lesser teams, but not strong enough to hang with true contenders deep into the playoffs -- teams like the Milwaukee Bucks, who were led by their dynamo of a star, Giannis Antetokounmpo.
Boston was above average. Nothing more. And this for a team that was considered by many to be the biggest threat to the behemoth Golden State Warriors. Forward Draymond Green even said so as recently as January. Some, including New York Times analysts, thought the Celtics would have the best record in the league.
As swingman Jaylen Brown told reporters on Thursday: "The expectations were a banner or nothing. We came up with nothing."
And now, the Celtics enter a crucial off-season having to take a detour from the rebuild executed by their president, Danny Ainge. But there are going to be questions now. The most important: Can the mercurial unrestricted free agent Kyrie Irving be the player to lead the Celtics back to championship contention? Is he even coming back after unexpectedly committing -- at least verbally -- to the franchise in October, only to waffle as the season went on?
And what about the young players? How good are Jayson Tatum, Brown and the others, exactly? Good enough to entice the Pelicans to trade Anthony Davis for them? Is it worth it if Davis doesn't commit to Boston past his current contract?
These are complex propositions for Ainge and the rest of the Celtics brass to consider. But the team that just bowed out had problems right from the start. They were right there for everyone to see, for those willing to believe their eyes, right from a lackluster preseason.
"I knew going in that it was going to be super challenging, but October screamed it," Coach Brad Stevens told ESPN in an interview published Thursday. "I knew after the first two exhibition games, it was going to be really, really hard."
When Boston dominated its rivals, the Philadelphia 76ers, on opening night, 105-87, the league was seemingly put on notice: The Celtics had arrived and the previous year's unexpected Eastern Conference finals run was no fluke. But then Boston struggled, going 10-10 in its first 20 games, with particularly bad losses to the Knicks and the Hornets.
Part of the problem was how the team's offense was structured. In the 2019 version of the N.B.A., the most efficient teams get their points in three ways: from 3-pointers, points in the paint and free throws. Boston's personnel shied away from contact at the rim -- making their offense heavily reliant on 3s. When the shots fell, the Celtics looked like a championship-caliber team. When they didn't, they lost. Often.
But effort and complacency were issues -- perhaps the biggest ones -- leading to several losses resulting from blown double-digit leads. Chemistry issues ran rampant all year long. Irving, who forced his way out of Cleveland so he could be the focal point of a team, routinely threw shots at "the young guys," saying after another underwhelming performance by the team in January, "The young guys don't know what it takes to be a championship level team." Irving is 27, by no means an N.B.A. elder, and his teammates, as Brown admitted recently, bristled at being singled out.
Much of the Celtics' off-season hinges on Irving's decision. If he ends up leaving, his tribute video when he returns to Boston will be a short one. Many in the Celtics fan base (much like Irving, a temperamental bunch) never embraced him in the way they did his predecessor, Isaiah Thomas. Even as Irving turned in a stellar regular season, he'll be remembered more for briefly engaging in the conspiracy theory that the earth is flat and his sustained moodiness. He had very little in terms of on-court standout moments. And this rang even more true in the playoffs, when he shot poorly and was outplayed for long stretches by the Bucks backup George Hill. If this feels unfair, that's because it is. But individual N.B.A. legacies have long been judged by playoff success -- and this campaign, fronted by Irving, was a failure. In fact, the year before, the Celtics went deeper in the postseason without Irving. And not for nothing: He asked for this pressure.
"This is what I signed up for. This is what Boston traded for me for," Irving said to reporters earlier in the Bucks series.
But if he stays, and the Celtics are able to land another star with their trove of assets, the Celtics will once again be preseason darlings. Pulling off a trade, however, could be difficult, as the value of those assets has depreciated.
Very few players tanked their value the way the restricted free agent Terry Rozier did. He enjoyed a far larger role on the Cinderella Celtics, but he struggled in his adjustment to playing on the bench as a backup to Irving. Rozier's shot selection didn't help, either: His penchant for taking step-back 3-pointers early in the shot clock should essentially have been counted as a turnover rather than a missed shot. And yet he might find himself a starter again for Boston next year if Irving leaves.
Gordon Hayward, a former All-Star whose recovery from a horrific ankle injury was delayed by a second injury, never consistently found his form as the season progressed. While he had his moments as a playmaker creating for others, Hayward often looked a step slow and unable to beat his man off the dribble. But executives, coaches and players alike emphasized patience. Hayward needed time but he would come around. But in the playoffs, particularly against the Bucks, Hayward looked no different than he had in the fall.
Brown and Tatum, two tantalizing wing prospects, had uneven seasons and didn't make the leap that was expected of them. And even Boston's chest of draft picks has seen a dip in worth: The Celtics' vaunted Kings pick will most likely be out of the top 10 because of a surprisingly strong regular-season run by Sacramento. Boston will, however, be able to cash in on its lottery-protected Clippers pick after Los Angeles unexpectedly made the playoffs.
But there is some light at the end of the bleak tunnel for the Celtics. The team is one year removed from almost making the N.B.A. finals. Its most recent draft pick, the athletic big man Robert Williams III, showed he could be a part of the future in limited playing time. And, at worst, the Celtics still have draft options, including a potentially high lottery pick that belongs to the Grizzlies. They still have Brown and Tatum, as well as Stevens, who continues to be regarded as one of the game's top basketball minds, though his legacy took a hit this year. If stars hit the trade market, Boston still has the most assets of any potential suitors.
Most important, the Celtics have Ainge, a savvy front-office executive unafraid of swinging for the fences, and strong ownership invested in his strategy. These aren't the Suns or the Wizards, or another franchise in disarray. There is clear organizational direction and a well-established culture.
But of this there is no doubt: This season will leave a sour taste in the mouths of many connected to the Celtics organization. The rebuild continues.

Texto completo: House Democrats have President Donald Trump's attorney general in their crosshairs
The political turf wars continue unabated in Washington, D.C., a 2019 prelude to what will be a brutal 2020 presidential campaign.
The latest chapter was written by U.S. House Judiciary Committee Democrats, who voted Wednesday to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of the House. His alleged sin is failing to turn over portions of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russia's role in the 2016 presidential campaign, as well as the underlying evidence on which Mueller based his conclusions.
The standoff between Barr and the committee prompted the usual rhetorical overkill.
Committee Chairman Gerald Nadler, a New Yorker, stated, "We are now in a constitutional crisis."
The U.S. is most certainly not in the midst of a constitutional crisis -- it's at best a minor tiff that will be addressed through the usual channels -- the courts.
Barr already has released the vast majority of the report, withholding grand jury testimony and other evidence that is by law secret.
So the House is going after Barr for his failure to turn over material that is required by law to be secret?
Democrats answer no, The New York Times explaining that "Democrats said they did not expect Mr. Barr to break the law and unilaterally release grand jury secrets." Instead, they have cited him for contempt for failing "to join them in petitioning a judge to unseal material for the grand jury for committee use."
The House clearly has the right to petition the court for the disputed material and do so anytime it sees fit. Whether it would be successful is open to doubt. At the same time, Barr is under no legal obligation to join committee members in seeking release of grand jury material the law explicitly requires to be secret.
If this really is the basis for the committee's contempt citation, one blessed in advance by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, it's pretty thin gruel on which to base such a serious allegation.
But that's not really the issue -- Democrats don't want the redacted material so much as they want to make a campaign issue out of the redacted material.
Who could blame them? It may be bad policy, but it's great political theater.
This contempt measure, however, is going nowhere fast. For starters, it's substantively ridiculous. Then, there's the not-so-small matter that the Justice Department, which is headed by Barr, would have to prosecute the attorney general.
House Republicans cited former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for contempt for failing to turn over subpoenaed materials related to the "Fast and Furious" government gun-running operation. Nothing came of it because Holder's Justice Department declined to prosecute Holder.
So what we have here is so much sound and fury, signifying not much of anything.
Democrats, naturally, were disappointed by Mueller's finding that there was no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to affect the presidential election. But they have lived to fight another day by taking the fallback position that the redacted material somehow represents the keys to the kingdom in their campaign to impeach Trump.
It's not. If they really thought it was, Nadler and his Democratic colleagues would be sprinting to the courthouse, not making an issue about Barr exercising his discretion not to join them.

Texto completo: She got her start as a child, doing community theater in Eagan, but soon Caroline Innerbichler will embody a Disney heroine for the entire country. A Minnesota native who has appeared regularly at Ordway Center, Chanhassen Dinner Theatres, Children's Theatre and Theater Latt Da, Innerbichler has been cast in the national tour of the smash Broadway musical "Frozen." She'll play Anna -- the royal sister who does not sing "Let It Go." Last summer, audiences saw her playing the lead in the Ordway's "Mamma Mia," but she cut her (gleaming) Disney princess teeth as Ariel in Chanhassen's "The Little Mermaid," where she also appeared as Sandy in "Grease." Innerbichler previously toured the country in the stage adaptation of "Little House on the Prairie," which premiered at the Guthrie Theater. She will reappear with the Guthrie this summer for "Guys and Dolls." Innerbichler, like two-time Tony Award nominee Laura Osnes, began her career with teacher and director Dennis Swanson, who created theater programs at several Minnesota schools. The "Frozen" tour kicks off in November and will check in at Minneapolis' Orpheum Theatre next May.

From Palace to the Met
We really thought we were done writing about Lizzo for at least a week or two following her long-awaited homecoming Sunday at the Palace. But then she went straight from her St. Paul show to the fashion world's biggest event of the year, where she made a splash even among some of the top trendsetting celebs. "Lizzo rolled in, spun around and started happily cursing, spreading joy through expletives," the New York Times wrote of the hip-hop star's appearance at the Met Gala in New York Monday. Falling in alongside the likes of Lady Gaga, the Kardashians, Katy Perry and Cardi B, Lizzo wore a pink dress by Marc Jacobs with a matching pink boa-style wrap and candy-like hair. "I feel very sexy, glamorous, expensive and beautiful," she told Vogue.

Lights out for Dietz
Northern Spark co-director Steve Dietz is stepping away from the arts all-nighter he founded in 2008. His last day will come sometime early next year, after a gradual phaseout of administrative duties. "I believe that change is positive and that it is important for generations to move on and let younger generations come in and have their own point of view and approach to things," said Dietz by phone. He does not have any solid plans regarding his next move, but is currently working closely with co-director Sarah Peters on a succession plan. This year's festival, themed "We Are Here: Resilience, Renewal and Regeneration," will take place June 14-15 from sunset to sunrise each night.

Seven-headed monster
Red Eye Theater is still searching for a permanent performance space, but the experimental company does have a new artistic director -- or rather, seven of them: playwrights Hayley Finn and Rachel Jendrzejewski; theater makers Theo Langason and Andrew Lee Dolan, and dance artists Emily Gastineau, Valerie Oliveiro and Jeffrey Wells. According to Gastineau, the benefit of hiring seven people is that each brings connections to other institutions, paving the way for future partnerships. "Frankly, everyone is already leveraging an artistic practice with various jobs," she said. Red Eye was forced from its original home near Loring Park in September, making way for a new six-story apartment development just as its founders Steve Busa and Miriam Must were preparing to retire. The group's annual New Works 4 Weeks Festival opens May 30 at the Cowles Center's intimate JSB Tek Box.

Infusion of African-American art
The Minneapolis Institute of Art just acquired 33 new works by African-American artists from the South. The art came via the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, an organization dedicated to placing those artists in museums' permanent collections. "Relative to other encyclopedic museums, we don't really have a high percentage of works by African-American artists," said painting curator Bob Cozzolino. These works will become part of a show in 2020. In the meantime, Cozzolino is working with African art curator Jan-Lodewijk Grootaers to put one of the pieces, Thornton Dial's "Monument to the Minds of the Little Negro Steelworkers" (2001-03), on view in Gallery 375 sometime in August.A.E.

Texto completo: With renewed attention to President Donald Trump's taxes, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst said she thinks the president should voluntarily release his returns.
"I think he should voluntarily release them, yes," Ernst said in response to a reporter's question Wednesday.
Asked why she thought that was important, Ernst responded: "Well, I'm not saying it's important, but I think there are a lot of folks that have stated they want to see them. Now that's up to him, again, voluntarily, I would like to see him do that. But I don't know what bearing that has on whether he's qualified to be president or not."
At a 2017 town hall in Cedar Rapids, Ernst said, "I think he should," in response to a question about the possibility of Trump releasing his tax returns. She clarified back then that she didn't support legislative efforts to compel the president to do so.
Traditionally, presidential candidates release their tax returns to allow the public to assess their income sources, tax rates and charitable contributions. Trump resisted the tradition. Many of the horde of Democrats running for presidential this year have already done so.
Ernst's latest remarks come after the New York Times obtained tax information that showed Trump reported losses of more than $1 billion from 1985 to 1994.
They also come as U.S. House Democrats are ramping up their efforts to get more information about the president's tax returns. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused to release them in response to a request by a Democrat-led committee.
Mnuchin sent a letter to the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee that called the request "unprecedented." Mnuchin added he believes "it presents serious constitutional questions, the resolution of which may have lasting consequences for all taxpayers."

A Furniture Designer Re-emerges

Texto completo: At the International Furniture Fair in Milan last month, a wingback chair sat in the exhibition space of the Italian furniture company De Padova, seemingly waiting for someone in a tea-length dress to sink into it with a cocktail.
The chair, with its matching, swooping ottoman, was a revival of a 1956 piece by Paul McCobb, an American designer from the "Mad Men" era. As recently as last year, the only McCobb furniture you could find was in vintage shops and auction houses. Then the first reissues began to trickle out. Now, a half-century after his death, freshly manufactured McCobbs are flowing back to the market.
What took so long? Paul McCobb was the quintessential designer for the middle class who outfitted starter homes in postwar subdivisions as gracefully as he did the suburban colonials of law partners and business executives. His gift for producing fine quality at a reasonable price has arguably never been matched.
In his time he was as famous as Charles and Ray Eames. Maybe more so. In 1957, Bloomingdale's showed 15 McCobb room settings, stocked with 348 designs. "We treat Paul's furniture like sugar in the grocery store -- it's a staple," the store's modern furniture buyer told The New York Times that year.
Indeed, a classic 1961 Playboy Magazine photo of leading furniture designers posing with their chairs (because industrial design was actually considered sexy in those days) was supposed to have included McCobb, along with Charles Eames, George Nelson, Edward Wormley, Harry Bertoia, Eero Saarinen and Jens Risom.
"You see him in photos at the party the night before; his furniture is at the Chicago mansion," said Jonathan Goldstein, a New York-based design historian and McCobb authority, who interviewed two of McCobb's staff members about the event. "But the next day in the morning when it's time to come downstairs for the shoot, he was too hung over."
Mr. Goldstein described McCobb as charismatic, but said he believed the designer's irascible personality, corrosive business dealings and lack of champions in the decades that followed his death at the age of 51, from complications of chronic hypertension, helped write him out of the historical record.
The turnaround came in 2016, when Form Portfolios, a Danish-American company that works with furniture manufacturers to bring back midcentury modern pieces, acquired the design rights from McCobb's estate. At last month's Milan fair not just McCobb's 1956 wingback chair was on display, but also furnishings and accessories revived by the Danish companies Fritz Hansen and Karakter.
In July, Ralph Pucci in New York will reissue five McCobb pieces including the 1962 Symmetric sofa, which has curving arms and a ribbed upholstered back.
"Discovering Paul McCobb was an act of instant love mixed with wonder for his clean, linear forms and sparsely elegant designs," Form Portfolios's director, Anders Brun, writes in "Shapes of Paul McCobb." Published last month by Ark Journal in Copenhagen, the book promotes what Mr. Brun describes as "the second coming" of the designer. "It felt like the excitement of hearing a new artist and thinking, 'why is this guy still unsigned?"'
A native of suburban Boston, with strains of William Shatner and John F. Kennedy in his looks, McCobb took art classes and was self-trained as a designer. After working as a window dresser in Boston, he served briefly in the United States Army Corps of Engineers' camouflage corps during World War II. In 1945, he set up an independent studio in New York and designed furniture, textiles and decorative objects for a mosaic of companies, including some in which he had an ownership stake.
Thunderous success came with the 1950 release of the Planner Group. The pieces, which were Shaker-simple and slim, in novel combinations of birch, maple and iron, fit the tight footprints of postwar houses and were finished in back so that they could go anywhere in a room.
Planner's entry-level prices made it the Ikea of its time. It was the best-selling furniture collection in the United States from 1950 until 1962.
But unlike Ikea, which it never matched for affordability but far surpassed in quality, Planner stuck with its youthful consumers as they grew up and earned more. As the name intimated, buyers could start with a few pieces and later add from the group, with each acquisition slipping harmoniously into a room setting. Or they could shop from McCobb's more expensive lines such as Directional and Widdicomb, which he upgraded with custom finishes and materials like walnut and brass.
To understand further what made McCobb a rock star, I asked two designers to join me on different trips last summer to the Gallery at 200 Lex Powered by Incollect at the New York Design Center in Manhattan. Both of my companions looked with love upon a pair of Planner night stands from 1953. The wood, iron and bamboo set had cost about $ 30 at the time it was released (about $ 286 in 2019 dollars). In the unchained vintage realm, the tables were now priced at $ 8,800.
Mark Goetz, who designs for Herman Miller and Bernhardt Design among other companies, praised the machine-made dovetail joints, the simple wood bracket supporting the drawer and the bamboo shelf imparting delicacy to a composition of multitextured planes. The rough welds at the iron frame corners had "a handmade quality" that McCobb was "not apologizing for, and is very direct and simple," not to mention economical, Mr. Goetz said.
Gregory Beson, a custom furniture maker with a master's degree in industrial design from Parsons School of Design, said of the nightstand, "This is how I would build it if I were going to make something like this." He pointed out that the iron brace at the bottom wasn't structurally necessary but added to the floaty feeling. And he was charmed by the drilled-out finger pulls that allowed each drawer to slide open with an easy tug, no hardware involved.
As furniture companies revive McCobb, they are tweaking the pieces to fit modern bodies and aiming at a far more affluent audience than starter homeowners. A publicist at Ralph Pucci said the new McCobb Symmetric Group sofa would be recognizable as such, but its seat cushions would be "a little more comfortable and not as much midcentury slim." It is expected to cost $ 20,500. (In 1963 you could buy it for $ 529 at Macy's, or about $ 4,395 in 2019 dollars.)
Last year, Christian Elving, the chief executive of Karakter, said that his company had to strengthen the legs on the 1952 Planner steel-legged console table to better withstand the weight of a prototype Planner-adapted drop-lid cabinet, which could be placed on top to create a desk. "Many of the original pieces are actually poorly engineered and executed for actual use," he said. The console table is listed for 2,531 euros (about $ 2,820) on Karakter's website.
McCobb fans -- including collectors who outfit entire homes with his midcentury furnishings and accessories -- have much to celebrate with the resurgence of their hero. But it is a reflection on modern economics and the shrinking middle class that these new pieces are destined for the homes of the elite. We are reacquainted with the products but not the populism.
Jonathan Goldstein, the McCobb historian, who consults with Form Portfolios, said he believed that this turn of events was inevitable. "I doubt that McCobb could achieve the economies of scale today that he achieved in the 1950s," he said, referring to the low costs of domestic materials and labor that made Planner's success possible, along with the marketing push that came from McCobb's celebrity. (Few designers at that time were brands.)
"It was a singularity," he said.

Texto completo: Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is investigating the FBI’s reliance on the unverified dossier produced by British ex-spy Christopher Steele in the surveillance of a Trump campaign associate “despite questions about [Steele’s] credibility."
Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal reports Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele, described as a “key source”, who was used to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants against former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page.

This is part of Horowitz’s broad investigation into alleged FISA abuse and more.
Steele’s dossier was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS, which had reached out to and contracted Steele.
Michael Horowitz, Christopher Steele
The new Wall Street Journal report says the inspector general’s office “has been asking why the FBI continued to cite Steele as a credible source in the renewal applications.” And a specific focus of Horowitz’s team is apparently “a news report cited extensively in the [FISA] applications that appeared to bolster Steele’s credibility… [which] said U.S. intelligence officials were investigating allegations similar to those Steele had raised.”
The “news report” was written by Yahoo News journalist Michael Isikoff, who said he was stunned when he learned that his September 2016 article for Yahoo News was used in the FISA applications targeting Carter Page to bolster Steele’s credibility, despite his source being Steele himself. Iskoff said “it’s self-referential” and “it seems a little odd that they would cite the Yahoo News story about the matter they are investigating themselves based on the same material that had been separately presented to the FBI.”

Isikoff personally met with Steele in person in September 2016. Also at the meeting was Isikoff’s “old friend” Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS. The three of them talked about Trump and Russia and Steele provided him with some of his research.
Isikoff now admits that everyone should have been more cautious about Steele’s information. “I think it’s fair to say that all of us should have approached this, in retrospect, with more skepticism, particularly when we didn’t know where it was coming from,” Isikoff said. “We knew that Steele compiled it, but that Steele did not hear these allegations himself. Somebody else heard them from others and then passed them along. That’s thirdhand stuff, which is not usually the kind you want for publishing.”
In the FISA renewal applications, which spanned until June 2017, the FBI continued to insist that it didn’t think Steele was Isikoff’s source even though Steele himself had said that he was by the spring of 2017.
The Wall Street Journal report says “investigators have also asked about an internal FBI evaluation of Steele’s credibility that found his reporting had been ‘minimally corroborated’ even as it also said he had provided information ‘of value’ to the U.S. intelligence community.” The report says “the evaluation was reflected in a ‘human source validation report’ written by a unit of the FBI after the bureau cut off its relationship with Steele in October 2016… because of his disclosures to the media about his work for the FBI.”
Heavily redacted FBI records unearthed through Freedom of Information Act litigation in 2018 show that Steele was cut off as a confidential human source because of his improper disclosures to third parties and that his “handling agent advised [Steele] that [Confidential Human Source] was not to operate to obtain any intelligence whatsoever on behalf of the FBI.”
According to a New York Times report from April, the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources in an attempt to determine their credibility, and as early as January 2017 agents had reportedly concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based upon “Russian disinformation.”

For its part, Fusion GPS told the Washington Examiner that it stands by Steele’s dossier, claiming that “to our knowledge, nothing in the Steele memoranda has been disproven.”

Journalist Bob Woodward has been calling Steele’s dossier “garbage” for more than two years. And former CIA Moscow station chief Daniel Hoffman said: “I called what bullshit the dossier was a year and a half ago… It’s likely FSB [the successor agency to the KGB] disinformation.” A number of Steele’s biggest claims — including its allegation from "Kremlin insiders" that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had met in Prague with Putin associates and foreign hackers — were knocked down by special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

Attorney General William Barr told Congress that the Justice Department has launched an investigation into how the DOJ and the FBI handled the Trump-Russia investigation, and he said that “the people helping me with my review will be working very closely with” Horowitz.

Horowitz, who launched his investigation in 2018, said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Carter Page].”
Horowitz stated that he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is Steele.
Barr has said Horowitz’s investigation should be completed in either May or June.

Texto completo: When Donald Trump comes to Wisconsin and lies in a way that could conceivably provoke violence against innocent people, it's hard to ignore.
But, for the most part, ignore it we should.
Late last month, President Trump among scores of lies at a Green Bay rally falsely claimed that mothers and doctors sometimes discuss whether to "execute" babies after they are born.
He then lashed out at Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers for promising to veto a related antiabortion bill being approved by Republicans in legislatures around the country, a bill intended to enflame the GOP's conservative base.
It's a phony issue.
Evers has noted that protections already exist for babies born alive, but Trump and allies are apparently willing to risk inciting violence against abortion providers for perceived political gain.
Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, "This is the kind of dangerous rhetoric that encourages the violence carried out today."
He was referring to a deadly attack on a California synagogue that happened earlier in the day that Trump spoke in Green Bay. The shooter expressed white-supremacist and anti-Semitic views in an online forum shortly before the attack.
At the rally, Trump said, "We're going to get to the bottom of a lot of things happening in our country."
Yet it is Trump's incendiary lies that serve as calls to action for unstable haters or, as Trump might call them, "many fine people."
For all of Trump's noxious rhetoric, defeating him in 2020 before he can further debase America could well depend on answers to three questions, none relating to such politics of hate. They are: Is the economy working for me?
Is Trump really on my side?
Do I like the Democratic candidate's approach?
My first question should be asked by the working class. Its members continue to struggle as they did pre-Trump. Unemployment is low, but many jobs cannot support families. Many of those jobs are at or near the minimum wage, and it is Trump and fellow Republicans who regularly oppose any increases. Trump boasted in Wisconsin that state unemployment is at a historic low, but there's no boasting about how much those jobs pay.
And a new Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests that how people feel about the economy may drive their perception of whether he's on their side.
The potency of the economic issue for Trump is "complicated," a Post story said, because those polled believe the economy mainly still benefits people other than them. In the survey, 60 percent of voters said the country's economic system primarily helps those in power, while 72 percent said that about the country's political structures.
Trump needs to win the economic argument. Other core issues of Trump's first campaign illegal immigration, health care and trade do not poll well for the president, the story said. He failed on promises to build a wall against immigrants and to overturn the Affordable Care Act, and his protectionist trade policy has been a controversial mess across broad swaths of the economy.
So, it's the economy, stupid to borrow a Bill Clinton political adage.
Trump and the GOP love to brag about tax changes in 2017 I refuse to call it "reform" that ballooned federal budget deficits.
Ordinary people seem to understand what it really meant, reflected in this recent Bloomberg Businessweek headline: "The tax law's big winner is the millionaire CEO." The article cited a poll that said a majority of respondents did not think the law saved them any money, though an analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated that Americans saved an average of $1,600, an amount "so slight and so spread out that they didn't notice."
The wealthy, the article said, must certainly have noticed how tax cuts impacted them. Savings by the top 1 percent of income earners averaged more than $51,000 and by the top 0.1 percent more than $193,000, the study revealed.
An under-emphasized impact of the cuts was the massive reduction in corporate tax rates. "Corporate shareholders made out like bandits," said a senior fellow at the tax policy center.
Trump succeeds marvelously at playing working-class whites. Paul Krugman of the New York Times explains how.
"Exploiting racial resentment to capture white working-class voters, while pursuing policies that benefit only the wealthy, has been the core of the party's political strategy for decades. That's why, in an increasingly diverse country, Republican support has stayed overwhelmingly white.
"In a fundamental sense, Trumpism is the culmination of that strategy. Commentators keep calling Mr. Trump a 'populist,' but the only way in which he actually caters to working-class white voters is by appealing to their racial animus. He may be successful in doing so partly because it's the only thing about his political persona that's sincere: All indications are that he really is a racist."
My third question which of the Democrats will offer the most broadly appealing economic message? will play out in months ahead.
That the Democratic nominee will be of higher character than Trump is a given. Has there ever been a lower bar?
But one assumes that the fundamental variable in choosing the nominee perhaps trumping personality, experience, age, race and gender will be his or her master plan for the economy.
Will it be a fiery democratic socialist making dramatic promises about upending the health care system and giving free tuition, or, conversely, will it be someone who makes a credible case for achievable change?
My framing betrays my preference.
Here in Wisconsin, Evers provides a model. He promised and now is attempting to deliver on improving health care, public education and fixing roads credible, relatable goals. They appeal especially to educated GOP-leaning voters, especially women.
Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt chortled in a recent Washington Post op-ed that Trump will win easily in 2020 because financial markets and the economy are generally strong and incumbent presidents hardly ever lose. (The last was George H.W. Bush in 1992.) So, to fellow progressives, my advice is that when Trump blurts out his next incendiary lie, don't simply turn to cable television for talking points in response.
Instead, you should spend time identifying and then supporting the Democrat who best speaks to the nation's economic future, one that will benefit our children and grandchildren.
Because, more than ever, that's what matters most. CREDIT: By Paul Fanlund

'Heartbeat bills' are wholesome provocations

Texto completo: While constitutional lawyers, ethicists and theologians — in descending order of importance in the abortion debate — have been arguing in the 46 years since the Supreme Court attempted to settle the debate, some technologists have been making a consequential contribution to it. They have developed machines that produce increasingly vivid sonograms of fetal development. This concreteness partially explains the intensification of the debate.
Six states have passed "heartbeat bills" to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable, about six weeks after conception. Such bills are, indeed, unconstitutional given the court's Roe ukase that abortion cannot be restricted before a fetus is viable outside the womb — which means, presumably, before the fetus is a child.
But why should "viability" be the dispositive criterion? Viable means capable of surviving outside the womb, which no infant can do without constant help that others must give. Must. No infants are "viable" in that all are helpless, and the law requires that help be given by those responsible for the infant.
A New York Times editorial (Dec. 28, 2018) opposing the idea that "a fetus in the womb has the same rights as a fully formed person" spoke of these living fetuses — that they are living is an elementary biological fact, not an abstruse theological deduction — as "clusters of cells that have not yet developed into viable human beings." Now, delete the obfuscating and constitutionally irrelevant adjective "viable," and look at a sonogram of a ten-week fetus. Note the eyes and lips, the moving fingers and, yes, the beating heart. Is this most suitably described as a "cluster of cells" or as a baby? The cluster-of-cells contingent resembles Chico Marx in the movie "Duck Soup": "Who ya gonna believe, me or your own eyes?"
The "heartbeat bills" are wholesome provocations: One of their aims is to provoke thinking about the moral dimension of extinguishing a being with a visibly beating heart. Furthermore, pro-life people are being provoked in different ways.
Last month, Kansas' Supreme Court found in this from the state constitution — "All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" — a reason to overturn the state's ban on D&E (dilation-and-evacuation) abortions that involve dismemberment of the living fetus. In February, after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed an executive order to enforce taxpayer-funded abortions, Democratic legislators decided that not even that was enough. They introduced a bill to create a right to abortion for any reason at any point in a pregnancy, a bill similar to legislation enacted or advancing in other Democratic-controlled states. In February, all but three Democratic U.S. senators opposed, thereby killing, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse's Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act that would have required, in the rare cases in which a child survives a botched abortion procedure, that the survivor receive the standard professional care that would be given to any child born alive at the same gestational age.
The 1850s debates that propelled Abraham Lincoln to greatness concerned not whether slavery should be abolished forthwith, which was neither a constitutional nor political possibility. Rather, the debates concerned two other questions: Would national policy stigmatize slavery as a tragic legacy and a moral wrong? And: Would policy confine slavery to its existing dominion by banning it from the territories, thereby, Lincoln thought, putting it on a path to ultimate extinction?
Temperate pro-life advocates, practicing Lincolnian prudence, consider the abortion debate akin to the slavery debates for three reasons: Abortion shrinks the scope of the concept of personhood. The issue has been inflamed by judicial fiat (Roe v. Wade as Dred Scott v. Sandford). And confining a morally objectionable practice is a worthy, albeit not fully satisfying, objective.
The changed composition of the Supreme Court, and the supposed imminent danger that Roe will be overturned, is the excuse that pro-abortion extremists have seized upon to do what they want to do anyway: to normalize extreme abortion practices expressive of the belief that never does fetal life have more moral significance than a tumor in a mother's stomach. (Most European nations restrict abortions by at least week 13. France and Germany are very restrictive after 12, Sweden after 18.) The court's new composition has encouraged some pro-life advocates in their maximum hope, that Roe can be overturned, which would not proscribe abortion but would restore its pre-1973 status as a practice states can regulate. This is not a foreseeable possibility; a more nuanced abortion regime is.

Texto completo: Illustration Ann Coulter Syndicated columnist

So Joe Biden launched his presidential campaign talking about Charlottesville.
This tells us that life is so good for the fabulous people on the coasts — the only group the Democratic Party really cares about — that they can afford to devote themselves to crazy fantasies that make them feel morally superior to other people.
The Democratic Party used to be about protecting workers' wages. Now the pitch is: I will suck up more to The New York Times editorial page.
I am in no mood to defend Trump, but the media's wholesale lying about Charlottesville is too much for any sane person to take. Everything the media say about it is the very definition of "fake news."
No human being, dead or alive, has condemned "white supremacists" more than Trump has. I can't begin to quote all the times he has done so, or this column would be the length of a book.
Within the first hour of the melee, the #Resist geniuses were already blaming Trump for the mere existence of white supremacists and neo-Nazis. It kind of looks like Trump was going to be called a Nazi no matter what he did.
At 10 a.m. on Aug. 12, 2017, Rosie O'Donnell tweeted a photo of Nazi flags at the rally, with the comment: "THE TRUMP EFFECT #25thAmendmentNow #stopTRUMP"
Soon thereafter, Rob Reiner tweeted: "Let's be clear. The hatred we're seeing in Virginia lies at the feet of Donald Trump. Stoked during the campaign, his silence condones this."
Alyssa Milano tweeted at 11:59 a.m.: "Hey, you going to comment on this, @realdonaldtrump? #AltReich"
Trump was a Nazi because some of the people who hate him managed to get on Twitter a few hours before he did that day. (He was golfing.)
Around 1 p.m., Trump began tweeting about Charlottesville, saying, among other things:
"We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!"
"We must remember this truth: No matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are ALL AMERICANS FIRST."
The actresses said: NOT GOOD ENOUGH! (Sarah Silverman: "This is on-purpose vague bc ur a wimp that stands 4 nothing ...")
Trump's statements were a LOT more condemnatory than any Obama statements on either the Dallas cop-killer or the Muslim who murdered 13 people at Fort Hood.
• Obama, two days after a black supremacist gunned down five policemen during a BLM protest against the police: "I think it's very hard to untangle the motives of this shooter."
• Obama, the day after the massacre at Fort Hood by an assailant shouting "Allahu Akbar!": "I would caution against jumping to conclusions until we have all the facts."
Back to Trump's shockingly inadequate response to violence in Charlottesville. Later that day, the president reiterated the color-or-creed point and condemned the "hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides."
Then we were off to the races! He said MANY SIDES. Q.E.D. He's a Nazi.
That's when twits like Marco Rubio and Mitt Romney said: Wrong! On one side were FASCISTS and on the other, anti-fascists, who are pure of heart and cute as little puppies ... as they beat the crap out of college conservatives.
New York Times reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg, reporting from the ground in Charlottesville, had tweeted: "The hard left seemed as hate-filled as alt-right. I saw club-wielding 'antifa' beating white nationalists being led out of the park."
Trump was a monster for seeing the same antifa violence that a New York Times reporter saw. (The left went mental on Stolberg, so she deleted that tweet. Reality must not be allowed to interfere with the media's lies!)
Two days later, Trump held a press conference on Charlottesville expressly to denounce neo-Nazis and white supremacists for the billion-and-oneth time: "Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans."
The following day, at a press conference on infrastructure, the press had about two questions on that topic and dozens of accusatory statements on Charlottesville.
• "Let me ask you, Mr. President, why did you wait so long to blast neo-Nazis?"
(It's been nearly a decade since a Muslim shot up Fort Hood in Texas and we're still waiting for Obama to "blast" Nidal Malik Hasan.)
• "Why do Nazis like you?"
(Was Obama ever asked why cop-killers liked him?)
The rest of the reporters' questions were more in the nature of "statements":
Q: Nazis were there. Q: David Duke was there. Q: The neo-Nazis started this.
In a press conference that was — again — on infrastructure, Trump spent paragraph after paragraph — more than 200 words — denouncing white supremacists and neo-Nazis. He condemned "hatred" and "bigotry," called the driver of the car that killed Heather Heyer a "murderer," and repeatedly said "the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists" were "very bad people."
But he also said: "Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee."
Trump clearly distinguished between the people "protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee" and "the bad ones" — the "neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them."
"You had people — and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally. But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. OK? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.
"Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people. But you also had troublemakers, and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets, and with the baseball bats. You had a lot of bad people in the other group."
Actual question from a reporter: "Sir, I just didn't understand what you were saying. You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly?"
That idiocy has now been enshrined as a canonical belief of the Democratic Party, worthy of launching a presidential campaign. Life must be great on the coasts.

Texto completo: BATH — The Chocolate Church Arts Center is thrilled to bring multiple award-winning female songwriters Eliza Gilkyson, Gretchen Peters and Mary Gauthier to perform together as an alternative folk supergroup Three Women and The Truth at 7:30 p.m. Sunday, May 19, at the center, 804 Washington St.
This is an opportunity to see three legendary songwriters perform together on one stage. With three voices and three guitars, Three Women and The Truth shares the hard-won wisdom from lifetimes spent in pursuit of the song.
Gilkyson is a twice Grammy-nominated folk singer whose songs have been covered by Joan Baez, Bob Geldof and Rosanne Cash. She has won countless Folk Alliance and Austin Music awards, including 2014’s Songwriter of the Year.
Peters, a member of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, has written songs for artists from Etta James to Bonnie Raitt and The Neville Brothers. In 2015, U.K. newspaper The Telegraph named her one of the greatest 60 female singer-songwriters of all time.
Gauthier, named by the Associated Press as one of the best songwriters of her generation, has released albums that have garnered praise from the LA Times and the New York Times (“best independent release of the year”). Her most recent release, “Rifles & Rosary Beads” (a collection of songs co-written with wounded veterans), was nominated for 2018’s Record of the Year by the Americana Music Association.
Tickets for Three Women and the Truth are $32 in advance and $35 at the door.

Texto completo: It took a few days, but the New York Times finally got around to apologizing for publishing in its international edition a grossly anti-Semitic cartoon depicting a blind President Trump wearing a yarmulke and being led by a dog resembling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The dog wore a Star of David around its neck.
At first the Times blamed a single editor and poor oversight, but Sunday the newspaper issued a formal apology.
That might be acceptable were the incident an aberration, but Bret Stephens noted in a scathing column for his own newspaper, "The Times has a longstanding Jewish problem, dating back to World War II, when it mostly buried news about the Holocaust, and continuing into the present day in the form of intensely adversarial coverage of Israel. The criticism goes double when it comes to the editorial pages, whose overall approach toward the Jewish state tends to range, with some notable exceptions, from tut-tutting disappointment to thunderous condemnation."
The Israeli ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, responded to the cartoon, calling the newspaper "a cesspool of hostility" toward Israel. There is much history of the newspaper's "coverage" of Jews and Israel that proves him right.
Defenders of the Times claim a difference between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, but this is like saying "I don't hate black people, I am just opposed to recognizing their civil rights."
The Times' coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is clearly pro-Palestinian. In its news stories, editorials and columns, the paper often portrays Israel as the obstacle to peace because it won't surrender to Palestinian demands to forfeit more land and support a two-state solution, by which the Palestinian leadership means a one-state solution achieved by the eradication of the Jewish state.
There are more subtle jabs at Israel and Jewish people in the newspaper's stories. The list could fill several columns, but here's a sample. In 2015, the Times published a chart labeling Democratic lawmakers opposed to the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran as "Jewish?" or not. The chart was removed from its online version after an outcry.
In 2013, the Times published the obituary of a woman whose three sons died in attacks against Israel. The headline read, "Mariam Farhat, 64, the 'Mother of Martyrs.'" As Clay Waters of the Media Research Center noted, "The text box couched the terrorism in passive terms: 'A woman who took unusual pride in how three of her sons died.' The word 'terrorism' didn't even appear in the obituary by William Yardley, who also called the murderous part of Hamas the 'military wing'."
In 2012, The Times' East Africa reporter worked in a swipe at Israel in a story about the genocide in Rwanda. Jeffrey Gettleman wrote, "...like Israel, Rwanda has succeeded in leveraging the guilt that other countries feel for not intervening in its genocide." Ah, that old trope about Jewish guilt.
In 2011, Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote about the favorable response Members of Congress gave to visiting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "I sure hope that Israel's prime minister ... understands that the standing ovation he got in Congress this year was not for his politics. That ovation was bought and paid for by the Israel lobby."
There are many more recent examples. The cartoon merely adds to the list.
The Times' reporting and commentary is one thread — but an influential one — in a pattern contributing to the rise of anti-Semitism worldwide. These include recent shootings at American synagogues, the defacing of Jewish cemeteries, the return of Nazi symbols and the proliferation of white supremacist web pages.
Denunciations of such talk, symbolism and acts of violence are not enough. Sadly, more houses of worship are hiring armed guards, but even that only addresses the symptoms of hate, not the disease itself. The Times might consider contributing to solutions, rather than adding to the problem.

A Cannabis Extract Won't Get You High, but It Might Get You Arrested

Texto completo: DUNCANVILLE, Tex. -- When the police raided Amy Wazwaz's tobacco shop in North Texas this spring, officers seized every product containing CBD oil, from bath balms to lollipops.
CBD, short for cannabidiol, is a chemical compound derived from the cannabis plant, but one that does not result in a high. It has become wildly popular during the last several months because of claims that it helps with a variety of ailments, from anxiety and diabetes to headaches and menstrual cramps.
But while CBD is now as common as coffee in some neighborhoods, sold in shopping malls and tested by a national hamburger chain, possession of CBD in some places can prompt an arrest.
In Duncanville, a suburb of Dallas, the authorities broke down the door of Ms. Wazwaz's store, seized CBD products and thousands of dollars in cash, and confiscated employees' personal cellphones.
"I'm not some mob boss," Ms. Wazwaz said in an interview. "I'm a soccer mom with kids."
Confusion over CBD dates back years, but it intensified last year when a provision of the 2018 Farm Bill lifted a federal ban on hemp production that had previously classified hemp as a controlled substance on a par with heroin.
Both hemp and marijuana are varieties of the cannabis plant, which is believed to have been among the first plants that humans cultivated. The plants produce a family of chemicals known as cannabinoids, some of which are psychoactive -- meaning they produce a high when smoked or ingested -- while others are not. A major difference between marijuana and hemp lies in how much of each they produce.
Marijuana is rich in THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component; it can account for as much as 40 percent of the total cannabinoid content. Hemp, on the other hand, is richer in CBD, and generally contains only 0.3 percent THC or less. CBD oils, which are processed from the hemp plant, are legal to possess under the new federal law as long as they, too, contain no more than 0.3 percent THC.
Most states, though, have yet to change their laws to match the new federal rules, leaving local police and prosecutors in a quandary over what is legal and what is not. The result has been a gold rush of CBD marketers, a raft of online ruminations about what is permissible, and, increasingly, confusion.
For instance, when farmers in Oregon and Kentucky, which produce large amounts of hemp, send their product through Oklahoma and Idaho, truck drivers are sometimes arrested by state and local police for drug trafficking.
Though now legal under federal law, CBD is still subject to regulation when it is sold with a claim of therapeutic benefit. Federal policy maintains that adding CBD oil to food products is the same as adding a prescription drug -- in other words, forbidden without a doctor's prescription. But states and cities have made their own rules on the issue, creating up a dizzying, sometimes contradictory patchwork of regulations for consumers, who also have few rigorous scientific trials or studies to rely on about the product's true effects and limitations.
A recent Colorado law, for example, appears to clash with federal rules by stating that all parts of the hemp plant can be legally added to food for sale. And Missouri, which only a few months ago approved medical marijuana, now allows CBD to be served in alcohol.
Elsewhere, California, Georgia and New York City have sided with the federal authorities, banning the addition of CBD to food. In New York, health inspectors have begun to confiscate CBD-infused cookies.
Adding to the chaos, officials in Texas, Ohio, Nebraska and other states have arrested people for selling CBD products regardless of whether they contain levels of THC higher than the 0.3 percent permitted under the new federal rules.
The Food and Drug Administration has scheduled a public hearing this month on the safety, sale and use of products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds, including CBD.
Texas is where much of the tension has arisen.
CBD products are widely available in Texas, even though state law allows prosecutors to charge people with a felony for possessing a product that contains even the slightest amount of THC.
In Austin, the police say they believe CBD products containing less than 0.3 percent THC are legal. Yet in Tarrant County, home to Fort Worth, Sharen Wilson, the district attorney, has said she will prosecute all CBD cases whether or not any level of THC is present.
Benson Varghese, a Texas criminal defense lawyer who has handled cannabinoid cases, said state lawmakers have not moved quickly enough to address the disarray.
"The citizens of Texas really need clarity," he said, "because you have a lot of people who don't think they're doing anything wrong, but if you're on the wrong side of a county line, you could be prosecuted for a felony."
Residents in San Antonio may be confused even if they don't cross any jurisdictional lines.
Joe Gonzales, the local prosecutor, said, "We won't proceed on prosecuting CBD cases until the Texas Legislature clarifies the law." But the city's police department says it considers any amount of THC present in CBD to be illegal, punishable as a felony.
Around San Antonio, CBD is sold openly and shops display prominent advertisements for it. Three retailers said that police officers were among their most dependable customers, using CBD oil for aches and pains as well as stress.
At the Dab Hemp Cafe in San Antonio's Five Points neighborhood, the CBD-infused products for sale include juices, pastries, lip balm, face scrubs, suppositories, and drops added to coffee, hot chocolate or hibiscus tea.
"I have a lot of anxiety, and marijuana makes it worse, but this is calming," Andrea Santinelli, 29, said of the daily dose of CBD she takes in her coffee.
The arrival of CBD was hardly calming in Duncanville, where police officers executed warrants in March on Ms. Wazwaz's two tobacco shops, which also sell CBD products.
"I said: 'Oh, we're fine. We don't have any marijuana. You can search as much as you want,"' Ms. Wazwaz recalled.
But when the officers began to confiscate hemp and CBD products, Ms. Wazwaz said she told them, "You know this is industrial hemp, right? And you know this is CBD oil?"
The Duncanville police confiscated nearly $ 12,000 in cash, two firearms, cellphones belonging to employees, items containing CBD, and what officers described in police reports as more than 30 pounds of marijuana. Ms. Wazwaz said it was hemp.
"We go by the letter of the law," said Nathan Roach, a Duncanville police sergeant, who said that officers found products containing THC in the store, and the department considers those products illegal. "The only way you can legally possess CBD," Sergeant Roach said, is if you have a prescription for Epidiolex." Epidiolex, a drug containing CBD, has been approved by the F.D.A. to treat epilepsy.
Duncanville's pursuit of Ms. Wazwaz put local prosecutors in an awkward spot, because the district attorney, John Creuzot, has pledged to stop pursuing low-level cases, including those for marijuana possession.
But while Mr. Creuzot contemplated charges, his office signaled its intentions by filing asset forfeiture documents requesting that the authorities be allowed to keep items seized from the shops.
After The New York Times contacted Mr. Creuzot's office about the case, a spokeswoman for Mr. Creuzot wrote in an email that the office had decided not to pursue charges against the Wazwaz family and would halt its efforts to retain items confiscated during the raid.
Ms. Wazwaz said she was pleased to hear that, but remained cautious, given all the lingering confusion over CBD. "I want it in writing," she said.

Democrats float theory about Trump not accepting 2020 election defeat, as they refuse to accept election defeats

Texto completo: Chris Cillizza, in his role as CNN's courier of conventional wisdom, on Monday gave voice to a theory being floated among Democrats that involves President Trump not conceding defeat in the 2020 presidential election, and then ... well, that much is unclear.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., promoted this idea by telling the New York Times that going into the 2018 midterms the view of Democrats was, "If we win by four seats, by a thousand votes each, he's not going to respect the election. [Trump] would poison the public mind. He would challenge each of the races; he would say you can't seat these people," she added. "We had to win. Imagine if we hadn't won — oh, don't even imagine. So, as we go forward, we have to have the same approach."
The prospect of Trump not conceding in 2020 was the source of some debate on Twitter over the weekend, and then Cillizza sketched out a piece of fan fiction rooted in the idea that Trump has been willing to challenge political norms and raise questions about voter fraud with insufficient evidence in the past. He writes, "close your eyes and imagine this: Trump narrowly loses -- by 20-ish electoral votes -- in 2020. He refuses to concede, insists there has been widespread election fraud and notes that Democrats (and the media) have been trying to steal from him since he was elected in 2016. Doesn't seem all that outlandish, does it?"
The first obvious reaction is, who cares? If Trump loses and has no legal basis to challenge the results, the electoral college outcome will be certified and power will turn over to the newly elected president on Jan. 20. After that, he will be tweeting into the wind, with no power to do anything about it.
I mean, I suppose Trump could barricade himself to the desk of the Oval Office and refuse to leave absent physical force. But for all the talk about how Trump challenges norms, in many cases he does so by his words rather than his actions. For instance, he's often floated ideas about revisiting libel laws or cracking down on the press, but he has not followed through. He has excoriated legal decisions and the integrity of judges, only to go on to obey the court orders.
Sure, if Trump convinces his loyal followers that he was robbed, it would make any outcome more divisive to the country. That isn't a good thing. But at the same time, the experience of the last few years has not been one of Democrats taking election results at face value.
We just got through a two-year investigation into the Trump campaign's dealings with Russia during the 2016 election, which Democrats have consistently used as a cudgel with which to raise questions about the legitimacy of his victory.
As my colleague Becket Adams details, Hillary Clinton is still pushing the idea that she was robbed, two and a half years after her defeat. "You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you," she said.
That isn't an isolated incident for Democrats.
Stacey Abrams is still insisting she was elected governor of Georgia last year and Andrew Gillum has raised questions about his race for governor in Florida. Sen. Kamala Harris, who could end up challenging Trump next year, said, "Let's say this loud and clear: Without voter suppression, Stacey Abrams would be the governor of Georgia. Andrew Gillum is the governor of Florida."
It's hard to see why, in principle, Trump losing in 2020 and claiming he really won would be different than what Clinton, Abrams, Gillum, and their supporters are doing. Either it's a threat to democracy for losing candidates to question the integrity of elections or it isn't.

Texto completo: TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli researchers reported Wednesday that violent attacks against Jews spiked significantly last year, with the largest reported number of Jews killed in anti-Semitic acts in decades, leading to an "increasing sense of emergency" among Jewish communities worldwide.
Capped by the deadly shooting that killed 11 worshippers at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, assaults targeting Jews rose 13% in 2018, according to Tel Aviv University researchers. They recorded nearly 400 cases worldwide, with more than a quarter of the major violent cases taking place in the United States.
But the spike was most dramatic in western Europe, where Jews have faced even greater danger and threats. In Germany, for instance, there was a 70% increase in anti-Semitic violence.
"There is an increasing sense of emergency among Jews in many countries around the world," said Moshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, an umbrella group representing Jewish communities across the continent.
"It is now clear that anti-Semitism is no longer limited to the far-left, far-right and radical Islamist's triangle — it has become mainstream and often accepted by civil society," he said.
Tel Aviv University's Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry releases its report every year on the eve of Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day, which begins Wednesday at sundown. This year, the report comes just days after another fatal shooting attack Saturday against a synagogue in southern California. The attack on the Chabad of Poway synagogue on the last day of Passover killed one woman and wounded three other people, including the rabbi.
In addition to the shooting attacks, assaults and vandalism, Kantor also noted the increased anti-Semitic vitriol online and in newspapers, including a recent anti-Semitic cartoon that appeared in The New York Times' international edition. It depicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a dog wearing a Star of David collar and leading a blind and skullcap-wearing President Donald Trump.
The Times has since apologized, calling the image "offensive," and vowing to refrain from publishing such bigoted cartoons again. Still, it sparked outrage among dozens of American Jewish groups that subsequently sent a letter calling on the newspaper to "become far more sensitive to anti-Semitism in the future."
Netanyahu lambasted the cartoon in his remarks at the main Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony Wednesday evening. "We're not talking about legitimate criticism of Israel, but of systematic, poisonous and shallow hatred," he said, touching on the worldwide surge of anti-Semitism and its insidious infiltration of mainstream views.
"Anti-Semitism has recently progressed to the point of calling into question the very continuation of Jewish life in many parts of the world," Kantor said. "As we saw with the second mass shooting of a synagogue in the U.S., many parts of the world that were previously thought of as safe no longer are."
"Anti-Semitism has entered gradually into the public discourse," he added. "Threats, harassments and insults have become more violent, inciting to even more physical violence against Jews. It feels like almost every taboo relating to Jews, Judaism and Jewish life has been broken."
The ascendancy of British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has also contributed to a growing sense of fear among Britain's Jewish community. Critics say Corbyn, a longtime critic of Israel, has long allowed anti-Jewish prejudice to go unchecked. Corbyn's supporters have been accused of sharing Holocaust denial and international Jewish banking conspiracies on social media. Several members of the party have quit it in protest.
Similarly, the inclusion of anti-Semitic activists in the Yellow Vests protests in France have raised greater concerns in a country in which anti-Semitic acts already account for half of all its documented hate crimes.
Kantor added that there has been an improvement in cooperation between Jewish communities and law enforcement agencies in Europe, and several European governments have taken strong steps as well, including fully adopting the working definition of anti-Semitism as outlined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.
The report says there has been a growing awareness of the threat among government agencies responsible for the well-being and security of their Jewish citizens.
Israel has also taken steps, hosting a global forum to combat anti-Semitism, and the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial has reported wide participation in its online course on the origins of anti-Semitism. Netanyahu said following the attack in southern California he would be convening a special meeting over the rising anti-Semitic attacks worldwide.

Texto completo: Saddened by deaths at Carolina college
I was sickened and saddened to read about yet another senseless school assassination of two promising young students at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte ["Cops: Student saved lives tackling gunman," News, May 2]. It seems not a week goes by when we don't hear of these horrendous shootings at schools and at workplaces.
When will this insanity end? I am afraid never. What happened to the days when the most you had to worry about at college were your grades? Politicians will take advantage of this situation and cry out for gun control and justice, but how do you battle insanity?
My heart bleeds for the families of Riley Howell and Ellis R. Parlier, who were killed, and the four who were wounded. Howell, who tackled the shooting suspect, was a true hero. I know his family will hear those words many times, yet it does not ease their pain. I hope the full weight of the law comes down on the suspect.

Where is federal fiscal restraint?
Thanks to columnist William F. B. O'Reilly for recognizing what I think most citizens would consider runaway spending ["Our reckless spending spree," Opinion, May 3].
Plans for infrastructure spending of $2 trillion on top of promises of free college, free health care, the Green New Deal, increases in Social Security and Medicare? There has to be a limit.
Any chance we can bring back Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich and a Republican Congress to put us back on a more responsible financial path the way they did in the 1990s?

55-percenters still will pay too much
I am among the 55 percent of Nassau County residents whose assessed values have decreased ["Bill would phase in new assessments," News, May 1].
That means I have been paying far too much for far too long. A phase-in of my reduction will mean that I will continue to pay too much for that period. How will we 55-percenters be compensated for that? Theoretically, if I grieve every year during the phase-in, I should be successful. Will you suspend grievances for the 55-percenters? It's time to make this right. Just do it.

Neighbors need help during PGA tourney
When a major golf tournament was held at Bethpage State Park a few years ago, I was unable to get to my house without showing my license to police officers on Old Bethpage Road. Sometimes 10 cars lined up as drivers tried to turn onto Round Swamp Road toward my street. Many drivers would be turned away, and it could take 20 minutes to get through.
I fear a repeat of the same situation when the PGA Championship comes to the park next week ["Tiger's win heats up Bethpage Black," Sports, April 21].
I was told by police the last time that tournament passes would be issued to homeowners to put on our dashboards so they would know we are residents and could wave us through. But after calling local and state police and a tournament official, I got no satisfaction. Long story short, I will have to wait in line with everyone else. Someone is making money from this tournament and inconveniencing those who live in the neighborhood. This is unacceptable.
Barbie Phillips,

Don't wait to fix Social Security, Medicare
One of America's current "gathering storms" does not require predictions, nor will it come in the form of a sneak military attack. It is the impending depletion of Medicare and Social Security funds ["Shaky fiscal futures," News, April 23].
Like students who delay tackling inevitable problems before time runs out, our politicians in Washington pander to constituents to obtain enough votes to stay in power. It is difficult for politicians to conceptualize problems that might not reach a crisis until they are long out of office, but address it they must.
If left to go bankrupt, these will have serious political, social and economic repercussions for the vast majority of Americans. Officeholders truly concerned about their constituents and country need to stop kicking the can.
Lowell Wolf,
  Levittown
Soft anti-Semitism is hard to fight
Cathy Young's column "All should reject enablers of prejudice" [Opinion, April 30] is both welcome and inadequate.
She rightly condemns anti-Semitism on the far right and far left, citing examples of each, and she correctly points to the violence that is typically associated with the alt-right brand of anti-Semitism, as in the synagogue shootings in Poway, California, and Pittsburgh.
This is the easy part. What thinking, morally grounded person doesn't condemn murder?
It is harder to take on the anti-Semitism of the far left, but Young does, citing the hideous syndicated cartoon in the international print edition of The New York Times and the far left's cloaking of anti-Semitism in the guise of criticism of Israel.
But this soft anti-Semitism, by its very nature, is more difficult to fight and can infect generations through the political process, social media and higher education. It is easy to condemn all forms of bigotry, harder politically to narrow that criticism and thus take on specific ideas and practitioners of that bigotry.

Trump’s brilliant strategy of divert and destroy

Texto completo: For the Valley News
Amid this train wreck of a presidency, an administration marked by cronyism and incompetence, where compulsive lying has been normalized, it’s easy to miss the damage being done by Donald Trump’s minions beyond the White House. What may be a strategy of diversion — daily outrages emanating from the Oval Office to deflect attention from the chicanery of Cabinet-level officials — has allowed surrogates to gut environmental protections, for example, and to undercut foreign alliances with impunity. Although I doubt that this diversion is intentional, if it is, it’s brilliant: Focus the public’s attention on the shenanigans in the White House while political appointees systematically dismantle policies, protections and alliances that have been in place for years, even decades.
Two examples, education and the environment, illustrate the effectiveness and the destructiveness of this diversion.
Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, environmental safeguards began to fall, beginning with regulations on oil pipelines and then dropping restrictions on the dumping of mining waste into surrounding waterways. On his first day as interior secretary, Ryan Zinke rescinded prohibitions on the use of lead ammunition, which is harmful to wildlife, on federal lands and waters.
The Trump administration has sought to expand offshore drilling, to roll back automobile emissions standards, to nullify restrictions on coal power plants, to loosen regulations on toxic air pollution and to rescind protections for endangered whales and sea turtles. And on and on. The Trump administration dropped climate change from the list of national security threats and, most important, withdrew from the Paris climate accord, the international agreement aimed at reducing the rate of climate change.
Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, might provide an even better example of the Trump administration’s success in undermining longstanding values and principles. Just as Zinke and Scott Pruitt (Trump’s initial choice as head of the EPA) were avowedly hostile to environmental protections, so too DeVos is hostile to public education. The difference is that both Pruitt and Zinke were chased from office because of ethical violations (whereupon they landed cushy jobs with the industries they were supposed to be regulating; their replacements also have deep ties to energy and extraction industries). DeVos, on the other hand, continues in office, where she has done, and continues to do, untold damage.
For decades, DeVos, who married into the Amway fortune, has been fixated with what she calls “school choice.” On the face of it, school choice is an appealing concept; we citizens in a nation of consumers like at least the illusion of choice, even in schools for our children. While no one denies the right of parents to educate their children as they wish, DeVos and others in the so-called school choice movement want taxpayers to foot the bill, even when children attend private, parochial or other religious schools.
DeVos’ own education apparently did not include a unit on the First Amendment. If it had, she would recognize that religion has flourished throughout American history precisely because we have (for the most part, at least) observed Roger Williams’ and Thomas Jefferson’s “wall of separation” between church and state. She would also know, as legal scholar Philip Hamburger has argued, that emphasis on separation was animated by 19th century fears that taxpayer money would go to support parochial (Catholic) schools. During the 1960 presidential campaign, John F. Kennedy, a Roman Catholic, repeatedly stipulated that public money should not support parochial schools.
The education secretary could also use a bit of history about public education. Common schools (as they were known early in the 19th century) provided a way for the children of those less fortunate to secure an education and thereby climb the ladder toward the middle class. As such, public education enjoyed the support of various religious groups, including evangelicals, and many of the early leaders in the common school movement were clergy.
Throughout American history, moreover, public education has also served as a tool of integration, a way to inculcate the values of citizenship in a nation of immigrants. As an 1880 editorial in The New York Times explained, “the reason for the existence of common schools is that they are, or are supposed to be, good for the common wealth. It is asserted, and has hitherto been widely believed, that they make good citizens; that without them the mass of the community would be less virtuous, less happy, less thrifty; and that in a country where suffrage is, to all intents and purposes, universal, public schools are the sweeteners and the salt of morals and the light of legislation and of government.”
I suspect we could use a bit more virtue and morals in American society and government these days.
That’s not to say, of course, that public education has always lived up to these aspirations. Not at all. No one can deny that public education is in trouble; disengaged students, neglected infrastructure, crowded classrooms and poorly paid teachers bedevil too many school districts. Too many frazzled teachers “teach for the test,” a strategy inimical to learning.
But the solution is not, as DeVos would have it, starving public education and funding the exodus of middle- and upper-class students, thereby exacerbating the socioeconomic divide. Providing taxpayer money to students for private and religious education betrays the mission of public education.
Public schools have played an invaluable role in American history and culture by providing a common ground for children of different ethnic groups and religious persuasions, regardless of social class — a place where, in the midst of a pluralistic society, differences could be explored and friendships formed. At school — in the classroom or on the playground — children interacted with one another and, in the best of all worlds, learned to understand one another and to tolerate one another. Whatever common culture we have attained in this country has come about largely through the agency of public schools. At the risk of sounding mawkish, I truly believe that public schools served to make America what it is by helping us to forge a mutual understanding of one another as Americans.
That’s an idealized vision, I acknowledge, but it still represents our best hope for reclaiming at least some measure of comity in our fractured society. Donald Trump has no interest in that, of course. His political fortunes rely on discord.
If we care about the future of democracy, however, we must attend to public education.
Betsy DeVos’ dystopian vision for education in America must not succeed, nor should the cynical, industry-friendly environmental policies of this administration. We cannot allow Trump’s tomfoolery and tap dancing to distract us from the real damage perpetrated by his surrogates.

Texto completo: Bestselling author David Elliott has just delivered a must read Voices: The Final Hours of Joan of Arc. The novel is perfect for young adults (ages 14 and older) and older folks alike. It revisits the final day of the fascinating girl whose extraordinary life and death led to sainthood.

“I wrote Voices to discover for myself how an illiterate teenage girl was able to accomplish what seems like the impossible, but by the time I typed The End, I was left with more questions than answers,” said Elliott. “I hope readers will find their own answers in Voices, and not just about Joan.”
In addition to telling the enduring story of the young French girl, the book explores timely issues such as gender, misogyny, and the risk of speaking truth to power.
The story is told through an imaginative and spellbinding treatment. Through medieval poetic forms and in the voices of the people and objects in Joan of Arc's life, (including her family and even the trees, clothes, cows, and candles of her childhood) we follow her last day. The book is sure to revive the timeless story for new generations.
The book is widely available at book stores, Target, and as an e-book.
Elliott is a New York Times bestselling children's author. His many titles include: And Here's to You!, The Transmogrification of Roscoe Wizzle, the Evangeline Mudd books, Finn Throws a Fit!, Jeremy Cabbage and the Living Museum, and In the Wild. His most recent titles In the Past and Baabwaa and Wooliam, and the young adult novel in verse, Bull, which received six starred reviews.
Born in Ohio, Elliott has worked as a singer, a cucumber washer, and a Popsicle stick maker. Currently, he lives in New Hampshire with his wife and a three-footed dog. Elliott is a member of the N.H. Writers' Project.

Cal Thomas: Anti-Semitism on the rise worldwide

Texto completo: It took a few days, but the New York Times finally got around to apologizing for publishing in its international edition a grossly anti-Semitic cartoon depicting a blind President Trump wearing a yarmulke and being led by a dog resembling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The dog wore a Star of David around its neck.
At first the Times blamed a single editor and poor oversight, but Sunday the newspaper issued a formal apology.
That might be acceptable were the incident an aberration, but Bret Stephens noted in a scathing column for his own newspaper, “The Times has a longstanding Jewish problem, dating back to World War II, when it mostly buried news about the Holocaust, and continuing into the present day in the form of intensely adversarial coverage of Israel. The criticism goes double when it comes to the editorial pages, whose overall approach toward the Jewish state tends to range, with some notable exceptions, from tut-tutting disappointment to thunderous condemnation.”
The Israeli ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, responded to the cartoon, calling the newspaper “a cesspool of hostility” toward Israel. There is much history of the newspaper’s “coverage” of Jews and Israel that proves him right.
Defenders of the Times claim a difference between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, but this is like saying “I don’t hate black people, I am just opposed to recognizing their civil rights.”
The Times’ coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is clearly pro-Palestinian. In its news stories, editorials and columns, the paper often portrays Israel as the obstacle to peace because it won’t surrender to Palestinian demands to forfeit more land and support a two-state solution, by which the Palestinian leadership means a one-state solution achieved by the eradication of the Jewish state.
There are more subtle jabs at Israel and Jewish people in the newspaper’s stories. The list could fill several columns, but here’s a sample. In 2015, the Times published a chart labeling Democratic lawmakers opposed to the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran as “Jewish?” or not. The chart was removed from its online version after an outcry.
In 2013, the Times published the obituary of a woman whose three sons died in attacks against Israel. The headline read, “Mariam Farhat, 64, the ‘Mother of Martyrs.'” As Clay Waters of the Media Research Center noted, “The text box couched the terrorism in passive terms: ‘A woman who took unusual pride in how three of her sons died.’ The word ‘terrorism’ didn’t even appear in the obituary by William Yardley, who also called the murderous part of Hamas the ‘military wing’.”
In 2012, The Times’ East Africa reporter worked in a swipe at Israel in a story about the genocide in Rwanda. Jeffrey Gettleman wrote, “…like Israel, Rwanda has succeeded in leveraging the guilt that other countries feel for not intervening in its genocide.” Ah, that old trope about Jewish guilt.
In 2011, Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote about the favorable response Members of Congress gave to visiting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “I sure hope that Israel’s prime minister … understands that the standing ovation he got in Congress this year was not for his politics. That ovation was bought and paid for by the Israel lobby.”
There are many more recent examples. The cartoon merely adds to the list.
The Times’ reporting and commentary is one thread — but an influential one — in a pattern contributing to the rise of anti-Semitism worldwide. These include recent shootings at American synagogues, the defacing of Jewish cemeteries, the return of Nazi symbols and the proliferation of white supremacist web pages.
Denunciations of such talk, symbolism and acts of violence are not enough. Sadly, more houses of worship are hiring armed guards, but even that only addresses the symptoms of hate, not the disease itself. The Times might consider contributing to solutions, rather than adding to the problem.

Texto completo: La lidereza de la mayoría en la Cámara, Nancy Pelosi , dejó claro que un juicio político contra el presidente Donald Trump sería complicado para removerlo de la Casa Blanca.
La representante de San Francisco, California, es parte del grupo demócrata que no quiere enfocar recursos a ello, como otra ala del partido y congresistas que presionan para concretarlo.
Pelosi dijo a The New York Times que la única forma de remover al mandatario republicano es a través de las urnas, ganando por un amplio margen, ya que teme que el presidente Trump quiera desafiar la legitimidad de la contienda electoral 2020.
“Tenemos que vacunarnos contra eso, tenemos que estar preparados para eso” , dijo Pelosi.
La demócrata es fría al hablar sobre el juicio político hacia el mandatario, considera que si éste pudiera avanzar en la Cámara –donde iniciaría la petición– en el Senado esa idea quedaría sepultada, ya que está controlada por republicanos.
“Si ganamos por cuatro escaños, por mil votos cada uno, no va a respetar las elecciones”, consideró Pelosi. “Él envenenaría a la opinión pública. Él desafiaría a cada una de las razas; él diría que no puedes sentar a estas personas” .
Insistió que los demócratas deberán ganar con amplio margen.
La más reciente encuesta de Harvard / Harris indica que el único que, por ahora, los votantes consideran viable es al exvicepresidente Joe Biden .

Texto completo: In the early 1960s, when newly famous Bob Dylan needed to escape New York City — where constant fan attention was becoming a drag — he moved upstate and into the guest quarters of his manager's vacation home in Woodstock, an artsy village on the edge of the Catskill mountains. There he rode (and famously crashed) his motorcycle along winding roads and lounged around Café Espresso on Tinker Street, the town's main thoroughfare. “Soon Dylan was spending so much time at the Espresso — drinking coffee, playing chess, reading The New York Times — that the [owners] asked if he wanted to work in the room above it," music journalist Barney Hoskyns writes in his book Small Town Talk, which explores the village's musical pedigree. The typewriter-equipped upstairs bedroom became Dylan's hideaway — and a favorite writing spot.
I'm standing on the balcony outside my room at the recently opened Woodstock Way Hotel (845-684-5911, woodstockway.com), gazing the 100 yards toward the rear windows of Dylan's old haunt, which is now the Center for Photography, an arts nonprofit. The boutique hotel, which opened last fall, celebrates this region's musical legacy. Photos in the lobby recall the 1969 Woodstock concert festival (which, due to zoning disputes, actually took place 60 miles from here). All rooms feature coffee-table books commemorating the concert, plush bathrobes, CBD-infused drinks in the minibar, and an outdoor firepit overlooking a small waterfall. Our room is also equipped with Bluetooth turntables and Bose speakers and a small collection of vinyl that includes The Monkees, Wings, Steve Martin, and Blues Traveler. The hotel is a two-minute walk from the heart of the village and proves an ideal spot for my wife and me to spend our anniversary weekend.
It's our first time here, but I've been hearing about Woodstock for years. In the 1990s, when I worked at a magazine in New York, several high-ranking editors had summer places here, in keeping with the cultural stereotype: Wall Streeters head east to the Hamptons, creatives head north to the Catskills. Although The New York Times recently reported that this region is seeing a rise in multimillion-dollar properties, we see little evidence of this glitzification. Instead, we observe ramshackle rural homes, art galleries, and a noticeable lack of trendy chains (not a Starbucks or a SoulCycle in sight). Despite too many souvenir stores hawking '60s-era memorabilia, Woodstock remains noticeably chill even as the 50th anniversary of the famed concert approaches this August.
We begin our first morning by heading 3 miles out of town to the Karma Triyana Dharmachakra (845-679-5906, kagyu.org), one of the largest Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the United States. Each day it opens its doors to the public at 6 a.m., and by 8:30 a.m., we find ourselves perched on round, firm pillows inside the main temple as a volunteer taps a resting bell and begins chanting. She repeats the lines three times in Tibetan, then once in English. (“From the stormy waves of birth, old age, sickness, and death / from the ocean of samsara, may I free all beings.") For the next 25 minutes, my wife and I, along with two others, sit in silence, meditating. After a five-minute break to stretch and chat, a new volunteer solemnly announces, “sitting meditation" and rings the bell, and we sit in silence some more. Driving back toward town afterward, hips sore from an hour on the pillows, we notice how many houses are adorned with fluttering multicolored prayer flags, a sign that the counterculture spirit of the '60s is alive and well.
But humans require more than spiritual sustenance, and on that front there's good news: Woodstock knows how to cook. For breakfast, start at The Mud Club (themudclub.com), which opens at 7 a.m. and offers bagels cooked in a wood-fired oven, or try the all-vegetarian (and mostly vegan) fare at the Garden Cafe (845-679-3600; thegardencafewoodstock.com), which also offers brunch-appropriate cocktails. For lunch, stop by Tinker Taco Lab (845-679-8226, facebook.com/tinkertacolab), which goes beyond the basics to offer more unusual items such as beef tongue tacos, fried avocado tacos, and yam tamales. For snacks, go to Nancy's (845-684-5329, nancysartisanal.com) for artisanal ice cream, or Peace, Love and Cupcakes (845-247-3687, woodstockcupcakes.com), whose treats are named after musicians who played the 1969 festival.
At dinner, fancier options abound. Cucina (845-679-9800, cucinawoodstock.com) offers contemporary Italian fare in a rambling yellow farmhouse just east of downtown. Forgoing the long communal table, we take a two-top near a front window, from which we imagine dining al fresco on the wide porch on a warmer, drier summer night. The food — bruschetta with prosciutto, fig spread, and burrata, followed by orecchiette with lobster, roasted tomato, and jalapeño — is imaginative and hearty. If we lived nearby, we'd eat here often.
For Saturday night dining, locals suggest upscale Silvia in the heart of downtown (but it's fully booked), Miss Lucy's Kitchen in Saugerties (a 10-mile drive), or The Red Onion (3 miles from downtown). We prefer to stay within walking distance of our hotel, so we type “vegetarian" into the Yelp search field and take a chance on Woodstock Pizza Theater (845-679-2700, woodstockpizzatheater.com), on the western edge of downtown. Although less renowned than Cucina and Silvia, the Pizza Theater proves a fine option for a more casual, less expensive meal. The menu is peppered with vegan and “vegetarian option available" items, including many with house-made meat alternatives that use tempeh or seitan. Its pizza, with a slightly salty, spongy-light crust, proves impossible to stop eating; a tuna, shrimp, and chicken taco special arrives with a homemade coconut-cilantro sauce I'd spoon over anything. As we linger at the bar watching a ballgame, the chef joins us to chat.
There's no shortage of live music options on many evenings in Woodstock. During our weekend stay, we're uninterested in the folk singer playing at The Colony, a renovated concert hall that offers ticketed shows, and Levon Helm Studios, the venue created by the drummer from The Band who was a long-time Woodstock resident before his 2012 death, is closed this spring weekend. We grab a drink amid a mostly local crowd at Station Bar & Curio (845-810-0203, stationbarandcurio.com) as a band sets up its gear on the outdoor stage. We consider staying for the show but grow impatient and leave after the bartender's playlist cycles through Jimi Hendrix's “Foxey Lady" twice in 20 minutes. (If you go out at night in Woodstock, be prepared to hear a lot of music from the 1960s.)
More contemporary songs emanate from the speakers at A&P Bar (845-684-5395, aandpbar.com), a two-year-old establishment tucked in the rear of what was once Woodstock's primary supermarket. These days the tall shelves of bottles highlight A&P's status as the region's cocktail mecca. At 9 p.m. on a Saturday in July, this area would be jammed with patrons — but tonight there's just a handful of people finishing meals or enjoying a nightcap. Bartender Carl Bester prepares one of his signature drinks, the Dawa: apple vodka, lime, mandarin orange, and sugar, which is served with a thick wooden muddler coated in whipped honey. “It's a different drink with every sip," Bester says, explaining how the gooey honey slowly melts into the drink. He's right: It starts out astringent and vodka-dominant, but by the last sip, the honey's sweetness has mellowed and balanced everything out.
As we drink and talk, Bester pours, stirs, sniffs, and tastes. He's experimenting. He takes a sip from a new drink and passes me the glass. It's the same cocktail I'm drinking, but he's replaced the apple vodka with a curried vodka. To me it tastes like a boozy Thanksgiving side dish, but Bester raves about its complexity, passing the glass to waitstaff and fellow patrons. Next he takes a Mason jar from a high shelf and mixes a new version, this one containing a homemade chili concoction. He sips and grimaces. “Wow. Serious heat." I sip, immediately regretting it. “TOO HOT," cries the waitress after her try. Becker tastes again. “I'm going to feel this tomorrow," he says.
When the weather cooperates, Woodstock is best experienced outdoors: the nearby Catskills offer spectacular hiking. The area's best-known route goes 2.4 miles up Overlook Mountain. Partway up lie the remains of an abandoned 1920s hotel; at the top of the 3,150-foot peak is a fire tower offering Instagram-worthy views. It rained at the start of our weekend, but late one afternoon, as things begin drying out, we drive up the curvy mountain road to the trail.
This turns out to be a popular idea: The parking lot is jammed, so we follow signs to a satellite lot that adds an extra mile of walking (each way) just to get to the trailhead. We start off enthusiastically. Our energy ebbs slightly as the trail (and our pants and shoes) become muddy. Although the trail's website describes it as a “gradual but nonstop incline" that rises 1,370 feet, it feels far steeper than that. The mud makes it slippery and slow going. Winded, I stop for a break.
It's now 4 p.m., we're only halfway up, and most of the other hikers we encounter are on their way down. In theory we have at least two hours until sundown, but this is starting to feel like one of those Everest disaster movies in which the protagonists' irrational pursuit of the peak leaves them in the “death zone" as temperatures drop and daylight wanes. I suggest we turn around.
My wife ponders our options. “If we bail, are you going to say it was because of safety, or because you're out of shape?" she asks.
“Definitely safety," I say between breaths.
Tired and back in our hotel room, we put a record on the turntable and pull out our phones, Googling to see who can find the best photo from the top of the mountain we failed to climb. The views remind us of the lyric from The Who: “I can see for miles and miles" — and provide yet another reminder of why Dylan and so many others found this area so special. Next time, with better weather and an earlier start, we plan to see that vista for ourselves.

BY THE TIME WE GOT TO BETHEL
Travel writers are supposed to know the ins and outs — to show you the way. Sometimes, however, they provide a cautionary tale. This is one of those times.
Imagine you're visiting Woodstock. You like music and history, so of course you want to visit the site of the 1969 music festival. You know the concert actually took place miles away in Bethel, now site of the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts (845-583-2079, bethelwoodscenter.org), which contains a Woodstock museum. But it's a nice day for a drive. Why not tuck a trip to Bethel into your weekend in Woodstock?
Bad move. The 60-mile drive, on rural roads with village speed limits routinely dipping down to 30 miles per hour, takes longer than you'd expect. (Figure at least 90 minutes.) And because Bethel is southwest of Woodstock, if you're heading back to Boston after your museum diversion, you've just added 50 miles to the drive home. (Figure on four hours back to Boston.)
The museum is hosting a special exhibition celebrating the 50th anniversary of the concert, featuring memorabilia, photography, and films. Many of the docents leading tours attended the concert themselves. Together, the exhibits do a fine job of explaining how 400,000 people flocked to nearby fields for “3 Days of Peace and Music" — and places the event in context against the backdrop of the Vietnam War and the social unrest of the 1960s. The surrounding fields, once Max Yasgur's dairy farm, are open to the public during the summer.
So if you're especially interested in '60s history and culture, by all means plan a visit, and consider seeing a show while you're there: Dave Matthews, Jackson Browne, Elvis Costello, and Sheryl Crow are all playing the grounds at Bethel Woods this summer.
But unless you enjoy long road trips, don't try to experience Woodstock-the-concert and Woodstock-the-village in the same weekend. Make separate trips.

Texto completo: BRIDGEPORT — Former Mayor Nicholas A. Panuzio, who resigned in 1975 after four years in office to serve in the administration of President Gerald Ford, died Friday night at age 83.
His son, Nicholas Panuzio Jr., said Saturday morning that the former Republican mayor died in Easton, Maryland, from complications following surgery.
Thomas Panuzio, also Panuzio’s son, said that his father loved the people of Bridgeport and his country. He became interested in politics while attending the University of Bridgeport, he said, and carried a deep belief in the value of giving back through public service through his life.
“He loved representing the city. He loved representing Bridgeport because Bridgeport gave him so much,” said Thomas Panuzio. “He did that with incredible honor and dignity... it was a match made in Heaven.”
Panuzio first ran for mayor in 1969, losing by 10,000 votes, according to the New York Times. In 1971, he triumphed, winning by nine votes — up from three, his initial margin of victory, which widened during a recount. He was re-elected in 1973.
Thomas Panuzio said his father was a door-to-door campaigner who took particular joy in meeting people, shaking hands, and striving to understand them. He was an optimist at heart, he said.
“My Dad was always the guy who would give you a hug, tell you how your day was going to be better,” Thomas Panuzio said.
Panuzio went on to run for governor in 1974, losing in the primary to then-U.S. Representative Robert Steele. He resigned as Mayor in 1975, taking up a position as deputy administrator of the General Service Administration under Ford.
Panuzio took up a career in the Washington area after that, establishing himself in public relations, including with the firm of Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly, which included Paul Manafort and Roger Stone Jr. He was also the city’s lobbyist in the nation’s capital.
During his professional life, he also served in the state legislature, representing Bridgeport in the 134th district, as the chairman of the Board of Trustees at his alma mater, the University of Bridgeport, and, in recent years, chairman of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee in Maryland.
Thomas Panuzio said his father’s commitment to public service would be his legacy.
“He lived an amazing life,” said Thomas Panuzio. “It’s been nothing but an honor to be his son.. there’s very, very few men in the world like my Dad.”
In 2007, as he addressed that year’s class from University of Bridgeport, Nicholas Panuzio “implored the graduates to commit some of their time to public service,” according to the Hartford Courant.
“There's no greater calling,” he said at the time. “And we need you in public service to solve the problems of human needs, debt and starvation. Don't think only of what we can do for ourselves. What we can do for others is important."
Mayor Joseph P. Ganim offered his condolences and paid tribute to Panuzio’s works in a statement Saturday.
“My condolences are with the family and friends of Nick Panuzio who served our city as mayor of Bridgeport, as well as our country under President Gerald Ford,” said Ganim. “His commitment to the people continued throughout his life and most recently with his time serving on the Board of Trustees for the University of Bridgeport. Nick’s contributions and kindness will be fondly remembered.”

Texto completo: Es iz schwer tzu sein a yid. It is hard to be a Jew. — Sholem Aleichem
The recent deadly assault on the Chabad temple in Poway — just six months after a bloodier massacre in Pittsburgh — reflects the sad reality that anti-Semitism in all its hoary forms, is back.
This is, if anything, even more the case in Europe, where Jewish populations are under siege and are almost one-third as large as right after the Holocaust.
Sadly, confronted by such incidents, the Jewish community, reflecting the deep fissures of American society, seems divided by political orientation. The conservative faction, sometimes aligned to President Trump, focuses largely on growing anti-Semitism on the political left often downplayed by progressive Jews who focus on the scattered, albeit sometimes deadly, expression of anti-Semitism among scattered white nationalists.
The problem here is that both the far-right and the progressive left represent clear and present dangers to Jews around the world. The proper response to incidents at Poway, as well as those perpetrated by the political left, should not be division, but a common sense of unity in the face of a growing, and, until recently, largely unexpected threat.
The two faces of Jew-hatred
Historically, anti-Semitism has fed on two different, although sometimes aligned, perceptions. The first, dating back to classical times, was based on a notion of “otherness “. In ancient Greece and Rome, that was in large part because Jewish monotheism clashed with the dominant state-sanctioned polytheism. Later this hatred was reinforced by Christian, and later Muslim, intolerance. Jewish ideas may have underpinned both faiths, but the refusal to embrace “the true and only” divine relation infuriated religious zealots of the new religions.
In medieval societies, emerged a conspiratorial strain of anti-Semitism that maintained that a secret cabal of Jews was seeking, or even have achieved, world domination. This melding of the othering and conspiracy was mostly embraced on the right and turned into policy in Nazi Germany.
Even today the far right in Poland and other European countries — where roughly one in four hold anti-Semitic views — retains such memes even if their countries are largely judenrein. The unhinged alt-right of the Charlottesville marchers, as well as the lone wolf shooters in both Pittsburgh and Poway, embraced this particularly virulent ideology.
“The socialism of fools”
America’s progressive Jews, dominant in the non-Orthodox rabbinate, have had a harder time confronting the rise of left-wing anti-Semitism, which focuses on Jews as capitalist exploiters or Israel as a neo-colonialist power. The German social democratic leader August Bebel is widely credited describing this as “the socialism of fools.”
Groups like the Anti-Defamation League like to focus on right-wing hate groups, but their statistics have been roundly criticized in such respected magazine as Tablet, and are widely thought to reflect their predictably progressive bias.
Others accuse President Trump as inciting anti-Semitism. But despite his poorly chosen comments about “good people” on both sides in Charlottesville, Trump has been arguably the most pro-Israel president since Truman and the first president with Jewish grandchildren; for this, he was bitterly denounced by both the Pittsburgh and Poway shooters.
The progressive Jews own sense of moral superiority and desire to push “social justice” as the core of their identity — conflicts with the reality that , in both Europe and North America, the strongest anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel, political movements come from on the left. In Great Britain, for example, the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has embraced the virulently anti-Jewish Hamas and attending ceremonies laying wreaths at the graves of such “heroes” as the terrorist killers at the 1972 Munich games.
Anti-Zionist, and anti-Jewish, sentiments are most commonly found in progressive bastions like college campuses, where “third world” oriented academics push “disinvestment” from Israel. Pitched merely as anti-Zionism, these same political warriors rarely favor actions against far more repressive states as China, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Worse yet, , for the first time in decades, there are now anti-Semitic members of Congress , led by Rep. Ilhan Omar, whose pronouncements about Jews, money and “dual loyalty” have been tolerated by a party leadership intimidated by the rising left.
Normalizing anti-Semitism
We are witnessing the normalization of anti-Semitism. Democratic Presidential candidates, most recently Pete Buttigieg, seek out the blessings of the likes of Reverend Al Sharpton, a past dealer in anti-Semitic calumnies. The New York Times recently printed, in its International edition, a cartoon depicting Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu leading a blind, Kippur-wearing President Trump that would not have been out of place in Julius Streicher’s Nazi era Der Stürmer.
In Europe, far more than America, anti-Semitism is also rising on the right. In Belgium, Jewish caricatures have been on display at local festivals despite complaints. And in Germany, one official of the rightist Alternative for Germany party, dismissed the Holocaust as “a speck of birds*** in 1,000 years of glorious German history.”
Faced with what could become a permanent threat, Jews, and their friends in other religious communities, should confront anti-Semitism in all its forms. Divisions about fighting hatred serve to empower the haters, and make us all, of any faith, more vulnerable.

Texto completo: "Once you don't make the debate stage ... really lesser known candidates will start to fade."
Kyle Saunders
Colorado State University political science professor
If two Colorado Democrats walk into an Iowa Pizza Ranch, and a dozen other Democrats also running for president have been there already, does anybody notice? With Sen. Michael Bennet fending off prostate cancer following successful surgery in April, the Democrat is all in on his quest for the White House. So is former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. Following Bennet's Thursday campaign announcement, two of Colorado's top Democrats are joining a intraparty battle royal for the right to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. And the similarities go deeper than that. Both built political careers on pragmatic, reach-across-the-aisle affability but turned up the rhetorical heat with their White House aspirations. Bennet's campaign website highlights when he bashed U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas on the Senate floor, and Hickenlooper broke from showering fully clothed in protest of negative campaigns to attacking Trump by name in the first two minutes of his kickoff speech. Each won his first statewide race in 2010, despite a national red wave fueled by the Tea Party. Both make jokes about their last names: Bennet's Twitter bio notes his name has two Ns and one T, while Hickenlooper has a laugh-line in his stump speech about not having the best-known name in the primary, but "at four syllables and 12 letters," having the biggest name in the race.
Both would consider 3 percent a fantastic showing in preference polls.
So does either stand a chance of emerging from a field that already features: 2016's primary runner-up Sen. Bernie Sanders and his fervent fan base; fellow left-wing stalwart Sen. Elizabeth Warren; establishment favorite Sen. Kamala Harris; the nontraditional but quickly popular paths of South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former U.S. Rep. and Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke; or the literally dozen-plus other contenders?
Oh, and former Vice President Joe Biden — another moderate Democrat positioning himself as a blue-collar slugger — also jumped into the pool with enough aplomb that it threatened to sweep other candidates over the edge.
"If you're looking at campaign contributions, if you're looking at name recognition in the polls, if you're looking at all the standard metrics we use to assess the possibilities of candidates, it's just tough for anyone to get oxygen," Colorado State University political science professor Kyle Saunders said. "Especially when there are two or three presumptive front runners, depending on how you gauge them." But, he added, "there's always a chance someone can catch a flash in the pan. You never know."
Neither Bennet's nor Hickenlooper's campaigns responded to requests for comment.
The Federal Elections Commission shows Hickenlooper with $2 million raised, which keeps him out of the top 10 of Democratic fundraising. Bennet's formal announcement Thursday means he's not even showing up on the FEC website yet. A recent CNN poll shows the two have a combined 0% support for the nomination among Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents, while Biden rocketed to the top with 39% support. Sanders polled at No. 2 with 15%.
"The problem is, Biden sucks away a lot of that moderate-opposing-Trump space that Bennet and Hickenlooper would inhabit," Saunders said, noting that the VP tag on Biden helps him quite a bit with name recognition and the idea of succession. "Parties also turn to whoever's next. In 2016, they didn't. They decided to move toward Hilary Clinton, and now Biden can claim that mantle of, 'Well, you should have chosen me.'"
Saunders also questioned the overall viability of a moderate white straight man — any moderate white straight man — being able to secure the nomination in a party increasingly defined by its diverse coalition and eagerness to embrace women and minority candidates along with the populist politics of candidates like Sanders and Warren.
That said, nationwide Democrats haven't had as much time to get to know Bennet and Hickenlooper as they have others in the race, and a lot could happen between now and the June 26 and June 27 debates for up to 20 of the candidates. A lot can happen after the debates and the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses, too, not to mention that the party doesn't formally pick its nominee for President until the July 2020 Democratic National Convention.
The upcoming debates will likely start to winnow the Democratic field, Saunders said. Hickenlooper already secured a spot, along with 16 others, thanks to clocking at least 1% on several polls, according to the New York Times. And if a candidate is able to score a few third-place victories in early caucus and primary states while the top spots sway among the others, that could signal viability despite lack of first-place finishes.
"Once you don't make the debate stage, and it's obvious you don't have a chance, those really, really lesser known candidates will start to fade," Saunders said. "But when will we start to see that winnowing down from 10 (candidates) to one? I'm not sure."
As for Hickenlooper and Bennet, Saunders is bearish on their chances in a field where attention is harder to come by than dollars. But then again, traditional indicators may not be as reliable as they once were, and there always remains the chance of one candidate grabbing the party's, and nation's, attention. "If you ask someone in 2013 if Donald Trump would be the Republican nominee in 2016, what would they say?" Saunders said. "They'd say Jeb Bush and his $100 million, and his exclamation point, was going to win."

Not so fast on infrastructure improvement

Texto completo: If you felt the ground shake and witnessed wild beasts living together in harmony, that was actually a supernatural event triggered when Republicans and Democrats agree on something.
As I listened to NPR, in my car, to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) talk about his meeting with President Trump on infrastructure, I almost had to pull over. Schumer said, among other things, that Democrats and the president — yes, President Donald J. Trump — "want to get something done on infrastructure in a big and bold way." He said there was "good will" in the meeting.
I first checked the date. It wasn't April 1.
That left only two possibilities. The man I heard on the radio was an impostor. The real Schumer was in a closet somewhere, bound with duct tape and an ether rag stuffed in his mouth. Or that was really him on the radio, talking about how his meeting with Trump was very "constructive."
I suddenly felt lighter.
Could this be a sign that Republicans and Democrats realize they are failing the American people and have awakened, committed to a new sense of cooperation for the benefit of their constituents?
And what could be better than addressing our crumbling infrastructure - roads, bridges, the power grid, water supply? This is good government. Perhaps Congress can finally start doing something to turn that measly 20-percent approval rating around.
And then, like a frying pan in the face, reality arrived.
The infrastructure package would cost about $2 trillion. Neither the Democrats nor the president talked about how they were going to pay for it.
This, of course, is the tricky bit about wanting expensive things — the paying.
I would enjoy a snowmobile, an 80-inch TV and a pizza oven. But I really won't have them until I exchange currency for the items.
It's safe to assume that Trump and the Democrats will have vastly different ideas about how to fund infrastructure improvement.
Raising the gasoline tax, which hasn't been raised since 1993, has been talked about, but Trump is unlikely to go along with any sort of tax increase, no matter what's being taxed.
And the skeptic in me says that Republicans and Democrats, with an election looming in 2020, realize they need to at least pretend to want to get something accomplished so when the whole thing blows up they can say, "Hey, we gave it our best shot. It's their fault."
May 13 will mark the beginning of "Infrastructure Week." I figured I'd let you know in case you want to send a card.
Unfortunately, "Infrastructure Week" has taken its rightful place next to "National Unicorn Day" and Tinkerbell's birthday. You can celebrate all you want, but you're not going to see anything.
If there's one thing, just one, on which Republicans and Democrats should be able to come together, it's infrastructure. Maintaining sound roads and bridges, along with a stout power grid, is fundamental responsibility of our government.
Of course, doing things that are "fundamental" for which it is "responsible" is not a strength of this current iteration of Congress, nor has been the strength of several previous iterations.
And even with infrastructure, there are naysayers.
"We're in the middle of a constitutional crisis here," former Schumer aide Brian Fallon told the New York Times Tuesday. "The most important job the Democrats have right now is to uphold the rule of law against a president who thinks the law doesn't apply to him. We have bigger fish to fry than trying to look like we gave it a shot on infrastructure."
Buzzkill.
And there are plenty of distractions to keep both parties from focusing on infrastructure.
On the day of this writing, Senate Democrats are grilling Attorney General William Barr about what he said regarding the Mueller report before it was released. This Capitol Hill hearing featured all of the political classics — grandstanding, righteous indignation, raised voices, not to mention the call by Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono for Barr to resign.
So much for "good will."
I have that heavy feeling again. My optimism is about gone. And now I'm wondering if that shaky ground was really just the start of another sinkhole.

Chorale's take on biblical tale fails an interesting premise The performance by the chorale couldn't save the poorly conceived program.

Texto completo: "What Binds Us Together: The Binding of Isaac Story in Music," the program that the Oratorio Chorale presented at Temple Beth El on Thursday evening, seemed like a fascinating idea, in prospect, since the first part of the title promised to examine a story shared (with considerable variations in detail and interpretive perspective) by Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
In that story, told in Genesis 22:1-19, Abraham is about to sacrifice his son Isaac (or, from the Muslim perspective, Ishmael) before God, speaking through an angel, stays his hand - the last and most terrifying of the tests of faith God posed for Abraham before promising him that he would become the patriarch of a great nation.
From a Muslim and Jewish perspective, the story is about, to use the Muslim terminology, submission to God's will - although an aspect of the Jewish interpretation was that God's stopping Abraham and providing a ram for the sacrifice instead was also a way of telling him that the child sacrifice practiced by the surrounding cultures was abhorrent. From a Christian perspective, the story is a precursor of God's willingness to sacrifice his own son to redeem humanity.
As it turned out, the concert was an odd mÃ©lange, not quite ready for prime time. In her introductory remarks, Emily Isaacson, Oratorio Chorale's artistic director, said she was able to find only one musical setting of the story from before 1950, Ciacomo Carissimi's 1685 oratorio "Historia di Abraham et Isaac," which is for soloists, not chorus. She also said - twice - that having read the story all her life, she still doesn't understand it.
A paucity of suitable works, and not understanding the underlying story, are not ideal ingredients for a successful program. But that was just the start.
Intent on giving the performance a theatrical quality, Isaacson had her soloists wear scarves of different colors to indicate which of the story's characters they were portraying. Telling the audience that Abraham's scarf was red, she suggested - tentatively, as a question - "he had blood on his hands?" But, of course, he did not - that's an important point on which the story turns.
A priest, Frank Strasburger, and a rabbi, Carolyn Braun, were on hand, the former contributing to some of the concert's many text readings; the latter singing the Hebrew text, using the Ashkenazic Torah cantillation heard in most American synagogues. A Muslim scholar, Reza Jalali, was listed on the program as the reader of the Koranic Sura describing the almost-sacrifice, but he did not appear (no reason was given); soloists and choristers read the passage instead.
That left Jawad Alfatlawi, a soloist on the oud (an Arabic precursor of the lute), as the only representative of the Islamic world. When he performed, the choir, at the front of the temple, turned to watch him. It was a nice touch, except that with the choir standing and the audience seated, it was impossible for listeners to see Alfatlawi as he performed a soulful, beautifully fluid interlude after the Koran reading.
There were performance deficits, as well. The Carissimi was accompanied by a pianist (Christopher Staknys) and a cellist (Ben Noyes), the piano part played with a heaviness that was not suitable for a Baroque work. Assuming a harpsichordist was not available, or outside the budget, a lutenist would have been a more appropriate choice. This was a surprising lapse, given that Isaacson regards herself as a Baroque music specialist.
The singing, in the Carissimi, was mediocre at first - tenor Joshua Collier had some trouble finding his pitch, but eventually settled in. Soprano Malinda Haslett, countertenor Lucas Coura and baritone Keith Phares were in better form, and all the soloists performed ably through the rest of the concert. Collier and Phares later gave a fine account of Benjamin Britten's melismatic vocal lines in "Canticle II - Abraham and Isaac."
But where was the choral music in this choir concert? Basically, it came down to two works - "Akedat Yitzchak" ("The Binding of Isaac") Aharon Harlap's dramatic, richly harmonized setting of the Hebrew text, of which the choir gave a vivid, beautifully balanced reading; and Howard Frazin's "The Voice of Isaac," a somewhat messier fantasy in which the story is rewritten from a modern perspective, with soprano Abby Fortune doing valiant work as Isaac.
"The Cave," a quasi-operatic 1993 work by Steve Reich and Beryl Korot that looks at this story from Jewish, Islamic and Christian perspectives, captured in taped interviews with adherents from each faith, seems to have been an inspiration for this program. Isaacson presented a few brief excerpts, but these were drawn almost entirely from the interviews, with only a snippet of Reich's music.
Concertgoers - even critics - attend performances in the hope of being moved or enlightened, not because it might be fun to catalog poorly conceived presentation notions. Even so, if the performances are top-drawer, much can be forgiven. But this was, by far, the most amateurish presentation I've attended in the time I've been in Portland.

Texto completo: Another synagogue shooting. Another day of shock. Another lonely fanatic. Another cascade of insecurity and fear.
I wonder if we've fully grasped how fear pervades our society and sets the emotional tone for our politics. When historians define this era they may well see it above all else as a time defined by fear. The era began Sept. 11, 2001, a moment when a nation that had once seemed invulnerable suddenly felt tremendously unsafe. In the years since, the shootings have been a series of bloody strikes out of the blue.
It's been an era when politicians rise by stoking fear. Donald Trump declared an "American carnage" and made it to the White House by warning of an immigrant crime wave that doesn't exist.
Fear also comes up from below, in the form of childhood trauma and insecurity. It sometimes seems as if half of America's children grow up in strained families and suffer Adverse Childhood Experiences that make it hard for them to feel safe. The other half grow up in overprotective families and emerge into adulthood unready to face the risks that will inevitably come. Depression rates rise. Safe spaces proliferate. Collegiate mental health systems are overwhelmed.
We in the media have contributed too. Everybody is a broadcast journalist now, competing for ratings and page views. The sure way to win is to ratchet up the crisis atmosphere. All news is breaking news!
We get to the point where the fear itself begins to take control. Fear generates fear. Everybody feels besieged - power is somehow elsewhere, with the malevolent forces who are somewhere out there, who will stop at nothing.
Fear puts a dark filter over everything. The fearful person is unable to hear good news, while any possible threat looms large. We are in the middle of one of the longest economic booms in our history, with wages finally rising again for the middle class. But nobody feels that because of the sense that it's all about to come crashing down.
Fear runs ahead of the facts and inflames the imagination. Ninety percent of the time we're not afraid of what's happening to us, but of some catastrophic thing our imagination tells us might happen.
Fear makes everything amorphous. Immigration is a phenomenon that has concrete advantages and concrete disadvantages. But for those in the grip of fear, immigration - or globalization, Silicon Valley, Wall Street or automation - are shapeless, insidious forces that are out of control. The inevitable reaction is overreaction.
Fear stokes anger, which then stokes more fear. Anger is the child of fear, philosopher Martha Nussbaum writes in her book, "The Monarchy of Fear." The fearful person turns asocial, rejects any compassionate response to social problems and instead lashes out.
"Fear, indeed, is intensely narcissistic," she continues. "It drives out all thoughts of others." The fearful person doesn't see particular individuals, just hateful shades who arouse disgust and can be blamed. 
Fear revives ideology. The 20th century saw a clash of iron-grip ideologies. Then, about 10 years ago, we seemed to be entering the age of the data wonks. The students in my classes didn't have faith in all-explaining dogmas. Skeptical, they just wanted the evidence.
But now grand ideologies clash by night: white nationalism, populism, oppression studies. All trade in binaries between oppressor and oppressed, the struggle between the good groups and the menacing evil ones.
They say that perfect love casts out fear. And maybe there is at least one presidential candidate who will perform the role Franklin Roosevelt performed 86 years ago - identify fear as its own independent force and confront it with hope.
But I'm coming to think governance might be the cure. The simple act of trying to solve practical problems. Enough with charisma. Enough with politicians who treat each election as a matter of metaphysical survival, a clash of existential identities. I've developed a hankering for slightly boring politicians who just get stuff done - Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland. I might agree or disagree with some of Elizabeth Warren's zillions of policy proposals, but at least they're proposals. At least they are attempts to ground our politics in real situations with actual plans, not just overwrought bellowing about the monster in the closet.
Fear comes in the night. But eventually you have to wake up in the morning, get out of bed and get stuff done.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Texto completo: Tareck El Aissami , uno de los líderes más poderosos del gobierno venezolano, cercano al presidente Nicolás Maduro , exvicepresidente y ahora ministro de Industrias y Producción Nacional en Venezuela , está siendo señalado de nueva cuenta por narcotráfico y de tener nexos con el grupo terrorista Hezbolá .
Así lo revela el diario The New York Times, que tiene en su poder un expediente que indica que El Aissami , de 44 años, y su padre, Carlos Zaidan El Aissami , buscaron cómo introducir a Hezbolá en Venezuela .
De igual manera los documentos afirman que su hermano, Feraz El Aissami , tenía negocios con el narcotraficante más famoso de Venezuela , Walid Makled alias “ El Turco “, y que tenía casi $45 millones de dólares guardados en cuentas bancarias de Suiza. Pero no solo eso, si no que además a Tareck se le vincula directamente con “ El Turco “, pues hay documentación que afirma que emitió contratos millonarios para empresas propiedad de Walid .
Y mientras la mayoría de los venezolanos viven entre el hambre y la miseria, Tareck El Aissami ha amasado una enorme fortuna que le permitió comprar un banco en Estados Unidos , parte de una constructora, acciones en un centro comercial panameño, tierras donde se construirá un complejo turístico de lujo y varios proyectos inmobiliarios en Venezuela, entre ellos una costosa mansión hecha para sus padres.
El 8 de marzo pasado Estados Unidos acusó formalmente a El Aissami por narcotráfico lo que lo convirtió en el segundo miembro del gabinete de Maduro señalado de dicho delito luego que se hiciera lo propio con Néstor Reverol , actual ministro del Interior venezolano.
De igual manera detallan cómo almacenes supuestamente abandonados en realidad estaban siendo usados para guardar toneladas de químicos que se utilizan para producir cocaína. Aquí de nueva cuenta suena el apellido de El Aissami : Haisam , primo de Tareck , quien se identificó como representante legal de Makled Investments , la compañía del “ El Turco “.
La última parte del archivo recoge informaciones de testigos que vinculan a la familia El Aissami con Hezbolá , quienes detallan los intentos para reclutar a militantes que buscaban establecer una red de tráfico de información y de drogas a lo largo de América Latina , algo que no se aclara si se logró o no.

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr was a no-show on Thursday, skipping a second congressional hearing into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Barr writes his obituary — and it's not flattering
By Brian Dickerson
Attorney General William Barr snookered me.
Back in January, testifying before senators considering whether to confirm him as the nation's top law enforcement officer, Barr was at pains to dispel suspicions that he would use his office to undercut the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, then nearing the conclusion of his investigation.
Senators who opposed Barr's confirmation had ample reason to question his bona fides as an honest broker. Half a year before his nomination as attorney general, in a 19-page memo mailed to Department of Justice leaders, Barr had asserted that Mueller's inquiry into the allegations that the president had broken the law by obstructing DOJ investigators was "fatally misconceived" because the president's authority over the department was absolute.

But at his confirmation hearing, Barr insisted the memo was merely a summary of his disinterested legal judgment, not a veiled pledge of unquestioning loyalty to the president who had nominated him. He had already served as attorney general under President George H. W. Bush, he reminded senators; he wanted to restore confidence in the DOJ, not use it as a shield for presidential misconduct.
The prospect that Barr had misled senators about his independence emerged on March 24, when he released a four-page summary of Mueller's report that eerily echoed the language of the White House propaganda machine. Barr confirmed his critics' worst suspicions on April 18, when he preempted the release of the redacted report with a news conference in which he portrayed White House efforts to derail the investigation as the reasonable reaction of a president "frustrated and angered" about the allegations against him.
Along with his assertion that the FBI had spied after obtaining a warrant to monitor the Trump campaign's contacts with Russian agents, Barr made it clear that contrary to his promise to defend Mueller's investigation, he was now fully invested in portraying Trump as its innocent victim.
Mueller made plain his dismay at Barr's metamorphosis from attorney general to chief defense counsel in a March 27 letter, made public just before the attorney general's testimony Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which the special counsel protested that Barr had distorted "the context, substance and nature" of his investigators' work and threatened to undermine public confidence in their findings.
In his Senate testimony, Barr dismissed Mueller's circumspect letter as "snitty," brushed off previous sworn testimony in which the AG denied any inkling of the special counsel's displeasure, and insisted, with the Trump White House's characteristic disdain for candor, that he had meant to telegraph "no negative connotations" with his insinuations about FBI "spying. "
Yet it is impossible to imagine that Mueller, his investigators, or the FBI agents and DOJ lawyers working on the 14 criminal investigations Mueller's team referred to other U. S. attorneys came away from Wednesday's hearing with the confidence that Barr has their backs.
Contrast that with the almost reverent appreciation Justice Department officials expressed for Barr's predecessors, the late Elliot Richardson and William Ruckelshaus, when they resigned rather than enlist in President Richard Nixon's campaign to co-opt the Justice Department.
Barr won't lose any sleep over my own disappointment, and he won't be around to see how historians remember the cause for which he sacrificed, in a few short months, his reputation for integrity.
But he is quickly rewriting the obituary that might have appeared if he had demurred when Trump enlisted him as the White House's principal propagandist. The updated version is unlikely to be one he or his children will take much pride in.

What others are saying
James Comey, The New York Times: "Amoral leaders have a way of revealing the character of those around them. . . . More often, proximity to an amoral leader reveals something depressing. I think that’s at least part of what we've seen with Attorney General William Barr and former acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Accomplished people lacking inner strength can’t resist the compromises necessary to survive President Donald Trump, and that adds up to something they will never recover from. "
The Wall Street Journal, editorial: "This trashing of Bill Barr shows how frustrated and angry Democrats continue to be that the special counsel came up empty in his Russia collusion probe. He was supposed to be their fast track to impeachment. Now they're left trying to gin up an obstruction tale, but the probe wasn’t obstructed and there was no underlying crime. So they’re shouting and pounding the table against Bill Barr for acting like a real attorney general. "
Dana Milbank, The Washington Post: "Barr continued undermining Mueller on Wednesday, calling Mueller’s letter to him 'a bit snitty' and saying Mueller should have ended the investigation if he didn't think it in his purview to say whether Trump committed a crime. And Barr eagerly played Trump’s defense lawyer. . . . Repeatedly, Barr said it didn’t matter that Trump had deceived the public. 'I'm not in the business of determining when lies are told to the American people,' he said. But now Barr, by misrepresenting his dealings with Mueller, has gotten himself into the business of lying to the American people. "
What our readers are saying
Attorney General William Barr is not America's lawyer, he's President Donald Trump's private counsel hired to lie to Congress and Americans. Barr lied to Congress on Wednesday regarding former special counsel Robert Mueller's letter and said it was probably written by a subordinate. He has no shame and will do anything to protect our "dictator. "
— Russell E. Glass
I'm glad Barr told them to stick it on a second congressional hearing. Barr was ready to testify until the House Judiciary Committee agreed to add an hour of questions by staff lawyers — a nonsensical demand. Democrats just wanted another day of theatrics.
— Gerd Eysser
So many people don't understand the true danger in this administration and their lawlessness. It sets the dangerous precedent that money and power mean you are above the law, and their total disregard for the Constitution and our laws is deplorable and putting us all at risk.
— Eileen Carlson Sierra
The Mueller report is done. There was no collusion! Liberals need to get over themselves and quit spending all this money.
— Pamela Hyder Lewis

Abusive priest to be sentenced May 24
The delayed sentencing of a defrocked Massachusetts priest convicted of sexually abusing an altar boy is scheduled for late May.
Officials at York County Superior Court say 76-year-old Ronald Paquin will be sentenced May 24. A pair of men testified they were altar boys when he invited them on trips in the 1980s and assaulted them repeatedly. The jury returned guilty verdicts on 11 of 24 gross sexual misconduct charges involving one of the men. Paquin had been slated for sentencing in early March, but his attorney filed a motion requesting a mental health evaluation.
Paquin spent more than a decade in a Massachusetts prison for sexually abusing another altar boy in that state and was released in 2015 before being taken into custody in Maine.

Police trying to locate man last seen Saturday
Police are still trying to locate a Maine man who was last seen early Saturday morning in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
Portsmouth police say Adam Camarato, 32, of Eliot, was last seen around 12:45 a.m. in the downtown area.
On Monday, police said they were continuing to investigate leads, but had no other updates on the effort to locate Camarato.
Camarato was last seen wearing a ball cap with an unknown insignia, a dark long-sleeved shirt and jeans.
Anyone with information is asked to call the Portsmouth Police Communications Center at (603) 436-2145.

Vietnamese sandwich shop to open by June
A new Vietnamese sandwich shop called BÃ¡nh Appetit is scheduled to open in late May or early June at 171 Cumberland Ave., in the former home of Ten Ten PiÃ© bakery.
This will be Tuyet Thi Le's first restaurant, but she comes from a restaurant family. Her mother has owned Huong's Vietnamese Restaurant at 267 St. John's for 18 years. Le and her sister have helped run Huong's for the past five years, Le said. Not long ago, Le's sister purchased Pho Co.in the Portland Public Market from their uncle, Hoang Nguyen, and changed the name to Pho Huong. Nguyen recently announced he and his wife, Chau Du, are opening Melting Pot Variety at 158 Spring St. in Westbrook, which will serve a mix of Vietnamese foods and traditional convenience store foods, such as pizza and Italians.
"I've been helping my mom quite a while, and I've always had a love of food my whole life," Le said. "I thought it might be time to start my own business."
Le said that in addition to serving traditional bÃ¡nh mi, she'll offer special versions of the popular sandwich weekly, probably on Fridays. Also on the menu will be banh bao, steamed buns filled with ground pork, cabbage and wood ear mushrooms; and banh pateso, a savory puff pastry filled with ground pork, mushrooms, onions and patÃ©. Le said she also plans to offer a main course option every day, such as a stir fry with soup and white rice. Meanwhile, Atsuko Fujimoto, the former baker/co-owner of Ten Ten PiÃ©, is selling her Asian-influenced creations wholesale to local restaurants under the name Norimoto Bakery while she looks for new retail space in Portland. Sichuan Kitchen is selling her desserts, and Boda recently posted a photo on social media of her shokupan buns - the very tender, very fluffy and increasingly popular Japanese white bread.
Historic district eyed for parts of Munjoy Hill
The city will roll out a preliminary proposal to designate a portion of Munjoy Hill as a local historic district.
Portland already has 11 local historic districts, which means properties located therein are subjected to an extra layer of review during any planned additions or alterations. New construction also is subject to stricter standards. According to a meeting notice from city officials, the idea to designate part of Munjoy Hill as a historic district was based on the findings of a detailed architectural survey of existing buildings.
"At the workshop, historic preservation staff will present draft district boundaries for consideration and discuss how individual building classifications were assigned," the city said in a news release. "The workshop is an opportunity for residents and property owners to learn more about this initiative, have questions answered and provide preliminary input on the historic district proposal."
The existing local historic districts include portions of Congress Street, Deering Street and India Street as well as parts of the following neighborhoods or areas: Old Port, How Houses (between Danforth and Pleasant Streets), Fort McKinley, House Island, Westbrook College, West End, Stroudwater and Portland Company, on the waterfront between the ferry terminal and Fort Allen Park.
The meeting will be held at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at East End School.
BRIDGEWATER

Three colleges announce commencement speakers
The director of operations for a project management company in the nuclear industry, a retired U.S. Army sergeant and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author will speak at graduations at three central Maine colleges on May 11.
Portland native Elizabeth Strout, winner of the 2009 Pulitzer Prize in fiction for her book "Olive Kitteridge," will speak at the University of Maine at Farmington's graduation, the university announced Monday.
At Thomas College, Todd Smith, president of TSSD Services, an Oakland-based project management company specializing in the nuclear industry, will be the commencement speaker.
Smith, who graduated from Thomas, is co-chair of its board of trustees.
Retired United States Army Staff Sergeant Travis Mills will deliver the commencement speech at Unity College.
In April 2012, Mills was critically injured on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan by an IED while on patrol, losing portions of both legs and both arms.
He has since started the Travis Mills Foundation, and has a New York Times bestselling memoir, "Tough as They Come."
AUGUSTA
Panel endorses bill on genocide education
A bill designed to require students to learn about acts of genocide, including the Holocaust, is moving through Maine's Legislature.
Democratic Sen. Louie Luchini said a legislative committee initially voted 5-4 Monday on the legislation, which now faces House and Senate votes.
Luchini originally proposed requiring Maine to join the less than a quarter of states that mandate Holocaust education.
The committee voted favoring an amended bill to require public and private school students to learn about genocide, including the Holocaust. Luchini said he supports Republican Rep. Justin Fecteau's proposal.
The bill was recommended by Ellsworth High School's Heidi Omlor, who teaches a Holocaust course.
BATH
Police: Protest arrests most in many years
Police say the number of protesters arrested outside Bath Iron Works during a weekend ship christening was the largest in many years.
Police arrested 25 people accused of blocking a road Saturday. Chief Mike Field said everyone was cooperative and no one was hurt. He said the number of arrests was the largest since at least the early 1990s.
The activists were calling on the federal government to spend money to fight climate change instead of building warships. They demonstrated as the daughters of Lyndon B. Johnson were christening a warship that bears the late president's name.
All 25 were charged with obstructing a public way, a misdemeanor. They're due to appear in District Court in West Bath on June 18.

Texto completo: Allen E. Richter
Allen ("Al") Eugene Richter, 82, died April 28, 2019, in Maitland, Florida, of complications of Parkinson's Disease. Born May 3, 1936, in Lorain, Ohio, to Emery and Mary Richter, Al was a graduate of Elyria High School and the University of Cincinnati, where he belonged to the Delta Sigma Pi fraternity. After working briefly as a schoolteacher, Al joined Polsky's Department Store in Akron, Ohio. He soon left Polsky's to work as a buyer for the flagship Strouss Department Store in Youngstown, Ohio. In articles appearing in 1969 and 1970, the New York Times reported his arrival, together with that of dozens of other buyers representing department stores across America. As the newspaper noted, Al was in New York to purchase "wigs, gloves, neckwear, handbags, handkerchiefs, [and] small leather goods" for the Strouss-Hirshberg Co. His children will always use the word "handbag" for the accessory used by ladies to carry more than just money. In 1973, when the biggest shopping mall developer in America, Edward DeBartolo Sr., built the Fashion Square and Altamonte Malls in Central Florida, Al moved, with his family, to Maitland to help open and manage Robinson's stores. He later sold insurance for Acacia Mutual Life Insurance Company and furniture at the Jordan Marsh Department Stores in Altamonte and Colonial Plaza and at Ethan Allen. For decades, he served the First United Methodist Church of Winter Park (FUMCWP) as a lay leader, Stephen Minister, Disciple Bible Study leader, usher, and UMYF chaperone. With FUMCWP, he assisted the needy, including on missions to Mexico, Costa Rica, and Belize, as well as on many trips to volunteer at the United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) Supply Depot in Louisiana. He was active in Aldersgate Emmaus and served on its Board as a lay director. In the early 1980s, he was President of the Kiwanis Club of East Winter Park. For ten years, he volunteered at the Orlando Veterans Affairs Lake Baldwin Outpatient Clinic. He loved entertaining and travel, especially to sites related to former U.S. Presidents. He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Nancy Greene Richter; son Randy (Dan) of St. Petersburg, Florida; son Jeff (Melvis) of Washington, DC; and daughter Holly of Casselberry, Florida. Viewing calling hours are Thursday, May 2, from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. at the Baldwin Fairchild Funeral Home at East Altamonte Springs. A Celebration of Life service will take place at the First United Methodist Church of Winter Park on Saturday, May 4, at 2:00 p.m. All are welcome. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Parkinson's Association of Central Florida or to UMCOR.
This is a paid death notice.

Texto completo: The team of lawyers named by Gov. Phil Murphy to investigate New Jersey controversial tax breaks will follow up its bombshell inaugural meeting, where a whistle-blower said her former company lied to win incentives, with more interviews Thursday.
The task force said it plans to interview "several" witnesses in its mission to determine if tax breaks were properly awarded and whether the agency that administers them, the Economic Development Authority, "applied appropriate scrutiny" to incentive applications.
Those key questions have come to the forefront of debate in Trenton since the task force met for the first time in March. A pair of reports Wednesday raised more questions about the integrity of the incentive programs used heavily under Republican former Gov. Chris Christie and passed by Democrats in the Legislature. The New York Times found that a lawyer with deep connections to Democratic politicians had a hand in writing the tax incentive legislation, the Economic Opportunity Act. That lawyer, Kevin Sheehan, helped edit portions of the bill that opened "sizeable" tax breaks to clients of his law firm, Parker McCay.
Earlier Wednesday, a joint WNYC and ProPublica investigation found that two-thirds of the tax break awards in Camden, or more than $1 billion, went to companies connected to George Norcross, the powerful unelected Democrat who is allies with Senate President Stephen Sweeney, and business partners and clients of his brother's law firm.
One of Norcross' two brothers, Phil Norcross, is chief executive officer of Parker McCay. Phil Norcross told the Wall Street Journal in an earlier interview that he helped write amendments to the tax break bill. Another brother, Donald Norcross, was a union leader who served in the state Legislature and co-sponsored the bill. He is now a U.S. Represent
Murphy said he was "deeply troubled" by the findings of the two reports.
"Coupled with what we already know about how the tax incentive program operated over the past six years, I believe now more than ever in the importance of the task force I commissioned," Murphy said in a statement. "Until we've taken a good hard look at the entire process, I don't believe we can be sure that all taxpayer money has been properly spent and accounted for. If there was fraud in this program, I expect the task force will uncover it and those individuals will be held accountable."
While that task force and a legislative committee looking into the incentive programs continue their work, Murphy has tried to assert his influence in the debate. He sought the resignation of certain authority board members, but most of them defied him and remain in positions to grant future awards. And Murphy's Republican predecessor, Chris Christie, accused the Democrat of engaging in "political assassination" to gain support for his own incentives.
It does not appear that Murphy plans to apply pressure on the holdout board members, who were named to their seats by Christie.
"They're the government appointees. We approached them, we laid out our case, they made their decision. We have to respect that decision. We don't agree with them," Murphy said last week.
Days later he named Kevin Quinn, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs, where Murphy worked for two decades, the authority's next board chairman. He replaces Laurence Downes, the only person who stepped down at Murphy's request.
The members of the task force are expected to hear from current and former executives of the authority when they meet Thursday in Newark. The witnesses have been subpoenaed by the task force, according to an announcement.
Since it is armed with subpoena authority and includes white-collar crime lawyers, the task force poses perhaps the greatest threat to those who may have abused the tax incentives. At its first meeting, a woman testified that her former company lied to win tax breaks.
The panel has also said it has "obtained robust cooperation" from companies who received tax breaks, including one that admitted it was out of compliance and agreed to repay its grant, saving taxpayers $1.5 million. It has also made a criminal referral and said it has uncovered evidence of unregistered lobbying on behalf of special interests.
"As we have said, we are going to follow the facts in a search for the truth," said RoChen. "Whether that means recertifying companies, seeking voluntary payments and terminations, or making referrals, we plan to be thorough, objective and efficient."
In the meantime, a group of activists signaled legal trouble for the authority by having its lawyer send a letter requesting that it preserve all documents related to tax incentives from 2010 on. Such letters typically precede a lawsuit.
Sue Altman, a board member of South Jersey Women for Progressive Change, which is one of many groups represented by the law firm Weissman & Mintz, said Tuesday that the potential lawsuit is partly an attempt to obtain documents from the authority and to convince authority board members to leave.

Texto completo: "The first thing we do, let's kill all the referees."
Admittedly, that is not quite how the famous line from Shakespeare's "Henry VI" goes. As you may recall, it was actually the lawyers whose demise was proposed.
But though no one is known to have uttered the words above, they still neatly encompass the strategy conservatives have long used against the so-called "liberal media." Namely, undermine them - and thus, their ability to act as arbiters of truth - with relentless attacks on their credibility.
No less an authority than conservative pundit Charlie Sykes admitted as much in a 2016 interview with journalist Oliver Darcy. "We've basically eliminated any of the referees, the gatekeepers," he said of himself and his conservative colleagues.
Sykes spoke during the 2016 campaign when people were still stunned at the barrage of untruths spewing from the Republican candidate.
"We've created this monster," said Sykes, adding that, "At a certain point, you wake up and you realize you have destroyed the credibility of any credible (news) outlet out there. And I am feeling, to a certain extent, that we are reaping the whirlwind at that."
In related news, Donald Trump told the 10,000th lie of his presidency Friday. This, according to The Washington Post, which maintains a database of all the times Trump has exaggerated, distorted or misled.
Ten thousand.
Feels like there ought to be a statue, or something. And what does Trump lie about? Pretty much everything.
He lies about the border wall, claiming it is now being built. It isn't.
He lies about his tax cut, claiming it was the biggest in history. It wasn't.
He lies about the Mueller report, claiming it exonerates him. It doesn't.
Indeed, the very same weekend he notched his dubious milestone, Trump told a particularly gruesome whopper about supposed legislation empowering a new mother and her doctor to "determine whether or not they will execute the baby."
And how did The New York Times respond to this flaming canard? It called it "inaccurate," which raised something of a stink on Twitter. That's not surprising. Calling that hogwash "inaccurate" is like saying the Titanic was "delayed."
The Times is not alone; most news organizations have resisted calling Trump's lies lies. Their reasoning, it must be conceded, is thoughtful. After all, to call something a lie is to impose judgment. Sometimes, when people are incorrect it's not a lie, only a mistake.
But 10,000 times in a little over two years? How gullible must you be to believe someone could be that wrong that often by accident? If any other man told you half that many untruths, you'd call him a liar. You wouldn't hesitate. Yet here, we do.
It sets an extraordinary precedent, yes, for a news organization to brand a president a liar. But these are extraordinary times and a liar, brazen and inveterate, is precisely what Trump is. In their refusal to call him that, in their insistence upon giving him the benefit of nonexistent doubt, news media compromise their prime directive, which is to present a picture of the world as it is.
That's something we can ill afford with the very idea of truth under attack and the need for news media to do their jobs arguably more critical than ever.
This is a time for forthrightness, yet too often journalists are anything but, from coverage of race, to climate change to this, as the newspaper of record dubs a grotesque lie merely "inaccurate."
It makes you wonder if all the effort conservatives put into neutering the referees was not a waste of time.
Seems the referees have done a fair job of neutering themselves.

Texto completo: Following the horrific church bombings by Islamic terrorists in Sri Lanka, which killed and injured hundreds, Donald Trump, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton all denounced the attack; however, none of them saw fit to recognize the victims by noting that they were “Christians.” This was far from coincidental in a world where using any variation of this word is increasingly deemed to be offensive. And it doesn’t stop there.
After NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstein recently spoke at a Capitol Ministries Christian gathering about the importance of influencing government with biblical teachings, Business Insider’s Dave Mosher expressed concern that he had violated the separation of church and state and possibly federal ethics rules.
Then the New York Times expressed sheer horror at the fact that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo holds the position of the United States top diplomat. His crimes: He is a man of faith, guilty of regular Bible reading and a believer in religious liberty.
Times Reporter Edward Wong first raised religious concerns about Pompeo during his visit to Jerusalem, during which Pompeo toured the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, built on the ground where Jesus is said to have been crucified and buried, and the tunnels beneath the Western Wall, by the holiest site in Judaism.
Specifically, Wong accused Pompeo of blending his religious beliefs with government policy; something no recent secretary of state has engaged in and which should trouble us all. Most concerning too was Pompeo’s contention that “the Bible informs everything I do.”
These are clear examples of the Left’s continuing war on Christianity, which increasingly includes an effort to prevent those of Christian faith from holding positions of public service within government. This intolerance literally has no bounds, from compelling Christian bakers to make cakes for gay weddings, preventing organized prayers by high school teams prior to athletic events and banning public nativity displays.
The founding fathers recognized this danger. America’s Bill of Rights first words state, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” But to many on the left, this only covers private expression of religion. Yet James Madison, the primary author of the Bill of Rights and the “Father of the Constitution,” believed in the fullest exercise of religious freedom.
Michael Berry of the First Liberty Institute, a non-profit law firm dedicated to defending religious freedom for all, believes Madison’s philosophy no-doubt stemmed from his time witnessing the then-colony of Virginia jailing Baptist ministers whose beliefs failed to match the majority Anglican society. Madison believed, like many founders, that religious freedom was not a concept created by the government, but an inalienable right granted by God.
Years later, Madison chaired the U.S. House of Representatives conference committee on the Bill of Rights. Not surprisingly, his proposed first amendment language was grounded
in individual liberty over toleration as follows: “the civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship … nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pretext infringed.”
In December, 1789, the states ratified this foundational concept as the First Amendment to our Constitution, as well as our entire Bill of Rights; legitimizing the concept that all people have a natural right to religious expression, government authorization notwithstanding. Furthermore, the Constitution sought to insure liberty by commencing with the words, “We the people,” in recognizing inherent individual rights and while agreeing to some central authority, not forfeiting ultimate personal freedom to the government.
Slowly, but surely, America has seen hostility increase as it pertains to the expression of religious liberty. Madison believed this freedom to be constant and not subject to limitation based upon prevailing attitudes of the time. This is a concept foreign to the progressive/statist mindset which seeks to elevate central government authority while diminishing and subverting religious expression to permanent secondary status.
Ours is the first and only nation ever conceived by virtue of inalienable rights granted by God. And just as government did not issue us these rights, it cannot remove them. Yet as long as the Left is engaged in a spiritual war against those of faith, the battle to preserve what Madison fought so long and hard to protect is undeniably worth fighting for.

Antihero Robbie Reyes, who is consumed by hellfire, will ride his way to the streaming service in 2020 in "Marvel's Ghost Rider," executive produced by Ingrid Escajeda. "Marvel’s Helstrom" will also premiere next year, following a pair of siblings named Daimon and Ana Helstrom as they track down a serial killer.
They join "Marvel's Runaways," returning for a third season, and several adult animated Marvel series, Hulu executives announced Wednesday at an annual presentation to advertisers.

She reteams with her "Big Little Lies" writer David E. Kelley on another project based on a Liane Moriarty novel. (Her "Lies" co-star, Reese Witherspoon, is also readying a Hulu adaptation of Celeste Ng's "Little Fires Everywhere," which also stars Kerry Washington. )
Chrissy Teigen is partnering with celebrity chef David Chang and Vox Media on several "food-centric" shows for Hulu.
The streaming service, which now counts 28 million subscribers, has also renewed critically acclaimed freshman series "Pen15" and "Ramy," joining spring comedy "Shrill" on the returning-shows list.

Texto completo: Back in the state where she broke into television, MSNBC's "Morning Joe" co-host Mika Brzezinski is drawing the ire of the Connecticut woman who alleged that Joe Biden touched her inappropriately - for calling the apology demand of another one of the former vice president's accusers "completely ridiculous."
Amy Lappos took Brzezinski to task for comments made Tuesday morning on the program, during which the one-time Fox 61 and WFSB reporter dismissed the controversy roiling the former vice president and Democratic White House front-runner.
Brzezinski was referring to former Nevada lieutenant governor candidate Lucy Flores, who has said that Biden "grabbed my shoulders, smelled my hair and kissed the back of my head" during a campaign event in 2014.
The first of eight women to accuse Biden of making unwanted contact with them, Flores penned an op-ed in the New York Times Monday saying that Biden's response to the allegations has fallen short of a true apology. It came less than a week after Biden's entry into the crowded Democratic presidential field and rapid ascent in primary polls, which is all playing out in the #MeToo era.
"I can promise you, I know Joe Biden. He went up behind her and took a deep breath because he was about to go on stage," Brzezinksi said. "He was going on stage, he took a deep breath before he went on stage and you took it deeply personally, and now you're writing a New York Times op-ed about it demanding an apology? This once again is completely ridiculous, and the rest of America thinks it's ridiculous, too."
Lappos said Tuesday she was disappointed with Brzezinski's dismissive demeanor and Biden's response to the complaints.
"Well, I stand by Lucy. If you do not take the power and importance of consent seriously you have no place in the public field- as an elected official or 'journalist,' " Lappos said. "I think some people are digging themselves into a hole denying the importance of consent."
Lappos said Biden should apologize to her, too, but that no one from his presidential campaign or office has contacted her since she accused Biden of putting his hands around her neck and pulling her in to rub noses during a 2009 fundraiser for Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th, in Greenwich. At the time, Lappos was an aide to Himes and was volunteering at the event.
On Tuesday, Lappos recalled Biden's role during the 1991 Senate confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, who was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill. Biden has expressed regret about Senate Judiciary Committee's treatment of Hill during her testimony.
"When a man inappropriately dismisses the importance of consent it is on him to accept responsibility and make amends," Lappos said. "Biden clearly doesn't accept responsibility for any of the harm he has done to women. We see this in his dismissal of responsibility for Anita Hill and refusal to apologize to Lucy Flores."
A request for comment was left Tuesday for the deputy campaign manager for Biden, who declined to apologize during an appearance last week on "The View," his first interview since entering the presidential race.
Joe Scarborough, the MSNBC show's namesake and Brzezinski's spouse, similarly questioned Biden's accusers Tuesday.
"If somebody's uncomfortable with it, they can tell him in real time ... but to suggest that there was something malicious in what he was doing, or that he was getting his kicks from doing that? Sorry, there's about 45 years of public experience that suggests that's just not true," Scarborough said.
Like Brzezinski, Scarborough has strong ties to Connecticut, where his New Canaan home sold in 2018. The MSNBC power couple headlined the inaugural ball of Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in January.
"What Mika says, Mika says," State Democratic Chairwoman Nancy Wyman said.
The lieutenant governor from 2011 to 2019, Wyman said she has been around Biden many times over the years.
"I never once felt uncomfortable," Wyman said. "He has respect for all people. I just cannot believe that people are talking about this instead of focusing on the issues."

Texto completo: That deal that Barack and Michelle Obama signed with Netflix last May has named its first set of projects. The Obamas production company, Higher Ground," has seven titles in development — three features and four TV series. Not surprisingly, they all appear to focus on themes of social justice and democracy.
1. “American Factory"
This documentary by Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert won the directing award for US documentary in this year's Sundance Film Festival. It's about a Chinese billionaire who opens a new factory in an abandoned General Motors plant in Ohio and hires 2,000 Americans, leading to conflict between high-tech China and working-class America.
2. “Bloom"
The upstairs/downstairs drama is set in the world of fashion in post-WWII New York, and it looks into the barriers faced by women and people of color. It's written and executive produced by Callie Khouri of “Nashville" and “Thelma and Louise."
3. “Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom"
Author David W. Blight's Pulitzer Prize-winning book of the same title gets a feature film adaptation.
4. “Overlooked"
This is a scripted anthology series based on the New York Times obituary column that tells the stories of people whose deaths were not originally reported by the newspaper.
5. “Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents"
The preschool TV series will take young children and their families around the world to look into the story of the food we eat.
6. “Fifth Risk"
Michael Lewis, author of “The Big Short" and “Moneyball," is developing this unscripted series based on his book “The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy." It will expose what happened when uninformed people were appointed to government programs in the Trump administration.
7. “Crip Camp"
This documentary feature looks at a summer camp for disabled teens in the 1970s that helped start the disability rights movement.

Texto completo: Berkeley chef-author Samin Nosrat and Los Gatos-based Netflix were the Bay Area's big winners at the 2019 James Beard Foundation Awards for media and cookbooks.
Their docu-series, "Salt Fat Acid Heat," won honors for Television Program Shot on Location.
Based on Nosrat's best-selling, James Beard Award-winning book of the same title, the Netflix series presented a guide to the basic elements of good cooking in travelogue fashion.
Nosrat traveled to home kitchens in Italy, the southern islands of Japan, the Yucatán and back to Berkeley's acclaimed Chez Panisse restaurant where she started her culinary career to demystify and explore the central principles of what makes food delicious.
Her back story is unusual in that she never went to culinary school or intended to work at Chez Panisse. In 1997, Nosrat, then a student at Cal, saved up for months to have a meal at Chez Panisse. It turned out to be a life-changing experience. Not long after, she wrote a letter to owner Alice Waters detailing her thoughts on the meal and asking for a job. She began working there, busing tables and later working in the kitchen, the day after her interview.
Twenty years later, she won the cookbook award.
The three biggest awards of the night, announced in New York City, went to Marcus Samuelsson the "No Passport Required" chef whose personal journey has taken him from Ethiopia to Sweden to Harlem for Personality of the Year; the New York Times for Publication of the Year; and "Cocktail Codex" for Book of the Year.

'Jeopardy!' champion James Holzhauer squeaks through to keep winning streak going

Texto completo: Reigning "Jeopardy!" champ James Holzhauer faced real jeopardy Monday, narrowly winning his 18th straight contest by just $18.
By winning, the 34-year-old professional sports gambler from Las Vegas added to his impressive earnings on the challenging quiz show, picking up $54,017 for a total of $1,329,604.
Runner-up Adam Levin just missed dethroning the champ, finishing with $53,999.
Holzhauer is second in "Jeopardy!" prize money, trailing only computer programmer-turned-author Ken Jennings, who won 74 games in 2004.
Holzhauer is still far behind Jennings, but he's closing in on No. 2 Julia Collins (20 wins) and No. 3 David Madden (19).
Although Holzhauer's winning streak is impressive, it's his aggressive bidding approach and the speed of his prize haul that's truly jaw-dropping. He's more than halfway to Jennings' record money total of $2,520,700 in fewer than a quarter of the all-time champ's appearances.
Although Monday's winning total is huge in comparison to the average champion's haul, it pales next to Holzhauer's own record for a single show, $131,127.
Holzhauer explained his wagering strategy in a Q&A last week with The New York Times. Unlike most players, he picks the highest-value clues first.

"You can see as soon as I get control of the board in the first game I’m going for the $1,000 clues whenever I have the opportunity," he said, likening his approach to a poker strategy.
Timanus notes Holzhauer's mastery of the signaling buzzer, but says he really stands out in his aggressive bidding.
"While many players, myself included, prefer to play categories from top to bottom and try to stick to them, Holzhauer clears the big-dollar clues first. Thanks to his ability to ring in first consistently and rarely miss, he usually has a considerable total built up by the time he uncovers a daily double. He finds most of them since he’s able to maintain control of the board for long stretches, and, as we've seen, he's not afraid to bet big" Timanussays.
His overall assessment of Holzhauer the player: "Speed, instinct, confidence and knowledge — pretty SICK, wouldn’t you say?"

Trump knocks Cuomo, Attorney General James over NRA, says people are 'fleeing' NY over taxes

Texto completo: ALBANY - President Donald Trump on Monday criticized New York's leaders for targeting the National Rifle Association, but also warned the group to "get its act together quickly."
On Twitter, Trump also continued to knock his home state, saying "People are fleeing New York State because of high taxes and yes, even oppression of sorts. They didn't even put up a fight against SALT — could have won."
Trump was referring to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's ongoing criticism of the federal tax reform approved in 2017 that limits state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, to $10,000 a year — a move that mainly hurts wealthy New York homeowners.
"So much litigation," Trump continued. "The NRA should leave and fight from the outside of this very difficult to deal with (unfair) State!"
Lawsuit against NRA in New York On Friday, Attorney General Letitia James's office confirmed it opened an investigation into the NRA's tax-exempt status.
On Saturday, the NRA's president Oliver North announced he would not serve a second term amid turmoil in the organization.
"The NRA is under siege by Cuomo and the New York State A.G., who are illegally using the State's legal apparatus to take down and destroy this very important organization, & others," Trump said in the first of two tweets on the issue Monday morning.
"It must get its act together quickly, stop the internal fighting, & get back to GREATNESS — FAST!"
The New York Times reported that James sent letters to the NRA and its charitable foundation to preserve its financial records.
New York has jurisdiction over the NRA because it was chartered in the state in 1871.
"Attorney General Letitia James is focused on enforcing the rule of law," her office responded Monday on Twitter. "In any case we pursue, we will follow the facts wherever they may lead. We wish the President would share our respect for the law."
NRA and New York The fight with the NRA is the latest in New York.
Cuomo's administration is looking to end an insurance policy run by the NRA, called "Carry Guard." The case is in court.
Cuomo, a Democrat, has long fought with the NRA, and New York passed a series of gun-control laws in 2013 in the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings.
Earlier this year, Cuomo and the Democratic-led Legislature passed another round of gun laws, such as banning bump stocks and allowing people to seek a court order to ban dangerous people from having guns.
On Monday, Cuomo responded to Trump's tweets by saying since the Newtown shootings, there have been 2,029 mass shootings in the nation.
Cuomo said that since Trump took office in 2017, there have been 74,600 gun-violence deaths, saying in a statement, "You have done nothing but tweet about it."
"The only thing illegal is the gun lobby's insurance scheme," Cuomo said.
"Unlike you, President Trump, New York is not afraid to stand up to the NRA. I will continue to fight for the children of this state. As for the NRA, we'll remember them in our thoughts and prayers."
Trump and Cuomo Trump met with Cuomo at the White House in February to discuss the impact of the tax reforms on New York, but no resolution was reached.
Trump has repeatedly criticized his home state for its sagging upstate economy.
"I love those people," he said in February. "Those people are my voters. They've been treated very badly."
He added: "If New York isn't gonna treat them better, I would recommend they go to another state where they can get a great job."
New York Democrats, meanwhile, are fighting Trump on several fronts, including trying to get a law passed that would require the release of his state taxes to Congress.
Cuomo has been a regular critic of the Republican president, too.
"Nobody makes the anti-Trump case better than Trump. Just let Trump talk, and let Trump act, and let Trump divide," Cuomo said March 26 on WNYC radio.

Texto completo: Magic Leap is seeking more cash from investors.
The Plantation-based startup, which already has raised $2.3 billion from some of the world's largest companies, has received $280 million in funding from Japan-based cellphone company NT DoCoMo, Magic Leap said in a news release.
NT DoCoMo will be Magic Leap's exclusive partner in Japan, the company said. The partnership will combine the telecommunication company's planned 5G infrastructure with Magic Leap's technology.
Magic Leap's spokeswoman replied to an email that she was traveling Monday and unavailable for comment. But in an interview with The New York Times, founder and CEO Rony Abovitz said research and development is expensive in spatial computing, or a computer-generated interactive experience. "The R&D investments are substantial, but so is the upside," he said.
While Magic Leap has many other products in its pipeline, evidenced by hundreds of patents filed by the company, it also is facing competition. Microsoft has already introduced its second version of HoloLens, which it is geared toward helping business people communicate and collaborate.
The company, which was founded and is led by entrepreneur Rony Abovitz, also said it is reopening its latest fundraising round to accept new investments from new and existing investors.
Magic Leap, which employs thousands of people in South Florida, introduced its first product, goggles for developers called Magic Leap One, in December 2017. It is a wearable computer that combines Magic Leap says its product lets users interact with digital content in the real world. The product sells for $2,295 and is available in South Florida.
The company also has a partnership with AT&T and has begun selling its product in some stores in California, Illinois, Massachusetts and Texas. Magic Leap One is not yet available in AT&T's South Florida's stores but can be ordered directly from Magic Leap.
Magic Leap has previously raised funds from companies including Google, Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, and the Public Investment Fund, an investment arm of Saudi Arabia.

How the Bengals flipped the QB script with Ryan Finley and other random NFL Draft thoughts

Texto completo: The NFL draft never lacks drama, does it? Here are some random thoughts from a couple of local perspectives:
* I can’t be the only one hoping part of the NFL’s plans to honor the 13 original towns includes some sweet new merch. When are we getting some Dayton Triangles throwback jerseys?

As the NFL gets ready to hold another Super Bowl, we take a look at the site of the first game between 2 of the league??s teams. The Dayton Triangles beat the Columbus Panhandles 14-0 at Triangle Park on Oct. 3, 1920.
* The Cincinnati Bengals draft is a great example of why it makes sense to let things come to completion before putting a reaction in ink. The first two nights were really not impressive, but they pretty much made up for it completely with the third day as far as I’m concerned. Let’s start at the beginning…
* On the first night of the draft, the Bengals had three good options (trade down, take Dwayne Haskins or take a great-looking OT) at No. 11 and took the least-appealing one (but came out looking a lot smarter than several teams, starting with the Cardinals and Giants).
* Passing on Haskins made me feel this way: The team needs to have an eye on the future but clearly doesn’t. I did not favor using extra draft capital to get a quarterback, but when one fell to them they should have taken advantage. Yes they must shore up the offensive line to be better this year, and Jonah Williams can be a building block for the future, but what are they building for? They’re not starting over. They think they can be at least decent this season, I guess, but at what point is the QB decision going to be made? This was as good a time as any to check off that box but it’s now clear more than ever that box isn’t even on their sheet. In passing on Haskins, the Bengals gave fans another reason to tune out for the near future. It’s says the team doesn’t know what it’s doing in the short term, imperiling the long term as well.
* This is why “Random Thoughts” is not a daily or especially hourly feature because they made a move early Saturday to get Ryan Finley of N.C. State. That works against my theory they have no idea they need to at least think about what comes after Andy Dalton as they A) Picked one of the handful of QBs who seems to have a higher ceiling than “career backup,” and B) Showed some urgency in making sure they got him.

— journalnews (@journalnews) April 26, 2019
* I am not big on tanking, which is why I think the Bengals needed to try to find a potential Dalton replacement this year. They have been marginally rebuilding for three years. If they had a better quarterback, it would have been less obvious. (They would be more like the Packers or Panthers.) They had greater needs for the 2019 season, but nothing they can plausibly do between now and August is going to make them a threat to do anything in January. With a developmental quarterback in place (and I view just about every quarterback, including Haskins, as a developmental quarterback as a rookie), they can still take a shot at being decent this year but more importantly be more ready to be really good in another year or two when the roster reboot that started after the playoff debacle in Pittsburgh is done.
* You have to have a great roster to win with Dalton. He proved over the last three seasons he doesn’t make bad rosters decent or decent rosters good. Having a decent quarterback is better than having a bad one, but the problem with planning long term to win with a guy who requires a great roster to succeed is great rosters are as susceptible as any other to getting hurt and the NFL’s CBA makes maintaining depth at multiple positions nearly impossible.
* Beyond Finley, Michael Jordan was a great value pick in the fourth round, they added depth at DT, LB and CB plus another running back was a need, so it was a productive draft overall. Of course I’ve seen Jordan play a lot more than the average draft pick, and he feels more like a potential second or third round pick. He’s got the measurables and is still relatively young for an offensive lineman (only three years out of high school).
* I was skeptical at first but that new Backstreet Boys song fits in perfectly with the other bad pop songs on The Highway.
* Related: Nashville hosting the draft but the song that got the most play being a hip-hop song that is both better and more country than just about anything else on country radio in the last three or four years is both hilarious and fitting.
* Meanwhile, if the Ohio State football playlist is any indication, hip-hop is in about as bad a slump as country music right now. Woof.
* OK, back to the draft: I’m sure Nick Bosa wanted to be the No. 1 overall pick, but one of the bonuses of Kyler Murray Mania was a relative lack of stories about Bosa’s allegedly controversial handful of tweets. The New York Times could not resist, though, producing a piece that was honestly much more contrived and poorly conceived than I had even imagined possible. The inexplicable comparison of Bosa sending a handful of questionable tweets to Jameis Winston having been accused of raping another Florida State student (along with other off-field missteps of far less importance) is obviously beyond the pail, but the parallels to Colin Kaepernick that are a bigger part of the narrative also miss the mark pretty badly.
* No matter what you think about the former 49ers quarterback’s message or how/when he chooses to express it, he has clearly put a lot more thought into it than a college student sending a few tweets about music, movies or politics. Lumping them together is quite frankly a major insult to Kaepernick as it seriously marginalizes his actions and cause. To do so is not only mind-numbingly simplistic, it is also an example of how deep into our bubble we get in the media at (far too many) times and how badly we overemphasize what happens on Twitter.
* Nonetheless, it seems Bosa’s handling of the situation after being drafted by the 49ers has been well-received.

I asked if he could understand why some would find them offensive: "Yeah. I definitely made some insensitive decisions throughout my life. I’m just excited to be here. It’s a clean slate. I’m sorry if I hurt anybody. I definitely didn’t intend for that to be the case." (cont)
— Jim Trotter (@JimTrotter_NFL) April 26, 2019
Added Bosa: "I think me being here (in SF) is even better for me as a person, because I don’t think there’s anywhere, any city, that you could really be in that would help you grow as much as this one will."
— Jim Trotter (@JimTrotter_NFL) April 26, 2019
Interesting note: 49ers CEO Jed York offered to be Bosa’s wingman for the presser, knowing there would be sensitive questions. Bosa declined. Wanted to handle it himself.
— Jim Trotter (@JimTrotter_NFL) April 27, 2019
* As for Haskins, I’m still kind of surprised at the caution many seem to be taking with the Ohio State quarterback. If you’re realistic about the whole process and realize there are few if any sure things in the draft...man is his potential off the charts. I mean this guy is the prototypical modern NFL quarterback on and off the field and the general reaction seems to be, “Meh.” Of course he would be a “safer” pick if he had more game experience, but that is a double-edged sword.
* Another thought that is relevant for draft week but isn’t confined to sports: I continue to be amazed at how many people whose job relies on rhetoric and public relations have no idea how to create, understand, interpret, etc. rhetoric and public relations.

Texto completo: DRENAS, Kosovo -- In February, a local news website in Kosovo published a shocking story: A teenage girl had allegedly been raped and abused for two years, first by a teacher and then by a local police officer, who forced her to have an abortion after she became pregnant.
In a Balkan region where gender-based violence has been a rampant problem, the girl's tragic tale struck a nerve. Hundreds of people, mostly women, took to the streets in support of the teenager, chanting slogans against the police and judiciary, accusing them of failing to protect the rights of women, as well as their bodies.
"Shame!" and "Rapists to jail," the protesters chanted in February outside the Kosovo Police Headquarters in the capital, Pristina. They carried signs that read in Albanian, "We have courts, prosecution, police, intelligence, but we don't have security!" and "Who's the next victim?"
Now the case has shaken the political leadership, forced a public discussion about the second-class status of women and exposed the shortcomings of Kosovo's new state institutions.
In Parliament, lawmakers demanded a thorough investigation. President Hashim Thaci, who appoints the country's judges and prosecutors, said in an interview that it was a "sad case" and promised justice. Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj launched an investigation into police misconduct.
"The perpetrators of this tragedy will be punished," Mr. Haradinaj said in an interview.
Usually, domestic issues are secondary in Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic Albanian region that declared independence from Serbia in 2008. NATO troops still maintain a tense peace in the region, and most of Kosovo's political leaders are former guerrilla fighters whose primary focus is winning global recognition of statehood amid persistent tensions with Serbia (which still doesn't recognize Kosovo's sovereignty).
But the rape case may be an exception.
"It was kind of a #MeToo moment in Kosovo," said Mimoza Kusari-Lila, an opposition member of the Parliament and the leader of the center-left Alternativa party.
The European Union has led a civilian effort to build up Kosovo's police, courts and judiciary, struggling to keep them free of interference amid complaints of political meddling. Laws exist to prosecute and punish gender-based violence, but women's rights activists say they are rarely enforced.
"I believe that this is only the tip of the iceberg in a society where women are treated mostly as objects," Mrs. Kusari-Lila said in an interview.
In an interview with The New York Times, the teenager recounted her experience. But fearing reprisals, she agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity.
She was a high school sophomore and star athlete when she said a teacher lured her into a sexual relationship on a promise of marriage. When she found out he was married with children, she walked into a local police station and reported him for abuse.
She was 16 years old and unaware that her horrific ordeal had just begun. At the station, she answered questions for nearly seven hours in the presence of a female officer. Then a male officer drove her home. There, he demanded her phone number and would not let her out of the car until she handed him her cellphone, she said.
"He went through my photos and said: 'I can see now why the teacher was after you,' " she said.
The officer returned repeatedly to her house, threatening to tell her parents about her relationship with the teacher unless she agreed to date him, she said.
"I had to do it. I was so afraid," she said. In the fall of 2017, he assaulted her the first time, she said. Then, she said, he kept calling and texting her, showing up at her home and taking her to a local motel, raping her three to four times a week throughout 2018.
"He created this relationship the way he wanted it because after the first time, he had told me he'd kill me if I refuse to go out when he called me," she said. When she became pregnant, she said, he drove her to Pristina in January and forced her to have an abortion. A gynecologist performed the procedure "against my will," she said.
In February, Insajderi, the local news website, published her story and prosecutors launched an investigation. Police arrested the teacher, the police officer and the gynecologist. But it can take up to two and a half years before prosecutors decide on whether to file charges. Kosovo law prohibits the publication of suspects' names until an investigation is completed and prosecutors have presented an indictment.
For now, the teacher and the police officer remain in custody, according to Laureta Ulaj, a spokeswoman for Kosovo Basic Prosecution in Pristina. The gynecologist is suspended from his job at a public hospital and must report to a police station weekly, according to his lawyer, Haxhi Millaku.
The police officer's lawyer, Bekim Kafexholli, said his client denied the teenager's accusations. "There is no truth to it, no facts to what she said," Mr. Kafexholli said. "I cannot say anything more until the prosecutors present an indictment," he added.
Mr. Millaku, the lawyer for the gynecologist, said the doctor had been implicated in the case only because of an "administrative error." He had failed to renew his medical license when it expired at the end of 2018, the lawyer said.
The abortion on the teenager was performed in mid-January, the lawyer said, "professionally, ethically and according to Kosovo law." He added that the teenager had affirmed at the time that the decision to abort was her own, taken without undue pressure.
No representative of the teacher could be reached for comment, but he has been quoted in the local news media as denying the accusations against him.
"I want them to get the highest punishment because they destroyed me," the teenager said, blankly staring at a gold-plated trophy she had received for sports.
Now 18, she said she wants to testify in court, though she remains fearful of her abusers and worries about how she will be judged in a society where victims of sexual violence are often blamed and shamed. Sitting inside the cramped apartment where she lives with her parents and older brother, she said she had considered suicide.
She hasn't received any counseling and hasn't seen a doctor since her abortion, she said. Her parents told her to drop out of school just months before she was to become the first family member to graduate from high school.
Luljeta Aliu, a women's rights activist, said the teenager's case had resonated on multiple levels for women in Kosovo, saying it reflected "poverty, lack of education and employment prospects, patriarchic mentality often linked to violence, a failing state and a justice system that discriminates against women."
"It's difficult for women in Kosovo to live," she added. "The state has neglected them because they have to deal with issues of war."
Domestic violence is an ingrained problem in Kosovo, as are rape and sexual assault, according to data from the state prosecutor's office. While reporting rates are rising, officials say that only a fraction of violent acts against women are registered with the authorities and fewer still get prosecuted.
"As a society, we need to recognize that we have a problem," said Korab Sejdiu, a lawyer and member of Parliament. Like in the rest of the Balkan region, "it's a very patriarchal, a very male-dominated society," he said.
The teenager's family cannot afford a lawyer, and for now, she only has a victims' advocate from the state prosecutor's office to represent her.
"I am suspicious that things can go wrong because the police officer has a very important position and that can have an impact on the case," she said.

Texto completo: ROBERTO GAVALDÓN: NIGHT FALLS IN MEXICO AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART (Closing on May 5) Appraising MoMA's 2015 series on Mexican noir in The New York Times, J. Hoberman called Gavaldón "the most versatile and prolific of Mexican golden age filmmakers." His noir-friendly interest in blurring the line between good and evil gets an uncommonly literal vehicle in "The Other One" ("La Otra"), showing on Friday and May 4, which finds Dolores del Rio (above with Agustin Irusta) playing identical twins -- one poor and kind, the other wealthy and venal. In the western "Rosauro Castro" (on May 4), Pedro Armendáriz plays a cruel political boss who strains to keep a village in his grip. Ben Kenigsberg

Book events plentiful in run-up to Wordplay

Texto completo: The Loft’s star-studded Wordplay festival of readers, writers and books is just a little over two weeks away, with Stephen King leading the charge of famous authors. Meanwhile, this weekend into next week will feature an incredible lineup of authors, plus the myriad delights of Independent Bookstore Day. Truly, we live in one of the world’s best places to be a reader, a writer or, let’s face it, a book.
This was a pick on Tuesday, but it’s worth repeating that Lorna Landvik will present her latest, “Chronicles of a Radical Hag (with Recipes)” tonight (Thursday, April 25) at Scott County Library in Prior Lake at 7 p.m. Thank you, Club Book. Also tonight at Ramsey County Library in Roseville, Larry Millett, historian of Minnesota architecture (and author of several Sherlock Holmes mysteries set in Minnesota), will present his “Metropolitan Dreams,” the story of the late, still much-lamented Northwestern Guaranty Loan Building in downtown Minneapolis, at 7 p.m. Thank you, Ramsey County Historical Society.
Tomorrow (Friday April 26) at Plymouth Congregational Church, the excellent Literary Witnesses series will close out its 21st season with a reading by poet Carolyn Forché from her new book, “What You Have Heard Is True: A Memoir of Witness and Resistance.”
We’ve been reading it and can barely put it down long enough to meet today’s Artscape deadline. Briefly: In the late 1970s, Forché was a young poet in her 20s who had published one book when a mysterious man named Leonel showed up at her door with his two young daughters. He had just driven from El Salvador to her home in Southern California. Civil war was coming to El Salvador, this stranger told her, and he needed her help – as a poet.
Forché spent two years in El Salvador and saw unspeakable things. She was chased by death squads. She took notes. She returned to the U.S. as “a poet of witness.” She wrote a book called “The Country Between Us,” which includes this poem, her most famous poem, whose first line is also the title of her memoir. Forché especially requested Literary Witnesses for her Upper Midwest publication reading, which is co-sponsored by Rain Taxi and The Advocates for Human Rights. FMI. 7 p.m., free, donations gladly accepted.
Saturday is Independent Bookstore Day , a day-long romp through 19 indie bookstores in the Twin Cities, from Birchbark to Wild Rumpus. Here’s how to play: Pick up a passport at any of the participating stores. Get it stamped at stores you visit for coupons, a chance at literary prize packs (including the Grand Literary Prize Pack, an embarrassment of literary riches) and discounts. Go here for the details writ finer, and a list of participating stores. P.S. Indie Bookstore Day will be kind of a coming-out party for Next Chapter Booksellers, formerly Common Good Books. Long-time St. Paul resident and customer Nick Ballas bought Common Good last week from its original owner, Garrison Keillor.
Each store will have its own readings, performances, activities, guest authors and booksellers, food, surprises and exclusive merch. For example, here’s what Birchbark Books has planned. Be sure to pick up a free Midwest Indie Bookstore Roadmap featuring 175 bookstores across the Midwest and a chance at a whopping $500 gift card.
How important is Indie Bookstore Day? (This is a national event, by the way, not just another really great book-related idea to come out of the Twin Cities like, for example, the Loft.) Last year’s total estimated reach: 256,827,888 people. For some bookstores, this is one of their two biggest days of the year, along with Small Business Saturday.
On Saturday evening at the State Theater, David Sedaris will read from his latest witty, self-deprecating collection, “Calypso,” a look at life, growing older, and beach vacations. Sedaris now has a Carolina coast cottage, which makes us wonder, rather anxiously, if he’s still writing about Normandy.
We came late to Sedaris. A while back, a friend gave us a copy of “When You Are Engulfed in Flames” and we only recently got around to reading it. The universe wants us to read more Sedaris; we had proof last week when we found “Me Talk Pretty One Day” in a Little Free Library. It’s kind of beat up, and it has an old cover, but you can still turn the pages, which are not sticky. Now all we want to do is read Sedaris, except we’re also reading Forché and a few other things. Who has time to earn a living?
NPR has called Sedaris “the best American humorist writing today.” More than 10 million copies of his books are in print, in 25 languages. 8 p.m. FMI and tickets ($48.50-58.50). Buy in person at the State Theatre Box Office, save on fees.
On Monday at Minneapolis Central Library, Talk of the Stacks will present Pulitzer Prize-winning author Anna Quindlen in conversation with Star Tribune books editor Laurie Hertzel (who was recently named board president at the National Book Critics Circle). The former New York Times and Newsweek columnist, author of nine novels, Quindlen recently became a grandmother; her new book is “Nanaville: Adventures in Grandparenting.” Doors at 6:15 p.m., program at 7. FMI. Free and open to the public. General admission seating; first come, first served.
On Tuesday at the Westminster Town Hall Forum, Barbara Brown Taylor will speak on the topic of her new book, “Holy Envy: Finding God in the Faith of Others.” Brown Taylor is an Episcopal priest, teacher, and bestselling author of 14 books on religion and spirituality who has been recognized by Baylor University as one of the top 12 preachers in America. At Westminster Presbyterian Church. 12 noon. Come early for music by Aaron Humble and Melanie Ohnstad (11:30 a.m.).
And later that day at Norway House, Norwegian author Sigrid Lien will discuss her new book, “Pictures of Longing: Photography and the Norwegian-American Migration.” Between 1836 and 1915, hundreds of thousands of Norwegians emigrated to North America. More than a few ended up in Minnesota. Writing to family and friends back home, they sent thousands of photographs of their new lives. Lien, a professor of art history at the University of Bergen, looked at thousands of these “America-photographs” in Norway and the United States, alongside letters sent home by Norwegian immigrants. First published in Norwegian, her book is a new look at what has been called history’s largest population migration. 5 p.m. reception, 6 p.m. presentation. FMI and registration ($10/15).

Joe Biden launches a big boy campaign

Texto completo: He needed more makeup to look less like Emperor Palpatine, and launching by video always feels like a cop out. But Joe Biden nailed the message he needed to cement his front-runner status in the 2020 primary: This isn't a question of politics, but the battle for America's soul.


Biden effectively capitalized on the #Resistance's ire while also providing an implicit but key dichotomy to those on the Right. Do you stand with a president who equivocates around the evils of white supremacy, or do you, conservative policy and all, stand with decency? He doesn't frame the Trump administration as an inevitability, a natural endpoint for the Republican Party, but rather a mistake, "and abhorrent moment in time." Biden came out of the gate with the distinction Hillary Clinton failed to make until it was too late: The alt-right is a cancer on, not a feature of, conservatism and the country.

Biden speaks a language nearly extinct in the Democratic Party: that America, even when we've failed to live up to them, is a nation of ideas. Just because the party leaders haven't given a damn about American excellence doesn't mean that the electorate at large will be any less receptive to it. As the New York Times studied earlier this month, the average Democrat is far more moderate or even conservative than loud people on the internet.

Hillary's eleventh hour appeal to Republicans that they were separate from the alt-right failed on two fronts. First was the last-minute timing, and second, no one believed her. She could hardly hide her contempt for anyone who so much as considered voting for Trump, that even though her eventual plea to decency may have been true, it never rang as earnest.

Biden is believable. He's a gaffe machine with two failed presidential bids behind him, and he's a relic, not just in terms of his literal age — he'll be days shy of 78 on Election Day — but also in terms of political tenor. With Democratic front-runners marching in lockstep to abolish private health insurance, nationalize one-fifth of the economy with "Medicare for all," create a federal jobs guarantee with the Green New Deal, legalize abortion up until the point of birth, revive court packing, abandon Israel as a key ally, and ramp up wealth taxes, the Obama era looks positively moderate.

But Biden wisely framed his video around values, not policy. It remains to be seen how far left he will go, but in positioning himself as the one last Democrat who can save the country and his own party from the degradation of the Trump era, he granted himself the gravitas his polling merits. He didn't break out his personal tragedies (including two dead children and one dead wife) or even his policy successes, such as unilaterally turning the Violence Against Women Act into law. Instead, he positioned himself as an arbiter of America, not just the Twitter Left.

He's the front-runner, and he's acting like it. Welcome back, Uncle Joe.

Texto completo: The Des Plaines History Center is proud to announce its next Coffee Talk speaker, Dr. Emilie Le Beau Lucchesi, who will address the History Center during National Nurses Week at 1:30 p.m. Thursday, May 9.
She will present the subject of her nonfiction book, "This is Really War: The Incredible True Story of a Navy Nurse POW in the Occupied Philippines."
Lucchesi will recount the experiences of Dorothy Still and her fellow Navy nurses, collectively known as The Twelve Anchors, who provided health care in the occupied Philippines during World War II.
According to Lucchesi, "Dorothy Still and the Twelve Anchors were incredibly resilient, strong, and selfless women. These women were humanity at its best. They maintained rank and nursed for more than three years in a civilian concentration camp, even though they were not required to do so. By liberation, these women weighed less than 100 pounds and all had their own ailments. They would stumble when walking through the infirmary and then try to joke about it for their patients’ sake."
All are invited to come learn more about the positive and powerful legacy of Nurse Dorothy Still and the Twelve Anchors. Dr. Lucchesi is a historian and prolific contributor to publications such as the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times and The New York Times.
Attendance is free thanks to the generosity of Village Bank & Trust; $3 suggested donations are welcome.
The History Center’s Coffee Talk series began in the winter of 2003. It is an adult program meant to invite public participation and discussion on a broad range of historical topics per the History Center’s mission.
The next Coffee Talk will feature Des Plaines History Center Curator of Collections Siobhan Heraty discussing "Des Plaines Park District 100th Anniversary" at 1:30 p.m. Thursday, June 13.

Texto completo: Before the Christchurch shooter killed 50 people at a mosque in New Zealand last month, he wrote a document that detailed his beliefs and motivations. It is a strange and disturbing piece – 87 pages in which he interviews himself, asking and answering questions such as “Were/are you a Socialist?” interlaced with anti-Islamic, anti-immigrant, racist, and misogynistic assertions.  
News outlets were divided about what to call it. The New York Times referred to it as a “white nationalist manifesto,” while NPR described it as a “hate-filled screed.” What is the difference?
A manifesto , according to Oxford Dictionaries, is “a public declaration of policy and aims.” The word implies a certain logical consistency. You may disagree with the content of a manifesto, but it is coherent and well argued. The most famous example is the “Communist Manifesto” of 1848, which inspired communist revolutions around the world. The word itself comes from the Latin manifestus , meaning “evident, unmistakable.”  
A screed , in contrast, is a long and tedious piece of writing. In the 18th century, it was possible for a screed to be dull and inoffensive – you could have “a screed on poetry,” for example. These days, the word suggests something that is full of anger and ranting. Screed is related to shred and originally referred to a scrap of cloth or paper. It probably acquired its negative connotations because it sounds like “screech” or “scream.” 
English has a surprising number of words for angry discourse, some of which might also fit. A rant is a wild speech expressing “outrage or dissatisfaction.” A tirade is similar, a long speech “marked by intemperate, vituperative, or harshly censorious language,” according to Merriam-Webster. Both are used more often in reference to spoken language than to written, however. A polemic is an attack on a person or doctrine, with an argument intended to cause controversy. While rants and tirades are emotional, polemics have a certain degree of sophistication and internal logic. Jeremiads are tirades in which the dominant tone is mournful. This word can apply to everything from a list of complaints to bitter laments about the declining morals of society. The word comes from the prophet Jeremiah, who bewailed the sinfulness of Jerusalem in the book of Lamentations.
What’s the best word, then, for statements like that of the Christchurch shooter? Manifesto implies a desire to build something, a positive plan; polemic implies careful argument. Jeremiad might work, except that such airing of complaints is a long-standing American tradition, having been used to make people aware of social problems. It seems that screed or rant best captures the violence, hatred, and incoherence of such writing. ρ

Texto completo: Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. felt the first stirrings of what would become his latest book, "Stony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the Rise of Jim Crow," during his 1969-70 sophomore year at Yale. He was enrolled in his first African-American history course - no such classes were given at his high school - and was introduced to Reconstruction, the brief period after the Civil War when blacks exerted their newfound rights and leadership in the former slave states. The course also covered the racist reaction to Reconstruction, known as Redemption, Gates writes, "when the former Confederate states 'redeemed' themselves at the expense of black rights" and took up with vehemence and violence the dictates of white supremacy. "I have connected Reconstruction with Redemption ever since, as the apex and nadir ... of the African American experience."
During that academic year, Gates also took a course on the Harlem Renaissance, a period of black intellectual and artistic ferment from the late 19th century to the mid-1920s; he continued to study that period and the emergence in those years of what became known as the New Negro. "In this book," Gates writes, "I attempt to show that the New Negro was the black community's effort to roll back Redemption, which was itself a rollback to Reconstruction, and to do so by coining a metaphor, of all things, and then by seeking to embody that metaphor." The result is "Stony the Road" - as Gates describes it, "an intellectual and cultural history of black agency and the resistance to and institutionalization of white supremacy." His title is borrowed from James Weldon Johnson's 1900 poem, "Lift Every Voice and Sing," known as the Negro national anthem: "Stony the road we trod/ Bitter the chast'ning rod."
Gates' book covers territory well known to scholars and Civil War buffs: how our received wisdom of the "tragic decade" of Reconstruction flows from two polluted streams, the myth of the Lost Cause and the Jim Crow segregation mania that swept American legislatures and popular entertainment after 1900. For those wishing to know more about this dismal story of racial hysteria in places as high as Woodrow Wilson's White House and as low as the blackface minstrel show, "Stony the Road" is excellent one-stop shopping. With a main text of about 250 pages, Gates offers a compressed yet surprisingly comprehensive narrative sweep, in addition to the usual catalog of political sins, an overview of the lesser-known stories of how our "best" universities, such as Columbia and Harvard, allowed two pseudo-disciplines - "scientific racism" and eugenics - to create a false dogma of black misrule and white suffering at the center of the Reconstruction narrative.
With a dazzling selection of cartoon stereotypes, the author shows that in the white supremacist reaction "all along, the issue had been about the fabrication of hateful imagery in order to justify robbing black people of their constitutional rights and their economic potential."
In tracing the emergence of the New Negro, Gates notes that Booker T. Washington "was named the very first new Negro" by the white press. But Washington was "problematic" - he called for a regime of economic cooperation and social separation as a necessary condition of black progress. Gates observes that Washington was gradually eclipsed by more militant followers of Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. Du Bois. The latter's scholarship in combination with the Harlem Renaissance saw the emergence of a "newer New Negro" and vigorous pursuit of the rights of equal treatment first promised by the Reconstruction Congress that passed the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments.
Gates is at his most fluent in defining the newer Negro as a feature of the Harlem Renaissance powered by Alain Locke, Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson and other key figures of the African-American creative pantheon. Locke is depicted as a flawed visionary who believed that artistic achievement would be as sure a path to equality as politics or economics. "They saw themselves as members of the black upper class," Gates writes, "a cosmopolitan mobile elite that could be integrated into American society, even if 'the slow-moving black masses' (as the head of the Urban League Charles S. Johnson would actually call them) could not."
Notwithstanding his high regard for the Renaissance, Gates clearly tilts toward politics, rather than art-for-art's-sake or pure commerce, as the most reliable vehicle for black progress. "No people, in all of human history, has ever been liberated by the creation of art. None," Gates asserts with a sense of certainty that is a signature of his rhetoric.
Analytically, this is a lively, consistently challenging book. I was struck by a sweeping criticism Gates offers in discussing the Harlem Renaissance. He blames Locke's 1925 anthology, "The New Negro," for ignoring "those great geniuses of black vernacular culture, the musicians who created the world's greatest art form in the entire twentieth century - jazz." The grandiose language feels like special pleading, based on personal taste, but Gates usefully reminds us that "jazz and its companion blues," while rooted in black culture, have a unique place in one of modernity's great stories, the African-American experience on the American continent in the previous century. Gates' telling of that story is a contribution to what we ought to be thinking about, given the rocky launch of this newest American century.

Modell's taps financial adviser for guidance

Texto completo: Modell's Sporting Goods, known for its catchy "Gotta Go To Mo's" jingle, has obtained guidance from a financial adviser — an indication that the country's oldest sporting goods store is facing mounting pressure in today's competitive retail climate.
The Manhattan-based retailer, which has more than 150 stores in the Northeast, including dozens in New York and New Jersey, has tapped California-based consulting firm Berkeley Research Group, the same adviser that worked with Modell's in 2017 and that has advised other troubled retailers like Gymboree Group Inc.
Retail experts say it is not unusual for retailers to reposition themselves in the ever-changing world of retail, where competition from big-box stores and online shopping has forced a growing list of retailers to file for bankruptcy in the first four months of 2019 alone, including Charlotte Russe and Payless ShoeSource.
Mitchell Modell, the retailer's chief executive, said the retailer has long-term plans to stay in business.,
"We are committed to securing our future in a challenging retail climate, and therefore are always looking for ways to improve our performance," Modell said in an emailed statement responding to questions from the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey. "To help us with efficiencies and process improvement, we have engaged Berkeley Research Group, as we have done in the past."
Modell, a resident of Alpine, did not specify what the company's plans were. When asked if stores would be closing in New Jersey or New York, he said the retailer had no plans to shutter stores in those markets, beyond closures that he said occur annually when leases expire.
The Wall Street Journal first reported in March that Modell's hired Berkeley Research Group. In the report, people familiar with the matter said options on the table included a possible bankruptcy filing or restructuring.
Should the retailer eventually file for bankruptcy or plan any widespread closures, it could send shock waves across New York and New Jersey's retail sectors. The chain has an estimated 100 stores in the two states, according to a count on the company's website. That's about one-third of the chain's retail footprint.
Widespread closures could have a big impact on the region's commercial real estate market, which has recently had to absorb the closure of Toys R Us and Sears stores, and must deal with planned closures of some Bed Bath & Beyond stores soon.
Retailers typically hire financial advisers when the future of their companies is uncertain, and because advisers can offer an objective approach to dealing with a distressed company, said Ted Gavin, managing director of Gavin/Solmonese, a bankruptcy and restructuring consulting firm.
Gavin said Modell's may consider getting out of under-performing markets. That, he said, is key to balancing other financial strains a retailer may be facing, whether too much debt or declining sales in particular stores.
"The key is to get out of the markets that aren't working for you and to do it early enough to be able to preserve cash," Gavin said.
An immigrant from Hungary The retail world has been unforgiving to sporting goods companies, but Modell's, the oldest family-owned sporting goods company in the country, has managed to stay afloat amid the changing tides.
The business started when Morris A. Modell, an immigrant from Hungary, opened a general store on Cortlandt Street in Lower Manhattan in 1889 — a date that has been affixed on the store's red-and-white signs for decades. The company thrived after World War I by stocking up on Army surplus merchandise and selling it at low prices, according to William Modell's obituary in The New York Times.
William Modell, the third generation to run the business, profited from the failures of his rivals, the Times reported. In 1996, Modell's grew from 67 stores by paying $2.5 million for 15 outlets in New Jersey and in the Baltimore and Washington areas from bankrupt Herman's World of Sporting Goods.
Modell's reportedly considered a similar strategy in 2016 when Sports Authority liquidated all its stores. Modell's planned to bid on some of Sports Authority's failed stores, but that plan was never executed.
Often, the competition between sporting goods companies has been fierce.
Dick's Sporting Goods, arguably, fast-tracked Sports Authority's demise — the big-box chain had a strategy of placing its new stores as close as possible to existing Sports Authority locations, taking away sales from the struggling retailer.
Today, Dick's Sporting Goods remains a dominant player. Modell's, by comparison, has a much smaller footprint that is exclusive to the Northeast.
Local footprints Earlier this year, a Modell's in the Arlington Shopping Plaza on Route 46 in Parsippany closed after the holiday season.
That Modell's is one of two big-box vacancies inside the shopping plaza.
The shell of a former K-Mart sits at the opposite end of the plaza. The Bed, Bath & Beyond store that is in the center, anchored with a Home Depot, is expected to close by summer — when that store's lease expires.
Just this week, Union-based Bed, Bath & Beyond announced plans to shutter an estimated 40 stores to make way for 15 new locations.
Modell's also has a store in Paramus, which is considered by many the retail mecca of Bergen County.
A shuttered Modell's Sporting Goods store in Parsippany is pictured on March 7.

Texto completo: Una vez más el presidente Donald Trump se vuelca a Twitter para arremeter contra sus críticos, esta vez haciendo una inusual exigencia.
Trump atacó al premio Nobel de economía, Paul Krugman y columnista del New York Times acusándolo de estar “obsesionado con el odio” de su administración.
En un par de tweets, Trump arremitió contra Krugman por lo que llamó “escritos falsos y altamente inexactos” después de la columna más reciente de Krugman, que dice que los republicanos ya no apoyan los valores estadounidenses.
“Paul Krugman, de Fake News New York Times, ha perdido toda credibilidad, al igual que el propio Times, con sus escritos falsos y altamente inexactos sobre mí”, escribió Trump. “Está obsesionado con el odio, al igual que otros están obsesionados con lo estúpido que es. Dijo que el mercado se estrellaría, ¡Sólo los máximos históricos!”
“Me pregunto si el New York Times se disculpará conmigo por segunda vez, como lo hicieron después de las elecciones de 2016”, continuó Trump. “Pero este tendrá que ser una disculpa mucho más grande y mejor. En este caso, tendrán que arrodillarse y pedir perdón, ¡son verdaderamente el Enemigo del Pueblo!”
Paul Krugman, of the Fake News New York Times, has lost all credibility, as has the Times itself, with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me. He is obsessed with hatred, just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. He said Market would crash, Only Record Highs!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019
I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger & better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019
Tras revisar el reporte de Robert Mueller, Krugman acusó a presidente y su campaña de “recibier con agrado” la asistencia rusa durante las elecciones de 2016, una referencia a los hallazgos del informe que determinó que los agentes rusos interfirieron en las elecciones de 2016 con la intención de apoyar la candidatura de Trump.
“Una potencia extranjera hostil intervino en las elecciones presidenciales, con la esperanza de instalar a Donald Trump en la Casa Blanca. La campaña de Trump fue consciente de esta intervención y la acogió. Y una vez en el poder, Trump intentó bloquear cualquier investigación sobre lo que sucedió”, Krugman. escribió.

Texto completo: Se conocen más detalles sobre Larry Hopkins , el líder de los Patriotas Constitucionales de los Estados Unidos, la milicia pro Trump que detuvo con armas de fuego a un grupo de 300 inmigrantes en la frontera sur.
El líder de la milicia de extrema derecha, capturado por el FBI dos días después de que el grupo publicó el video de la captura de los inmigrantes, presumió hace dos años que los miembros de su grupo habían recibido capacitación para asesinar a figuras como el ex presidente Obama.
Los documentos judiciales conocidos por Reuters dijeron que si bien se había estado investigando las denuncias de “actividad de la milicia extremista” en 2017, los testigos acusaron a Hopkins de decir que su grupo planeaba asesinar no solo a Obama, sino al candidato presidencial demócrata de 2016, Hillary Clinton y George Soros, un rico partidario de los liberales.
Hopkins ahora enfrenta cargos criminales por posesión de armas de fuego.
Reuters informó que el agente especial del FBI, David Gabriel, había descubierto una charla sobre dichos asesinatos en octubre de 2017, cuando estaba investigando informes de que una milicia operaba desde la casa de Hopkins en Nuevo México.
“Hopkins supuestamente también hizo la declaración de que los Patriotas Constitucionales de los Estados Unidos se estaban entrenando para asesinar a George Soros, Hillary Clinton y Barack Obama “, según el reporte de Reuters.
El informe señala que el grupo ha afirmado haber ayudado a los funcionarios de La Migra a detener a 5,600 migrantes en el desierto de Nuevo México en los últimos 60 días.
Por su parte Carlos A. Díaz, un portavoz de la Patrulla Fronteriza, le dijo a The New York Times que la agencia federal “no respalda a los grupos privados u organizaciones que toman los asuntos de aplicación en sus propias manos”.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
On a recent Friday afternoon, a team of writers huddled in a test kitchen with exposed brick, soft lighting and high ceilings on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
The smell of fresh basil and the sound of clinks from dishes filled the space, a small area decorated with plants, paper lanterns and baking racks piled high with gadgets like espresso machines and pressure cookers.
The group works on the kitchen team at Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products. Wirecutter's small but dedicated kitchen team is a group of five writers and editors who enter every product testing with meticulous attention to detail and a sense of seriousness, whether it's a niche product like an expensive pizza oven (that day's assignment) or essentials, like refrigerators, skillets and chef's knives.
A great Wirecutter pick, at its core, "exceeds expectations of what a product or category can be," said Ben Frumin, the site's editor in chief.
Guides on the service journalism website, which was founded in 2011 by Brian Lam and purchased by The New York Times Company in 2016, typically focus on practical and affordable products that people can adapt easily into their lives. They review smart speakers, coffee makers, running gear and baby strollers. (The site sometimes earns affiliate commissions when readers buy products through recommended links.)
Wirecutter's kitchen and dining section has published over 140 guides. The team constantly looks for new products to add as updates to its existing stories.
Wirecutter prides itself on the intensive reporting and research that go into its guides and reviews. Some guides take 40 to 60 hours to produce. Because the site serves a wide audience, musings on, for example, the best air purifiers or acoustic guitars for beginners are designed to be easily digestible, but hours of work and critical thinking go into the guides.
"A lot of the time is spent talking through things as the writers are testing," said Marguerite Preston, the kitchen editor at Wirecutter who oversees and assigns guides. "We have to think about not only what is going to be the top pick, but why is that the top pick?"
The writers said they tested for a broad audience, although men and young adults are the biggest visitors to the site, according to Lesley Stockton, a senior staff writer. Ms. Stockton says she believes the readership expands into other demographics through word-of-mouth.
"Parents and aunts and uncles come to Wirecutter because the younger generation says, 'Why don't you just look at Wirecutter for that thing that you need?' and get swept into it as well," she said.
After Ms. Stockton tested pizza stones and baking steels -- ceramic and steel slabs that trap heat, best for baking pizzas and breads -- the team requested the Breville Smart Oven Pizzaiolo, an $ 800 appliance, to compare the products.
"I'm typically pretty skeptical of appliances that are that expensive," Ms. Preston said. But the fact that the oven advertised it could reach 750 degrees, when a typical home oven reaches only 500 degrees, intrigued her and Ms. Stockton.
Wirecutter's team spends weeks discussing the best way to evaluate something, including surveys and real-world use.
To test the Pizzaiolo, Ms. Stockton made a dozen homemade dough balls and let them ferment for two days. She gathered fresh toppings, like Parmesan cheese, olives, basil and anchovies, for the two pizza styles the manual recommended: Neapolitan and New York.
She compared baking the pies using the manual settings with the automatic presets. The pizza cooked within two to seven minutes on both settings. When Ms. Stockton wasn't satisfied with how the pizzas browned, she cranked up the heat a few notches in the oven.
Ms. Stockton closely examined the Pizzaiolo's size, practicality and price point. She decided the pizza oven would make an uncomfortable fit for a small New York City apartment, but might be the right choice for people with large kitchens. She noted that it was difficult to clean and that the high price made it unappealing for the average person.
After testing the Pizzaiolo, Ms. Stockton put a pizza in the conventional oven atop a baking stone she tested for a larger guide. Although the stone took longer to preheat than the Pizzaiolo, she recommended it for its affordable price and versatility.
She later made even more pizzas and re-evaluated the oven's automatic settings, saying the appliance was high-quality, but not for everyone.
Ms. Stockton concluded: "You would have to be a pretty die-hard home pizza hobbyist to want this oven."

'Curse of La Llorona' Tops the Box Office

Texto completo: With "Avengers: Endgame" positioned to wipe out any competitors come Friday, only a couple of studios dared to roll out new movies this weekend.
It worked fairly well for both of them.
Warner Bros.'s "The Curse of La Llorona," the latest horror movie from some of the producers of the popular "Conjuring" series, topped the domestic box office with $26.5 million in ticket sales. That's a solid start; the movie reportedly cost just $9 million to make. While it pales in comparison to the $53.5 million that "The Nun," a recent "Conjuring" offshoot, made during its opening weekend in September, it is above the roughly $21 million opening weekend that analysts expected for "La Llorona."
Directed by Michael Chaves, "La Llorona" stars Linda Cardellini as Anna, a widow. The plot involves Anna and her two children, Chris (Roman Christou) and Sam (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen), being haunted by La Llorona (Marisol Ramirez), a weeping woman based on a figure associated with Mexican folklore. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called the movie "an enjoyably old-fashioned ghost story."

Warner Bros. also took the No. 2 spot with its lighthearted superhero movie "Shazam!," which brought in $17.3 million during its third weekend. Its domestic gross is now $121.3 million.
The other new movie this weekend was Fox's faith-based "Breakthrough," which landed in third place with $11.1 million. Based on a 2015 incident in which a Missouri teenager survived after being submerged for 15 minutes in a frozen lake, the movie stars Chrissy Metz as a mother who prays for her son (Marcel Ruiz) to make a seemingly impossible medical recovery.
Disney's "Captain Marvel," in its seventh week, rose from sixth place last week up to fourth, earning another $9.1 million this weekend. The movie, which was the debut of Brie Larson's superhero, now has a cumulative domestic total of $400 million -- just in time for Larson to outpace herself as part of the "Avengers" ensemble this week.

Texto completo: The head of a militia group that reportedly has been detaining scores of migrant families at gunpoint as they crossed New Mexico's southern border was arrested Saturday by the FBI on charges of being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition.
Larry Mitchell Hopkins, 69, who lives in the tiny village of Flora Vista in San Juan County, was arrested in Sunland Park, a border town near El Paso, the FBI said in a statement.
It wasn't Hopkins' first arrest on a weapons charge. He faced a similar count in Oregon in 2006. Though, Hopkins' original felony conviction was not immediately clear. The FBI said in the statement that it would not release further information until after his first court appearance, scheduled Monday in U.S. District Court in Las Cruces.
Online New Mexico court records did not show any charges for Hopkins, who also has used the names Johnny Horton Jr. and Scott Alan Curtiss.
Hopkins, who has said in court documents that he runs an entertainment business and is a musician and recording artist, is the leader of the United Constitutional Patriots, a group of "Americans that believe in the constitution and the rights of every American that will stand up for there [sic] rights in unity and help keep America safe," according to a Facebook group page.
Last week, the militia detained about 200 migrants, most of them Central Americans who had just crossed the border near Sunland Park, seeking asylum, according to the New York Times.
Militias have been operating along the border for years to try to curb the flow of immigrants, but the recent targeting of families -- which are allowed by law to request asylum and typically surrender to Border Patrol agents -- is raising the ire of human rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Times reported.
Allegra Love, executive director of the Santa Fe Dreamers Project, which provides free legal services to immigrants, expressed outrage over the militia's activities.
"We don't need citizens confronting them at gunpoint," she said Saturday, referring to the men, women and children who have been making the arduous trek to the U.S. border in droves from nations such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.
The Facebook page for Hopkins' group shows a video of masked men pointing guns at families with young children as they await Border Patrol officers.
"They're already fleeing violence in their home countries," Love said. "It's an incredibly difficult journey, morale is low, only to be assaulted by citizens of this country? We can meet these folks with compassion."
Political leaders in New Mexico also have condemned the armed groups.
"This is a dangerous felon who should not have weapons around children and families," New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas said of Hopkins in a statement issued Saturday. "Today's arrest by the FBI indicates clearly that the rule of law should be in the hands of trained law enforcement officials, not armed vigilantes."
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a Twitter message a day before Hopkins' arrest, "We are actively working with @NewMexicoAOG as well as local and state police. Menacing or threatening migrant families and asylum-seekers is absolutely unacceptable and must cease."
But state Sen. Joseph Cervantes, who ran against Lujan Grisham in the Democratic primary race for governor last year, said Balderas must do more.
"NM Attny Gen. must arrest, charge and prosecute those kidnapping and pulling guns on immigrants in my Senate District/Sunland Park. Scolding them won't cut it," Cervantes tweeted Saturday.
Even Gavin Clarkson -- a New Mexico Republican running for U.S. Senate who met with members of Hopkins' militia in March, according to a video posted on Facebook -- decried their efforts Saturday. He said on Twitter that "masked militiamen are the antithesis of what a free republic looks like. I absolutely condemn their lawless activities."
It wasn't clear Saturday how Hopkins' arrest would affect the activities of United Constitutional Patriots at the border. One member, though, appeared to warn supporters on Facebook that the group was under siege.
Chuck Davis, who identified himself as the head of intelligence and chaplain of United Constitutional Patriots, said in a post Saturday, in all capital letters, "We have an emergency. The commander was arrested by the FBI at base camp. It was a set up."
Davis went on to say that "they are trying to use [Hopkins'] past from 50 years ago."
Other Facebook posts indicate the group has faced a mix of troubles and support since news emerged late last week that it has been holding families at gunpoint. PayPal suspended an account the group was using to collect donations, a member posted Friday. By Saturday, another member had posted information about a new PayPal account where backers could send funds to cover costs of supplies for the militia's border operation.
Hopkins has a troubled history, according to court documents.
In a U.S. District Court case in South Dakota accusing him of failing to pay child support in Washington state, Hopkins argued that he had a tough upbringing. He also claimed in a 2011 sentencing memorandum, seeking probation in the case, that he had never met the child to whom he owed support and had been told while he was in prison that the child had died.
He had an "extremely abusive" stepfather, he wrote, who had removed him from school when he was 13 and sent him to work for the man's logging company.
After telling another logger that his 17-year-old sister had become pregnant out of wedlock, Hopkins wrote, his stepfather kicked him out of the house with two boxes of clothes, saying, "Why, I ought'a shoot you boy. What right do you have telling anybody your sister is pregnant."
Hopkins said a trucker picked him up and drove him to the home of an aunt and uncle, and he "began his exposure to the Court system at that time."
Eventually, he was given a choice by the court to join the military or go to a home for neglected children, he said; he chose to enlist at age 17. He served in Vietnam from 1967-70, he said.
Hopkins was charged in 2006 in Klamath County, Ore., with impersonating a police officer and being a felon in possession of a firearm, according to court records uncovered by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups and extremists in the U.S.
A Klamath County Sheriff's Office report said Hopkins was found at a gas station in Keno, Ore., showing firearms to youth and telling them he was a police officer.
Hopkins had been "bragging about going on drug stings in Louisiana and stating that he worked for the government," a deputy said.
A witness told deputies Hopkins had claimed to be a "fugitive bounty hunter" and a police officer.
In his guilty plea in the case, records show, Hopkins acknowledged he had given "the impression to others that I was a peace officer" while unlawfully carrying a firearm as a convicted felon.

Will Costa Rica be next to suffer 'leftist' policies?

Texto completo: In the ongoing U.S. debate about immigration, the Central American countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala are mainly in the news because many of those crossing our border from Mexico are from these nations. Why isn't Costa Rica experiencing a similar mass exodus?
I put the question to President Carlos Alvarado Quesada. In an email response he writes in part, "8 percent of our GDP is dedicated to education and our main resource is the human talent and well-being of the people who live in our country. Next Monday, for example, we will celebrate 150 years of primary education for free for all kids in the country."
Many of those fleeing other Central American countries claim to feel threatened by gangs and crime. Costa Rica has had a lower crime rate than others in the region, but that may be about to change.
According to the Costa Rica Star newspaper, the government and tourism industry started paying more attention to crime when "two female foreign tourists were killed in two days last year, and a third was raped a week later, all near Tortuguero National Park." The Costa Rican homicide rate has been rising steadily. There were 603 murders in 2017, although figures are lower than in other Central American countries.
Costa Rica is experiencing its own immigration challenge. The New York Times reported last September, "Since mid-April, when Nicaragua erupted in a violent political crisis that has left hundreds dead and crippled the economy, Nicaraguans have been leaving their country en masse -- some fleeing a crackdown by President Daniel Ortega against his opponents, others -- newly unemployed -- desperately looking for work. Many thousands have headed to Costa Rica ...."
In fact, writes QCostaRica.com, "Costa Rica has the highest percentage of immigrants in Central America, according to the study Labor Market and Social Policies, of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)."
Tourism is the main economic driver here. The government is concerned any perception it is unsafe to visit might cause serious financial harm.
The Heritage Foundation's 2018 economic freedom rankings place Costa Rica 61st under the category "moderately free," although President Alvarado references The Economist, which ranks his country "among the strongest 20 democracies in the world."
While acknowledging The Economist's ranking, Anthony Kim of the Heritage Foundation comments, "the country needs deeper institutional reforms for more dynamic development of a broader private sector. Despite progress, excessive government bureaucracy still discourages entrepreneurial activity, slowing the pace of privatization and fiscal reform. Widening budget deficits have put public debt on an upward trend, just to name a few economic policy shortcomings. Costa Rica can do more in terms of implementing pro-growth policies and needed economic reforms."
Not many people are leaving Costa Rica. It has the lowest emigration rate in Central America and one of the lowest in Latin America and the Caribbean. And though the unemployment rate is 9.30 percent and about 20 percent of the population lives in poverty, Costa Ricans stay put.
Part of the reason may be a new anti-poverty program introduced by the previous president, Luis Guillermo Solis. Its goal is to pull at least 54,600 targeted families out of poverty. The plan combines previous welfare benefits that have been, reports the Tico Times, "distributed through 30 separate programs, administered by 20 different agencies." Families are to be assessed according to their needs and not a-one-size-fits-all formula. Job training and education scholarships are part of the plan so that poverty doesn't become a life sentence.
President Alvarado, 39, and a center-leftist, has different priorities. The major issue in the last election was same-sex marriage. The former president opposed it, while Mr. Alvarado supports it.
Mr. Alvarado is also a disciple of the climate-change movement. His goal is to achieve zero net carbon emissions by 2020.
How a small country like Costa Rica -- or even a larger one like the United States -- can affect the globe's naturally changing temperatures -- especially when major polluters like China, India and, yes, the United States aren't doing much to reduce carbon emissions -- is never addressed. For the left, intentions count, not results.
Crime control and maintaining a vibrant tourist industry seem to be better and more attainable goals than changing the climate and promoting same-sex marriage.

Texto completo: On this holiest day of the Christian calendar, let's talk religion.
I'll try not to toss in politics and sex, I promise. But I will throw money in the commentary pot.
I got to thinking about the Holy Spirit, Jesus and money last week after the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris nearly burned down. To me, it's an 850-year-old architectural treasure that simultaneously heralds man's amazing creativity and building acumen, and our devotion to elevating God and Jesus through excessive materialism.
If you've never been there, it's a magnificent structure, intended to awe and awaken a sense of God's glory, I suppose. Taking in such grandeur dedicated to a power greater than ourselves can indeed inspire us, whether it's Notre Dame or the Basilica of St. Lawrence here in Asheville.
When I visited Notre Dame in the late 1980s, I was appropriately awed, but I also couldn't help thinking that the Catholic church spent a fortune on an opulent edifice over a couple of centuries while much of the world's population lived infamously short and brutal lives. And I grew up Catholic.
Now, in the wake of the conflagration, billionaires are coming to the grand dame's rescue, opening their wallets and promising astounding amounts of cash for the rebuilding effort. As USA TODAY reported, "Francois Henri Pinault and Bernard Arnault — both billionaires — each pledged more than $100 million to the restoration efforts. The rivals have a history of one-upmanship."
The restoration could run into the billions. You've got to wonder, What Would Jesus Do?
The outpouring of grief and dollars over a building has generated a fair amount of controversy.
Pastors and Yeezys and big houses The New York Times carried a fantastic piece last week with one of the best headlines ever: "Let He Who Is Without Yeezys Cast the First Stone. Should pastors wear $5,000 sneakers?"
Yeezys apparently are sneakers created in collaboration with rapper Kanye West. I've heard of Kanye, but not the shoes. I'm not impressed by either.
As a guy who paid $3,800 for my current car, the idea of dropping $1,200 more than that to emulate a rap star and showcase a status symbol that will wear out in 10 months seems a bit extravagant. Unless the shoes were large enough to drive, that is.
At any rate, apparently a whole lot of pastors sport $700 shoes or pants or jackets, partly as an effort to look cool and appeal to the youth, partly because sometimes the companies or friends give them the togs.
The Greenville News in South Carolina recently wrote about a Christian megachurch pastor living in a $1.8 million church-owned home and buying his wife a $200,000-plus Lamborghini as an anniversary gifts.
Call me crazy, but I can't really see Jesus zipping around town in a Lambo. A cart pulled by a donkey, maybe.
Jesus would be appalled Personally, I've got to think Jesus, upon his return, will likely be appalled right down to his sandals by such excesses in a world in which so many still suffer and lack life's basic necessities. We're not exactly loving one another when we drop a grand on clothes and then walk right past the food bank without giving.
Really, I see nothing new here. Anybody remember Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker living like royalty while promising salvation through a theme park?
People cashing in on Christ has pretty much been going on since he left the tomb and a vendor started hawking the shroud. It's all unseemly and well, not terribly Christ-like.
But it's also really easy to get on your high horse and become judgmental. All of this is a very slippery slope.
Personally, I fall into the, "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God." As, you know, Jesus said that.
He also lived humbly, with few possessions, and went a little bananas about the money changers. Not exactly a Gordon Gekko Wall Street capitalist titan, that savior of the world.
Yes, I know Jesus also said the poor will always be with us, but he also said we should help the poor and live humbly and modestly, with the concept of loving one another as the primary driver in our lives.
Lots of Christians adhere to the "prosperity" principles cited in the Bible, a book which I've always found can offer an argument for just about any kind of behavior people want to engage in or criticize.
Look, we all spend money superfluously at times, whether it's on craft beers (guilty as charged!) or dining out or buying that fancy sports car we've always coveted, or even spending $90 on a pair of Merrell shoes when the Skechers on sale would have sufficed. (Guilty again — I love me some old man Merrells!) Obviously, I could divert that saved money to the poor, just like the South Carolina pastor could've bought his wife a Ford and diverted $150,000 to the poor, or the French gazillionaires could give Notre Dame $50 million and donate the other half to charity.
Yes, if mankind all chipped in, we could end world hunger and poverty.
It's all about priorities and rights and beliefs, and it's all very complicated.
But yes, the spending and the wealth accrued in Christ's name does indeed feel obscene at times.
I'm reminded of the famous 1964 U.S. Supreme Court case about obscenity in which Justice Potter Stewart described his threshold test for spotting it as, "...I know it when I see it..."
I think we're seeing it all the time now, and I've got to think Jesus, when he returns, will be appalled.
Happy Easter.

West Palm wants to know: Where are you going?

Texto completo: WEST PALM BEACH — Your cellular phone is talking even when you aren’t, and the city might want to listen to it.
West Palm Beach’s economic development director, Christopher Roog, this week presented the mayor and city commissioners with a proposal for a Florida Atlantic University researcher to track phone signals as people drive, bike or walk on Clematis Street.
The idea is to analyze where downtown visitors go — what shops, what public places, and at what time — and how they get there. The city could use it to study traffic flow and gauge the impact of changes it makes to the streetscape, while merchants could use the data to strategize to improve business.
Mayor Keith James said at the mayor-commission work session Monday that he found the idea “very interesting” and indicated he would bring it up for a commission vote in coming weeks.
“It provides a very powerful streetscape analytics tool” to gather “hyper-local” information of value to residents, merchants and the public, said Jason Hallstrom, professor in FAU’s Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, who spelled out details of what would be a joint project of the city and university.
According to Hallstrom, the research is possible because 80 percent of the U.S. population owns network-connected smartphones, whose signal can be tracked with precision.
“Whether you use the device or not, it is constantly chattering,” sending out a “hello beacon which says, ‘I would like to connect to a network.’ Within that message is a unique code, etched in the silicon. It is constantly being broadcast as you walk around with that device,” Hallstrom said.
The signals are like breadcrumbs and the researchers could assemble those breadcrumbs to study “individual mobility pathways” and combine them with city maps to track and analyze where they go, he said.
Special receivers would be placed up and down Clematis to pick up the signals. The researcher, likely an FAU doctoral student, later could conduct the same analysis elsewhere around the city.
Sounds pretty 1984?
According to a New York Times investigation, there’s a hot market for location data gathered from mobile phones that have location services enabled. Sales of location-targeted advertising reached $21 billion last year, the Times reported Dec. 10, in an article titled, “Your Apps Know Where You Were Last Night, and They’re Not Keeping It Secret.”
Those with access to the data can identify a person without consent, the article said. “They could follow someone they knew, by pinpointing a phone that regularly spent time at that person’s home address.
Or, working in reverse, they could attach a name to an anonymous dot, by seeing where the device spent nights and using public records to figure out who lived there.”
Protecting personal privacy “is something personally that I care very deeply about,” Hallstrom said, adding that safeguards would be added to prevent the signal from being tracked back to an individual.
As a former police officer, “I know law enforcement will request data,” Commissioner Joe Peduzzi said. Would they be able to track a person’s movements, he asked?
With the phone and a subpoena, that would be possible, Hallstrom replied.
The data would be owned by the city, and the city and FAU jointly might license the analytics that stem from the project to outside parties, he said.
Roog estimated the project would run three years and cost $600,000. The Knight Foundation, which has funded several innovative programs in the city, indicated it would cover half the cost, leaving the city responsible for $100,000 per year for each year, he said. The city’s Community Redevelopment Agency also might contribute, he said.
The project offers “significant potential,” James concluded. “I’m excited in terms of what we can learn and how it can influence our strategies.”

Texto completo: To: David Brooks
Columnist, The New York Times
Dear David,
We have met a few times over the years while covering the same events. I’m a big fan. You write beautifully and, more often than not, have insights about our politics, lifestyles and beliefs that others have missed. But as time passes, you have grown increasingly somber about our national condition. Your most recent column, based on your new book “The Second Mountain,” is downright depressing.
Here’s a brief summary: “The whole country is going through some sort of spiritual and emotional crisis. . . . We’ve created a culture based on lies.” One is that “career success is fulfilling.” Not so, you say. “Everybody who has actually tasted success can tell you that’s not true.” Another related lie is that “I can make myself happy” through “individual accomplishment. . . . The message of the meritocracy is that you are what you accomplish. . . . You are not a soul to be saved but a set of skills to be maximized.”
As a rule, I rarely respond directly to other columnists. Many columnists do the same. It’s a good rule because, if abandoned, it would make commentary even more personal and shrill. But sometimes rules need to be broken. This is, I think, one of those times.
So, David, let me respectfully suggest: Lighten up.
To be sure, most of your insights are true. But they’re also utopian. You argue that we’ve lost our moral compass and have surrendered to delusional beliefs that rationalize a cultural emptiness. You seem disappointed that we haven’t arrived in some Garden of Eden paradise where almost everyone is happy, fulfilled, responsible and respected. I yearn for this as well, but I have reconciled myself to the inevitability of imperfection.
Our job as journalists is not simply to point out untruths, injustices and societal problems. It is also to illuminate the inconsistencies, contradictions and confusions of our national condition. It is, in short, to be realistic, especially when being realistic is politically and intellectually unpopular — as it is now.
We have a culture of complaint, where nothing works, selfishness is rampant, disillusion is widespread and hatred — practiced across the political spectrum — is common. There is no virtue in feeding this frenzy of pessimism, just because it fits the temper of the times. We need to recognize the limits of our condition. Many legitimate problems can’t be solved, and some problems aren’t worth solving.
It is also worth acknowledging that things could be worse. Most Americans who want jobs have them; we are not engaged in a major war; millions of households are doing the difficult work of balancing the duties of child-rearing with the rigors of their job schedules. The Trump presidency has turned up the heat on public and private discourse without (yet) leading to a breakdown of debate. Crudely, the nation’s institutions seem to be working.
David, here are a few comments on the “lies” that you describe as polluting today’s American dream:
● Ambition is America’s blessing and curse. It is a blessing because it encourages people to try new things, to stretch their abilities and to see how much more they can achieve. It fosters a vibrant economy, even if the most ambitious people are often unattractive as human beings. That’s the curse. Great ambition often causes great character flaws. Obsessed with their projects and themselves, people mistreat co-workers and family. They’re creatures of their ambitions, which can be both frustrating and fulfilling.
● Happiness is not a practical goal of public policy, even if governments sometimes reduce or eliminate some conditions that make people unhappy or miserable. But if some sources disappear, others may arise. There are too many factors (personality, religion, schools, luck, parents — or lack thereof — and much more) that determine outcomes. Pursuing happiness should remain, mostly, a personal responsibility. Making it a public responsibility would ensure failure.
●The meritocracy — frequently criticized — is not nearly so sinister as it’s portrayed. Of course, it creates stress among its members. They’re constantly being measured and prodded to do better, or to lose out to the students, workers and athletes next door. But the meritocracy’s principles, even if sometimes violated, are the right ones to govern our institutions. We want people who know what they’re doing; competition is not a bad way to make the selections. What are the alternatives? Would we be better off if social connections, race or political affiliation assumed a larger role?
Finally, there’s the matter of work. Everyone complains about it, but without it, most of us would die of boredom. Learning new stuff, the essence of journalism, is inherently rewarding, and, David, you and I are paid to do it. The virtues outweigh the vices.
So, let’s keep perspective. We don’t live in an ideal world and never will. But things could be worse, maybe quite a bit worse. Let’s try to avoid that.

Texto completo: Congressman John Joyce, a Hollidaysburg Republican, said he was stunned with what he saw on a congressional trip to the U.S.-Mexico border at Yuma, Ariz., this week.
His trip with a contingent of Republican congressmen coincided with an emergency declaration by Yuma Mayor Douglas Nicholls, who called for a "FEMA-type response" as officials tried to cope with a surge of asylum-seeking migrants from Central America streaming into overtaxed facilities in the border city of 100,000 people.
The New York Times reported Tuesday that Border Patrol agents had apprehended more than 1,000 migrants in the Yuma sector over a three-day period and that during the seven-month period from Sept. 1 through March 31, the number of migrants apprehended there had increased from 6,487 during the same period the prior year to 24,194.
"It was eye-opening, to say the least. ...Trust me, after what I've seen this week the crisis is real," Joyce said of the vast stream migrants who are walking into the U.S. through the Arizona desert.
Joyce, a physician, said he learned a child had been detained with its mother and was being treated for measles at the Yuma center. It was the first measles case at the facility. But even more frightening, he said, were the 12 tuberculosis cases, including multiple cases of antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis, among migrants being detained and treated there.
He said exhausted Border Patrol agents working double shifts to fill the gaps in a manpower shortage took his contingent into the desert to see what was happening as groups of asylum-seeking migrants sat down, calmly waiting to be taken in for processing.
"The largest apprehension was 32 adults, each one of them with a child, each one of them with a fast pass to entry," Joyce said. He said agents told them those with a child are often processed, given a date for a hearing and released in as soon as a day and a half.
Joyce said he's particularly concerned about reports that some children are used as ploys by unrelated adults, and then sent back across the border to be used again and again by others.
He said he plans to co-sponsor H.R. 586. Joyce said the bill, penned by Rep. Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican, was designed to protect such children by requiring that they be released only to individuals who can prove they are a parent or legal guardian.
Joyce said the overwhelming message he took away from his visit is that congress must fix loopholes in the nation's asylum system, provide adequate funds for manpower and technology at the border and build the wall.
"By building that wall we can allow the border patrol to push immigrants to the ports of entry to be processed," he said.

How Notre Dame helped three Louisiana churches rebuild

Texto completo: Weeks before the fire at the Notre Dame Cathedral, a Baptist church in Louisiana went up in flames.

It was only the first in a series of what appear to have been hate crimes. Over the next two weeks, two other Baptist churches were reduced to ash.

Since April 4, the date of the last inferno, the churches had struggled to raise the funding for renewal. But then a fire erupted at France’s most iconic cathedral, and people started to pay attention.

An international tragedy such as the collapse of the 850-year-old cathedral’s roof and spire can become a reminder of how religious spaces influence many more than those who attend services there.

In the case of Louisiana’s St. Landry Parish, Notre Dame reminded Americans that even if you’re not religious, we can all unite to help people who’ve suffered a terrible loss.

The three historically black churches — St. Mary Baptist Church, Greater Union Baptist Church, and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church — appear to have been the victims of violent racism. A 21-year-old was charged with arson and hate crimes in connection with the fires.

Because of Notre Dame, their story went viral. Just two days after the catastrophe in France, a crowdfunding campaign for the churches reached, then surpassed, its $1.8 million goal. It’s now at more than $2 million.

It shouldn’t take a high-profile disaster such as the destruction of Notre Dame for people to pay attention to the restoration of three rural churches. Nevertheless, it’s encouraging that at least one positive movement could result from it.

As visitors mourned the fire at Notre Dame, they remembered the cultural, architectural, and artistic impact it had on France. The Louisiana churches may have had just over 100 regular members each, but they influenced their community nonetheless.

Monica Harris, a parishioner at Greater Union Baptist Church, told the New York Times that witnessing the burned remains of the building was devastating.

“Seeing the church in the condition it is now,” Harris said, “it’s almost like losing a family member.”

Freddie Jack, president of the Seventh District Baptist Association, which includes all three churches, told the New York Times that the churches still have a long road ahead of them. “They’re a long way from full recovery,” he said, “but the generosity of the people seems to be speaking volumes.”

As French billionaires pledge to help rebuild Notre Dame, more than 35,000 people have offered donations as small as $10 to three Louisiana churches. Even thousands of miles across the ocean, it’s amazing how one tragedy can highlight another, giving each of them a little more hope.

Heisler: Lakers sticking with family, but Kobe Bryant won’t be riding to the rescue

Texto completo: Imagine that. Playoff thrills locally, after all.
It was supposed to be over by now. The Lakers left us months ago except for their managerial meltdown. The Clippers were supposed to be finished off by Golden State before anyone noticed they were in the postseason.
Instead, in yet another miracle, the Clippers staged the biggest playoff comeback in NBA history, coming from 31 down to win Game 2 in Oakland to make a series of it, after making a season of it when no one expected that.
Or, as Coach Doc Rivers told his players: “We don’t die. We multiply. We’re like roaches.”
Whatever they are, they have a promising future as well as a lot of heart, about to pursue Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard with salary cap space, with charismatic figures such as Rivers and Jerry West to lead their recruiting effort and an inspiring story to tell.
Then there are the Lakers … or there would be if they weren’t in hiding.
Since Magic Johnson dropped the big one on them – 12 days ago – no team official has appeared in public. This suggests its own message:
The Lakers’ road ahead involves massive secrecy and an inability to handle hard times?
Suggesting how overwhelmed Jeanie Buss is, she hasn’t told her people to make an appearance, or said anything herself, other than her flowery Twitter paean to Johnson (“Earvin, I loved working side by side with you. You’ve brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you.”)
Did Jeanie miss the one about someone trying to pin the blame for drafting Lonzo Ball on her?
Oh, well, kids fight in the best of families.
There has been no sign of General Manager Rob Pelinka, whom Buss is standing by after Magic reportedly tried to fire him for “back-stabbing” him.
LeBron James, the mainstay of social media, has yet to mention Magic’s departure or his own hopes going forward.
Of course, no one has glimpsed the secretive Kobe Bryant, who declined Jeanie’s offer to take over with Magic in 2017 and doesn’t look interested in doing it now.
If no one knows what’s going on, it’s likely that she has reached out to Bryant.
A source says Kobe’s importance to Jeanie explains why Pelinka, Kobe’s former agent whom Magic gored, remains in place with enhanced powers and no thought of replacing him.
Elsewhere, Pelinka is regarded with open skepticism. The New York Times’ Marc Stein called him “a polarizing figure” with “numerous reports of trust issues – not only in his dealings with other teams and former rivals in the agent world but also former Lakers players (Larry Nance Jr. and Andrew Bogut) who were jettisoned after broken promises.”
Actually, “broken promises,” or reassurances that don’t turn out to be true, are common enough for GMs.
Nevertheless, Pelinka did, indeed, have a controversy-filled career as an agent. Now in the bullseye after Magic’s accusations – if only for joking, “Where’s Earvin?” – the buzzards have come home to roost.
As for any hope that Bryant will ride to the rescue, he’s not one to agonize about decisions. If he had any interest in taking over, we would have heard about it by now.
Kobe isn’t taking questions about it but did in March, telling Slam Magazine’s Tzvi Twersky, “The answer is no, I’m not doing it.
“I’m not interested … not even (for) a couple years. I’m just not interested. I don’t want to be a GM. I don’t want to own a team. I don’t want to coach. I have no interest in any of that. That’s an easy answer for me.”
Of course, Kobe might still be in the loop, even if he has no desire to run anything day by day. As such, he’s like the man behind the curtain in “The Wizard of Oz.”
Whether Kobe’s counsel is helpful remains to be seen. Bold and intelligent as he is, he has no experience running teams and enthusiastically endorsed Magic’s half-baked idea about not needing shooters.
In a perfect irony, there is one former Lakers great who’s still in the game and would have been invaluable. Of course, that’s West, whom the Lakers – presumably, Magic – declined to hire when he was hoping to be invited back.
Jeanie is widely considered good people, but her obsession with Lakers Family … which she treasures as her birthright from the father she worshiped … keeps her from thinking clearly, or at all.
Outside her cocoon, it looks like they’ve gone as far as they can with former Lakers … the approach that backfired so badly with Magic proving temperamentally unsuited to his job … but it’s continuing.
With the Lakers’ marquee stature and the vast resources conferred by a $3 billion TV deal, they should attract top management people like Golden State GM Bob Myers, San Antonio’s R.C. Buford, Oklahoma City’s Sam Presti or Houston’s Daryl Morey.
Reaching out to them would have meant asking their teams for permission. Nothing like that happened.
The well-regarded David Griffin, a LeBron ally as Cleveland GM, was available. With no Lakers interest, he accepted a job with New Orleans days after Magic stepped down.
“Jeanie is great,” a GM said, “but she is too insulated and has made no effort to expand her knowledge base outside the Laker family. They won’t get A.D. (Anthony Davis) because they don’t have the best package.”
Ominously for whoever’s in charge, the Lakers’ scheduled return to greatness is based on acquiring Davis in a trade with New Orleans, which looks ever-more problematic.
For months, I wrote the Lakers were the favorites as A.D.’s preferred destination. Now NBA people say several Western Conference contenders, desperate at being capped by the Warriors, could make attractive offers without assurances he will re-sign in the summer of 2020.
Teams never used to run such risks, but things have changed.
Toronto did it a year ago, trading DeMar DeRozan to San Antonio for Leonard.
Presti did it two years ago, trading Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to Indiana for Paul George, who was supposedly Lakers-bound but re-signed in OKC. If that wasn’t enough, Presti might be ready to offer Steven Adams for A.D.
Houston, run by Morey, another tightrope walker, could offer Clint Capela.
Meanwhile, in Portland, Trail Blazers players are wooing A.D. openly, as if they were Lakers.
“I’m saying, ‘OK, Anthony Davis, we’ve got a winning culture. We win. We’re not jealous of each other. We have a good time,’ ” Damian Lillard told The Ringer.
“He’ll win. He’ll get to be himself and he’ll get to be on a team that fits. I think he would be perfect for us.”
By week’s end, the Warriors had reasserted themselves, leading the Clippers by 36 in Game 3 at Staples Center and winning by 27, showing what happens when you get them mad.
Still, it was magical for the Clippers, if only for the three days between Games 2 and 3.
As for the Lakers, everyone might have to scale down hopes. At present, their fans just want to make sure they haven’t left town.

David Reay, a climate scientist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, is an expert on carbon management. He also likes fresh bread.
So, when his bread machine broke, he immediately went online to look for a new one. He found that a similar machine would cost the equivalent of about $80. He also learned that he could replace the broken part for about $8.
With the help of a video that showed how to change the broken part, the job took only about 15 minutes. "It was really satisfying," he said, adding that low-cost repairs also help the climate. "The carbon footprint of buying a new replacement is avoided."
Dr. Reay, who has written extensively on sustainable living, said that, with the rise of online shopping and faster shipping, it has become extremely easy for people to replace, rather than fix, things that break.
"It's so tempting," he said, noting a 2015 report from Germany that found the replacement rate of large household appliances in the country had nearly doubled between 2004 and 2013. While this may have been partly a function of changing construction quality, Dr. Reay said people generally "don't even think of the consequences" of throwing away fixable appliances and gadgets.
Another report, from the consulting firm Deloitte in 2016, wrote that emissions from Europe's electrical and electronic equipment sector "could be divided by two if minimal efforts were made" to increase reuse. That would amount to tens of millions of tons less greenhouse gas emissions annually.
Dr. Reay said the drop would be even greater if other products, like clothing, were included. "The fashion industry has a significant environmental impact," he said, "and it tends to be quite throwaway."
Whether clothes or electronics, Dr. Reay suggests checking to see if something can be repaired before you replace it (being sure, of course, to turn to a professional when you're not sure of what you're doing).
Dr. Reay found his instructional video on YouTube. Another online repair resource is IFixit, which offers how-to guides and repair discussion forums. In Europe, repair parties and cafes are starting to spring up as well.
There's also a movement to support "right to repair" laws that would require companies to make their products easier to fix. Nearly two dozen states are now considering such legislation.
"You have this win-win," Dr. Reay said. "You save money and it really does reduce environmental impact."

Thinking about moving? Duluth might be the place.
By Kendra Pierre-Louis
It seems inevitable that the rising seas and wildfires linked to climate change will eventually cause large numbers of Americans to move. But where those climate migrants will go, and how they'll get there, is still something of a mystery.
So, when Jesse Keenan, a researcher at Harvard University, mentioned that there were places, like Duluth, Minn., that would suffer less than others in a warming world, it immediately piqued my interest. So did the fact that some community and business leaders in Duluth are wondering if the region's geographic blessings could help with economic development by attracting people who decide to leave vulnerable areas even before climate disasters strike.
Often when people move after disaster, they aren't welcomed. There was real tension in Houston, for example, when 250,000 newcomers arrived in the city after Hurricane Katrina. And while 25,000 to 40,000 people displaced from New Orleans ultimately stayed in Houston, Hurricane Harvey displaced some of them again. So it's interesting to think about communities deliberately trying to attract newcomers and keep them.
Still, I wasn't wholly enthused at the prospect of heading to much colder Duluth as New York City was finally starting to see the first tendrils of spring. But, the trip was worth it. The city is thinking seriously about climate change, as a tour of a local power plant (which did not make the story) made clear. Officials had made huge upgrades to the energy system, shifting to hot water from steam, which is less efficient, and switching fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Of course, Duluth isn't immune from the effects of climate change, like more frequent and more severe winter storms and flooding. Nowhere is. This story is asking questions about how we're going to adapt.

Texto completo: Stanford University has exonerated its researchers of any wrongdoing in their communications with a Chinese biophysicist who brazenly violated a scientific taboo using a gene-editing technique to alter the DNA of human embryos.
In a statement released late Tuesday, the university said that its review concluded that the school's high-profile faculty were not participants in the CRISPR-Cas9 work by He Jiankui, a former Stanford postdoctoral researcher, and that they had no research, financial or organizational ties to He's research.
The review, conducted by a Stanford faculty member and an outside investigator, found that the Stanford researchers expressed serious concerns to He about his work. But Stanford did not address concerns that its faculty members biophysicist Stephen Quake, physician and medical ethicist William Hurlbut and hematologist and gene-editing specialist Matthew Porteus failed to publicize what they knew about He's work.
"When Dr. He did not heed their recommendations and proceeded, Stanford researchers urged him to follow proper scientific practices," according to the statement.
Although this review is over, there remains debate about what scientists should do when confronted with ethically troubling research.
He Jiankui conducted his postdoctoral research at Stanford in 2011-12 under Quake, one of the university's top bioengineers. In 2017 and 2018, He consulted with Quake, Hurlbut and Porteus about his gene-editing research and they all said they discouraged He from pursuing the research.
Critics say the American scientists should have alerted the public that the Chinese research into embryonic gene editing was underway.
"I am convinced that this silence is a symptom of a broader scientific cultural crisis: a growing divide between the values upheld by the scientific community and the mission of science itself," wrote molecular biologist Natalie Kofler of the Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics in the journal Nature.
The president of He's Chinese university has blamed Quake for the rogue experiment, alleging in a letter to Stanford president Marc Tessier-Lavigne that Quake provided instructions to the preparation and implementation of the experiment, the publication of papers, the promotion and news release, and publicity strategies after the news was announced.
While Quake would not discuss his involvement with He's research when asked by this newspaper in November, he told The New York Times in an April 14 article that his interactions had been misinterpreted.
Email correspondence between Quake and He provided to the Times shows no evidence that the Stanford researcher was involved in the work himself but also that he did not tell his Chinese protégé to stop. He informed Quake of milestones, according to the Times article, including that the woman became pregnant and gave birth. The emails show that Quake advised He to obtain ethical approval from Chinese institutions and submit the results for vetting by peer-reviewed journals. They do contain expressions of Quake's polite support, like "good luck!" and "Wow, that's quite an achievement!"
The Chinese researcher forged ethical review documents and engaged in actions that "seriously violated ethics, scientific research integrity and relevant state regulations," according to a preliminary report released in January by the Chinese government.
Meanwhile, there is still no proof that He, a biophysicist, was successful in changing the genes of twin girls or those of a third child expected to be born later this year.
When He was working in Stanford at Quake's lab, his research did not involve CRISPR gene editing. He was part of a team that studied how the genetic sequence of antibodies, produced by the immune system's B cells, changes over time. The team's findings, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, revealed that elderly and young people have different mutations, which could influence the effectiveness of flu vaccines.
In 2017, the Chinese scientist returned to the U.S. to attend a UC Berkeley workshop about gene editing technology, where he met Stanford's Hurlbut and UC Berkeley's CRISPR pioneer Jennifer Doudna.
Hurlbut said he carried on a long conversation with He about societal opposition during the Chinese scientist's later visits to Stanford.
In conversations about ethics, "he wanted to get some sense of guidance. He wanted to understand what that was about," said Hurlbut, who disagrees with what He did. The Chinese scientist seemed skeptical of arguments that life begins at conception and cited the good that could come through gene editing, according to Hurlbut.
Porteus, a pioneer in the effort to use CRISPR to find curative therapies for blood diseases, reportedly tried to dissuade He, telling him such a step was reckless and put the entire field at risk.
Other major American scientists communicated with He. He confided in his plans with Mark DeWitt, a researcher with UC Berkeley's Innovative Genomics Initiative, but assured him that an ethics committee had approved the study and subjects were already being enrolled in China, according to STAT News. In a draft article about the gene-edited twin girls, which He planned to submit to journals, he thanked DeWitt for "editing the manuscript."
Michael Deem, a prominent physics and bioengineering professor at Rice University, faces a less certain future. In November, the university said that it had opened a "full investigation" into Deem's involvement.
The CRISPR baby scandal has highlighted the shortcomings of existing guidelines. International medical leaders are planning a commission to guide genome editing, and there are calls for an international moratorium on related research.
"I don't think they did anything wrong but I do wish each had done something more  (and) that science had established a framework to encourage them to do so," Stanford law professor and bioethicist Hank Greely tweeted in response to the university statement.
"Many scientists (& other people) have moral frameworks but don't see good ways to embody them," he wrote. "Let's give them some, rather than kvetch about their failures to be saints."
But "in this whole fiasco," added Greely, "at least 99.9% of the blame' was earned by He Jiankui."

Texto completo: Seeing the iconic church on fire was stunning. After firefighters extinguished the inferno, the heartbreaking scenes of the charred church, which had been a beloved home for generations of her family, were almost too much for Monica Harris.
"Seeing the church in the condition it is now," the 57-year-old Christian said for a story in The New York Times, "it’s almost like losing a family member."
That loss, and the beauty destroyed by that blaze, hadn’t even had time to register before a man of the cloth added some perspective.
"They burned down a building. They didn’t burn down our spirit," he said.
The gofundme rebuilding fund for three overwhelmingly black churches burned in Louisiana in the past month had topped out under $100,000 until Monday’s fire at the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris reignited the cause. None of those structures was on par with the world-famous, centuries-old, magnificent cathedral of Notre Dame, but black churches matter. As of Wednesday, online donations for the three black churches were nearing the $1.8 million goal. Donations for Notre Dame are expected to top $1 billion.
"As we hold Paris in our thoughts today, let’s also send some love to our neighbors in Louisiana," Hillary Clinton tweeted Tuesday. Journalist Yashar Ali and CNN anchor Jake Tapper posted similar tweets asking people to remember those black churches, too.
As the world watched the flames consuming the iconic spire of the cathedral of Notre Dame, people used words such as heartbreaking and tragic to describe the damage to the centuries-old architectural wonder, which is a monument to Christianity. But one of the first online comments I read came from a suburban Catholic priest, who noted, "This is really, tragically sad. But God is NOT confined to even beautiful and ancient structures." He went on to explain how asylum-seekers and other people suffering hardships deserve that same outpouring of empathy and assistance.
Easter celebrates the belief that Jesus Christ was crucified and rose from the dead, the keystone of the Christian faith. But it also offers a more universal message that bad things can get better. Easter signals hope and a new start.
On the same day Notre Dame was burning, every Major League Baseball player, coach and umpire wore a No. 42 jersey to honor Jackie Robinson, the first black player allowed to play in the majors. It is heartbreaking and tragically sad that there was a time when black players were banned from the National Pastime, but in honoring Robinson, we celebrate how the world can change for the better.
At the same time, we can continue to find it heartbreaking and tragically sad that MLB now is investigating racist messages sent to Carl Edwards Jr., a relief pitcher for the Chicago Cubs who got off to a bad start this season and happens to be black.
Clearly, today’s world gives us plenty of opportunities to right wrongs and make bad things better. Louisiana officials on Monday charged a 21-year-old white man with arson and hate crimes in connection with the fires set at the Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, Louisiana, as well as the St. Mary Baptist Church in nearby Port Barre.
Every cowardly and hateful act can inspire a commitment to decency and good in others. Not only can we take some comfort in the fact nobody died in any of these tragic church fires, we can also find something good in the response of ordinary people.

Texto completo: White House was briefed on contents
Details of obstruction probe, Trump's actions expected The Justice Department plans to release a lightly redacted version of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's 400-page report Thursday, offering a granular look at the ways in which President Trump was suspected of having obstructed justice, people familiar with the matter said.
The report - the general outlines of which the Justice Department has briefed the White House on - will reveal that Mueller decided he could not come to a conclusion on the question of obstruction because it was difficult to determine Trump's intent and because some of his actions could be interpreted innocently, these people said. But it will offer a detailed blow-by-blow of the president's alleged conduct - analyzing tweets, private threats and other episodes at the center of Mueller's inquiry, they added.
Attorney General William P. Barr plans to hold a 9:30 a.m. news conference to address "process questions" and provide an "overview of the report," a senior Justice Department official said. The report will be delivered on discs to Capitol Hill between 11 a.m. and noon and posted on the special counsel's website thereafter, the official said.
Those who spoke to The Washington Post for this report did so on the condition of anonymity, citing the matter's supreme sensitivity.
Thursday's rollout plan - and news of the White House's advance briefing, which was first reported by ABC News and the New York Times - sparked a political firestorm Wednesday, with Democrats suggesting the attorney general was trying to improperly color Mueller's findings before the public could read them.
Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said at a news conference that Barr "appears to be waging a media campaign on behalf of President Trump" and had "taken unprecedented steps to spin Mueller's nearly two-year investigation." He said after his committee had time to review the redacted report, he would ask Mueller and other members of his team to testify before Congress.
While the report's light redactions might allay some of their concerns, Democrats are likely to bristle at any material that is withheld. What the Justice Department and Trump's lawyers might view as modest, lawmakers might see as overly aggressive. The redacted version of the report is expected to reveal extensive details about Trump's actions in office that came under scrutiny, but it is unclear how much the public will learn about how the special counsel's team investigated the Kremlin's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election and Russian contacts with Trump associates.
Barr also is likely to face scrutiny over the Justice Department's talks with the White House - which could help Trump and his attorneys hone in advance their attacks on the report.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's lawyers, has said he is preparing a counter-report to Mueller's findings and in a recent interview said his document would explain from the president's viewpoint every episode that could be considered obstructive. Giuliani and others have long feared Mueller's findings on obstruction, viewing them as potentially more damaging than anything found on the Trump campaign's contacts with Russians.
Mueller did not find a conspiracy between Russians and Trump or his campaign, Barr said in a brief letter describing the special counsel's conclusions shared with Congress late last month.
Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's attorneys, told The Post, "We do not discuss conversations that we may or may not have had with the president." A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to address questions about its briefings to the White House, the report's redactions or Mueller's findings on obstruction.
Trump had also apparently been briefed in advance of the planned news conference, which he revealed Wednesday during a radio appearance only to have it confirmed later by a Justice Department spokeswoman. Barr will appear alongside Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, the spokeswoman said, and he planned to take questions.
Barr has faced intense scrutiny from the public and lawmakers on Capitol Hill for his handling of Mueller's report. The news conference could give him an opportunity to address his critics - and perhaps provide them fresh ammunition. It is sure to be watched closely by Trump, an avid TV viewer whose relationship with his attorney general will almost certainly be colored by Mueller's findings and what Barr says about them.
Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the White House did not ask the Justice Department to hold the news conference, but she declined to discuss White House and Justice Department interactions about the report.
Trump told "The Larry O'Connor Show" on WMAL that he was considering holding his own news conference.
"You'll see a lot of very strong things come out tomorrow. Attorney General Barr is going to be giving a news conference. Maybe I'll do one after that; we'll see," Trump said.
A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment but said Mueller will not be at Barr's news conference.
Already, Democratic lawmakers and pundits have alleged that Barr seems to be taking steps to mitigate the political damage Mueller's report might do to Trump, and some members of Mueller's team have told associates they are frustrated by the limited information Barr has released about their work.
A senior White House official said Trump has praised Barr privately for his handling of the report and compared him favorably to former attorney general Jeff Sessions, whom Trump grew to loathe over his recusal from what would become Mueller's investigation.
Since the special counsel's office closed its investigation late last month, Barr and his team at the Justice Department have been reviewing the final report to determine how much of it can be made public. The Justice Department has said it plans to release the document with four categories of information shielded from public view: material from the grand jury, material that reveals intelligence sources and methods, material that is relevant to ongoing investigations, and material that could affect the privacy of "peripheral" third parties. Each redaction will be color-coded so readers know the reason the material is being shielded, Barr has said.
Democrats have said they won't be satisfied unless they are given the entire unfiltered document. House Democrats probably will attempt to subpoena it, sparking a legal battle that could last for months or even years.
Barr has so far disclosed only what the Justice Department terms Mueller's "principal conclusions." In a four-page letter to lawmakers, he declared last month that Mueller did not find that anyone on Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, and that the special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump had sought to obstruct justice. Barr wrote that he and Rosenstein then reviewed the evidence and did not find it sufficient to make an obstruction case.
White House officials are concerned about damaging testimony from a number of senior aides, particularly former counsel Donald McGahn and former chief of staff Reince Priebus, according to current and former officials. Their testimony, according to people with knowledge of it, gave a clear, detailed breakdown of some of the administration's most controversial incidents, from the firing of James B. Comey as FBI director to attempts to oust Sessions. McGahn spoke with the special counsel for dozens of hours, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The Justice Department generally avoids holding news conferences - or offering any specific information - about cases it closes without charges. Comey, then the FBI director, was criticized in 2016 for bucking that principle and declaring at a televised news conference that he was recommending no charges following the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. He took no questions.
At his confirmation hearing in January, Barr publicly distanced himself from Comey's approach.
"If you're not going to indict someone, you don't stand up there and unload negative information about the person," Barr said. "That's not the way the department does business."
Barr is expected to testify before the House and Senate Judiciary committees in early May, and he has said he is willing to discuss with lawmakers providing more information if they are left unsatisfied by Thursday's release.
The Justice Department also revealed in a court filing Thursday in the criminal case against longtime Trump friend Roger Stone that it plans to let a "limited number" of lawmakers and their staff review Mueller's report "without certain redactions, including removing the redaction of information related to the charges set forth in the indictment in this case."

Texto completo: PLAYA VISTA — You’ve just set an NBA record for biggest postseason comeback in NBA history – what are you going to do next?
Settle in for a critical film session, naturally.
“We came back and what we did was historic, but the reality tells a whole different story,” said Coach Doc Rivers, whose team’s epic comeback evened their first-round Western Conference playoff series with the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors at 1-1. Game 3 is Thursday night at Staples Center.
“The reality is that we were down 31, and the reality is we’re not going to win a lot of games against anybody doing that. The reality is they’re shooting over 50 percent and there’s a lot of realities in this series that don’t bode well unless we do something about it.”
The reality, Rivers stressed before (and likely at) Wednesday’s practice: “We have to play better. We understand we won the game, but we’re not going to win the game playing that way. I think we fully understand that. If not, we’re about to when we watch film.”
Yes, the Clippers outscored Golden State 72-37 – the best offensive 19 minutes of not just the season, but “of their lives,” Rivers said – down the stretch to win Game 2. But prior to the 7:31 mark of the third quarter on Monday, they were being outscored 215-167 in the series.
“I mean, 131 points (total),” said Clippers guard Patrick Beverley, whose job it has been to harass Kevin Durant. “Ain’t nobody really playing no defense, but we were fortunate to get stops when they mattered, to get loose balls when they mattered.”
They had squandered opportunities in Game 1 – which was encouraging, insisted the Clippers, who were pleased to have had chances. And it was true: Before the turnaround began in the third quarter, the Clippers had forced 28 turnovers. The problem was that they’d turned them into only 23 points. (Conversely, they’d coughed it up 27 times themselves, miscues the Warriors converted to 34 points).
Except for the production of Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell off the bench, the Clippers hadn’t been nearly aggressive enough for Rivers’ liking – especially because against the Warriors, offense might be the best defense.
“We’ve just got to be more in sync offensively,” Clippers guard Landry Shamet said Wednesday. “I know they scored 70 points in the first half, but offensively, I think that made a big difference (in the comeback). We were more in sync, making plays for each other, on the same page. Our flow was a whole lot better in the second half.”
In the final 24 minutes, the Clippers’ offensive assertiveness and togetherness was rewarded: They went 17 for 19 from the free-throw line (to which they made seven more trips than in the opening half), and they shot 30 for 45 from the field, including 8 for 14 from 3-point range.
And as the Clippers – the biggest first-round underdogs in 30 years, at 100-1 – rallied from a statistical 0.1 percent probability of winning with 8:30 on the clock Monday, the nation took notice, either that night as it happened or waking up to the stunning result the next morning.
USA Today proclaimed the Clippers “the best thing to happen to the NBA playoffs,” the New York Times profiled Lou Williams (whose 36 points and 11 assists in the game were more than any other reserve in a postseason game since 1985), and ESPN invited Landry Shamet to share his reliable insight on “The Jump.”
“It’s been good,” Shamet said Wednesday of the attention, but he quickly added, “at the end of the day we’re 1-1 right now. By no means are we satisfied or feel like we’ve accomplished anything in its entirety, at least.
“It’s a good feat to come from behind and tie the series, but me personally, I’m trying to move past all that because we know we probably just (irritated) a sleeping bear. They’re going to be ready to go tomorrow.”
“I don’t care,” about the bear, Rivers said. “Because we have to have an extra something.”
And then, with his players taking their seats on folding chairs in a semi-circle around a television monitor, Rivers went to show them how.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Some time after martial law was imposed in Poland in December 1981, John Darnton folded a draft of an article he had just written inside an empty box of Marlboro cigarettes.
Mr. Darnton served as The Times's Warsaw bureau chief from 1979 to 1981; it was a precarious time for Poles, as a Soviet-backed regime tried to tighten its grip on the nation.
The unyielding Times reporter -- who had been expelled from Nigeria by anti-democratic forces just two years earlier -- was determined to stay in his post this time, and to tell the world about the oppression that was unfolding in the Soviet-bloc nation.
He handed the cigarette box off to a lay traveler who had agreed to carry it back to the United States.
But the carrier grew increasingly anxious of arrest by customs officials: "I don't smoke. What if they ask me for a cigarette?"
Mr. Darnton answered plainly: "They won't."
The article was published in The Times just days later.
For his reporting from Poland -- nine investigative articles -- Mr. Darnton received the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting. (On Monday, The Times received Pulitzer Prizes for editorial writing and explanatory reporting, bringing the publication's total number of Pulitzers to 127.)
At a 2002 reunion in Warsaw for Western journalists who covered Communist Poland, the country's foremost dissident of that era, Adam Michnik, introduced Mr. Darnton as "the man who brought down Communism."
"It was an exaggeration, of course," Mr. Darnton said in a telephone interview this month, "but one that captured a sense of gratitude to the Western press for giving Poles a voice."
Unwavering commitment to the journalistic cause, even against a dangerous backdrop, was in Mr. Darnton's DNA. He was just 11 months old when his father Byron (Barney) Darnton, a war correspondent for The New York Times, was killed while reporting in what is now Papua New Guinea in October 1942.
Following in his father's footsteps, Mr. Darnton started his career as a copy boy, running a mimeograph machine for the New York Times news syndicate in 1966. He also had stints on the photo and metro desks, and as a foreign correspondent, before arriving in Warsaw in 1979.
The imposition of martial law in Poland, a country already ravaged by the Nazi invasion in 1939, created a host of challenges for everyday Poles. For journalists trying to tell the stories of the Solidarity movement -- a free trade union that transformed into a mass movement for liberalization in Poland -- the stakes were high and extremely risky.
Mr. Darnton and other Western journalists found ingenious ways to circumvent government censorship and work within the limits of martial law to file articles back home.
His first method was simple: Approach strangers. "If you consider that I wrote about a dozen stories and had three copies of each," Mr. Darnton said, "that is 36 times that I approached people in the country and asked them to carry the copy for me and none, that I recall, declined."
Mr. Darnton did not ask the travelers to deliver the copy by hand. Instead, he scribbled the phone number of The New York Times's foreign desk on the top of each article and asked his carriers to call The Times as soon as they arrived in a Western country. These aides then proceeded to dictate the story, start to finish, including punctuation, to a Times employee on the other end of the phone.
Mr. Darnton does not know which copy of each article made it back to Times headquarters. He was not in touch with anyone outside of Poland for weeks at a time.
The reporter developed a code system with the foreign desk in New York that let him know when each story had been received. He made up a name for each article -- Alice or Betsy, for example -- and he wrote it at the head of each copy. The foreign desk would send him a telegram later, using that name as proof that the story had reached 43rd Street. "John, I hope all is well. Betsy sends her greetings," Mr. Darnton paraphrased the telegrams that he received back in Warsaw. "That way I'd know that my second story, Betsy, arrived and was published," he said.
Once, Mr. Darnton approached a man -- "kind of a hippie, with large cowboy boots" -- in a hotel lobby. "He agreed and stuffed my story, equal pages in both boots, so he wouldn't hobble," he said. That article, too, made it back to Mr. Darnton's editors.
Surprisingly, Mr. Darnton never felt scared; he found that the "cat-and-mouse game of getting around censors" gave him a frisson of thrill.
Mr. Darnton -- who frequently had his car tires slashed by secret police officials on his trail -- recalls his most "dramatic" encounter as having taken place on a grim and snowy winter night. He was set to interview a member of the Solidarity movement, the highest-ranking official not yet in custody, who had evaded arrest by moving to different hide-outs.
"He was kind of like the Scarlet Pimpernel," Mr. Darnton said, referring to the secret life of the protagonist in the novel of the same name, set during the French Revolution.
Mr. Darnton was blindfolded and led to a secret location. But then the interview was abruptly called off: His contacts feared they had been followed. Instead, they allowed Mr. Darnton to submit written questions that would be forwarded to the Polish dissident. So he waited, alone, in a dank apartment building on the wrong side of curfew.
Then the door creaked open. "A woman in a fur coat dusted with snow came inside," he said. "She reached down and pulled the answers from this Solidarity activist and gave them to me with a little smile. And then she disappeared."
For Mr. Darnton, 77, who serves as the curator of the George Polk Awards and is writing his sixth novel, the Warsaw assignment was among his most fascinating. "It was a laboratory for human behavior: how people reacted when suddenly circumstances changed radically and the rug was pulled out from underneath them," he said.
He remains cleareyed about the impact of his reporting and what it has meant with the hindsight of history. The news reports "made the Kremlin think twice about invading, and, when fed back into Poland by radio broadcasts, encouraged the Poles in their quest for freedom," he said.
Solidarity members "realized through the news reports that the whole world was watching," he said. "They were making history. And so they discarded their fear."

Texto completo: Aunque durante el juicio a Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera se dieron a conocer cientos de documentos de testimonios de testigos y cooperantes, fiscales federales y defensores del mexicano decidieron sellar miles más, debido a que contienen información que podría ser perjudicial para el caso, a favor o en contra.
En octubre de 2018, a pocas semanas de que iniciara el proceso en la Corte Federal de Brooklyn, los fiscales del Distrito Este de Nueva York y el equipo legal de Guzmán Loera acordaron revelar versiones públicas de esos testimonios, a petición de los abogados del New York Times y de VICE News.
Uno de los primeros documentos que se reveló integra las declaraciones de Alex Cifuentes , exsocio de Guzmán Loera, sobre la contratación de menores de hasta 13 años por las que, supuestamente, el líder del Cártel de Sinaloa pagaba para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas.
Semanas después se dio a conocer otra parte de esos documentos, donde los fiscales federales y la defensa indicaron que algunos dichos de ese cooperante podrían afectar el proceso –de uno y otro lado– en caso de que se dieran a conocer. Aquellos documentos incluyen las creencias esotéricas de Cifuentes y más detalles de sus gustos sexuales.
Los documentos debieron ser publicados entre enero 22 y marzo 20, pero no ha ocurrido así, por lo que fiscales federales y defensores de Guzmán Loera pidieron al juez Brian Cogan una extensión, la cual fue concedida hasta el 3 de mayo.
“La extensión permitirá a las partes dedicar recrusos apropiados y exclusivamente a los esfuerzos de revisar los archivos previamente sellados” , indica una carta enviada al juez Cogan, quien aceptó la moción.
Se espera que los documentos contengan información sobre el comportamiento privado y público de Guzmán Loera y sus socios, datos que no fueron utilizados en el juicio.
Another deadline to unseal documents from the El Chapo trial passed this weekend with nothing released to the public.
Today, the government and defense filed a joint motion asking for a "modest extension" until May 3, which Judge Cogan has granted.https://t.co/65JPCnU7Uj pic.twitter.com/aSNNwzPYE5

Series on model bills illustrates what legislators do to serve us

Texto completo: The series in The Republic on the "model bill" group is very interesting. It's a good indication of how many bills are written and submitted into the state legislative process.
It's hard to tell whether it is meant to educate the voters or alarm them to the influence of these "model" bill factories. As I see it, this is a good way for legislators to exchange thoughts with like-minded lawmakers from other states and produce legislation that reflects their vision for their states and the country.
At any rate it should encourage voters to get to know their legislators and get involved with their legislative districts.
You quote Debbie Lesko and the weight she gave to constituents as well as businesses in her district. I know of no legislator who better served her constituents than Lesko. And she was always open about her association with ALEC or any organization that would help her serve her district.

Arizona can even playing field by supporting federal term limits Members of the Arizona State Legislature can do their part to vanquish big money in politics and create a level playing field for all who want a say in government.
As a bonus, they will ultimately elect more women to Congress.
All they need to do is go along with a proposal former Democratic President Barack Obama endorsed before he left office. That idea — impose term limits on members of Congress through an Article V convention.
But the time for Arizona legislators to vote in favor of a resolution to that effect is running out.
Right now the state senate has a bill that would allow Arizona to have a say in this matter, SCR1014 awaits a vote.
The outcome is uncertain.
According to a 2015 New York Times/CBS Poll, 84 percent of Americans believe money has too much influence in political campaigns. Fundraising is most unequal when an incumbent defends his seat. Any reform that fights incumbency can make the money situation more equal.
Term limits is that reform.
Like any smart investor, special interests spend on candidates who provide them with the best possible return. That's why sitting

Letter writer gets it wrong about religious belief in marketplace It really wasn't necessary for Mr. Austin, a letter writer, to state he was not a Christian. His misuse of Bible passages made that glaringly obvious. His claim about the admonition to "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's" had nothing to do with keeping religion out of the marketplace. It had to do with obeying the law to pay taxes.
Mr. Austin's next misuse is Jesus chasing the money lenders out of the temple. Again, it had nothing to do with mixing politics and religion. It had to do with desecrating a place of honor to God.
If he believes you should keep religion out of the marketplace, then he should oppose those who want to punish business people who follow their religious beliefs outside of the marketplace.
Chick-fil-A does not discriminate against anyone in serving or hiring. People and government entities that attempt to drive Chick-fil-A from the marketplace because of personal religious beliefs, should be the target of his outrage.

Actually, it would be great to have all veterans on Medicare system While one letter writer was correct to criticize the failed VA, he is comparing it to a very different system. Medicare does not run hospitals or clinics or hire doctors as does the VA.
Medicare let's you go to any medical provider you choose (if they accept Medicare, which almost all do). Medicare simply sets the prices they will pay and then issues payment to the provider for 80 percent of charges.
The claims are actually processed by private entities. I took a retirement job, working for United Healthcare, processing those claims so I know. The Medicare system is efficient and works for millions of seniors.
Why can't all citizens, including vets, be on such a system?
It actually works.

Texto completo: It's Tax Day: Need an extension? And how to celebrate when done
It's Tax Day. If you haven't filed yet and are feeling pressed for time, you may want to consider getting an extension. (The IRS doesn't care what your reason is. ) Otherwise, you may get hit with a late-filing and/or late-payment fee. Here's how to pay your taxes – and what to do if you don't have the money right now. For those who are done and also got money back, here are the 50 best things to buy with your refund. And don't forget, businesses nationwide mark tax day with freebies and deals. This year's tax relief includes free treats, discounted meals and free paper shredding along with a way to eliminate the stress of filing at the last minute — free massages.
Can you trademark what sounds like a curse word?
The founder of a clothing line with the name FUCT says it's pronounced as four letters, one after another. As in "F-U-C-T. " The Justice Department, seeking to block its request for trademark protection, equates it "to the vulgar word for which it is a homonym. " The two sides will debate the clothing line's rhyme or reason at the Supreme Court Monday as the justices return for two weeks of oral arguments, their last of the 2018 term. In 2017, they ruled unanimously that trademarks considered to be disparaging nonetheless deserve First Amendment protection.
The Boston Marathon (and maybe some storms)
Gusty thunderstorms and downpours may pass through Boston just before the Boston Marathon begins Monday morning, according to Kristina Pydynowski, AccuWeather senior meteorologist. Winds will spread across the mid-Atlantic on Monday, reaching southern and central New England by nighttime, Accuweather said. Some 30,000 runners will take part in the marathon's 123rd edition, including Sara Hall. The 36-year-old Arizona mother adopted four sisters from Ethiopia and hopes to reinforce her Olympic contender status.
Bernie Sanders drops his tax returns
Vermont's Sen. Bernie Sanders said he will release 10 years worth of tax returns Monday. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate has has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump's failure to release his returns, but Sanders' delay in releasing his own has left him vulnerable to accusations of being a hypocrite. "I hope that Donald Trump will do exactly the same. We are going to release 10 years of our tax returns, and we hope that on that day Donald Trump will do the same," Sanders told the New York Times.
Mourners pay respects to SC’s Ernest ‘Fritz’ Hollings
Family, friends and former colleagues paid their respects at a visitation Sunday for Ernest F. “Fritz” Hollings, who helped shepherd South Carolina through desegregation as governor and went on to six terms in the U. S. Senate. Hollings died April 6 at his home on Isle of Palms. He was 97. Two more days of mourning are planned for Hollings, one of the last of the larger-than-life Democrats who dominated politics in the South. His body will lie in repose Monday at the Statehouse in Columbia. A funeral is Tuesday at The Citadel, where former Vice President Joe Biden and current Gov. Henry McMaster are scheduled to be among the speakers.

Texto completo: SOUTH BEND — Pete Buttigieg officially entered the crowded 2020 presidential race Sunday, marking the young Midwestern mayor's rise from political obscurity to a notable name in the Democratic field seeking to replace Donald Trump in the White House.
"My name is Pete Buttigieg. They call me Mayor Pete. I'm a proud son of South Bend, Indiana, and I am running for president of the United States," Buttigieg announced to a roaring crowd of about 4,520. Another 1,500 were watching outside, according to his campaign.
Already Buttigieg has made history, as the first openly gay Democratic presidential candidate in history.
His announcement capped a week of heightened media attention — driven in part by his criticisms of a fellow Hoosier, Vice President Mike Pence.
And in an unintentional nod to his ties to Pence, Buttigieg made his announcement at the Studebaker Building 84 — a former South Bend auto plant undergoing renovations because of a partnership between Pence and Buttigieg.
But he didn't mention Pence, or even Trump, in his speech.
Instead he stayed positive, telling Democrats to take back words such as "freedom" and "security." And, hinting at Trump's popular slogan, he argued that Americans shouldn't be looking to do something "again."
"It is time to walk away from the politics of the past and toward something totally different," Buttigieg said.
It was 35 degrees and raining in South Bend as supporters lined up Sunday to hear Buttigeig speak. Inside, some attendees wore hoods as water dripped down from the ceiling of the old building.
But spirits were high as mayor after mayor introduced Buttigieg, who if elected, would also be the first person to jump from mayor to the White House.
Their point: Mayors get things done.
Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley pointed to the very building audience members stood in as an example of Buttigieg's success. Buttigieg didn't promise he would refill Studebaker with long-gone factory jobs, she said.
"Instead, he saw this piece of South Bend history as a symbol of its innovative future," Whaley said.
The Indiana GOP responded on Twitter to Buttigieg's announcement minutes after his announcement.
"Finally, after over two years of bashing @realDonaldTrump, personally attacking Vice President @mike_pence, and neglecting his duties in South Bend, @PeteButtigieg announced what we all knew he was up to the whole time," the party said.
Buttigieg's rise as a candidate The once little-known political figure has seen his popularity rise steadily since forming an exploratory committee in January. He's released a New York Times-best-selling political memoir and took part in a well-received CNN town hall early last month, events that paid dividends in fundraising and name recognition.
In the past week, polls from both New Hampshire and Iowa — early-voting states for the Democratic nomination — showed Buttigieg in third among the party's voters, behind Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden.
Similarly relevant in his ascendance is his biography. The 37-year-old Indiana native is a two-term mayor of a blue-collar city, a Rhodes scholar who graduated from Harvard and Oxford and a veteran of the U.S. Navy Reserve who took an unpaid leave from the mayor's office to serve in Afghanistan.
Earlier this month, Buttigieg announced he raised $7 million in the first three months of 2019, more than well-known candidates such as Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker. In doing so, Buttigieg said, he crossed the donor threshold to be invited to Democratic debates set to start in June.
Brenda Emgee, of Newburgh, came to see Buttigieg speak with her daughter. She called him their "Midwest boy."
"He's fresh, he's new," she said. "I don't know whether I can say this or not, but he hasn't had time to be corrupted."
Buttigieg's complex relationship with Pence The public attention that helped yield that haul, however, has also brought him more criticism for his comments on Pence, particularly in the past week, and led to a high-profile back-and-forth between the two Hoosiers and their supporters on homosexuality and religion.
Buttigieg criticized Pence last weekend at a LGBTQ Victory Fund event for his opposition to same-sex marriage.
"That's the thing that I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand," said Buttigieg, who often references his own religious beliefs. "That if you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my Creator."
Since then, Pence has defended himself and attacked Buttigieg for making comments "critical of my Christian faith."
"He knows better," Pence said in a CNBC interview that aired Thursday. "He knows me."
Buttigieg has been outspoken about his religious beliefs and how loving his husband has brought him closer to God. It was fitting that Buttigieg started his Palm Sunday announcement with a prayer from a local reverend.
Austin Texas Mayor Steve Adler, who introduced Buttigieg despite hailing from the same state as candidate Beto O'Rourke, likewise referenced Buttigieg's beliefs.
"Wouldn't it be great to have a president who holds his faith in his heart and knows the importance it plays in his life, but does not use it as a cynical tool to achieve power?" Adler said.
Daniel Roldan, a 36-year-old from Chicago, said he likes that Buttigieg expresses his religiosity, because he views himself as a progressive Christian.
"It's refreshing," he said. "For so long, I feel like Democrats and progressives were afraid to talk about religion, but if you look at the teachings of Jesus as I know them and as Pete has expressed them, it is helping the disadvantaged, helping women, helping people of color, helping LGBTQ people, immigrants and all of those groups."
But the success of the renovations on the onetime eyesore where Buttigieg announced his candidacy Sunday — Studebaker Building 84 — illustrates the complex relationship between Buttigieg and Pence.
The improvements were only made possible by $3.5 million from an economic development program Pence championed in 2015 as governor — even pushing back on his own party.
In his book "Shortest Way Home," Buttigieg took issue with Pence's social policies but praised many of Pence's economic policies and called him "affable, even gentle."
And when Pence announced his attentions to pass the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which drew criticism from local and business leaders across the state who feared it would allow for discrimination, Buttigieg didn't immediately confront him.
'An act of hope' Buttigieg's speech centered around his hope for the future, saying "running for office is an act of hope."
He didn't delve deep into politics, but he referenced words his "conservative friends" often use.
"Security," he said, includes keeping Americans safe "in the face of violent white nationalism," and "climate security, a life-and-death issue for our generation."
Meanwhile, "freedom," he said, doesn't only belong to conservatives. Americans aren't free if they can't marry who they want, can't make their own reproductive choices or can't unionize.
And it's not much of a democracy, he said, if the Electoral College chooses the president instead of the majority of the voters.
He also emphasized that he wants every American to be able to have access to health care, though he didn't specify how that would look.
Jacquie Bontrager-McCann, of Columbus, Indiana, said she appreciates Buttigieg's message of bringing people together.
"It feels like his approach to policy takes into consideration what is needed rather than what people feel they want, because it's not feasible to start with the whole pie," she said.

Are Julian Assange and WikiLeaks essential or criminal? After all, hacking is theft.

Texto completo: As an investigative reporter, I strongly believe in the importance of transparency in government, accountability of public agencies and full disclosure of acts taken in the name of the American people. I believe secrets to protect national security, though necessary, should be rare and reviewed often to prevent cover-ups and corruption. To me, whistleblowing at the risk of one's job or going to jail, to expose undisclosed waste, fraud or abuse, promote social justice and/or protect the public interest, is an act of heroism.
Hacking is a method, not a philosophy. Hackers deconstruct bureaucracies to see where they are weak or redundant and exploit systemic vulnerabilities. Julian Assange, the world's most infamous hacker, uses the principle of the people's right to know to justify digital breaking and entering. The line between transparency and trespassing is a moving target and the WikiLeaks founder knows something about both. Until last Thursday, he had been hiding out to avoid prosecution by Sweden and the U. S. government for more than six years under the increasingly unwilling hospitality of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. He was evicted and dragged out by Scotland Yard and will now presumably be forced to defend his argument.

Julian Assange deserves a Medal of Freedom, not a secret indictment
Spygate: Did American intelligence agencies spy on Trump? Barr says we'll find out.
It will be a tough call. Prior to my career in journalism, in the pre-digital 1980s, I was a private detective. Those days were during the wild west of information retrieval. My bag of tricks included telephone pretexts, an analog form of hacking, to extract information from unwitting gatekeepers.
My clients were law firms, businesses, nonprofits and journalists, who always had a specific agenda that they hired me to achieve. My cases sought substantiation of suspected anti-competitive practices, bid irregularities, product liabilities, political corruption and housing or employment discrimination. The value of documented evidence is to impact one's goal and I believed their goals were worthy of the effort.
A terrible person who disclosed valuable info
All that high-minded self-regard notwithstanding, as privacy rights and information security abuses by others gained public attention, I had my own consciousness-raising epiphany. I stayed away from using misleading omissions and making obscured representations. Instead, I developed inside sources, who knew exactly who they were talking to. I was prepared to testify or sign affidavits detailing how I'd come to whatever knowledge I gained.
If access to information is the coin of the realm, authorized entry is the gold standard. By the early 1990s, I was on the government payroll as a US Senate investigator. My inquiries were backed by seldom invoked, though always implied, subpoena power. My phone calls were returned without need of subterfuge.
Today, watchdog organizations and investigative reporters navigate a field of anonymous tips, keystroke counted redactions, dark web denizens, encrypted communications, purloined passwords and a few trusted truth-tellers to bring sunlight to information.
Although Assange sounds like a terrible person on many levels, back in 2010 when he posted hundreds of thousands of digital files disclosed by then-PFC Bradley Manning documenting excesses by the U. S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan, and an enormous cache of State Department cables, I gave him a nod of respect for injecting the skies full of sunshine for open government. Embassy cables are a great way to learn about U. S. foreign policy.
Whistleblowers are the real heroes
While whistleblowers continue to fight an uphill battle to make claims of wrongdoing, my ambiguity about hacking in general, and WikiLeaks in particular, is apparently shared by some of its direct beneficiaries. When First Amendment champion The New York Times ran the sensational stories drawn from the very act for which Assange is now indicted (and for which whistleblower Manning — now Chelsea — spent years in jail), the newspaper of record's editors admitted their squeamishness about revealing the contents of the hacked files: "When we find ourselves in possession of government secrets, we think long and hard about whether to disclose them. "
Perhaps reluctant to give Assange the legitimacy a Pulitzer might have imparted, the Times eschewed submitting its scoop for the prize.
As a former private sleuth, past congressional staffer and investigative reporter, my sympathies toward the WikiLeaks founder are just as conflicted. Assange is a toxic house guest and alleged sexual assailant. He is not a journalist, but his published files gave media outlets valuable material important for Americans to know. He is not a political operative but his posting of Russian hacked emails of Democrats helped secure the presidency for Donald Trump. And while he has given whistleblowers a platform to reveal abuses, he is not a hero. He is a secrecy vandal.

Texto completo: Max Lugavere is the author of "Genius Foods," a book about optimizing brain function through diet. The subject became personal for him when his mother, Kathy, was given a diagnosis of dementia seven years ago, and he devoted himself to her care. She died last winter. "Now that Mom is gone, I am even more obsessed with the topic," he said. Mr. Lugavere, 36, is currently working on his second book and also has a podcast, "The Genius Life." He lives with his brother Ben, 30, a software engineer, and his cat, Delilah, in the Murray Hill neighborhood of Manhattan. Their brother Andrew, 33, lives in the same building and works in sales.
WAKE UP, HYDRATE I'm up somewhere between 7 and 8. I don't use an alarm clock. I go straight into the kitchen and drink a tall glass of room-temperature water. I may sprinkle a bit of mineral salt in it which replenishes electrolytes.
LIGHT, AIR Whether it's winter or summer, I go out onto my terrace and do a few minutes of deep breathing, stretching and meditation. I'm a big believer in getting in natural light in the morning because it aligns my circadian rhythm for the day.
SCREEN TIME I'll grab a cup of coffee that I've cold-brewed overnight and park myself in front of the computer to read the latest health related news. My go-to sites are EurekAlert, Twitter, Science Daily and The New York Times. I also come up with a new post for my Instagram. I do one post a day and try to make it as interesting as possible.
GET TO WORK I spend a good two hours working on my book. It's all about how to live your best life and avoid cognitive decline through your diet and lifestyle.
PROTEIN AND GREENS At around 11, I'm finally ready to eat. At Eons, a fast casual Greek place in my neighborhood, I get a huge bowl of greens with grass-fed beef or chicken. I also add beets and drench it with extra-virgin olive oil. The quality of the food is incredible. If I don't go to Eons, I make two or three fried eggs at home with a big bowl of greens on the side.
MOVE IT I like to get in some sort of activity every single day. I'm a member at Equinox, and I'll go there and do a weight lifting routine. I may also do some high-intensity interval training like sprints on a bike or sets of boxing.
DAILY SAUNA Being in a sauna gives me a lot of energy, and I've done research on the health benefits including on how saunas potentially reduce the risk of dementia. I love the sauna at Life Time Fitness on 42nd Street, and I'll go in for two or three half-hour intervals. I try to do this seven days a week. After the sauna, I take a plunge into the cold pool.
FUN WITH GROCERIES For most people, food shopping is a pain, but I love it and spend at least an hour at different grocery stores and farmers markets. I love Fairway, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and the farmers market on Second Avenue and 33rd street.
WRITING, ROUND TWO Back at home, I'm at the computer again. Writing a book takes real commitment and is a lot of sweat. Sometimes, I'll spend an entire day finessing a sentence. Other times, I'll get lucky, and the words will just come out.
THE FAMILY CHEF I always cook dinner for Ben, Andrew and me. My mom instilled an appreciation of cooking from when I was young. I love simple, nutrient-dense meals and follow a Mediterranean-style template that favors using the highest-quality ingredients and letting those dictate the flavor of the dishes. I'll roast in-season vegetables with salt, pepper, garlic and extra-virgin olive oil. I'll also roast a protein like a whole chicken, grass-fed steak or wild fish like salmon. I'll toss together a leafy green salad and top it with extra-virgin olive oil.
BROTHERHOOD The three of us sit down to dinner around 7. We live in the same building but are so busy that dinners are the only time when we really connect. Ben and Andrew try to eat healthy like me, too, and seem to be happy with what I cook. Occasionally, we'll open a bottle of red wine with our meal.
BLUE BLOCKERS All of us will clean up together, and then we'll move to the couch to get our TV fix. We're into "Game of Thrones" and also like this BBC show called "Killing Eve." At some point, I'll put on my blue blockers, which are glasses that block the blue light which TV's, tablets and phones all emit. Ben and Andrew usually head to bed around midnight. I may do a little more writing and go to sleep myself.

Texto completo: There's an easy way to get zero roaming fees, inexpensive internet service and cheap phone calls when you travel. The trick is the SIM card, a tiny, removable chip, inside your phone.
What is a SIM card?
Subscriber Identity Module cards are roughly the same size, and indeed look like, the microSD memory cards you'd find in a digital camera. (Some phones actually have both microSD and SIM cards, but most just have the latter.) The main purpose of a SIM card is to store a small amount of data that lets the closest cell tower know, among other things, what wireless company you've subscribed to. For example, if you're on Verizon, the SIM card will let Verizon's tower know that, yep, you're on Verizon.
When you're traveling, this creates a problem. When your phone connects to the tower in a different country, the tower effectively says "I don't know you," and either denies you service, or tells Verizon you're roaming. If the latter, you get whatever speed Verizon and that provider have determined is acceptable, and you get charged exorbitant roaming rates. AT&T works similarly, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Google Fi are different, but we'll get to them later.
If you're wondering if you can just get a different SIM card that will work on a different network, you can.
For years that's how I've gotten cheap data in dozens of countries all over the world. I'd arrive in a city, head to a local cellphone company store (like Vodafone, 3, or Orange), and buy a SIM and a month of service. These would have different names, like "pay-as-you-go" or "prepaid." but in every store I'd just say I was traveling and wanted a SIM for a few weeks, and they all knew what I was looking for. Put the new SIM in your phone (make sure you don't lose your old one, you'll need it when you go home!) and you're all set. If you're not sure how to do that, the store will probably do it for you. You can be in and out with cheap high-speed data in less than 30 minutes.
How much does a local SIM cost?
The prices vary depending on country and provider, but on average I've paid around $20 for a month's worth of 4G data and calls in that country. You read that right. Most roaming packages charge that for a few days, and are slow and data-limited as well. Most companies want to look at your passport, so make sure you bring it. A handful of countries have other requirements, so a quick Google search before you go is a good idea.
The catch, and you knew there'd have to be one, is that your phone has to be unlocked. This means your cellphone company has to enable a setting on your phone that allows you to use it on a different network. The process to do this varies, but in most cases you need to have paid off your phone. The actual unlocking process is free, though. I wrote about how this works over at Wirecutter, the product review site owned by The New York Times Company.
Not every phone will work in every country, but most new phones should be fine. Best to check with your current cellphone company to verify that your phone will work, and if it needs to be unlocked.
A handful of phones have dual-SIMs, which is exactly what it sounds like: two SIM card slots. This lets you keep your home SIM and your "away" SIM in the same phone. Not necessary for infrequent travelers, but for anyone who regularly goes to another country, quite handy.
Times are changing for SIM cards, however. Both Google and Apple have "eSIMs" in some of their phones and tablets. These Embedded-SIMs are essentially a virtual SIM card, and work across multiple cellular networks. This is how Google's Fi works.
Speaking of Google Fi, it, along with Sprint and T-Mobile, have generous free international coverage. Generally, if you have one of these providers, you'll be able to step off a plane just about anywhere in the world and your phone will work more or less normally. Google Fi has 4G data, Sprint and T-Mobile have far slower 2G, but offer 4G packages for a few dollars a day.
Where do I get a local SIM card?
You can buy SIMs at airports, but these are often far more expensive and offer less data than those you can purchase from a local telecom company. Lists of the main providers in the Americas, Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Africa and the Middle East can be found online before you depart. There are also "universal" travel SIM cards, but these cost more than a local SIM.
Will I have the same telephone number?
No. Your apps will work, but you will have a new number. Your old number will go direct to voice mail until you return home and swap in your original SIM, which will return your phone back to normal. Just something to keep in mind.

Texto completo: New York Chinese restaurant Lucky Lee’s is apologizing for not being “smarter about cultural sensitivities” after encountering backlash for marketing its restaurant as “clean.”

Lucky Lee’s nutritionist Arielle Haspel, who is white, expressed remorse after the restaurant unveiled a menu with “clean” Chinese-American food that claimed to “actually make [diners] feel good.” Haspel also came under fire for an Instagram post that questioned if lo mein made people feel “bloated and icky.”

“We heard you’re obsessed with lo mein but rarely eat it,” Haspel said in the post, which has since been deleted. “You said it makes you feel bloated and icky the next day? Well, wait until you slurp up our HIGH lo mein. Not too oily. Or salty.”

According to Haspel’s blog and other videos, she uses the term “clean eating” to refer to organic foods and to using olive oil rather than canola oil. But critics argued that Haspel’s use of “clean” in relation to the Chinese-American restaurant insinuated that other Chinese food was bad for consumers.

“Where she is coming from is a very dark place, and it’s a very sensitive place in the hearts of Chinese people,” Chris Cheung, owner of East Wind Snack Shop, told the New York Times.

“She mentions that every time she goes to eat Chinese food, she’s bloated,” Cheung said. “Well, I don’t know where she is going to eat Chinese food, but that doesn’t happen to me or anyone else who I know when they eat it.”

Haspel said Friday that although Lucky Lee’s intent was to show that those with dietary restrictions could be accommodated, the restaurant should have been more cognizant of the cultural ramifications. She said that the restaurant was “never trying to do something against the Chinese community.”

“We thought we were complementing an incredibly important cuisine, in a way that would cater to people that had certain dietary requirements,” said Haspel. “We have been listening and learning, and we have been making changes and we will continue. Shame on us for not being smarter about cultural sensitivities.”

Texto completo: 'Amazing Grace' ****
A massive rookie mistake -- director Sydney Pollack and his 16-millimeter film crew forgot to use a clapperboard synchronizing the sound with the image for each new take -- delivered roughly 20 hours of footage captured for the 1972 Aretha Franklin concert film "Amazing Grace" into a maddening purgatory.
There it stayed for nearly a half-century. But now it's here.
For a concert movie of straightforward, self-effacing technique, "Amazing Grace" delivers one of the purest, most concentrated blasts of satisfaction in a long time. Franklin was 29 at the time she recorded the best-selling gospel album in history. For anyone who grew up with the double album on the stereo, seeing her record renditions of the title song, Marvin Gaye's "Wholy Holy" and so many more will bring them closer to what they already adore.
For sinful newcomers to the album, it's 87 minutes of better late than never.
Franklin recorded with the 25-member Southern California Community Choir, inside the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in the LA neighborhood of Watts. Backed by a four-piece band, Franklin, the super-smooth Rev. James Cleveland (on screen nearly as much as Franklin) and exuberant choir director Alexander Hamilton's singers split the session into two evenings.
The second night brought, among others, Mick Jagger into the church. He's seen, fleetingly, sitting in the back; Pollack and his crew can be seen in "Amazing Grace" hustling, weaving around, trying to get as close to the music and what it meant for those people in that church on those nights.
The close-ups say it all: Beads of sweat intermingle with Franklin's blue eye shadow, and at times she seems to be blinking back tears. This is hard work in a place of worship; the joy it brings out in the crowd is the undeniable result.
The call-outs, spontaneous bursts of dance and shouts of affirmation from the choir and audience, especially during "Amazing Grace" but throughout the entire film, serve as a glorious reminder that sometimes all a filmmaker needs to do is be there, and be awake and responsive to the talent.
"Amazing Grace" finally fell together thanks to the tireless efforts of producer and music executive Alan Elliott.
Near the end of her life, Franklin sued and was granted an emergency injunction against the finished film's planned 2015 unveiling at the Telluride Film Festival. Shortly after Franklin's death last year, Elliott came to an agreement with Franklin's estate for the release.
There are a hundred little stories going on in "Amazing Grace," some unrelated to the music.
Bassist Chuck Rainey told The New York Times recently that Franklin felt marginalized by her own movie, probably owing to the screen time afforded Cleveland (her childhood mentor) and, on the second night, the big-footing presence of her father, the Rev. C.L. Franklin. His imposing, vaguely patronizing speech seems to turn Franklin into a meeker, compliant version of her adult self.
Even if Aretha Franklin doesn't dominate every second of "Amazing Grace," she's indisputably the reason the film exists and the reason it's so good. Her voice could lift people straight out of their seats in jubilation; her vocal flourishes and deep readings of the simplest, most elemental lyrics remain incomparable.
When she sings "my soul is satisfied," she's speaking for anyone listening to what she achieved here, in this Watts church with the walls painted various shades of blue, like countless prom tuxes of the era. "Satisfying" doesn't really do it justice, but it's a start.

Texto completo: SEOUL, South Korea - In a major reversal, South Korea's Constitutional Court on Thursday ordered the easing of the country's decades-old ban on most abortions, one of the strictest in the developed world.
Abortions have been largely illegal in South Korea since 1953, though convictions for violating the restrictions are rare. Still, the illegality of abortions forces women to seek out unauthorized and often expensive procedures to end their pregnancies, creating a social stigma that makes them feel like criminals.
The court's nine-justice panel said that the parliament must revise legislation to ease the current regulations by the end of 2020. It said the current abortion law was incompatible with the constitution and would be repealed if parliament fails to come up with new legislation by then.
The ruling is final and cannot be appealed, court officials said, but current regulations will remain in effect until they are replaced or repealed.
Current exceptions to the law only allow abortions when a woman is pregnant through rape or incest, when a pregnancy seriously jeopardizes her health, or when she or her male partner has certain diseases.
A woman in South Korea can be punished with up to one year in prison for having an illegal abortion, and a doctor can get up to two years in prison for performing an unauthorized abortion.
Thursday's verdict was a response to an appeal filed in 2017 by an obstetrician charged with carrying out about 70 unauthorized abortions from 2013-2017 at the request or approval of pregnant women.
4 in Senate GOP signal their opposition to Cain on Fed
WASHINGTON - A swift defection of at least four Senate Republicans has all-but-doomed the chance of Herman Cain to win a seat on the Federal Reserve's board of governors, serving as one of the most striking rebukes to President Donald Trump's personnel choices since he took office in 2017.
Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., all said they would oppose Cain's appointment to the Fed. Republicans control 53 seats of the 100-chamber Senate, and losing the support of four members means Cain would need help from Democrats, which appears unlikely.
Cain ran for president in the 2012 GOP primary, but lost momentum amid accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct, among other things.
Cain has denied wrongdoing.
Navy drops criminal charges against ex-Fitzgerald officers
Two former officers involved in the June 2017 collision between the USS Fitzgerald and a commercial ship off the coast of Japan will no longer face criminal charges, the Navy has announced.
"This decision is in the best interest of the Navy, the families of the Fitzgerald Sailors, and the procedural rights of the accused officers," the Navy said in a news release late Wednesday. "Both officers were previously dismissed from their jobs and received nonjudicial punishment."
Former commanding officer Cmdr. Bryce Benson was sleeping in his quarters the night of the collision, while former crew member Lt. Natalie Combs was manning the ship's Combat Information Center.
Two other officers were also charged in the collision, which killed seven U.S. sailors.
Trump's sister retires, negating judicial ethics complaints
NEW YORK - President Donald Trump's sister has retired as a federal appellate judge in Philadelphia, ending a civil misconduct inquiry launched after a report that she participated in Trump family schemes to dodge taxes.
The retirement of Maryanne Trump Barry was revealed in an April 1 order signed by a top court official in New York, where the misconduct case was assigned to prevent conflicts of interest for judges who knew Barry.
A judicial panel began the review in response to four citizen complaints filed in October after The New York Times published a story alleging the president and his siblings evaded inheritance taxes.
Barry, 82, was not identified by name in the order, but the facts matched her circumstances.
Ohio governor signs fetal heartbeat abortion bill
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Ohio's governor has signed a bill imposing one of the nation's toughest abortion restrictions.
Republican Gov. Mike DeWine followed through Thursday on his pledge to sign the heartbeat bill. It cleared the state Legislature on Wednesday.
It makes Ohio the fifth state to ban abortions after the first detectable fetal heartbeat. That can come as early as five or six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they're pregnant.
DeWine's support for the bill breaks with his predecessor. Former Republican Gov. John Kasich twice vetoed it on grounds it was unconstitutional and would spark a costly court challenge.
Even before the bill was signed, the ACLU of Ohio said it was preparing a constitutional challenge on behalf of four Ohio abortion clinics.
Senate confirms ex-lobbyist to lead Interior
WASHINGTON - The Senate on Thursday confirmed acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to lead the department on a permanent basis, despite complaints by Democrats that the former oil and gas lobbyist has used his federal position to benefit former industry clients.
Senators voted 56-41 to approve Bernhardt's nomination to oversee more than 500 million acres of public lands and other resources, including national parks, monuments and wildlife refuges. He succeeds Ryan Zinke, who resigned in January amid a series of ethics investigations.
Bernhardt was confirmed to the No. 2 position in July 2017.
Three Democrats - Sens. Martin Heinrich, N.M., Joe Manchin, W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona - voted for Bernhardt.

The Beresheet robotic spacecraft lost communication with ground control as it was making its final descent. Moments later, the mission was declared a failure.
Opher Doron, general manager of the space division of Israel Aerospace Industries, general manager of the space division of Israel Aerospace Industries said the spacecraft was in pieces scattered at the planned landing site.
He nonetheless called the mission an "amazing success," for reaching the moon and coming so close to landing successfully.

Texto completo: The big news this week for Pennsylvania hunters was the shift in the state's firearms deer season opener from the Monday after Thanksgiving to the Saturday after the holiday.
Lost amid all the discussion about the huge change to the state's most popular hunting day, however, was the fact that the Pa. Game Commission made alterations to several other seasons as well.
When it comes to bears, the agency has once again expanded bear-hunting opportunities by adding a muzzleloading bruin hunt to run concurrently with the antlerless deer muzzleloader season Oct. 19-26, as well as a firearms hunt for juniors and seniors to take place with the special firearms deer season for juniors and seniors Oct. 24-26. In addition, the archery bruin season dates have changed and the hunt has grown from one week to two, with sportsmen allowed to pursue bears with stick and string Oct. 28-Nov. 9. The late season firearms hunt has also expanded from 4 to 7 days in many wildlife management units.
Sportsmen who enjoy the late archery and flintlock muzzleloader deer season will have more time to head afield, as the after-Christmas season has been extended by a week, concluding on Martin Luther King Day. The 2019-'20 season will run Dec. 26-Jan. 20.
To accommodate the shift in the firearms deer season opener, the state has also shortened the November turkey seasons, with the last days to hunt the birds being Nov. 28-29.
One other major change of note is that archery hunters will no longer need to wear fluorescent orange during the archery deer, bear or elk season portions that overlap with firearms hunting seasons. Sportsmen previously had to wear orange while moving or post a piece of orange material while in a fixed position. Fall turkey hunters are also now excluded from the fluorescent orange requirements.
Noted Wildlife author holding book signing
in Kutztown
Author Charles Fergus, who has written for Pennsylvania Game News for more than two decades, will hold a book signing for his new book, "Make a Home for Wildlife," ($29.95) 7 p.m., April 22 at Firefly Bookstore, 271 W. Main St., Kutztown.
A longtime Keystone State resident, Fergus and his family purchased a 120-acre farm in Vermont in 2003, doing a variety of habitat projects to enhance the landscape for birds, mammals and other wildlife. In "Make a Home for Wildlife," the author offers insights and perspectives on how landowners can look at their properties in news ways to enhance food and cover for everything from butterflies and songbirds to amphibians and deer. Whether a person owns a 500-acre hunting parcel or just wants to improve the habitat in their backyard, Fegus shares tips and tactics that can make a difference in your life and the life of the area's wildlife.
A resident of Vermont's Northeast Kingdom, Fergus has authored 17 books during his career, as well as written for New York Times, Audubon, the Yale Review and others. In addition to the 208-page "Make a Home for Wildlife," he will offer signed copies of his historical mystery, "A Stranger Here Below," during his appearance at Firefly Bookstore. Both books are also available at Amazon.com.
Delaware Water Gap Recreation Area user fees kick in April 13
Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area visitors are reminded that the park's amenity fees will go into effect April 13-Nov. 1. Fees are charged for Smithfield, Milford and Turtle beaches, as well as Bushkill Boat Launch, Dingmans Boat Launch and Watergate Recreation Area. Cost is $10 per vehicle up to 7 occupants and $2 for pedestrians or additional passengers. "The fees collected in the park stay right here in the park and are used to pay for deferred maintenance projects and projects that directly benefit our visitors like trail maintenance, improved facilities including restrooms and launches, informational signs, picnic area improvements, and to staff the fee areas," says DWGNRA spokesperson Kathleen Sandt. "By contrast, if someone gets a ticket in the park, the revenue from the fines goes to the General Treasury and does not stay in the park for us to use here."
The recreation area also offers a $45 annual pass good for all fee areas for the entire season. For additional information, visit www.nps.gov/dewa/planyourvisit/fees.htm.
Shad Association's Sportsmen's Night
April 17 in Bethlehem
Angling seminars, an American shad fishing presentation and a variety of vendors offering fishing and boating equipment for sale highlight the annual Delaware River Shad Fishermen's Association's Spring Sportsmen's Night April 17, 7 p.m., at Se-Wy-Co Fire Company Social Hall, 3621 Old Bethlehem Pike, Bethlehem. The evening, which is free and open to the public, will also include light refreshments and raffles for deep sea and Lake Ontario spring brown trout angling trips. For more information, contact DRSFA President Mike Topping at thetoppings1@gmail.com.
Macungie's Michael Huff releases new book
on coyotes
Sportsmen who enjoy pursuing coyotes may want to check out "Master Coyote Hunting," the new book from hunting expert Michael Huff of Macungie.
Billed as the most comprehensive coyote hunting book ever written, Huff's book focuses on mastering the art of finding and calling coyotes within range of firearm or camera. The book takes an in-depth at everything needed to pursue the mammal, including firearm selection, mouth and electronic calls, lights for nighttime hunting and more.
A nationally recognized coyote hunting authority, Huff is also the author of the award-winning "Understanding Coyotes: The Comprehensive Guide for Hunters, Photographers and Wildlife Observers." He is a popular speaker at outdoors shows and seminars on the topic of coyote and fox hunting, and has also assisted municipalities dealing with coyote issues.
"Master Coyote Hunting" is available for $19.95 at amazon.com.

Texto completo: When Tim Gleason, the founder and artistic director of Binghamton's KNOW Theatre, first offered Adam Holley a starring role in "Blackbird," Holley turned him down.
That role is Ray, a man who set out to make a new life for himself after his illegal relationship with an underage woman landed him in prison.
"It scared the crap out of me," Holley said.
But the play stuck with him.
"It's so beautifully written, as controversial as it is," Holley said. "Even when you look at the pages, it looks like prose. I've never seen a script written like that."
While researching "Blackbird," Holley found a New York Times article written by Jeff Daniels, who played the role on Broadway. Also terrified, Daniels likened the role to standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon.
"Every actor knows you can't run from the ones that scare you," Daniels said in the 2016 article. "It's not the acting of the character, nor is it the dark imagination it takes to put yourself through all of his guilt, regret and shame. To truly become someone else, you have to hear him in your head, thinking, justifying, defending, wanting, needing, desiring."
Daniels' words, Holley said, helped him relax and prompted him to accept the role, which will mark Holley's KNOW Theatre debut.
"For me, it's been a circuitous path to find empathy for the man, in a lot of ways, to find the humanity in him," Holley said. "He's a human being who's made big mistakes, but he's also capable of love and care, and just trying to make something of his life that he has left."
"Blackbird" will run at KNOW Theatre from April 12 to 28. It's directed by Gleason, who selected the work for the theater's 2018-19 season.
"It scared me a little bit, which I like to be scared," Gleason said. "It makes me work harder."
Written by David Harrower, "Blackbird" was initially commissioned by the Edinburgh International Festival in 2005. It later moved to London's West End and won the Olivier Award in 2007 for Best New Play.
In 2007, Daniels first played the role in the play's Off-Broadway premiere at Manhattan Theatre Club along with Alison Pill and under the direction of Joe Mantello. Nearly a decade later, Daniels starred in the play's Broadway run in 2016 (also helmed by Mantello), this time alongside Michelle Williams. It was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play, and Daniels and Williams received Tony nods for acting.
In 2016, the play was adapted into a film titled "Una" starring Ben Mendelsohn and Rooney Mara.
In "Blackbird," we meet 56-year-old Ray, who has assumed a new identity and new life after years in prison. But his attempt to start over is shattered when he is approached by 27-year-old Una, who arrives unannounced at his new job, six hours away from her home, after seeing a photo of Ray in a magazine.
It's soon revealed that Ray and Una had a relationship 15 years ago, when she was 12 and he was 40.
The entire play takes place in the break room of the corporation where Ray is employed.
"It has a controversy to it," Gleason said. "It's going to make people get out their scales, which I love to make people think. It certainly fits that."
When developing Una, Nogaret conducted extensive research about survivors of sexual abuse, learning what happens in the aftermath.
"Being a voice for (survivors) in the show, it's a lot of pressure," Nogaret said. "But to do what we do, we have to go to pretty dark places and figure it out."
In conducting her research, Nogaret spoke to a close friend who is a survivor of sexual abuse.
"Una is a young woman who has been lost, and is trying to find answers for herself and even contentment in that loss," Nogaret said. "She's struggling a lot."
In crafting Ray, Holley's challenge was to find empathy for a character who has made horrifying, illegal choices. At times, Holley said said, he felt "ugly."
"I've just delved as deep as possible, I think more than any role I've done," Holley said. "I've really gone as far in as I can go to try to connect the dots from my own experience as closely to his experience as I could to sort of bring that truth to it, to understand when he feels like he's justified or he feels ashamed or guilty. How can I relate to that and bring my own story to that?"
Gleason has challenged Nogaret and Holley to find the humanity in the situation.
"In rehearsals or scenes, they both will drop their heads on the table," Gleason said. "It's exhausting to search, to feel the things."
At the center of the controversy is a love story, albeit one with endless gray areas.
"And is it love of her being young, or is it love that is still carrying on?" Nogaret asks.
Questions abound. And Daniels asked those questions of his character as well.
"Was he truly a 'beast' as Una describes? Or was he a one-time offender still living with the horror of what he'd done?" Daniels inquired in the New York Times article. "Was this new life for which he'd fought so hard real, or was he living a lie? Had he moved on, had he stopped being a ghost, had he truly forgiven himself?"
Like life, there may be not be any firm answers.
"That's all I want," Gleason said. "Is to hear the audience say 'yeah, but.'"

Treasury declines to release returns on time

Texto completo: Mnuchin questions legitimacy of request
for president's tax papers
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department would not meet the Wednesday deadline set by congressional Democrats to turn over copies of President Trump's tax returns, escalating a clash between the White House and Congress.
Mnuchin said he was consulting with the Justice Department as to the constitutional questions raised by the Democrats' request and appeared deeply skeptical of the lawmakers' intentions. He did not flatly reject the notion that he might ultimately comply, but his letter to the House Ways and Means Committee suggested that Mnuchin would not hold himself to any timeline.
Mnuchin wrote, "The Committee's request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional scope of congressional investigative authority, the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose, and the constitutional rights of American citizens."
Mnuchin's letter appeared to closely track the legal issues raised by Trump's lawyers last week in a letter in response to the request made by Ways and Means Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.). Even though Neal addressed his letter to Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Charles Rettig, Mnuchin said he would personally oversee the review. The IRS is part of the Treasury Department.
House Democrats had requested the president's tax records from 2013 to 2018, as well as information related to a trust that controls more than 100 businesses in Trump's empire.
Mnuchin's decision not to reject the Democratic request outright could buy the Treasury Department more time, since courts might not want to get involved until such a decision is made.
The request cited a 1924 federal law that states the IRS "shall furnish" the records at the request of lawmakers tasked with tax oversight.
"We have completed the necessary groundwork for a request of this magnitude, and I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative, legal and oversight rights," Neal said last week.
But Mnuchin said Wednesday that "the legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power."
Trump declined to release his records while running for president in 2016, breaking with decades of precedent.
The tax returns would give the public a new look into the president's sprawling business empire and alleged conflicts of interest, information that could come out during Trump's 2020 reelection campaign.
House Democrats are expected to soon send a second letter to the Treasury Department requesting the returns, according to a congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
The committee could also send subpoenas to Mnuchin and Rettig, demanding the returns be divulged. If the administration continues to deny the request, House Democrats could also file a lawsuit in federal court, said Daniel Hemel, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.
It's not clear how long the subsequent court fights would take.
Democrats may also choose to request the documents from New York state, given that federal taxes are often included as attachments in state tax returns. New York's legislature is considering a measure that would allow Congress to request the president's tax returns from the state's Department of Taxation and Finance.
"I think it's likely to go to the D.C. circuit, but does the Supreme Court want to get into this? That's really hard to predict," Hemel said. "I'd be surprised if [Chief Justice] John Roberts wants to resolve this dispute, but it is an important interbranch dispute."
Neal said in a statement Wednesday that he would discuss with legal counsel the best way to respond to Mnuchin's response to Democrats' request.
Rep. Kevin Brady (Tex.), the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, said the Treasury Department was "right to carefully review the privacy impact" of Democrats' request, saying it set a "dangerous precedent."
But Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.), who also sits on the committee, mocked Mnuchin's letter as "doubletalk" that shows Trump is "engaging in obstruction."
"How many lawyers and how much time does it take for Secretary Mnuchin to understand that 'shall' means 'shall'? " Doggett said in a statement.
Trump says he cannot release the tax returns because he is under audit, and the administration has put up a united front aimed at blocking the documents from being released.
Both Rettig and Mnuchin are Trump appointees.
In a 2016 column in Forbes, Rettig, then a private attorney, said no "experienced tax lawyer" would advise Trump to publicly release his tax returns during an audit.
Mnuchin revealed in testimony this week that Treasury attorneys had consulted with White House attorneys about the possible release of the returns. Mnuchin described the discussions between the White House and Treasury officials as purely "informational," though he wouldn't provide more details. White House officials similarly would not offer more information.
Democrats cried foul, saying any White House involvement in Treasury's decision-making raised the risk of improper political involvement. The reason federal law says the treasury secretary "shall furnish" tax returns requested by Congress is to block any involvement from the White House.
Attorneys for the president have said that Neal's request risks using the IRS for partisan political aims and that House Democrats are engaged in a "gross abuse of power" that infringes on taxpayer privacy. These arguments have been echoed in House hearings by congressional Republicans.
White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has said that Democrats will never obtain Trump's tax returns.
"The requests for [Trump's] private tax information are not consistent with governing law, do not advance any proper legislative purpose, and threaten to interfere with the ordinary conduct of audits," said William S. Consovoy, Trump's attorney, in a statement. "We are confident that this misguided attempt to politicize the administration of the tax laws will not succeed."
Last week, Consovoy sent a letter to the Treasury Department urging it not to release Trump's tax returns until it had received a formal legal opinion on the matter from the Justice Department.
Presidential candidates since the Nixon administration have released their tax returns, but Trump has refused to do so. He has promised to release the returns after the conclusion of an audit, although independent legal experts have said that an audit would not bar him from releasing them.
Democrats may be forced to prove in court that their request is part of Congress's oversight or legislative responsibilities, according to tax experts.
In 2016, the New York Times published Trump's 1995 income tax records, showing he claimed a large loss that could minimize his tax burden.
Mark W. Everson, who served as the IRS commissioner under President George W. Bush, said there is little dispute that Congress has the authority to receive Trump's tax returns. He also said he was alarmed by Mulvaney's comments denying Democrats would ever get the returns.
"I understand the stakes are significant, because it involves a president. But I am disturbed that the White House, through the chief of staff, would appear to be calling the shots on a matter that is fully within the purview of the Treasury Department," Everson said. "I think the law is clear on this matter."

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
This is my 20th year as a baseball writer for The New York Times, and to commemorate the occasion, I built a house.
Not literally, of course. I'm the least handy person you'll ever meet. But as a writer I sometimes think in analogies, and in this case I'm a carpenter. I build hundreds of tables and bookshelves and cabinets each year, taking pride in crafting something stable and sturdy. But I've always wanted to apply those skills to something grander. I've always wanted to build a house.
As The Times's national baseball writer, I'll generate hundreds of articles each year in the 800- to 1,200-word range. A few might reach 2,000. But what about something truly long-lasting: 112,000 words, sold in stores, shelved in libraries, with my name on the spine? What if I built ... a book?
Now I've written one, called "K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches," released by Doubleday on April 2. It's the culmination of a three-year scavenger hunt across the baseball landscape, locating more than 300 interview subjects to ask about the pitches that make up the game's DNA.
The book devotes a chapter apiece to the fastball, the curveball, the sinker, the slider, the cutter, the changeup, the splitter, the screwball, the knuckleball and the spitball. To write it, I had to find a different voice than the one in the newspaper, one of assurance and authority. To be comfortable doing that, I relied on the tools I use to write daily columns and features: talking to as many people as possible, and always learning to try something new.
My mission was to find every pitcher who threw any pitch especially well, plus catchers, hitters, coaches, umpires, scouts and so on -- and, because the book would cover the scope of baseball history, to make sure to get voices of the past, too.
I spent several days engrossed in ancient news clippings at the Hall of Fame library in Cooperstown, N.Y. I leaned on players I covered in my dozen years as a beat writer (at The Times and on the West Coast), reconnecting with pitchers I covered: Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte, Roger Clemens, Mike Myers, Al Leiter, Jamie Moyer, Chuck Finley -- and especially Mike Mussina, the new Hall of Famer, who invited me to lunch in his hometown, Montoursville, Pa. We talked about pitching for hours.
In all, I interviewed 22 Hall of Fame pitchers, plus many standouts who made a huge impact in the game but do not have a plaque in Cooperstown: guys like Carl Erskine, Roger Craig, Elroy Face, Wilbur Wood, J. R. Richard, Kent Tekulve, Ron Guidry, Dave Duncan, Mario Soto, Brad Lidge and many more.
I also tracked down pitchers whose feats I witnessed in my formative days as a fan near Philadelphia: the Hall of Famer Steve Carlton, my first baseball hero; Steve Rogers, the longtime Expo who beat Carlton in the first game I ever saw, in 1981; and Scott McGregor, who clinched the 1983 World Series for the Orioles as I watched, forlornly, from the front row at old Veterans Stadium.
Carlton was famous for never talking to the news media, but he was delightful in our 40-minute chat. He greeted my call with a playful brushback pitch: "So you're writing a book -- don't you know people don't read anymore?" But I hung in there and learned all about the pitch that might have been the best slider in the history of the game.
Rogers, whom I found at an All-Star Game in Cincinnati, was a riot; he shared the advice of an early pitching coach, Calvin Coolidge Julius Caesar Tuskahoma McLish -- Cal, for short -- who told young pitchers, "All right, son, just get out in front and get whippy!" Quite a contrast to today's coaches, who calculate every revolution of the ball with precise technological backing.
McGregor, whose name I cursed as a vanquished 8-year-old Phillies fan, was also a treat to interview, reflecting not just on his moment of glory but also on his final day in the majors, in 1988, when he knew he was finished. The Twins were lashing his lifeless pitches, and the Orioles' shortstop, Cal Ripken Jr., asked McGregor on the mound if he was still throwing his changeup.
"They're all the same speed anymore," McGregor told Ripken. "Just back up a little bit. You might be a little safer."
You'll find that story on Page 207. I like to pick up the book and flip to a random page like that, to remember the moments of discovery behind every paragraph. For me, it's like roaming the hallways of the house I finally built, every insight a support beam holding it up.
I hope you'll drop by and enjoy your stay.

The UK's 'Remainers' will tear down democracy and all its rules to get their way

Texto completo: “The United Kingdom,” the New York Times proclaims with its customary tone of Olympian certainty, “has gone mad.”

That publication has become almost comically anti-British over the past two years, but on this occasion, it has a point — albeit an unintended one.

The author, Thomas Friedman, offers us his lofty diagnosis of Britain’s collective dementia. It is caused, he informs us, by “Conservative hard-liners who used to care about business but are now obsessed with restoring Britain’s ‘sovereignty’ over any economic considerations.”

What he means by “hard-liners,” to be clear, is “MPs who accept the 2016 referendum result,” something all sides promised to do in advance. It is worth pointing out that 12 months after the referendum, there was a general election, at which both the Labour and Conservative parties promised unequivocally to uphold the people’s verdict.

Only now, it turns out that when they made that promise, quite a few candidates had their fingers crossed behind their backs. The hard-liners, we are to understand, are those who actually meant what they said and plan to deliver on the commitments they made during the campaign.

That, these days, is what passes for psychosis.

To be fair, Friedman is not alone in this eccentric nomenclature. Liberal pundits have evolved a peculiar vocabulary to describe pledge-breaking by politicians. Words such as “leadership,” “compromise,” “maturity,” and “courage” are now used as euphemisms for “going back on what you promised when you were asking people to vote for you.” Conversely, those representatives who stick to their promises are called “extremists,” “hard-liners,” “obsessives,” and “swivel-eyed loons.”

What is unusual here, though, is the length to which the supposed moderates are prepared to go to defy the electorate. They are tearing down all the props and scaffolds which used to prop up Britain’s parliamentary system to guarantee its popular legitimacy. For example, the neutrality of the speaker of the House of Commons used to be a given, a datum on which everything else rested. But the current speaker, John Bercow, a passionate Euro-integrationist, is making up the rules as he goes along. First, he ignored official advice and precedent to allow an inadmissible pro-EU amendment. When challenged, he smirked, and told MPs that if we stuck with precedent, we would never change. A few weeks later, he refused to allow a pro-Brexit motion, citing a long-defunct rule from 1604 that forbade the same motion or amendment to be submitted twice in the same session. Precedent, he said, must be followed. Immediately afterwards, he made clear that he would allow pro-EU amendments to be resubmitted as often as the authors pleased, precedent be damned.

I could fill the rest of the column with examples of norms ignored, rules breached, conventions overturned, all for the sake of trying to keep Britain in the EU. Collective Cabinet responsibility, the balance between legislature and executive, the freedom of a government to contract treaties, the weight of election promises and even, possibly, the survival of the two main parties — all these are being tossed overboard in an attempt to capsize the referendum result.

Commentators are so used to applying the word “obsessive” to euroskeptics that they can’t bring themselves to acknowledge the mania of the Europhiles, who are prepared to tear down all the things that mainstream, liberal, sensible people used to value. Even the idea of democracy itself, the idea that elections matter and are not to be treated as an inconvenience, Venezuela-style, has been hacked aside by the Eurozealots’ machetes.

How did Edmund Burke put it? “Rage and frenzy will pull down more in half an hour than prudence, deliberation, and foresight can build up in a hundred years.” Yet, it is these Europhiles whom Friedman (and, indeed, the Financial Times, the BBC, and the rest) consider sane, simply because they won’t abandon a 1950s-era customs union.

The pundits have it back-to-front. Yes, a certain derangement has possessed some MPs. But the British people, I’m glad to say, are as sane, cynical, grumpy, and phlegmatic as ever. They never had much time for their politicians in the first place.

They suspected that their politicians would say one thing before the election and do another after it. They are not surprised to see MPs working to delay, water down, or block their decision, having always half-expected it to happen. But they know, too, that the 2016 referendum cannot simply be wished away. Sooner or later, Britain is leaving the EU. The only question is how many current politicians will survive the transition.

VIETNAMESE JAMES BOND' DIES

Texto completo: SAN JOSE >> In his lifetime, Ly Tong was known as an anti-Communist freedom fighter, an eccentric self-promoter and a "Vietnamese James Bond."
On Friday, Tong, 74, a controversial figure who earned notoriety in San Jose in 2008 for staging a hunger strike over efforts to rename the "Little Saigon" neighborhood, died of lung failure in a San Diego hospital surrounded by family.
Tong had been in a coma for more than two weeks and, when news spread that the renowned activist was on his deathbed, a parade of visitors descended on his hospital room, including long-time admirers and fans, community leaders and elected officials.
"He had many great adventures, and he survived many things that an average person would not survive," said San Jose City Councilman Lan Diep, whose parents are Vietnamese refugees. "At his core, he is a representation of the anger that the Vietnamese refugee community feels to the Communist Vietnamese government."
As a young fighter pilot for the South Vietnamese Air Force, Tong was shot down near the end of the Vietnam War and imprisoned by the North Vietnamese before escaping. In 1998, he hijacked a plane and ordered the pilot to fly low over Ho Chi Minh City to drop anti-Communist leaflets, then jumped out the cockpit window and parachuted into a swamp before he was captured and imprisoned. He pulled a similar stunt in 2000.
In San Jose, two years after staging the hunger strike, Tong dressed as a woman at the Santa Clara Convention Center in 2010 to get close enough to a Vietnamese singer he opposed politically to hand him a bouquet of roses, then pepper sprayed him in the face. For that stunt, he was sentenced to six months at the Santa Clara County jail.
"It's precisely because he dared to do those things that many people in the community admired him," Diep said. "The more he did that, the more his legend grew, and it's fair to say he quite enjoyed the notoriety."
Tong's stunts not only garnered admirers among Vietnamese refugees but drew media attention from around the globe. The New York Times, in a 2006 profile of Tong while he was imprisoned in Bangkok for the second plane hijacking, called him "a symbol of courage and redemption, a tragic hero in the tradition of Vietnamese history."
"It's a quintessential Vietnamese thing, dying for a cause, trying and failing for a cause," Hoi Trinh, one of Tong's fans, told The New York Times. "Vietnamese, we are not set against failure. We think it's a very beautiful thing."
Tong also had his detractors, who thought his extreme actions went too far.
"He's a very courageous guy, probably the most courageous in the Vietnamese community," said reporter Dzung Do of Nguoi Viet Daily News in Westminster, home to some 180,000 Vietnamese where Tong's death was front-page news. "Of course, some people didn't like the way he acted. But to a lot of people, especially those who were anti-Communist, they considered him a hero."
Tong was born in Vietnam Sept. 1, 1945. He never married but had three children. An all-day viewing is planned for April 20 at Peek Funeral Home in Westminster, followed April 21 by a half-day viewing before an afternoon burial at Westminster Memorial Park.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump volvió a presionar a México para que detenga inmigrantes que buscan llegar a los Estados Unidos.
El mandatario ha enviado mensajes encontrados sobre la actuación del Gobierno de Andrés Manuel López Obrador en torno a los centroamericanos, ya que primero alabó la detención de inmigrantes, pero luego se quejó de lo opuesto.
El presidente Trump advirtió que el país “está lleno”, además de amenazar nuevamente con cerrar la frontera.
“México debe aprehender a todos los ilegales y no dejarlos que avancen hacia los Estados Unidos, o no tendremos otra opción que Cerrar la Frontera y/o establecer Impuestos” , escribió anoche el mandatario. “¡Nuestro País está LLENO!” .
….Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States, or we will have no other choice than to Close the Border and/or institute Tariffs. Our Country is FULL!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2019
El mensaje del republicano se dio apenas unas horas después de presionar a la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen , de presentar su renuncia, tras una complicada reunión en la Casa Blanca, según reportes del New York Times y el Washington Post.
Previo a su nueva advertencia, el mandatario presumió las acciones de la Patrulla Fronteriza, al señalar que ha detenido a más inmigrantes que “en muchos años” e insistió sobre lo “lleno” que está el país, además de pedir nuevamente el endurecimiento de leyes, exigiendo a los demócratas sumarse a su petición.
“El sistema ha estado roto por muchos años. Los demócratas en el Congreso deben aceptar arreglar estas lagunas legales – No fronteras abiertas (crimen y drogas)” , tuiteó.
More apprehensions (captures)
at the Southern Border than in many years. Border Patrol amazing! Country is FULL! System has been broken for many years. Democrats in Congress must agree to fix loopholes – No Open Borders (Crimes & Drugs). Will Close Southern Border If necessary…
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2019
Desde la semana pasada, el presidente Trump ha enviado mensajes públicos a la Administración de López Obrador, quien no ha respondido directamente al respecto, pero el canciller Marcelo Ebrard afirma que México se mantendrá en su posición de respetar el Acuerdo de Marrakech , el cual aboga por la inmigración libre y ordenada. Este plan aprobado por las Naciones Unidas fue rechazado por Estados Unidos.
A pesar de las críticas del republicano a México, ese Gobierno aceptó recibir a inmigrantes que esperan una decisión en las cortes de EEUU sobre sus casos de asilo, un proyecto que Nielsen proyectó ampliar la semana pasada.

Unlocking iconic peak, a Colorado town seeks new destiny

Texto completo: Driving south on Interstate 25, the mesa emerges like a hazy talisman. That’s Fisher’s Peak looming over Trinidad, the flats of piñon and juniper morphing into hills of pine and aspen, rising to those volcanic cliffs near 9,700 feet.
“I’ve had visions from many, many, many years ago. How can we have public access to this thing?” says Phil Rico, Trinidad’s mayor and native son. “And I’m not the only one. The residents who’ve been here all our lives, we’ve always felt like it belonged to us, yet we couldn’t access it.
“Now it has become reality.”
It will be reality after two to four years of planning. Thanks to a deal reached by multiple agencies, Fisher’s Peak and the surrounding Crazy French Ranch will be for the public. Thirty square miles of classic, Colorado beauty will become a recreation paradise, boldly representing Trinidad’s new destiny.
The town has a gritty heritage of farms, railroads, mines and oil — faded images of an economic portrait. Leaders are pleased by the recent boost from marijuana dispensaries. But they’re wary of that industry spreading far and wide, erasing the niche they’ve established.
“We need to develop something different,” Rico says.
So they’ve set a course aimed at outdoor recreation, the state industry reportedly worth $62 billion. Their proclamation? The dramatic backdrop they’ve identified with all along.
“What the Flatirons are to Boulder, Fisher’s Peak is to Trinidad, or what Pikes Peak is to the Springs,” says Jim Petterson, the Colorado director with the Trust for Public Land.
A senior planner with that organization sparked the conservation mission. He had come across a 2014 article in The New York Times mentioning the ranch owned by a French couple. Initially, Fisher’s Peak was listed with a larger tract of adjoining land, altogether the size being three times that of Manhattan, The Times reported.
“I think the price was over $80 million,” says Trinidad City Manager Greg Sund.
In 2017, Sund saw the price reduced for a smaller portion that included the mountain. He called the Trust for Public Land people, who called The Nature Conservancy people.
The two nonprofits are raising the rest of the $25 million cost after Colorado Parks and Wildlife and Great Outdoors Colorado combined to pony up an essential $14.5 million.
Thus Trinidad has what Juan DelaRoca calls its “game-changer.”
“With Fisher’s Peak, it really hits home,” the resident mountain biker says. “This is going to be a place that will turn around in a big way.”
He saw the potential when he drove into town in 2015. The longtime Coloradan had been living in Boulder, continuing his career in marketing. He was feeling “squeezed” and priced out.
So he went looking for something that felt more true to the state. What he found had promontories, plains, a running river — the ingredients of a fine mountain town but far more affordable.
“I never would’ve thought I’d end up in Trinidad,” DelaRoca says. “But this is part of the state that’s as good as any other. It’s just one of those areas that people have overlooked for a long time.”
So here he is, an emerging advocate for the open space all around. Last weekend, he hosted the Explore Las Animas Dirt Series, taking advantage of the gravel roads webbing one of the state’s larger counties in land mass, smallest in population.
With the parties responsible for acquiring Fisher’s Peak, DelaRoca took a helicopter ride over the mountain and has been dreaming big ever since.
“That ride from Crested Butte to Aspen?” he says, drawing one lofty comparison. “That’s the sort of ride you’ll be able to do here that you’ve never done before.”
That would be from Trinidad to Raton, N.M. Overseers expect Fisher’s Peak to become a convergence point for outdoor enthusiasts, with Santa Fe and Denver about the same distance away in either direction.
But first, a management plan. Parks and Wildlife has pledged to manage the property, leading some to wonder if Fisher’s Peak has a state park designation in its future.
Previously private, rugged land near Conifer became Staunton State Park in 2013 and could be “useful learning,” Petterson says. But the size pales in comparison with these 19,200 acres. Among Colorado’s state parks, only State Forest is bigger than that.
With Teller County’s Mueller State Park, land managers split a massive ranch into a wildlife area and park. At the Fisher’s Peak site, wildlife areas border the ranch, with Trinidad Lake State Park northwest of the mountain.
CPW isn’t talking specifics yet. “We’re very excited about the possibilities here,” said spokesman Bill Vogrin.
For now, ideas are being heard. Trinidad kids were recently asked to contribute theirs. They returned colored pictures depicting cyclists and equestrians, all with that iconic landmark in the background.
“They’re dreaming, too,” the mayor says.

Texto completo: Remember "Wayne's World"? I think a lot about this one scene: Wayne and Garth, having sold their public access show to the enterprising capitalist yuppie Benjamin, arrive at the set of their newly slick, ad-supported program. They're in a control booth peering down over a perfect replica of Wayne's basement, and Garth says: "We're looking down on Wayne's basement, only that's not Wayne's basement. Isn't that weird?"
On the internet, I often feel like I'm in that control booth, looking down on a version of me, fighting for the controls to myself.
And who am I? Personally, I'm a plant mom, Garth stan and friend to outdoor cats. Professionally, I'm a critic-at-large for The New York Times, which is a fancy way of saying that I'm a critic of everything. I write about movies and awards shows and SoulCycle branding. I end up thinking a lot about the internet, which means thinking about money and power and brands and the unseen ways our online identities are guided by all of the above.
The point is: I've made a digital product for you to consume. It's a video series about internet culture, and it is branded around me. It's called "Internetting With Amanda Hess" and it's about the downfall of cat memes, the rise of Instagram cyborgs, the creeping dominance of hands videos, and more. I want you to watch it and share it with everyone you know, and everyone you don't. I want you to Tweet it, Facebook it, Pin it, Instagram it and post it everywhere else influence is sold.
______
"Internetting with Amanda Hess" is a video adventure through our unending dystopian nightmare. Sign up for email reminders about the latest episodes.
______
Doesn't it seem like we're all selling something now? The story of the internet is of a freewheeling public communication accelerator colliding head first with consumer culture -- wrangled by zillionaires, pumped with venture capital and showered with ad dollars. Here, all of our wild, individualistic social relations are aggregated into market research and greased for consumption. The game plays out all around us, from the cute dog videos we watch to the tiny famous babies we follow on Instagram. It subtly shapes how The New York Times makes content for the internet, too: YouTube likes faces, so mine is everywhere.
Wherever the trends move and the cash flows, there we all are. The dizzying rise of online visual culture means our faces and bodies are exposed and scrutinized like never before. Whatever it is we "do" for a living is increasingly stitched up with who we are. We sell ourselves and stuff at the same time -- my Instagram cat photos are interspersed with links to my articles, asking you to like me and my work, too.
Sometimes, scrolling back over my online presence, it can seem like I'm playing myself in an ad for myself. What's the inverse of your soul leaving your body? Being a citizen of the internet can make me feel like my image is out walking around without my knowledge, representing me to strangers and brokering little deals.
So here's one more: Season 2 of "Internetting" is available now, so you can binge watch all 10 episodes and never ever leave.
You can sign up now to get email reminders from me, me, me -- or write directly to internetting@nytimes.com. And with me as always is Shane O'Neill, who edits and produces "Internetting."
We're not worthy,
Amanda

The opium of California

Texto completo: The current frenzy of new IPOs — Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest and Airbnb — seems destined to reinforce progressive notions that California represents the future not just for the state, but the nation. It will certainly reinforce California’s fiscal dependency on tech-dominated elites — half of the state’s income taxes come from people making over $500,000 a year — and provide a huge potential multi-billion dollar windfall for the state treasury.
To be sure, the insiders — founders, with nearly half the voting shares in companies such as Lyft, a small “tech mafia” of venture firms, foreign investors such as Japan’s Softbank and Wall Street investors — will have reason to celebrate. But the lavish paydays will do little to relieve, and may even serve to worsen, the state’s gaping inequality and nation-leading poverty rates .
Most damaging of all, the IPO high will encourage supporters of the state’s policy agenda. If new companies crop up, and the handful of politically savvy investors thrive, California’s illuminati can fend off criticism of policies that undermine the middle and working class in everything from energy to housing.
The changing nature of California’s tech economy
“Science,” observed Daniel Coit Gilman, the second president of the University of California, ”is the mother of California.” With few navigable rivers, a persistent shortage of water, far from the then-dominant Eastern seaboard, California’s growth depended on engineering prowess. Not tied to the traditional industries, the state seized on emerging fields such as aviation, space and eventually semiconductors, laying the basis for an expanding middle class
In contrast, little of today’s tech growth produces tangible products, and those that remain, such as Space X , the semiconductor industry and Apple, are placing their production either abroad or in less expensive and less highly regulated states. This allows them to escape California’s high electrical rates, poor roads, collapsing bridges and lagging public education system. The digital future may remain in California but the action in chip-manufacturing, biomedical products or space exploration seems headed elsewhere.
The firms in the new “information peddling economy,” notes the University of Washington at Tacoma’s Ali Modarres, have a very different relationship with their employees than “first wave” companies such as Hewlett Packard and Intel. In the first wave a broad range of employees enjoyed rewards from corporate success and stock gains; drivers for Uber, as one analyst suggests, will get nothing but the privilege of seeing vast flows of cash used to replace them with automated vehicles.
The neo-feudal city
The new wave of IPOs will expand the ranks of what The New York Times aptly describes as “the elite caste who can afford to live comfortably in the Bay Area.” Tech senior managers will enjoy huge capital gains, greatly reducing their federal tax liability. In contrast, less well-placed working schmucks will pay upward of half their income in taxes while those who clean their offices will face potential new fees on everything from tires and soda to water.
Even in the Bay Area, home to four of California’s wealthiest ZIP codes, middle-wage jobs are disappearing and most new growth is tilted toward low-wage service work. Nearly half of all millennials are planning to leave and analysts suggest the area may face a severe shortage of skilled workers. Overall, notes a new Joint Venture Silicon Valley report, homelessness and inequality has expanded in the region, while the quality of life is perceived by most to be deteriorating.
One can appreciate the economic benefits that Uber, Lyft, Salesforce and others have brought to San Francisco, but there’s also a neo-Dickensian reality: sky-high housing prices, widespread homelessness, displaced minorities, few children and a rapidly shrinking middle class. There are now more drug addicts in the city of San Francisco than high school students and so much feces on the street that one website has created a “poop map.” More than half of the Bay Area’s lower-income communities, notes a recent UC Berkeley study, are in danger of mass displacement.
As for the rest of California
In previous tech-led economic booms — as recently as the last decade — growth extended to the rest of the state, particularly the more affordable interior. Tech firms expanded eastward, to Sacramento, south toward Salinas and throughout Southern California. The new tech economy, in contrast, has no real need for a periphery. It expands almost anywhere, whether to media-centric New York, less expensive places including suburban Austin, Nashville or Dallas or to China, India or the Philippines.
This has left much of Southern and interior California an economic dependency, hosting largely on low-wage jobs and increasingly dependent on an expansive welfare state. Worse yet, the tech boom serves as a narcotic, anesthetizing our political leaders from confronting the economic realities outside the venture capital-funded Bay Area bubble.
What is needed now is a focus on the middle- and working-class Californians, the vast majority of whom live far from the Bay Area. California’s policy makers need to start by rolling back many of the regulations on energy and housing that are reducing opportunity by driving up costs and driving middle-class jobs out of the state. We also need to focus more on developing employment centers outside the ultra-expensive coastal areas, something that would allow people to live closer to where they work. This suggests a policy that focus on such things as good roads, decent schools and a variety of upwardly mobile jobs — things that may not matter much to oligarchs or the youthful staffs, but make all the difference to middle- and working-class families.
To be truly a sustainable society, California needs opportunities for carpenters, machinists, middle managers, not just for the current structure that relies on superstar coders and produces large numbers of low-paid service workers. We need a California boom that lifts most of our citizens and does not drive them toward a permanent semi-feudal state, servants and supplicants of a small, fantastically wealthy and preening technological elite.

Cook County Judge Keeps Limit on Publication in Place in Child Welfare Case

Resumen: In a hearing on Friday, Patricia Martin, presiding judge of Cook County Juvenile Court’s child protection division, said she will rule on a motion by ProPublica Illinois to lift the order within five business days of reviewing a transcript of the proceedings. Martin issued her order in response to a request from Bruce Boyer, a professor at Loyola University Chicago’s law school and director of the Civitas ChildLaw Clinic, which represents children in child protection cases. A coalition of 40 news organizations, led by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a group that advocates for press rights, submitted a friend-of-the-court letter that argued Martin’s order violated ProPublica Illinois’ rights under the First Amendment.

Texto completo: A highly unusual judicial order blocking ProPublica Illinois and other news organizations from publishing some information about an ongoing child welfare case will remain in place for at least several more days.
In a hearing on Friday, Patricia Martin, presiding judge of Cook County Juvenile Court’s child protection division, said she will rule on a motion by ProPublica Illinois to lift the order within five business days of reviewing a transcript of the proceedings.
During the 90-minute hearing, Martin questioned attorneys for ProPublica Illinois and for the children in the case about how they would balance the First Amendment right to publish with the minors’ privacy interests.
Child protection cases involve victims “who have done absolutely nothing but be born,” Martin said. “Does that truly innocent victim have a [privacy] right?”
Martin barred ProPublica Illinois and other organizations last month from publishing “the names and/or any other information that would permit the ready identification” of the children or foster parents involved in a case ProPublica Illinois is investigating, “including specific address or other demographic information.” Her order was a rare instance of a judge restricting a news organization before the publication of a story, and it drew widespread criticism from other journalists.
Martin issued her order in response to a request from Bruce Boyer, a professor at Loyola University Chicago’s law school and director of the Civitas ChildLaw Clinic, which represents children in child protection cases. Boyer represents the children involved in the case and had argued that he wanted to protect their privacy.
No one has argued that the minors don’t have privacy rights, said Gabriel Fuentes, an attorney at Jenner & Block representing ProPublica Illinois. But ProPublica Illinois has no plans to reveal the identities of the children in the case, he said, and the court should not address privacy concerns with a “broad” prior restraint order.
ProPublica Illinois reporters learned the identities of the children and foster parents independently and outside court hearings.
“The harm we’re talking about is the state acting as an editor for ProPublica — the invasion of the power of the state into a newsroom,” Fuentes said.
Michael Weaver, an attorney from McDermott Will & Emery who is representing the children, said the order was specific and necessary.
“The issue here is not ProPublica’s general First Amendment rights,” he said. Instead, it’s about “whether the primary rights of minors are outweighed by ProPublica’s right to publish.”
A coalition of 40 news organizations, led by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a group that advocates for press rights, submitted a friend-of-the-court letter that argued Martin’s order violated ProPublica Illinois’ rights under the First Amendment.
The judge was undoubtedly trying to protect the children’s privacy, the letter said, but the order is “an unconstitutional prior restraint” and a “direct attack on the marketplace of ideas.” The letter was signed by news organizations that included Chicago’s daily newspapers, NPR, The New York Times and The Washington Post.

Texto completo: Dig in, Broadway fanatics, because Des Moines Performing Arts offers a buffet of touring musicals as part of its 2019-20 season.
The Willis Broadway Series returns for a 23rd year, bringing a dozen stories of song and dance to downtown Des Moines. Kicking off with film-to-stage favorite "Mean Girls" in October, the season boasts 10-time Tony Award winner "The Band's Visit," a 50th anniversary of "Jesus Christ Superstar," the return of "Wicked" and more.
The dozen Broadway announcement comes as the nonprofit arts organization rolled out 35 total shows in dance, comedy, music and more for 2019 and 2020. Since opening in 1979, Des Moines Performing Arts has welcomed an estimated 10.6 million visitors to nearly 10,000 scheduled performances.
Looking for a closer look at each upcoming show? We've got you covered.
Mean Girls (Oct. 15-20, 2019) With book from beloved Hollywood creative Tina Fey, "Mean Girls" brings to stage the storied struggle of Cady Heron and Regina George.

Per the show, "Cultures clashed and nerves ran high, but uneasiness turned into trust, music soared into the night and gratitude grew into enduring friendship."
Anastasia (Feb. 25-March 1, 2020) One of film's most familiar stories comes to life on stage as this musical takes theatergoers through the journey of Anya as she searches for "home, love and family." The show debuted on Broadway in April 2017 and makes a Des Moines debut next year.

Texto completo: Lawyers for the former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst, who is charged in connection with the nationwide college admissions cheating scandal, said Wednesday that his legal fees are likely to exceed $250,000 and asked a judge to release funds the government has seized from his accounts.
In a motion filed in US District Court in Boston, attorneys for Ernst, 52, a ­Cranston, R.I., native with homes in Falmouth and Chevy Chase, Md., said that releasing the funds is necessary to help pay his legal fees and living expenses.
And, the lawyers argued, the government hasn't shown that the seized funds are tied to alleged criminal activity. All told, federal officials seized more than $1.1 million from four accounts pursuant to seizure warrants, records show.
The “government lacks probable cause to believe that the seized funds are traceable to proceeds of a RICO conspiracy," the motion said. “The government ­alleges that the racketeering conspiracy involving Mr. Ernst transpired between 2012 and 2018. . . . Between January 1, 2019, and March 12, 2019, [redacted] and Mr. Ernst earned wages totaling [redacted]."
Ernst, who once gave ­Michelle Obama tennis lessons and told The New York Times in 2014 that the then-first lady had a powerful backhand shot, is one of 50 defendants charged in a sweeping scandal that exploded into the headlines last month.
Federal prosecutors say dozens of wealthy parents, including Hollywood stars and captains of industry, cut fat checks to have their children falsely certified as athletic recruits at fancy colleges, or to facilitate cheating on their SAT and ACT exams.
Ernst faces a charge of racketeering conspiracy for allegedly collecting bribes totaling $2.7 million over several years in exchange for designating “at least 12 applicants as recruits for the Georgetown tennis team, including some who did not play tennis competitively, thereby facilitating their admission to Georgetown," court records show.
He has pleaded not guilty.
Noting that Ernst recently resigned from coaching women's tennis at the University of Rhode Island, Ernst's lawyers said in Wednesday's motion that he has limited options for generating income, absent the release of the seized funds.
“Mr. Ernst's affidavit further shows that much of Mr. Ernst's assets are significantly burdened by substantial debt, and that the vast majority of his assets are illiquid and/or not easily liquidated," the filing said.
“Even assuming that Mr. Ernst could sell his Maryland home (he cannot sell his Massachusetts condominium in light of the restraining order), its sale will not generate proceeds net of costs and commissions, sufficient for his legal defense."
In a separate case, a prominent California dentist has lost three book deals because of the onslaught of publicity surrounding the case, legal filings show.
But on Wednesday the defendant, Dr. Homayoun Zadeh, 57, heard some good news when a federal judge in Boston granted his request to travel abroad for speaking engagements while his case is pending.
Zadeh is charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for allegedly conspiring to pay a $100,000 bribe in several installments in exchange for having his daughter certified as a lacrosse recruit at the University of Southern California, even though she didn't play the sport competitively, records show.
Magistrate Judge M. Page Kelley on Wednesday approved Zadeh's motion for permission to travel to upcoming conferences in foreign locales.
The motion, filed March 21, laid out the professional challenges faced by Zadeh since his arrest.
“As a result of his highly publicized arrest, Dr. Zadeh has been placed on administrative leave from his position as the director of the Laboratory for Immunoregulation and Tissue Engineering at the University of Southern California, and has lost three book contracts," the motion said. “Dr. Zadeh makes this motion to avoid canceling upcoming speaking events so that he may continue to earn a living and pay his legal fees to defend against the charges in this case."
According to court records, Zadeh is slated to give talks on April 19 in Malaysia, April 21 in Taiwan, May 3 in Canada, and May 31 in France.
“Dr. Zadeh is an internationally respected periodontist, and is not a flight risk," the motion said.

Gun Control Group Flunks 6 Banks for Industry Ties

Texto completo: Gun control activists have spent years trying to limit the number of assault-style firearms available to civilians: holding rallies, drafting proposed laws and backing campaigns by shareholders of publicly traded gun makers.
Now, one advocacy group is focusing on a different pressure point: the consumer banks that provide loans and other financial support to the gun industry.
The group, Guns Down America, which formed in 2016 after a mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., has created a ranking system that gives 15 banks letter grades based primarily on their ties to firearms makers and trade groups like the National Rifle Association.
Six of the banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, received failing grades. Citigroup earned the highest one, a B.
Igor Volsky, Guns Down America's founder and executive director, said he hoped the grading system would compel banks to be more publicly supportive of gun control measures, in the same way that many companies have taken positions on gay rights, immigration and other social issues.
Part of the mission, he added, is stopping "the Wild Wild West of how gun manufacturers both produce military-style weapons and also how they can market those firearms."
"We're not interested in shaming banks or running a campaign focused on how evil they are," Mr. Volsky said. "Our end goal is to change the way banks make decisions when doing business with the gun industry."
The group used a 100-point scale that applied different weights to factors like a bank's loans to and investments in gun makers; its public statements about gun safety; its support for lawmakers backed by the N.R.A.; and the discounts and deals it offers to N.R.A. members.
The basis for the grades was publicly available information gathered from media reports, regulatory documents, campaign finance filings and other sources. Any undisclosed updates to gun-related deals, legal complications that might affect those arrangements and internal discussions were not reflected.
Guns Down America said it had shared its methodology and individual grades with all 15 banks and was involved in continuing talks with some of them, but several banks contacted for comment said that they had not been consulted and that the group had relied on arbitrary metrics.
In the last year, gun safety groups have begun looking more closely at the firearms industry's corporate ties, with the scrutiny leading some businesses to make changes.
After a mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., Delta Air Lines, Hertz and several other companies broke with the N.R.A., and retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods made some guns harder to buy. Influential Wall Street figures like Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, publicly embraced gun safety efforts.
In March, estimated firearm sales in the United States slipped 12.6 percent from a year earlier, to nearly 1.4 million units, according to the research firm Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting.
The financial industry's connections to gun makers have drawn attention before. In December, The New York Times reported that many of the mass shootings in the last decade had been financed with credit cards.
[Read out how banks unwittingly provide financing for mass shootings.]
Some banks have already started to revise their policies and practices on firearms. Citigroup, which earned a score of 84 from Guns Down America, said in March 2018 that it would work only with clients that agreed to certain restrictions on firearm sales.
A short time later, Bank of America said it would stop lending to companies that made military-inspired firearms for civilian use. It was subsequently criticized for its commitment to contribute $43.2 million in bankruptcy financing for Remington.
Bank of America, which did not respond to a request for comment, got a C from Guns Down America.
The six banks that received failing grades all had more than $200 million in recent financial arrangements with gun companies, according to Guns Down America.
The group gave JPMorgan Chase a 48, finding that it had contributed $21,000 to politicians strongly supported by the N.R.A., and had a $273 million financing arrangement with Vista Outdoor. Guns Down America did not specify whether the money was directed only to Vista's gun business, which the company had said it plans to sell.
Marianne Lake, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, said last year that the bank's links to military-style firearms "have come down significantly and are pretty limited." JPMorgan declined to comment on the Guns Down America grade.
BB&T was last on the Guns Down America list. Its score of 20 was partly a result of its arranging $147 million in loans to the industry from 2012 to 2016 and partly a result of its recent involvement in a $78 million revolving credit line for Smith & Wesson, according to the gun control group.
Brian Davis, a spokesman for BB&T, said the bank was "deeply concerned with the increasing amount of gun violence in our schools and communities," and listened to "a wide range of opinions" on gun control. He said the bank did not comment publicly about its financial relationships.
Guns Down America found that Wells Fargo, which fared slightly better at 25 points, had extended $471 million in loans and credit to gun makers since 2012, including a $40 million loan to Sturm Ruger last year. The N.R.A. also uses Wells Fargo, and the bank donated $92,000 to a group of lawmakers supported by the trade group, Guns Down America said.
Trisha Schultz, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in a statement that the bank planned to invest more than $10 million over three years in studying gun-violence prevention and in improving school safety. The bank, she said, has "a small and declining relationship with the N.R.A."
But Ms. Schultz added that "changes to gun laws and regulations should be determined through a legislative process that gives the American public an opportunity to participate and not be arbitrarily set by a bank."
"We do not believe that the American public wants banks to decide which legal products consumers can and cannot buy," she said.

A Florida tragedy

Texto completo: He was wearing a swim suit and a bath robe. His body was hanging in a closet of a rented beach cottage, a red and white belt cinched around his neck.
When he didn’t show up for breakfast at a nearby restaurant, a neighbor went to the house and found him.
John Monk Saunders — Army aviator, author, Rhodes Scholar, magazine editor, Academy Award-winning writer, and recently divorced husband of actress Fay Wray, of “King Kong” fame — was dead at age 42.
“BEACH WRITER HANGS SELF,” screamed the banner Page 1 headline in The Fort Myers News-Press on March 12, 1940. It was front-page news across the country, too.
The small, two-bedroom cottage that Saunders rented in Fort Myers Beach on Florida’s southwest coast was about as far as you could get from Hollywood, where his stories of wartime fliers were turned into classic movies such as “Wings,” which won the first Oscar for best motion picture.
Saunders had been in a tailspin for a long time. Handsome and talented, he was once dubbed the “Golden Boy.” But alcohol, drugs and mood swings began to dominate his personality.
And then there was the way he treated his wife.
King Kong desired Wray’s character so much that he fought off airplanes on top of the Empire State Building. But in real life, Saunders cheated constantly on his wife, neglecting her and saying she bored him. Toward the end of their marriage, he even kidnapped their two-year-old daughter, and spent all her money.
He didn’t leave a suicide note. His life was one long suicide note.
Except to early film fans, Saunders is mostly forgotten, but the sad arc of his life is getting attention again in an excellent new memoir by Wray’s daughter. And few know that if it wasn’t for Saunders, the man many consider Hollywood’s most debonair actor might have a different name.

Fay Wray never forgot the first time she saw Saunders at the gates of Paramount’s studio.
“It was a warm summer afternoon. He was dressed in white flannels, a dark-blue blazer and wore a white Panama hat. I thought he was astonishingly good-looking.”
Wray’s recollection is quoted in her daughter Victoria Riskin’s new book, “Fay Wray and Robert Riskin: A Hollywood Memoir” (Pantheon). In telling the story of Wray’s happier marriage to her father, screenwriter Riskin (“It Happened One Night”), she recounts her childhood surprise at discovering her mother had been wed before.
Saunders and Wray met in 1927. She was 18, a rising star who had never gone on a date. He was ten years older. Wray felt “a current of sensory feeling” when Saunders touched her arm. They fell hard for each other, but he was having an affair with the wife of studio chief Jesse Lasky, and he told her he wasn’t planning to stop.
She married him, anyway.
In her youthful “confusion,” Riskin wrote, she tried to accept a man who drank heavily and blamed his infidelities on being “oversexed.”
On the surface, they were glamour personified. She became an icon for playing the Beauty to King Kong’s Beast. His aviation and underworld tales were turned into movies for legendary directors William Wellman, Josef von Sternberg and Howard Hawks.
Saunders’ pinnacle was winning the Oscar for Best Story for Hawks’ “The Dawn Patrol.” But as his drinking magnified, the work dried up, Riskin wrote.
The couple had brief glimpses of happiness, but then Wray would catch him drunk or with other women. Saunders would make anti-Semitic, pro-Hitler comments. At a party, he decked actor Herbert Marshall, who had lost a leg in World War I, which played badly in the gossip columns.
Wray became pregnant and they had a daughter, Susan, but it didn’t help their relationship.
“John’s decline accelerated,” Riskin wrote. “His pupils were often enlarged, his eyes vacant, his movements bizarrely slowed.”
When she woke up to find him injecting a drug into her, Wray finally asked for a divorce. He retaliated by selling their house and taking all her money.
As she worked to replenish her bank accounts, he kidnapped their daughter for a couple of months and eventually landed in Charlottesville, Va., where he checked into a hospital for “a nervous condition” and had their daughter put in the pediatric unit.
Custody laws favored fathers in Virginia at the time, Riskin wrote, but Wray managed to take Susan back to California and get a divorce. Saunders went for more treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, but finally headed south with a nurse, winding up in Fort Myers.
“For a long time, John had been standing precariously at the abyss,” Riskin wrote. “Now he had reached the dark and lonely end of his journey.”

Saunders was no stranger to Florida. He did his military training here. And it was front page news when he arrived in Fort Myers in February 1940.
“This is Mr. Saunders’ second season at the beach,” the News-Press reported, “which he says is the best place he has found for a rest, as well as the quietude he needs for his working hours.”
He apparently kept to himself, preferring long walks and time alone in his cottage. It was the 1940s version of celebrity rehab. But his nurse departed three days before he was found dead on March 11, and he probably shouldn’t have been left alone.
After his suicide, rumors about a dissolute lifestyle quickly spread, and the paper followed up with another front page story on March 13: “Beach Friends Deny ‘Wild Tales’ About John M. Saunders.”
Local restaurant owners got to know him, including Mrs. Watt Harris, who ran the tea room where he was supposed to show up for breakfast.
“Mr. Saunders was a lovable character,” Mrs. Harris (no first name given in those days) told the News-Press. “He was sensitive and nervous and not in good health and insisted on working long hours. Sometimes he drank too much and then hated himself for doing so.”
Harris said Wray called her soon after his death. According to national news accounts at the time, the actress was “heartbroken,” and had “collapsed.”
“He often told me how proud he was of the fine life and happy times he had lived with Miss Wray,” Harris told the Fort Myers paper. “I don’t know why he wanted to take his life except he was not happy and his work did not make his life complete.
“The only reason I’m saying all this about Mr. Saunders is that some people had spread wild tales,” she added. “He may have had too much to drink for his own good but he was always a gentleman.”
Why did he kill himself? Some trace Saunders’ problems to the fact that he spent World War I in Florida — as a flight instructor instead of in heroic combat. A columnist friend claimed that punching actor Marshall had exiled him from Hollywood, and he couldn’t bear it. Today, his mood swings and drinking might be diagnosed as a bipolar disorder.

Saunders’ abbreviated career remains, at best, a footnote in Hollywood history. In the 1920s and early 1930s, though, his name was big enough that it was a selling point in advertisements for his films.
Perhaps his true claim to fame is a gift he unknowingly gave to a young actor.
In 1931, Saunders wrote his only novel, “Single Lady,” a Lost Generation tale of a French girl and her soldier pals that critics felt was patterned too closely on Hemingway’s writing. It was turned into a Broadway musical called “Nikki.” Despite Wray as the star, it did about as well as the book, closing after 39 performances.
Her leading man in the show was a former acrobat and vaudeville comic with the curious moniker of Archibald Leach. Saunders had named Leach’s character Cary Lockwood.
When Leach went to Hollywood, he needed to change his name to something suitable for a movie star. Fond of Wray and his experience acting with her, he chose the name Cary, then added the last name of Grant. You know the rest.
Until she died at age 96 in 2004, Wray never spoke unkindly about Saunders. When writing her autobiography, she fretted to a New York Times reporter that it was “unfair” to expose his weaknesses.
“How can anyone make a judgment on what other people do?’’ Wray said in that 1989 interview. ‘’It’s just not possible for me. It’s so tragic that John had this theme in his life of living dangerously and dying young.’’
In an interview last month with the Los Angeles Times about her memoir, Victoria Riskin said Wray “didn’t talk a lot about (Saunders) except toward the end of her life. I found in some of her personal notes that she felt she had let him down. She knew she was stronger. She knew she was caring and didn’t find that key to open the door to saving him.
“She felt that she should have been able to help him, and she couldn’t. He was beyond help.”

Texto completo: The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter - and daughter of Johnny - plays the State Theatre on Tuesday.
Singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash has released 15 albums since 1978 and has been nominated for as many Grammy awards, four of which she won. Her most recent record is "She Remembers Everything," released in November, and it's what brings Cash and her band to the State Theatre for a show on Tuesday night.
Cash, 63, is the oldest daughter of Johnny Cash and Vivian Distin.
"She Remembers Everything" is a riveting album of 13 well-crafted, moving songs. The title track includes the lines "My enemy, my treasured friend/Outside this waking dream/She remembers everything." The song was co-penned by Sam Phillips, who also lends backing vocals to the tune, and if her name isn't familiar to you, start with her 1994 album "Martinis & Bikinis."
Another pristine track is the album-opening "The Only Thing Worth Fighting For," which Cash wrote with T Bone Burnett and Lera Lynn. "Waking up is harder than it seems/Wandering through these empty rooms of dusty books and quiet dreams/Pictures on the mantle speak your name/Softly like forgotten tunes, just outside the sound of pain."
Cash's songs criss-cross the genres of country, roots, folk and Americana, and her gorgeous voice has a haunting ache to it. Her discography will keep you busy for a long time, but even if she's new to you, jump right into "She Remembers Everything" because it's tremendous and features guest musicians Colin Meloy (The Decemberists), Elvis Costello, Kris Kristofferson and Phillips.
Along with a multi-decade music career, Cash has authored four books, including the 2010 memoir "Composed," which landed a spot on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list. She has also written essays that have run in The New York Times, Rolling Stone, the Oxford American and the Nation, among several others.
Most recently, Cash wrote a first-person article that ran in the March 23 issue of Billboard magazine. Hands down, it's the most concise account I've ever read about the #MeToo movement as it pertains to the music industry. In it, she speaks of "menacing sexual overtures" made by a male regional label promotions staffer, being grabbed repeatedly in unwelcome ways by men involved with radio, the male rock star who relentlessly pursued her, and the verbal and physical abuse she endured from other renowned male musicians.
The most sobering part of Cash's piece was her saying that the music business wasn't built for women. "We've gained purchase through our own probity and by creating a community. It's time to bring us into the larger community, to make a collective commitment to nourishing creative fire that doesn't incinerate others."
Rosanne Cash is as good as it gets when it comes to making music. But she's also willing to make her voice be heard in other ways and has taken on the role of agent of change. At the end of her State Theatre performance, she'll surely take
a bow. We should return the favor.

Texto completo: Elon Musk has come under recent scrutiny from the SEC for some ill-advised tweets, from shareholders about closing stores, and even paparazzis for his relationship to indie musician Grimes.
Those blows were probably softened by his $2.28 billion compensation last fiscal year from Tesla. That means his compensation is 40,668 times more than the median Tesla worker’s, which is about $56,200, according to Bloomberg.
Tesla has about 48,800 employees, the news outlet reported. The majority of Musk’s total compensation, which would be paid out over 10 years, is in stock options contingent on Tesla hitting several targets for revenue, market value and more, Bloomberg said.
So far, the company has met two of the 16 goals, according to that news organization. Tesla is required to pay Musk at least minimum wage, about $37,000 a year, but he told the New York Times he doesn’t cash the checks and therefore does not receive an annual salary.
Tesla had the largest CEO-to-median worker compensation ratio among public companies in the data analyzed by Bloomberg. However, Musk’s realized compensation last year was $56,380, which would make the CEO to median worker ratio 1-to-1, according to documents Tesla filed with the SEC.
In addition to salaries and stock options, CEO compensation can include bonuses and even additional costs incurred by companies on their bosses’ behalves.
For example, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a salary of just $1 but a total compensation of $8.85 million in fiscal year 2017. That includes $7.3 million for Zuckerberg’s personal security at his Palo Alto home, as well as when he’s traveling, plus $1.5 million for his use of a private airplane, according to a 2018 proxy statement.
Facebook employees had a median compensation of $240,430, so Zuckerberg had a 37-to-1 ratio. That’s far smaller than the median CEO to employee ratio of 137-to-1, according to Bloomberg. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s COO, had total compensation of about $25.2 million in fiscal year 2017, mostly in stock awards, according to the proxy statement.
Twitter’s median employee compensation was lower, $161,860, but their CEO, Jack Dorsey, didn’t take a salary. Dorsey was paid $2.75 by Square, the payment processing company he also runs. Square employees have a median compensation of about $152,300.
Likewise, Alphabet — the company formerly known as Google — paid its CEO Larry Page $1 in fiscal year 2017, the most recent data available from Bloomberg. The median Alphabet employee earned almost $197,300.
Salesforce’s billionaire CEO Marc Benioff had $4.65 million in compensation, and his median employee earned about $155,300 — a 30-to-1 ratio. Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation was $15.68 million, a 238-to-1 ratio to the tech giant’s median employee, who earned about $55,400.

Texto completo: E-cigarettes are fueling a rise in the use of tobacco products by young people, says the Centers for Disease Control. A new report finds that, in 2018, 4.9 million middle and high school students reported using a tobacco product in the past month, up from 3.6 million in 2017.
E-cigarettes were actually the only type of tobacco product that saw an uptick in use.
More than 20% of high schoolers and 5% of middle schoolers said they had vaped in the past month.

Just the Yaks, Please
According to The New York Times, the strands of hair on the head of President Donald Trump's wax replica at Madame Tussauds in New York City are a mix of human and yak. His eyebrows come from squirrel.

Get Me That, Stat!
The CDC reports that roughly 15% (37 million) of the U.S. adult population is affected by chronic kidney disease, which means the organs are damaged and can't filter blood the way they should. About 1 in 3 adults with diabetes and 1 in 5 adults with high blood pressure are estimated to have CKD. Managing blood sugar and blood pressure levels helps protect the kidneys, but 9 in 10 adults with CKD don't even know they have CKD.

Stories for the Waiting Room
Google Translate is supposed to convert text from one language to another, presumably with pretty good accuracy. So how well does it work translating a doctor's written instructions? Researchers used Google to translate 100 sets of emergency discharge instructions. Google Translate was 92% accurate translating from English to Spanish and 81% accurate in English to Chinese.
But in 2% of the Spanish translations and 8% of the Chinese, the researchers said the result had the potential to harm patients. Case in point: A doctor wrote that a patient should "hold the kidney medicine," which translated into Spanish as "keep the medication" and into Chinese as "keep taking."

I always want to be eating meatballs at Anchovies

Texto completo: God knows I love a restaurant where the pasta is made from hand-milled flour and the service is as polished as the decor and I feel like maybe I'm in Italy, not Boston at all. But then I also love a restaurant — I probably love this restaurant even more — that has been around forever, that has a crowded bar and eccentric regulars and dark wood booths bathed in the glow of the fruit-themed stained-glass lights overhead.
I always want to be eating meatballs at Anchovies.
At this South End institution (it's impossible to write about the place without using that phrase), the drinks are strong, the food is laced with garlic and ladled with marinara, and each main course comes with an old-school house salad on the side. There are always specials — a lasagna of the night, maybe made with ground beef and spinach; baked ziti with chicken, hot sausage, smoked mozzarella, and an array of vegetables. You could order an appetizer of burrata with tomatoes and basil, or a chopped salad, but let's be honest: Your table is going to want the Italian nachos, a pile of crisp corn chips topped with braised short-rib ragu, ricotta, and pepperoncini. It's a comical cultural adaptation, and it's delicious.
The linguine with meatballs and the chicken parm offer a satisfaction so predictable it's soothing, but there are also sleeper hits on the menu. A friend ordered the chicken marsala with penne recently, and I silently doubted this decision, and then it came and it was also satisfying. You can get linguine with littlenecks either in a white wine and garlic butter sauce or with marinara, and there is no wrong choice; the steaming bowl arrives with another bowl plonked on top of the pasta, to be removed and used as a receptacle for the shells. The food here is both better than it has to be and not so good that it distracts you from the business of having some drinks and being with your people.
Those people might be anyone. There are customers of all social stations and ages, sports bros and students and gay couples and townies. The kitchen is open until 1:30 a.m., and the later it gets, the more it feels like bizarro world Cheers, the brick walls hung with taxidermy, old signs, and assorted bric-a-brac. There's always a crush of regulars at the ornately carved mahogany bar. “Oh my God! You should have called me. I would have reserved a seat for you," a bartender says to someone trying to squeeze in. I spot a woman I once did jury duty with at a table with her entire extended family, multiple generations having dinner together. I brought my son here when he was a toddler. Anchovies was my friends' regular date night going back decades . They came for the dry martinis, and in truth they stayed for the dry martinis, but the reasonably priced food and warm welcome never hurt.
It is nice to be able still to go out for dinner and a beer in the South End for less than $50. All of the entrees here cost $18. For most customers, this probably just seems like a deal. For the Jew pilgrimaging to Anchovies, it is auspicious: In gematria, the Hebrew system of numerology, 18 is significant because it's the sum of the letters that spell “chai," or life; Jews often give gifts or donations in $18 increments. I am entirely willing to pay my bill that way, and to believe that Anchovies is some kind of mystical vortex, where all comers are welcome and time is elastic.
Because they don't make them like this anymore, kiddo. Anchovies feels like the old South End, or an old South End, the one I think of as the real iteration of this neighborhood — a quirkier, gayer place with less money and more artists; the one where I once went to a wild party at a space called the Cloud Club, where Amanda Palmer played in the courtyard garden, and at the top of the building there was a glass dome filled with cushions you could lie on and look out at the surrounding rooftops. This is nostalgia speaking, I know. Ada Calhoun is the author of “St. Marks Is Dead," a history of the New York street she grew up on: “If you're complaining about the East Village, or New York in general, being dead, I think it's worth considering the possibility that, yes, it is over — for you," she once wrote in The New York Times. “But for plenty of others, the city is as full of potential and magic as it was in 1977. Or 1964. Or 1992. Or whenever you last walked down the street and felt like it belonged only to you."
I can still go to Anchovies. I can still go to the Delux. You know what I really miss? Pho Republique. I guess the food was good, but I don't remember it with any clarity — there were ribs we liked, I think? What I remember is that it was dark in there, that what light there was had a reddish cast, that you could be there comfortably even when you didn't want to be seen. It felt like home, and it practically was: At one point I lived in the building overhead, and when I called down for takeout, I felt like Eloise.
Some restaurants, once they're gone, you miss like characters in the story of your life. May Anchovies never disappear. I just couldn't take the meatball-size hole in my heart.

Texto completo: The third season of "This Is Us" comes to a close. And "The Last O.G." returns for a second run.
What's on TV
THIS IS US 9 p.m. on NBC. This is the end ... for now. (Spoiler alert!) Last week's episode chronicled the ups and downs Beth (Susan Kelechi Watson) and Randall (Sterling K. Brown) endured to stick together. Back in the present, the couple had an explosive falling-out in which each said some cruel things. Whether that portends the end of their marriage is the crux of this season finale. As for the fate of the show, a fourth season hasn't been announced. But the creator, Dan Fogelman, remains hopeful: In an interview with Deadline in February, he said, "Next season is a season of new beginnings and restarts."
AMERICAN SOUL 9 p.m. on BET. The first season of this scripted series on "Soul Train" wraps up with the members of Encore confronting personal hurdles as they inch closer to musical stardom.
THE LAST O.G. 10:30 p.m. on TBS. This feel-good comedy series returns with the former convict Tray (Tracy Morgan) taking his dreams of becoming a chef to a new level. In this Season 2 premiere, Tray asks his ex-girlfriend Shay (Tiffany Haddish) to show him their twins' birth video, and her search for it takes her down memory lane. The show had a rocky start, but Morgan delivered "a rich performance," James Poniewozik wrote in his review in The New York Times. He adds that Morgan "still has the blustery bravado he showed on '30 Rock,' but he's slowed a few beats, which helps him pull off the bittersweet aspects of the role."
What's Streaming
A QUIET PLACE (2018) Stream on Amazon or Hulu. This gripping horror film may not have won an Oscar, but it racked up a few awards for its sound editing and screenplay. It's the second feature film by John Krasinski, who also stars, and it imagines a post-apocalyptic place where a family must live in silence among blind monsters who navigate by sound. Noise is a central feature here, so be sure to turn up the volume.
KEVIN HART: IRRESPONSIBLE (2019) Stream on Netflix. Given that the Oscars have come and gone, is this new special a comeback? A shot at redemption? Or just a sign that Kevin Hart hopes the world is over the mess? The comic was announced as the host of the 2019 Academy Awards last December. When several of his past comments that were considered homophobic resurfaced, Hart stepped down from the role and apologized. The matter dragged on for weeks, and overshadowed the release of the dramedy "The Upside," in which he stars alongside Bryan Cranston. Now Hart is back with this stand-up special filmed at the O2 Arena in London. He jumps right into bits on his three children, his second marriage and why he despises amusement parks. (There's no mention of the award show that shall not be named.)

Texto completo: During a crucial time for the public to remain informed and aware of political news in the United States, many citizens are finding a challenge in chasing Washington's latest headlines.
In recent years, Twitter has emerged as the most expansive (and sometimes explosive) public forum for political debate — a hub for insider discussion among journalists and the readers that depend on them for analysis and coverage.
Staying ahead of investigations, candidates and national news has evolved into a daunting process, even for people accustomed to life at the speed of the Internet.
"It acts like an addiction," said Jim Rutenberg, media columnist for The New York Times.
Rutenberg's column, Mediator, is a continuing study of how technology and journalism intersect.
"Social media feeds on itself, and I think that is part and parcel with the discussion on iPhone addiction," said Rutenberg. "People really seem to be addicted to the dopamine they get from the feeds."
Rutenberg has written at length about his complicated relationship with smartphones and the natural draw towards endless streams of news and reactions, including a December 2018 article titled, "The Effects Cannot Be Overstated: When Tech Invaded Media".
"It's about what people want," said Rutenberg when asked about the effects of social networks on readers. "Are people willing to slow down and think and absorb? Right now, the culture is moving away from that. There needs to be a cultural corrective, and it's only going to happen if people really concentrate on doing it. It's not going to happen organically, because everything is so powerfully moving in the other direction."
One of the people working on that cultural corrective is Judd Legum, a journalist and former campaign staffer who founded ThinkProgress, a news project based out of the Center for American Progress. In the summer of 2018, Legum left ThinkProgress and began authoring Popular Information, a newsletter offering concise reports on the latest in politics.
"I like the idea of a daily newsletter where that's part of the purpose," said Legum. "I'm trying to look at what's going on and pick out one or two things that I think are really important and distill it down for readers."
Billed as "a newsletter about politics for people who give a damn," Popular Information is delivered to over 48,000 subscribers once a week, with paid supporters receiving additional updates more frequently throughout each week.
Popular Information is an example of a direct subscription model allowing writers to focus on content that matters, backed by the confidence of an engaged audience.
"I feel good about it, I think the model is good and all the incentives are aligned," said Legum. "People will subscribe if they feel like they're getting something meaningful and valuable from it, and that gives me the right incentives to work hard and try to get something useful for people."
Newsletters are not a new trend, and some industry experts see their resurgence in popularity as the result of social media fatigue and information overload.
"I think people realize the kind of information you get from social media is piece-meal compared to the curation and comprehension you can get from email," said Christine Schmidt, a staff writer at the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University.
The Nieman Lab is an online publication focused on tracking how journalism has changed as an industry in the Internet age.
"Social media is still valuable for connections, free-time pleasure and intrigue, but email newsletters are more authoritative and direct," said Schmidt. "Social media is what the algorithms recommend serving you, and email newsletters are what you specifically ask to be served."
This balance between sharp reporting in the form of longer newsletters and quick-witted discussion on social networks has also become a major part of Legum's work.
"I think tools like Twitter can be a good way of learning about what's going on in the world, but it's less practical for folks that are busy and have other things to do with their time during the day," said Legum. "I do both now (Twitter and Popular Information), and they kind of feed into each other to a certain extent. There is a lot of chatter on Twitter, but there's also a lot of good back and forth with readers in an email newsletter. People will write in and I think people have a different approach, you get a lot of very thoughtful commentary coming back and that's something that I appreciate about the format."
A reader's undivided attention has become much more difficult to capture, and for writers the option to deliver directly to an audience with confirmed interest in their work has led to a refreshing experience for many journalists struggling to cut through the noise.
"When you produce content for the internet you can often feel you are putting it into the void," said Schmidt. "When you send an email, you are putting it directly in someone's inbox. Because email is something that subscribers opt into, it can help diminish that feeling of 'how many likes will this get,' 'oh hey this is going viral,' 'I'm gonna take this down because no one reacted to it,' etc."
As Popular Information nears its one year anniversary, Legum plans to continue using the platform he has built to reach an engaged and active readership directly.
"I think one of the good things about newsletters is that readers make a decision to receive them," said Legum. "It's not mediated by a technology company... I think people need to make more intentional choices about how they consume media and where they get their information."
Both Schmidt and Legum agree that whether readers consume the news through email, social media or other avenues is secondary to their main goal as journalists: to inform and enable the voting public, especially as the 2020 presidential election is starting to take shape.
"The best way to be effective is to actually vote," said Schmidt. "And the second best-way is to discuss the issues with people around you. And 'around you' can be virtually or physically, having conversations privately or publicly on social media in addition to in person. You can learn more about other's point of view and also take the time to think through your own position as well. Many reputable news outlets have newsletters about the 2020 races, but often local media can help you stay informed on the issues closest to you, on social media or email."

As Russia looks for influence in Africa, Venezuela should be a lesson for Washington

Texto completo: Russian backing of illegitimate Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has stymied local and international efforts to oust him from power. As Russia expands its influence across the African continent, Moscow's meddling in Latin America should serve as a warning to Washington.

In Venezuela, Russia essentially traded arms and military support for oil. As Maduro's government has lost domestic and international backing, Russia stepped up its support, landing troops and equipment even as Maduro continued to starve his own people and preside over what can only be described as economic chaos.

As Russia has made clear that it has no intention of backing down, the U.S. is only starting to realize the consequences of Moscow’s strategy. Russian President Vladimir Putin has successfully purchased influence, giving him leverage over Maduro and, as long he remains in power, access to the country’s oil reserves and a troublesome foothold for Russian interests in Latin America.

But Venezuela is far from the only country that Putin has found willing to give Moscow considerable influence in exchange for Russian weapons. As the New York Times reported, deals with Russia have proliferated in the Central African Republic, Burkina Faso, and Libya among other countries.

In the Central African Republic, for example, a Russian national is currently serving as a national security adviser to the president, valuable mining resources have been traded for Russian arms and Russia has shipped weapons and advisers to train the country’s military.

In other countries, Russia seems to have bet on resources-for-arms deals as a way to undercut not only local control over economic decision but also to give Russia regional power against U.S. investment and diplomatic relations with leaders. As such deals along with the shadowy presence of Russian security firm, the Wagner Group, turn up across the continent, Washington is right to be worried.

Although those deals might seem far from U.S. interests, our recent experience with Russia meddling in Venezuela demonstrates otherwise. Such investments are not innocuous and clear-cut trade deals. Instead, they further Moscow’s clear interest in resource extraction and development of regional influence and political and economic power.

Cache Of Moon Samples To Be Unsealed For Study

Texto completo: Later this year, NASA will reveal never-before-seen morsels of the moon, the agency announced recently.
The astronauts of the Apollo missions that landed on the moon from 1969 to 1972 collected 842 pounds’ worth of lunar rocks, core samples, pebbles, sand and dust. Many of those samples were later opened on the ground. But three have remained sealed - their contents stashed away for nearly 50 years.
They were intentionally saved for a time when more advanced technology would allow planetary scientists on Earth to delve deeper into the moon’s mysteries.
“The technology available in the ’60s and ’70s wasn’t able to do what we can do now,” said Jessica Barnes, an astronomer soon to join the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. “Now we can go to a mineral and we can look at the very fine details, down to almost the width of a human hair.”
In a year marking the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, and with U.S. space priorities shifting toward a return to the moon, NASA has at last decided that it’s time to open the long-locked samples. The agency selected nine teams to study the moon rocks in detail.
For the past decade, Charles Shearer, a scientist at the University of New Mexico, has pressed NASA to unseal the rocks. He was thrilled by the news: “We are completing the Apollo mission adventure after 50 years, using new types of measurements and new views of our moon.”
Darby Dyar, a scientist at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, agreed. She first studied lunar samples in 1979, as an undergraduate, and has come full circle as a leader of one of the selected teams.
Dyar and her colleagues will scour materials from Apollo 15, 16 and 17, searching for yellow, orange and green glass beads roughly the size of a grain of salt. Those beads formed when the droplets within fire fountains - picture an Old Faithful of lava - hit the lunar atmosphere and cooled.
“Imagine spraying a squirt gun of hot lava,” Dyar said. “Because the droplets are so tiny, they cool immediately.”
And those cooled droplets, or glass beads, are a treasure trove for scientists. They provide a window into the interior of the moon and could answer fundamental questions about how our nearest neighbor evolved.
Clive Neal, a scientist at the University of Notre Dame who will work with Shearer on another team, said that preparing for future missions to the moon makes it important to open the lunar samples now.
“We did have the technology 10 years ago, but we didn’t have the drive,” Neal said. “Now, we’re going back to the moon, and we need to use lunar resources in order to do it sustainably.”
That was made possible in 2008, when scientists discovered that the moon was not bone dry, but contained water. With water, future astronauts might be able to quench their thirst, and they also will be able to split its molecules into oxygen, to breathe, and liquid hydrogen, to refill their fuel tanks - thus helping sustain a lunar outpost.

Texto completo: This writer must admit: He's really not a big fan of April Fools' Day.
Maybe it was because of some of the (relatively speaking) traumatic experiences he had as a kid. The Easter Bunny prank really hit home, mom. He's also not creative enough to pull off some of the gags that were put out there Monday.
Yes, it's that time of year again, another sign of spring — perhaps not as appreciated as baseball's opening day or the year's first beach day, but it's there.
We look at some of the more interesting ruses out there. (Tom Brady's arrival on Twitter isn't among them.)
There's a snake on the screen! For xennials like me, seeking Snake pop up on Google Maps is a great moment. (It was a fixture of Nokia's T9 phones, back in the 1G days when it took 45 seconds to compose a text.) There are plenty of Snake apps out there, but the nostalgia is strong here.
You have a choice of wandering through different cities or just across the globe; the object is to pick up as many passengers as possible, and there are special bonus items (for instance, the Eiffel Tower in Paris).
It's available on the iOS and Android platforms, but if you're chained to the desk click here to access it.
It's not the first time Google has created a version of Snake.
I spent about five minutes playing before I remembered that I have to work, but don't tell my boss.
New York, new restaurants? The City of Angels has a burgeoning dining and cultural scene, or so The New York Times claimed in travel and business pieces over the years.
But to Los Angeles residents, some of the Times coverage was tone deaf and cliched.
The Los Angeles Times decided April 1, 2019, was the day to return fire.
“A weekend spent in the 'city so nice they named it twice' leads this writer to recommend, rightly or wrongly, that food enthusiasts consider paying a visit to New York (The Big Apple in local jargon)," wrote food critic Lucas Kwan Peterson.
Not the only (dog) show in town Tennis's US Open is giving the Westminster Dog Show a run for its money.
No breed snobbery here, US Tennis Association officials say; all are welcome.
Dunk this Dunkin' is Boston, so we have to at least mention this.
Go now, please Ah, the far-reaching ramifications of Brexit.
The Eurovision Song Contest is considered that continent's “American Idol." Like “Idol," it has its fans and detractors.
Britain has had five winners, but it may not have any more, according to The Daily Express.
The replies to that tweet were overwhelmingly positive. “I always knew something good would come of Brexit," read one tweet.
'Say goodbye to height fishing' Tinder's height-verification tool isn't real, after all.
But oh, if it were.
“It's come to our attention that most of you 5'10ers out there are actually 5'6. The charade must stop," Tinder posted on its blog.
“This type of dishonestly doesn't just hurt your matches — it hurts us, too."

What will Democrats do with Mueller report?

Texto completo: When, on May 17, 2017, the Justice Department named former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel to oversee the investigation into the Trump campaign and possible collusion with the Russians, The New York Times virtually hailed it as a triumph of democracy. Mueller was described in the most glowing of terms with words like "unblemished," "credible," "exacting," and as a man "who is credited with building the modern FBI."
For more than 675 days, we have been subjected to a steady drip of leaks, endless Russia collusion coverage and the suggestion that Trump was the Manchurian — ur, I mean, the Russian — candidate who was sent to assassinate American democracy as we know it. Whenever there was no news on the Mueller front, we could always expect Stormy Daniels to be given extensive coverage. Mueller's investigation into Trump's alleged wrongdoing would be the long-awaited answer to Hillary Clinton's book, "What Happened."
Only it wasn't.
Or, more precisely, it was; it just wasn't the answer Democrats wanted — or should I say, it wasn't the answer Democrats needed? On the same day that Mueller was appointed special counsel, Trump issued this: "As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know — there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity."
Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller report indicates this is precisely what happened, which is highly problematic for Democrats. Having put their proverbial eggs in the Russia collusion basket, the Mueller report is an anticlimactic ending to an epic buildup.
Mueller's integrity comes back to bite And this is where it gets uncomfortable for Democrats. Because they have continually endorsed Mueller as the font of integrity ruthlessly searching for the truth, it now becomes more than a little awkward to condemn the results of his investigation. What do they do now?
For the moment, Democrats appear to have a two-pronged strategy:
First, launch yet another Trump investigation. "The Mueller report is one document," declared Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia. "It is not, however, the final word on ongoing investigations, criminal or otherwise." Reps. Maxine Waters of California and Eliot Engel of New York remain equally defiant.
Second, they are attacking Attorney General Barr for not releasing the full report. This enables them to continue doing what they have done throughout the Mueller investigation: Hint that the Trump campaign did indeed do something sinister, but it just hasn't been revealed to the public. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler is, for instance, already suggesting a "cover-up."
Both strategies are inherently risky.
Defense strategies could crack wide open In the first instance, Democrats run the risk of giving Trump victim status by appearing to be on a witch hunt. If Mueller found nothing on this president after more than $25 million, two years of investigation and 34 indictments, the public may deem that enough.
In the second instance, the strategy can work only so long as the attorney general does not release the report or, if he does, it is found to contain the hoped-for smoking gun. If, however, Barr releases the report — a prospect Trump says "wouldn't bother me at all" — and his summary proves to be accurate enough, this strategy fails, too.
With the nuclear option off the table for now at least, Democrats are suddenly on the defensive and their strategy appears to be as cracked as the Liberty Bell. For them, the order of the day is damage control. Just how deep the damage runs remains to be seen.
They might have unwittingly ensured Trump's re-election.

Texto completo: Concord Community Music School is proud to welcome two accomplished teaching artists to its faculty: mezzo soprano Jazimina MacNeil, and fiddler Jordan Tirrell-Wysocki.

Jazimina MacNeil, mezzo soprano, received her Bachelor of Music degree from the Manhattan School of Music and Master of Music degree from the Curtis Institute of Music. Called “clearly a singer to watch” by the New York Times, her recent performances include concerts with the Apple Hill string quartet, a solo recital with the Sideman Projekt in Berlin, a Verdi Requiem with the Brattleboro Concert Choir, a Mozart Requiem with the Albany Symphony, and the Winners Recital of the Liederkranz Competition in Weill Hall at Carnegie Hall. Since moving to New Hampshire, she has become active with a number of Monadnock area musical organizations and will be performing with the Boston Lyric Opera in April 2019. Jazimina's enthusiastic, joyful teaching style is influenced by her study of the Alexander Technique and yoga, with a focus on freeing the body and breath to free the voice. She is endlessly thrilled by the process of discovery, and no matter what kind of day her students are having, she wants them to leave their lesson feeling lighter, more energized, and inspired by their own capabilities.
Jordan Tirrell-Wysocki is an award-winning fiddler who grew up playing dances and concerts around New England. He was first recognized as part of New Hampshire's culture at the age of 12, when he was the youngest member of the delegation representing the state at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. He has toured nationally with bands in various genres, performed across Ireland, and released multiple recordings of Celtic music that can be heard on radio stations around New England and in the British Isles. He has also written soundtracks for audiobooks and television and appeared as a guest on more than 75 albums. He performs about 200 shows each year with multiple groups, mostly with his own project, the Jordan TW Trio. In 2013, Tirrell-Wysocki was awarded the title of “Master Artist” by the N.H. State Council on the Arts, and named “Best Fiddler 2016” by N.H. Magazine. When not on the road, he teaches in Concord and cohosts the family-friendly Irish Night every Thursday at the legendary Stone Church Meeting House in Newmarket.
Jazimina and Jordan are now accepting new students for spring; all musical abilities are welcome, and tuition will be prorated based on the number of weeks remaining in the semester. Please call 228-1196 for information or to register. More information at ccmusicschool.org.

Are you a United States citizen?
By Manny Fernandez in McAllen, Tex.
Here in Texas, America has two southern borders. I live 10 miles from one, 60 miles from the other.
The first border is the one you know about: the tall steel barrier you see on the news, the physical and symbolic line that is patrolled, topped with razor-wire and debated.
The second is well north of that, and it has been quietly setting Southwestern cities apart from the rest of America for years. This other "border" is the line of federal traffic checkpoints that operate up to 100 miles north of the existing fence. There are more than 30 permanent Border Patrol checkpoints across Arizona, California, Texas and New Mexico.
More than the fence line, the checkpoint line is in many ways the true border wall -- more undocumented immigrants die trying to circumvent the checkpoints than they do trying to get around the fence, and many fear the checkpoints more than they fear the fence. Every day, hundreds of thousands of people who pull up to these checkpoints have to do something other Americans in other cities don't have to do on the highway: Answer a uniformed officer's question about whether they are a United States citizen.
These checkpoints were suddenly in the news this week, after the Border Patrol took the rare step of temporarily closing some of them in the El Paso region and in New Mexico. Border Patrol officials said they did it in response to the influx of Central American families seeking asylum. Agents working those checkpoints are being diverted elsewhere to help process the migrants that officials said are overwhelming their resources along the border.
"Two weeks ago, I briefed the media and testified in Congress that our immigration system was at the breaking point," the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Kevin K. McAleenan, told reporters in El Paso on Wednesday. "That breaking point has arrived this week at our border." There were a total of 13,400 migrants in custody along the border Wednesday morning, he said. "A high number for us is 4,000. A crisis level is 6,000. Thirteen thousand is unprecedented."
The closures have brought the checkpoints back into the national spotlight and have raised a host of questions. The Border Patrol has pumped a considerable amount of time, taxpayer money and personnel into these inland checkpoints, designed to intercept any drugs or unauthorized migrants that might have made it through the main ports of entry.
When I visited one of the busiest checkpoints on the border in 2015 -- located in the middle of South Texas ranchlands near the town of Falfurrias on Highway 281 -- a Border Patrol official told me: "Without the checkpoints, then you have narcotics and people just coming straight up the highways."
One must presume those narcotics and people are coming straight up the highways now in the parts of Texas and New Mexico where the checkpoints are now closed -- for all the talk of toughened border security.
Last month, I moved temporarily from Houston to the South Texas city of McAllen to help expand The New York Times's coverage of the border. I can't drive north back to Houston without passing a checkpoint, and I can't pass a checkpoint until I roll down my window and answer a Border Patrol agent's question: "Are you a U.S. citizen?"
Sometimes the agents ask me where I'm headed, and on at least one occasion they asked me to pop the trunk. Once, an agent joked about the Barbie and "Trolls" stickers my 6-year-old daughter had stuck on a back window. Another time, one of the Border Patrol dogs that sniff the vehicles responded to something in my trunk, and I had to pull over for a secondary inspection (which proved uneventful).
In a nation where police stop-and-frisk tactics are the subject of much debate, Americans who live on the border have normalized government intrusion.
"It's destabilizing to the people who live in these regions, in subtle ways, nuanced ways," said Francisco Cantú, a former Border Patrol agent who is the author of "The Line Becomes a River," a memoir. "I think it's part of creating the 'state of exception,' creating this idea that the borderland is somehow 'other' -- other than the regular full United States."
The interactions at the checkpoints don't always go as smoothly as mine have. Numerous motorists and activists who have refused to answer the citizenship question have posted videos of the encounters on YouTube. One video shows a California teacher at a New Mexico checkpoint as she questioned an agent's authority to stop her. Agents in those situations usually make reference to U.S. v. Martinez-Fuerte, the 1976 Supreme Court ruling that established that vehicle stops at the checkpoints were consistent with the Fourth Amendment's restrictions on unreasonable search and seizure.
One thing I often wonder: I was born in Fresno, Calif., but would I get questioned as often at the checkpoints if I weren't Mexican-American? Several white friends and colleagues have told me that agents have waved them through without questioning their citizenship status. That doesn't happen to me. I've passed through several Border Patrol checkpoints in Texas dozens of times. I get asked whether I'm an American citizen, every single time.
Manny is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently reporting from the border. Each week they're sharing a slice of their reporting about the border and the people who spend time on both sides of it .

Quote of the week
"This is me, this is who I really am. When I get out of here, I transform."
-- Jess Enriquez Taylor
Ms. Taylor, a transgender woman who is Mexican and grew up in the United States, was the subject of a recent story by Jose A. Del Real. In Mexico, her family expects her to dress as a man, but in the United States, she has the freedom to live and dress as a woman. Rather than go back to Mexico regularly, she chooses to be homeless in America. Read Jose's full story about Ms. Taylor here.
Read the latest on: the border wall
The president wants a wall. Many in Congress do not.
The fight over how much funding should go to expanding the nation's border barriers, if any, led to the longest shutdown in United States history. And when the government finally reopened in January, the fate of the president's wall seemed as confusing as ever.
Here's a look at what has happened since then and what's likely to happen next:
On Tuesday, the House of Representatives came up short in an attempt to override the president's veto of an earlier House vote rebuking him for declaring a national emergency at the southern border. That allowed the president's declaration of a national emergency at the southern border to stand. Read the full story here.
Here's how every member of the House voted.
The debate over the emergency declaration now turns to the courts, where a coalition of more than a dozen states filed lawsuits last month challenging its legal merits.
This week, the acting defense secretary authorized the transfer of up to $1 billion toward the construction of 57 miles of border wall and other related projects. That money was separate from the emergency declaration, and military leaders around the country are mindful that local construction projects -- fire station repairs, new schools and training complexes -- may soon see their funding cut or delayed to help pay for the wall. Read more about those projects here.

D.E.A. Tracked Who Bought Money-Counters

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Drug Enforcement Administration secretly collected data in bulk about Americans' purchases of money-counting machines -- and took steps to hide the effort from defendants and courts -- before quietly shuttering the program in 2013 amid the uproar over the disclosures by the National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, an inspector general report found.
Seeking leads about who might be a drug trafficker, the D.E.A. started in 2008 to issue blanket administrative subpoenas to vendors to learn who was buying money counters. The subpoenas involved no court oversight and were not pegged to any particular investigation. The agency collected tens of thousands of records showing the names and addresses of people who bought the devices.
The public version of the report, which portrayed the program as legally questionable, blacked out the device whose purchase the D.E.A. had tracked. But in a slip-up, the report contained one uncensored reference in a section about how D.E.A. policy called for withholding from official case files the fact that agents first learned the names of suspects from its database of its money-counter purchases.
That instruction, it said, "was intended to protect the program's sources and methods; criminals would obtain money counters by other means if they knew that the D.E.A. collected this data."
A preamble said the D.E.A. and the inspector general worked together on redactions, and press officers for both declined to comment on the inadvertent disclosure. The D.E.A., which is an arm of the Justice Department, provided a statement responding to the inspector general's findings, pledging fealty to the rule of law while citing "the importance of protecting the techniques and procedures that D.E.A. agents rely upon to protect our nation."
The report cited field offices' complaints that the program had wasted time with a high volume of low-quality leads, resulting in agents scrutinizing people "without any connection to illicit activity." But the D.E.A. eventually refined its analysis to produce fewer but higher-quality leads, and the D.E.A. said it had led to arrests and seizures of drugs, guns, cars and illicit cash.
The idea for the nationwide program originated in a D.E.A. operation in Chicago, when a subpoena for three months of purchase records from a local store led to two arrests and "significant seizures of drugs and related proceeds," it said.
But Sarah St. Vincent, a Human Rights Watch researcher who flagged the slip-up on Twitter, argued that it was an abuse to suck Americans' names into a database that would be analyzed to identify criminal suspects, based solely upon their purchase of a lawful product.
Ms. Vincent, who wrote a report last year criticizing "parallel construction" -- the practice of concealing an intelligence program by reobtaining the same data, through a traditional targeted subpoena or other measures, to submit it as court evidence -- also flagged a 2008 email cited in the report in which a D.E.A. official wrote, "Unless a federal court tells us we can't do this, I think we can continue this project."
Because the D.E.A. was hiding the program, she pointed out, no judge would have an opportunity to evaluate it.
The report described a cursory review by D.E.A. lawyers but said the agency never developed a comprehensive analysis for why it was lawful for it to use the statute that authorized administrative subpoenas to obtain bulk records. The statute permits gathering records that are "relevant or material" to a drug investigation. Citing the D.E.A.'s "uniquely expansive use" of this subpoena authority, the report called that failure "troubling."
In the spring of 2013, the report said, the D.E.A. submitted its database to a joint operations hub where law enforcement agencies working together on organized crime and drug enforcement could mine it. But F.B.I. agents questioned whether the data had been lawfully acquired, and the bureau banned its officials from gaining access to it.
The F.B.I. agents "explained that running all of these names, which had been collected without foundation, through a massive government database and producing comprehensive intelligence products on any 'hits,' which included detailed information on family members and pictures, 'didn't sit right,"' the report said.
Then, in June 2013, Mr. Snowden leaked a trove of files from the N.S.A., bringing to light that the agency was collecting Americans' domestic calling records in bulk -- and setting off an uproar.
An intelligence court had secretly blessed the N.S.A. effort under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which similarly permitted the government to collect records that were "relevant" to a counterterrorism investigation. A federal appeals court in New York later rejected that interpretation of the law, and Congress ended that practice and replaced it with the USA Freedom Act in 2015.
Other bulk data collection or exploitation programs existed. The New York Times reported in November 2013 that the C.I.A. was using the same law to collect bulk records of international money transfers handled by companies like Western Union -- including transactions into and out of the United States.
And the inspector general report also addressed two other D.E.A. programs that focused on call records, and whose existence was already public.
The first is the Hemisphere Project, which The Times first reported in September 2013. It has involved AT&T analyzing its vast database of historical logs about Americans' phone calls on behalf of counterdrug agents. A section of the report that discusses what appears to be Hemisphere -- its name is redacted -- says it is still operating.
The other was a D.E.A. program that used administrative subpoenas to collect bulk logs of outgoing international phone calls from the United States to countries linked to drug trafficking. The Justice Department disclosed its existence, which began in the first Bush administration, in a 2015 court filing, and it was later the subject of a detailed report by USA Today. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had ordered the D.E.A. to shut it down in September 2013 -- the same time it shuttered the money-counter purchase records program.

Texto completo: A special visitor showed up several days ago at 930 E. 50th St., a former synagogue now known in Chicago and beyond as the headquarters of Rainbow/Push, Rev. Jesse Jackson's civil rights organization.
Over two days, Saturday and Monday, the visitor, "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett, spoke with high school students who were thinking about college. He hawked civil rights gear at the upstairs bookstore.
For Smollett, the visit may have been an opportunity as well.
In explaining its decision to drop all charges Tuesday against Smollett, who had been accused of faking a hate crime attack, the Cook County state's attorney's office noted Smollett had no history of violent orime or other felonies, his agreement to forfeit his $10,000 bond payment and his "volunteer service in the community."
The statement raised several ques:icns, including whether the community service was part of a deal to end the case. It also left many wondering: just what service had Smollett done?
A batch of letters and memos from various organizations, released by the state's attorney's office, provided some answers.
They mentioned performances that Smollett, who is also a singer, had done at the national conference of the Kennedy Forum, an organization run by former Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy that focuses on mental health; appearances at the Catalyst Circle Rock School, a predominantly black charter school in Chicago; and work with the City Lights Orchestra, the Boys & Girls Club and the Black AIDS Institute.
And Saturday, as his legal team was finalizing talks with prosecutors about dropping the case, Smollett turned up at Rainbow/ Push.
Smollett, who is Black and gay, had been accused of falsifying a hate crime to get attention in a bid for a higher salary from "Empire." Smollett maintains his innocence, saying he nad not planned the attack he reported to police Jan. 29. Prosecutors said their decision aid not exonerate him, but the circumstances of the case, as well as the $10.000 payment and the community service, justified the dropping of the charges.
In an interview Wednesday, Jackson said Smollett had volunteered with Rainbow/Push in the past.
Tina Glandian, one of Smollett's lawyers, disputed the notions he had escaped prosecution by helping out with Jackson's group.
"It was not compulsory whatsoever," Glandian said. "Him volunteering for the Push Coalition is completely in line with his years of service." - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: Mientras Donald Trump recorría el país intentando convertirse en presidente, sus hijos viajaban en ocasiones al sur de Florida en avión y eran recibidos en el aeropuerto por un miembro de su equipo de seguridad, Zoltan Tamas, armado con pistola, que los conducía seguros hasta el campo de golf que la familia posee en Jupiter, a 80 millas al norte de Miami.
Tamas, de 38 años, había emigrado legalmente desde Rumanía en 2011. Logró la residencia permanente, pagaba sus impuestos, y se compró una casa.
Pero desde hace ocho meses está encerrado en un centro de detención del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, en inglés), y no ha podido ni siquiera ver a su esposa y a sus dos hijos de 11 y ocho años, según informa el diario The New York Times. La mujer y los niños son estadounidenses, pero dependían del salario del hombre para subsistir.
¿Qué sucedió?
Tamas fue arrestado después de que aplicara para conseguir la ciudadanía en 2016, cuando un control de antecedentes reveló que había sido condenado en Rumanía por un fraude con un seguro.
Su abogado ha recurrido ante la corte migratoria para evitar su deportación, y ha recibido cartas de apoyo de empresarios y antiguos empleadores, pero ICE considera que debe permanecer detenido hasta que se aclare su caso.
“A Zoltan no le atraparon cruzando la frontera”, ha explicado su abogado, Mario Urizar, “estaba en el país legalmente, pagando sus impuestos, y no tiene antecedentes criminales en Estados Unidos. ¿Por qué mantenerle detenido?”.
Tamas comenzó a trabajar para una propiedad de Trump en 2006, según el citado diario. Tenía entonces 25 años, y llegó al complejo vacacional de Mar-a-Lago con un visado H-2B de trabajo temporal.
Era camarero y estacionaba carros. Su novia de entonces, rumana, vino de vacaciones y se casaron en Las Vegas (Nevada). Fueron de luna de miel a Hawaii. Volvieron a Rumania, tuvieron un hijo, y en 2011 lograron la residencia permanente en la lotería de green cards, que permite cada año a 50.000 extranjeros emigrar legalmente a Estados Unidos por sorteo.
Tamas volvió a Florida, y logró trabajo en Mar-a-Lago, mientras su esposa se quedaba en Rumania esperando el nacimiento de su segundo hijo. En 2013, fue trasladado al campo de golf de Jupiter, y allí se convirtió en guarda de seguridad y, con los años, fue ascendiendo hasta convertirse en vicedirector de seguridad.
En 2016, transcurridos cinco años como residentes permanentes, la familia intentó conseguir la ciudadanía. La mujer y los niños lo lograron en abril de 2017. En junio, ICE citó a Tamas, y luego lo detuvo.

Texto completo: A report released Thursday identified serious flaws at Somerville Hospital and its parent company, after a 34-year-old woman dying from an asthma attack was locked outside the emergency room, but the review stopped short of blaming any individuals for the 2016 tragedy.
The report criticized hospital officials for failing to share key details about the death of Laura Levis with her family and with hospital board members, and describes Cambridge Health Alliance, the parent of Somerville Hospital, as beset by internal divisions.
The 85-page document is the result of an investigation by former attorney general Martha Coakley and Dean Richlin, partners at the law firm Foley Hoag LLP.Coakley and Richlin said they found no evidence that hospital leaders lied to or intentionally misled Levis's family.
They said the hospital staff who searched and cared for Levis — including a nurse who failed to spot her after looking for about 10 seconds— acted “reasonably" given the limited information they had at the time.
“There was no one person who did anything wrong or who could be blamed, under the circumstances," Coakley said in an interview.
“The takeaway," she said, “is this organization, like many, can do a self-assessment to make sure they do better in the future so that no other family has to go through what . . . Laura Levis's family had to go through."
Hospital officials hired Foley Hoag to investigate after Levis's husband, Peter DeMarco, described her life and death in the Boston Globe Magazine last November.
DeMarco said Thursday that the report falls short, ignoring some important details and undermining the acknowledgment he received from hospital leaders that both system failures and individual decisions played roles in his wife's death.
“As Laura's husband, I'm quite sure there isn't a report in the world that could make me feel any better, or answer every question as to why Laura was left to die a mere 29 feet from the front door of a hospital," DeMarco said in a statement.
He added: “My feelings about this report honestly won't matter if the lessons learned from it do indeed help save lives in the future."
Levis walked alone to Somerville Hospital early on the morning of Sept. 16, 2016. When she found a locked door, she called 911. “I'm dying," she said. Her call was transferred.
By the time firefighters found her, collapsed on a bench outside the hospital, her heart had stopped.
The report detailed the actions of hospital staff who were working that morning, including a veteran nurse.
After getting off the phone with a Somerville police dispatcher, at 4:28 a.m., the nurse opened a sliding door and stepped outside to look for Levis “for about 10 seconds" before returning inside, according to the report. She spoke with a hospital security officer but didn't ask for help with the search. She also called Levis's cellphone. But Levis didn't pick up; she had already lost consciousness.
Levis spent several days in intensive care at Cambridge Hospital, also part of Cambridge Health Alliance, before she died.
Still, the report said hospital officials “did many things right." It said Levis received excellent care once she was located and noted that hospital officials began reviewing her death almost immediately.
Hospital officials did not discuss the incident publicly until after the Globe published DeMarco's story. Several days later, they met with DeMarco and apologized for “multiple failures."
The public hospital system's chief executive, Patrick Wardell, told DeMarco that he took personal responsibility for what happened. Wardell later said he will retire in June, after a four-decade career in health care. He noted “the Laura Levis tragedy" in his announcement.
Coakley and Richlin said they conducted 25 interviews and reviewed more than 3,000 documents for their report.
They found that Cambridge Health Alliance, which runs hospitals in Cambridge, Somerville, and Everett, lacks organizational cohesiveness and trust,with much “finger pointing" among staff, management, and board members.
“The lack of cohesion within the organization has the potential for serious consequences," the report said.
Hospital officials have said they made several changes after Levis's death, including improving lighting, signage, video surveillance, and training for employees.
The report recommends that they also clarify and strengthen some of their policies, particularly how they notify families of patients who have been harmed.
Some portions of the report were redacted.
Jeffrey N. Catalano, a medical malpractice lawyer not involved in the case, said he was disappointed by the redactions but called the report a commendable step.
“It's important that hospitals recognize that patients' families have a right to know what happened to their loved one," said Catalano, a member of the Massachusetts Alliance for Communication and Resolution following Medical Injury.
After Levis died, her husband wrote a thank-you letter to her caregivers. It was shared internationally and published in The New York Times. Hospital officials had already begun reviewing the circumstances around her death at the time the letter was published, in October 2016 — but they did not inform Levis's family or the full board of trustees about the review.
In fact, several hospital board members told Foley Hoag that they learned important details about the case from the Globe article two years later — not from hospital management.
“This has been a challenging process. However, CHA is stronger and more transparent as a result of it," Josh Posner, chairman of the hospital system's board, said in a statement accompanying the report.
Posner said hospital officials hope to collaborate with Levis's family on “an appropriate and enduring way to honor her life and legacy."
State and federal officials previously investigated Levis's death. In 2017, Cambridge Health Alliance officials settled allegations that they violated a federal law requiring hospitals to treat anyone who comes to an emergency room because they failed to conduct a reasonable search for Levis.
Hospital officials didn't tell Levis's family about the circumstances that led to her death; family members discovered those details through police records and other research.
The report said Levis's death and its aftermath caused “reputational harm" to Cambridge Health Alliance that extended beyond bad publicity: “It decreased morale, promoted divisiveness, and led to a questioning of effectiveness within the organization. All of this might have been avoided if CHA had given timely notice to Mr. DeMarco that Ms. Levis's case was under review."
DeMarco previously considered a lawsuit against the hospital system but later promised not to sue. He is pushing for new state legislation.
One bill would require hospitals across Massachusetts to “ensure safe patient access at all times." This could include new rules about signs, lighting, and surveillance. The other bill would remove the limit on damages for people who sue public and nonprofit hospitals in cases where a patient is severely injured or dies.
“We want to make sure this never happens anywhere else," said state Representative Christine P. Barber, a Somerville Democrat who sponsored the legislation.
“I appreciate the report," she said, “and want to make sure we learn from it."

Lyft Raises Its I.P.O. Price, Showing Wall Street Appeal

Texto completo: Lyft was not the first ride-hailing company. But it is poised to become the first publicly traded one, and investors' appetite for its shares proved enormous.
The company priced its shares at $72 each on Thursday, after raising its price range amid significant demand from prospective shareholders. That puts Lyft's value at more than $24 billion as it prepares to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock market on Friday, under the ticker symbol LYFT.
In total, the company raised about $2.3 billion, having also increased the number of shares that were sold. (That amount could grow if Lyft's underwriters sell an additional block of shares to meet even stronger-than-expected investor demand.)
The offering marks the arrival of a new generation of Silicon Valley darlings on the public markets. Many of the companies promised new business models, upended established industries such as transportation and triggered a chain effect on how people work and make a living. The public offerings cement the place of the companies in people's lives, promise millions of dollars in investment gains for their longtime backers and are set to unleash a new wave of wealth in the tech industry.
[Elite early investors will be the biggest winners of the new I.P.O. wave.]
Among those set to follow in Lyft's footsteps is its archrival, Uber, whose initial public offering in the next few months is expected to be the biggest in years. Others on the docket include the digital pin board company Pinterest, the messaging platform Slack and the delivery service Postmates, all betting that they will also gain enthusiastic backing from investors.
"The strong demand for Lyft certainly bodes well for other unicorns," said Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business, using a term for start-ups valued at $1 billion or more.
But some investors worry that these companies, awash in red ink and unlikely to turn a profit for years, are being valued too highly and could ultimately disappoint their new public-market backers. Some companies that went public while running big losses, including Groupon and Snap, now trade well below their I.P.O. prices.
In its offering prospectus, Lyft revealed that it lost close to $1 billion in 2018. Lyft and Uber regularly lose money in their competition to win new markets, where they spend amply on subsidies for riders and drivers. The companies also burn cash on other transportation initiatives, like bikes, scooters and autonomous vehicles. Last year, Lyft bought the largest bike-sharing company in the United States for around $250 million.
"With Lyft, obviously, the market is saying, 'We're willing to give you the benefit of the doubt on a lot of things,' given that there are huge uncertainties about its future," Mr. Ritter said.
At its I.P.O. price, Lyft's market value puts it within range of old-line auto companies like Ford Motor. It is a significant increase from the $15.1 billion that Lyft earned in its last private fund-raising round last year.
Over the past week and a half, Lyft executives and their bankers embarked on a roadshow that took them from New York to Kansas City to San Francisco, pitching their business to institutional investors. Lyft initially set a price range of $62 to $68 for its shares, before raising that range on Wednesday to $70 to $72. The offering was led by JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse.
Between 2001 and 2018, I.P.O.s that were priced above their initial range averaged a return of 37 percent, Mr. Ritter said.
But Lyft must now prove that it is worth the eye-popping valuation bestowed upon it by its new public-market investors. That challenge includes maintaining its enviable growth rate -- it more than doubled its revenue in 2018 -- while showing that its focus on transportation, rather than branching out into ever-more business lines as Uber has, can be lucrative.
The offering's success will bring windfalls for Lyft's biggest existing investors. Among them: the company's founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, who are poised to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars; Rakuten, the Japanese e-commerce giant; and venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz.
Though Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer are taking their company public, they will still retain control, following in a long tradition of founder-led technology businesses. The two own special holdings that give them nearly 49 percent of voting shares, despite owning less than 5 percent of the overall stock.
Lyft also plans to give cash bonuses to drivers who have completed a large number of rides for the company, so that they can buy shares at the I.P.O. price. Drivers with 10,000 rides will receive $1,000, which at the $72 price would allow them to buy 13 shares before taxes. Drivers who have finished 20,000 rides will receive $10,000.
Only full-time drivers who have been with the platform for several years are likely to make the cut, said Harry Campbell, an Uber and Lyft driver who runs the driver blog and resource site The Rideshare Guy.
"It was the right thing to do," he said of Lyft's cash bonuses for drivers. "If you gave 10,000 rides for Lyft, you actually were a big part of helping build this company." He added that the I.P.O. was "kind of exciting to be part of" for drivers.
Unlike Lyft's employees and early investors, who are restricted by a lockup period from selling their shares, drivers will be able to sell any Lyft stock purchased through the cash bonus program as soon as the company begins trading on the public market, according to an email sent to qualifying drivers and reviewed by The New York Times.
But the cash bonuses ultimately did not satisfy many drivers, who work as freelancers for Lyft and Uber and do not receive full-time employee benefits. This week, hundreds of them protested in San Francisco and Los Angeles against lower pay rates.
"If political will starts to shift against Uber and Lyft, that's a scary proposition," Mr. Campbell said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: A report released Thursday identified serious flaws at Somerville Hospital and its parent company, after a 34-year-old woman dying from an asthma attack was locked outside the emergency room, but the review stopped short of blaming any individuals for the 2016 tragedy.
The report criticized hospital officials for failing to share key details about the death of Laura Levis with her family and with hospital board members, and describes Cambridge Health Alliance, the parent of Somerville Hospital, as beset by internal divisions.

Jeffrey N. Catalano, a medical malpractice lawyer not involved in the case, said he was disappointed by the redactions but called the report a commendable step.
“It's important that hospitals recognize that patients' families have a right to know what happened to their loved one," said Catalano, a member of the Massachusetts Alliance for Communication and Resolution following Medical Injury.
After Levis died, her husband wrote a thank-you letter to her caregivers. It was shared internationally and published in The New York Times. Hospital officials had already begun reviewing the circumstances around her death at the time the letter was published, in October 2016 — but they did not inform Levis's family or the full board of trustees about the review.
In fact, several hospital board members told Foley Hoag that they learned important details about the case from the Globe article two years later — not from hospital management.
“This has been a challenging process. However, CHA is stronger and more transparent as a result of it," Josh Posner, chairman of the hospital system's board, said in a statement accompanying the report.
Posner said hospital officials hope to collaborate with Levis's family on “an appropriate and enduring way to honor her life and legacy."
State and federal officials previously investigated Levis's death. In 2017, Cambridge Health Alliance officials settled allegations that they violated a federal law requiring hospitals to treat anyone who comes to an emergency room because they failed to conduct a reasonable search for Levis.
Hospital officials didn't tell Levis's family about the circumstances that led to her death; family members discovered those details through police records and other research.
The report said Levis's death and its aftermath caused “reputational harm" to Cambridge Health Alliance that extended beyond bad publicity: “It decreased morale, promoted divisiveness, and led to a questioning of effectiveness within the organization. All of this might have been avoided if CHA had given timely notice to Mr. DeMarco that Ms. Levis's case was under review."
DeMarco previously considered a lawsuit against the hospital system but later promised not to sue. He is pushing for new state legislation.
One bill would require hospitals across Massachusetts to “ensure safe patient access at all times." This could include new rules about signs, lighting, and surveillance. The other bill would remove the limit on damages for people who sue public and nonprofit hospitals in cases where a patient is severely injured or dies.
“We want to make sure this never happens anywhere else," said state Representative Christine P. Barber, a Somerville Democrat who sponsored the legislation.
“I appreciate the report," she said, “and want to make sure we learn from it."

Texto completo: Clue: a 16-letter word for something that can drive you nuts.
CROSSWORDPUZZLES.
This past weekend in Stamford, Conn, crossword champions from across the country met to duke it out to see who can fill in the blanks the fastest. The Annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament was founded in 1978 and every March since then, crossword puzzle fanatics have gathered to test their metal in a shootout that proves that some people can solve the hardest of all New York Times puzzles in mere minutes.
If you need to see it for yourself, watch crossword documentary movie "Wordplay" and you can see geeky old men, housewives, college kids, sports heroes, and even presidents fill in all the blanks in less time than it takes for most of us to sharpen our pencils and fold the newspaper just right. It's such an amazing display of words-smithery - a linguistic mission impossible. It's much more exciting than zombies and vampires, and there are no stuntmen or fancy camera work. What these word-masters do is much more heroic than leaping tall buildings.
The Big Kahuna of crossword puzzles is, of course, New York Times Crossword Puzzle Editor Will Shortz, and this tournament is his show, the nation's oldest and largest crossword competition. Contestants work on eight original crosswords created and edited specially for this event. Scoring is based on accuracy and speed. Prizes are awarded in more than 20 categories, including a $5,000 grand prize. Evening games, guest speakers, and a wine and cheese reception are an important part of the event and many of the hundreds who come to it know they aren't going to win prizes. They love the camaraderie of a shared passion.
Many people who love crossword puzzles are also Scrabble fanatics, and of the two, I have to say I like the fact that unless you want to play a computer, Scrabble involves live action with another player or players.
As a child, I would watch my parents, then later my brothers and sisters fight over the newspaper for the crossword puzzles while I went more for the comics. Like golf, I saved crossword puzzles to my so-called senior years when 65 was the new 45. Now I keep them in every room - and in the car.
I prefer the cheap kind with big print that come in little books you buy in dollar stores. None of this week's contestants at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament would be caught dead with one of those, but I can whip through them like a smarty pants, slowing down only for the last half dozen pages which are labeled "championship," but don't get the big head if you can knock them off fairly easy. They are child's play compared to what Will Shortz has planned for his crowd.
A Scrabble dictionary includes a lot of words you'd swear were only on eyecharts.
Learning them is part of the game: qi; zooecia. It's much smaller than The New Comprehensive A-Z Crossword Dictionary with over 250,000 entries on 1367 pages of microscopic print. Definitions come first, then a lists words. Say the clue is cenotaph, the answer could be "tomb" or "monument."
The number of words in a person's vocabulary depends on many variables, making it hard to settle on an average. Estimates run from 10,000 to 12000-plus, and any one of them could be called on sooner or later in a crossword puzzle of championship caliber; and unlike Scrabble, a crossword puzzle isn't just about words. Good players need a sense of humor, a sharp wit, a big imagination and the nose of a bloodhound.
My favorite crossword story happened on Election Day in 1996 when the clue to the middle grid in The New York Times puzzle was "Lead story in tomorrow's newspaper."
The answer appeared to be CLINTON ELECTED, but because of intentional ambiguity in the crossing clues, the answer could also have been BOB DOLE ELECTED. Either answer fit.
"It was the most amazing crossword I've ever seen," Shortz said. "As soon as it appeared, my telephone started ringing. Most people said, 'How dare you presume that Clinton will win!" And the people who filled in BOB DOLE thought we'd made a whopper of a mistake!'"
You can appreciate the name of the game they've been playing this past weekend in at the big tournament:
I would never qualify for that level of play, but I am sure it involved lots of cross words uttered under the breath while filling in those blankety-blanks.

Texto completo: LONDON -- The British Foreign Office on Wednesday defended spending almost $16 million to buy an apartment for a diplomat in New York as "the best possible deal and value for money" and a way to promote Britain's business interests in the city.
The British government paid 12 million pounds, or about $15.8 million, for the property, a full-floor penthouse on the 38th floor of 50 United Nations Plaza, a 43-story condominium building that is a stone's throw from the United Nations headquarters on the East Side of Manhattan.
It will be home to Antony Phillipson, the British consul general in New York. Mr. Phillipson is also Britain's trade commissioner for North America, responsible for strengthening the bilateral trade relationship between Britain and the United States, among other duties.
The price of the apartment did not sit well with some in Britain, who accused the government of wasteful spending while the country was still experiencing the hardships of austerity. The tabloid newspaper The Sun described the property as a "pencil-pusher paradise."
"The government could afford a £12 million grace-and-favor penthouse in New York, but couldn't spend money to rehouse Grenfell survivors," Umaar Kazmi, a law student at the University of Nottingham, said on Twitter on Wednesday, referring to the 2017 fire at a high-rise building in London that killed more than 70 people.
"As ever, the government shows that these things are not a matter of cost, they're a matter of political priorities," he added.
Nearly a decade of government austerity has had profound effect on British society, slashing budgets for policing, housing and welfare.
A United Nations expert said late last year that efforts by the Conservative-led government to cut state spending were "entrenching high levels of poverty and inflicting unnecessary misery in one of the richest countries in the world."
Christopher Phillips, a professor of international relations at Queen Mary University of London, called the purchase "yet another example of the ridiculousness of Brexit."
"The U.K. has had to sell off many of its grander foreign properties to balance the books during austerity; and now splashes out on this penthouse to win previously unnecessary trade deals," he wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.
A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it was in the process of selling Mr. Phillipson's current residence, which is near the British Consulate on Second Avenue.
"We have secured the best possible deal and value for money on a property that will help promote the U.K. in the commercial capital of our largest export market and trading partner," the spokesman said in an email. He confirmed that the sale had closed on March 15.
"As well as being the consul general's residence, it will also be used to support his work to help British businesses" as trade commissioner for North America, he added.
Zeckendorf Development and Global Holdings, the developers of 50 United Nations Plaza, confirmed the sale in an email on Wednesday. The building -- which also has a swimming pool, a garage, and a fitness center -- was completed in 2014. It is on First Avenue between East 46th and East 47th Streets and was designed by the London architects Foster & Partners.
Mr. Phillipson's 5,893-square-foot penthouse has seven bedrooms, including two for household staff; six bathrooms; a powder room; three walk-in closets; and a library, according to the floor plan.
In a review of 50 United Nations Plaza on the website CityRealty, Carter B. Horsley, a former real estate writer for The New York Times, described it as "a glittering scepter for modern pharaohs who demand spectacular sunrises." With the sale to the British government, more than 80 percent of the building has now been sold, Zeckendorf Development said.

Reporters should be proud of work on Russia story

Texto completo: It should be no surprise to anyone that President Donald Trump's reaction to the special counsel Robert Mueller's report is to attack reporters for doing their jobs.
That's exactly what he has been doing for years. It's a predictable political strategy - an ugly, undemocratic one - that works as a way to feed raw meat to his base.
And it should be no surprise that his media echo chamber - led by Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity - is calling for the heads of journalists whose work Hannity couldn't begin to emulate even if given 100 years.
As for the rest of the harsh criticism that's being leveled at journalists who dug into the connections between Trump, as candidate and president, and Russia, it's largely misguided.
Fairly typical of this was conservative writer Rich Lowry, who said the three biggest losers from Mueller's report were "the media, the media, the media, which he described as "obsessed and hysterical for 2 years.
There are calls for a "reckoning on news coverage.
All right, then. Here goes.
I reckon that American citizens would have been far worse off if skilled reporters hadn't dug into the connections between Trump's associates - up to and including his son Don Jr. - and Russians. That reporting has not been invalidated.
I reckon that the felonious lying to the public about a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow remains a scandal - and that we know about this in large part because journalists were doing their jobs aggressively.
I reckon that the hard-nosed reporting about former national security adviser Michael Flynn - roundly denied, you might recall, before it was proved - was an early sign of the venality that was to follow.
I reckon that reporting by The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, BuzzFeed, CNN, Bloomberg News, The Daily Beast, Mother Jones, ProPublica and others drove forward a national conversation that needed to happen. As Americans saw with their own eyes Trump's bizarre efforts to ingratiate himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin, that reporting mattered and provided context.
And that shouldn't be forgotten or swept aside now.
And yes, I reckon that endless speculative threads and the explosions of tiny cannons on Twitter were ridiculous and over the top - and that the cable pundits who made a living off such speculation aren't really journalists anyway.
It's important to acknowledge the value of the serious journalism, because there's a real risk that news organizations will take the edges off their coverage of this subject now.
You could see it starting to happen over the weekend.
It was strange, for example, to see Scott Pelley's lead-in to CBS's "60 Minutes erroneously describe the Mueller report's findings in a way that Trump might have scripted: He flatly stated that the report, as described by Attorney General William Barr, exonerated the president.
In fact, Mueller came to no such conclusion on obstruction of justice, and on the contrary stated clearly that his investigation did not exonerate him.
Perhaps cowed by the criticism - which came from the left as well as the right, most notably from author Matt Taibbi - some news organizations may back down from aggressive coverage of Trump.
That would be a serious mistake. With some regrettable and damaging exceptions - individual stories that seemingly went too far - reality-based news outlets have done quite well on this story.
And it's far from over. So this is no time to retreat.
What would be a good idea, though, is to be less obsessed with this subject to the exclusion of others that are far closer to home for most Americans: health care, the economy, affordable housing and crime.
"We've done two listening tours across the U.S. in the past two years, and it was striking how Trump, Russia and Mueller just never came up, HuffPost Editor Lydia Polgreen told me Sunday. As a result, "we haven't invested heavily in covering the Trump/Russia story in terms of enterprise.
Similarly, I've been thinking of Christine Radwan, a Trump voter (and former Democrat) I interviewed in rural New York state in 2017.
When I asked her whether possible Russian collusion mattered to her, she paused and then answered thoughtfully: "Yes, it's important, but not as important as our economy and what's happened to our middle class.
This observation is worth thinking about, and acting on.
But that's not to suggest that serious news organizations should drop the Trump/Russia story, which is still playing out.
Nor should they allow themselves to be bullied about the important work they've done, and must continue to do.

Texto completo: Conor McGregor announced his retirement from mixed-martial arts Monday, hours before a report surfaced detailing sexual assault accusations made against the former UFC champion last year.
The New York Times reported Tuesday that McGregor, 30, is under investigation in Ireland after a woman accused him of sexual assault in December. McGregor was arrested and released by Irish police in January but has not been charged with a crime, according to the report.
Late Monday night, McGregor tweeted, "I've decided to retire," minutes after a previously recorded segment with host Jimmy Fallon aired on "The Tonight Show."
"Hey guys quick announcement, I've decided to retire from the sport formally known as 'Mixed Martial Art' today," wrote @thenotoriousmma, McGregor's account. "I wish all my old colleagues well going forward in competition. I now join my former partners on this venture, already in retirement. Proper Pina Coladas on me fellas!"
McGregor, currently serving a six-month suspension for his role in the October post-fight incident with lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov following Nurmagomedov's fourth-round submission victory, has been engaged with veteran lightweight Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone for a July fight.
McGregor told Fallon, "I love to compete, I love to fight. We're in talks for July, (but there's) a lot of politics. The fight game is a mad game. I can fight who I want."
But UFC leadership has been resistant to place the nontitle McGregor-Cerrone bout as the main event to its marquee International Fight Week card July 6 in Las Vegas.
McGregor, after signing a new multifight deal with the UFC before fighting Nurmagomedov, hinted at his leverage in talking to Fallon at a New York Irish bar on March 18, where he hawked his new whiskey and clothing line.
"I've done my piece for the company. I don't necessarily need to fight. I am set for life," McGregor said.
The UFC could use the promotion of a looming McGregor fight to counter a bad month of publicity that has included the yearlong performance-enhancing suspension of bantamweight champion T.J. Dillashaw, a restraining order against former interim lightweight champion Tony Ferguson by his wife in Orange County, Calif., and a post-fight attack of fighter Leon Edwards in England by the UFC's Jorge Masvidal.

Texto completo: Of 895 slots in the freshman class of Stuyvesant High in New York City, seven were offered this year to black students, down from 10 last year and 13 the year before.
In the freshman class of 803 at The Bronx High School of Science, 12 students are black, down from last year's 25.
Of 303 students admitted to Staten Island Technical High School, one is African-American.
According to The New York Times, similar patterns of admission apply at the other five most elite high schools in the city.
Whites and Asians are
30 percent of middle school students, but 83 percent of the freshmen at Bronx High School of Science, 88 percent at Staten Island Technical and 90 percent at Stuyvesant.
What do these numbers tell us?
They identify a fault line that runs through the Democratic Party, separating leftists who believe in equality of results for all races and ethnic groups, and those who believe in a meritocracy.
Mayor Bill de Blasio has expressed anger and frustration at the under-representation of blacks and Hispanics in the elite schools. But Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state legislature have ignored his pleas to change the way students are admitted.
The same test, of English and math, is given to middle school applicants. And admission to the elite eight is offered to those who get the highest scores.
Moreover, Asians, not whites, are predominant.
Though 15 percent of all middle school students, Asians make up two-thirds of the student body at Stuyvesant, with 80 times as many slots as their African-American classmates.
The egalitarian wing of the Democratic Party sees this as inherently unjust. And what gives this issue national import?
First, the recent scandal where rich parents paid huge bribes to criminal consultants to get their kids into elite colleges, by falsifying records of athletic achievement and cheating on Scholastic Aptitude Tests, has caused a wave of populist resentment.
Second, Harvard is being sued for systemic reverse racism, as black and Hispanic students are admitted with test scores hundreds of points below those that would disqualify Asians and whites.
Third, Joe Biden has a history on compulsory integration dating back to the 1970s that Sen. Jesse Helms called "enlightened."
That was 44 years ago. While those views were the thinking perhaps of most Americans, in the mid-'70s, they will be problematic in the 2020 primaries, where African-Americans could be decisive in the contests that follow Iowa and New Hampshire.
Biden knows that just as Bernie Sanders, another white male, fell short in crucial South Carolina because of a lack of support among black voters, he , too, has a problem with that most loyal element in the Democratic coalition.
In 1991, Biden failed to rise to the defense of Anita Hill when she charged future Justice Clarence Thomas with sexual harassment. In the Senate Judiciary Committee, he was a law-and-order champion responsible for tough anti-crime legislation that is now regarded as discriminatory.
How, with a record like this, does Biden inoculate himself against attacks by rival candidates, especially candidates of color, in his run for the nomination?
One way would be to signal to his party that he has grown, he has changed, and his 2020 running mate will be a person of color. Perhaps he'll run with a woman of color such as Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the 2018 governor's race in Georgia.
An ancillary benefit would be that Abrams on the ticket would help him carry Georgia, a state Donald Trump probably cannot lose and win re-election.

Texto completo: The executive editor of the New York Times stands behind his paper’s coverage of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between President Trump and Russia.

Dean Baquet told one of his reporters that he had no regrets over the news organization’s extensive Trump-Russia coverage.

“We wrote a lot about Russia, and I have no regrets,” the top editor said. “It’s not our job to determine whether or not there was illegality.”

He joins Jeff Zucker, president of CNN, who said he stood by CNN’s reporting of the 22-month long investigation in an email reported by the Times.

“We are not investigators. We are journalists, and our role is to report the facts as we know them, which is exactly what we did,” Zucker wrote. “A sitting president’s own Justice Department investigated his campaign for collusion with a hostile nation. That’s not enormous because the media says so. That’s enormous because it’s unprecedented.”

Attorney General William Barr announced in a four-page summary of Mueller’s report released Sunday that Trump did not collude with Russia.

In the following days, the revelation has prompted a sense of vindication from Trump and his supporters who are upset at the media for its extensive coverage of the investigation. Trump, who frequently refers to the Times and CNN as “fake news,” re-purposed the phrase to describe mainstream media as a whole Tuesday morning.

Mueller also declined to determine whether Trump obstructed justice, and Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the president committed a crime.

Texto completo: These two silver screen lovebirds will always remember.
On Monday, Mandy Moore got her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the occasion gifted us with a perfect throwback moment with her "A Walk to Remember" co-star Shane West.
West (who now stars on Fox's "Gotham") surprised Moore with a photo of the pair taken when they wrapped the 2002 romance "A Walk to Remember. "
"We couldn't have been more opposite when we met," West said at the event, noting he was an eyeliner-wearing garage punk musician at the time while she was "killing it" as an early aughts pop star. "I was trying to get you to listen to The Clash and the Ramones. You were not interested, but you were very sweet about it. And you stuck to your Fleetwood Mac. "

But their "Walk" director Adam Shankman thought they'd be a good fit, he recalled. "What can I say but I'm glad he did," said West, calling Moore's energy "irresistible. "
Later, Moore posted a throwback photo on Instagram of her and West. "Stars have always sort of been our thing. Thankful to @theshanewest for his kind words on this very special day, one which I will never forget. It was a walk (of fame) to remember," wrote Moore on Instagram, sharing then-and-now photos of the famous friends.

Also showing support for Moore at her star ceremony was her new husband, Taylor Goldsmith, Shankman, "This Is Us" show creator Dan Fogelman and Moore's "fake family," as Moore called them — including her NBC co-stars Milo Ventimiglia, Sterling K. Brown, Susan Kelechi Watson, Justin Hartley and Chrissy Metz.
In her speech Monday, Moore also took a moment to speak obliquely about her participation in a New York Times expose about her ex-husband, Ryan Adams. "At this chapter in my life things are starting to feel like they're coalescing," she said Monday. "Recently, I have found myself stepping into my power in a new way. I'm finally starting to understand and own who I am. And I feel really lucky. "
And now, let us revisit Moore's iconic video for "Cry," which also stars West.
Happy Monday!

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Please, let's stop pretending that the college cheating scandal is just an indictment of overindulgent, wealthy helicopter parents.
The Justice Department has accused dozens of super-rich parents of making $25 million in illegal payments - and, in some cases, taking a tax break to boot - to get their children into selective colleges.
If true, these parents broke the law. They could face some prison time. But in the coming weeks, a lot of parents and their children, who've been legitimately accepted to pricey colleges, will make a move to put themselves in another type of prison.
Certain madness takes over this time of year - between late March and early April - when the college acceptance letters are sent out. Hearts are elated if children are accepted to prestigious public and private universities. Then comes the financial reality: Going to these dream colleges often means taking on substantial student loans.
Outstanding student-loan debt at the end of last year was $1.5 trillion. Education debt ranks second in consumer debt nationwide behind mortgages.
Parents will sentence themselves and their children to decades of debt because they believe attending a select school is a must for their children to succeed. They will trade financial stability for the status symbol of a brand-name college education.
The recent admissions scam has been used to underscore the pressure parents and students are under to get into "better" schools, as if the thousands of other colleges and universities in the country just aren't good enough. Heaven forbid you suggest a student attend a community college first, if money is woefully lacking. The pushback is typically substantial -- and illogical.
Dripping with disdain, parents and students say that if the acceptance to an elite college doesn't happen, there is always the "safety school." What's financially sound and safe about struggling under the weight of enough debt to equal the price of a home?
And the financial imprisonment is even harder for low-income families, particularly minorities. Many students from these homes run out of money before they can graduate. They end up with debt and no degree.
Last fall, I met a mother at a financial-literacy program in Delaware who was very concerned about how to pay her parent PLUS loans. She had taken out more than $100,000 to help send her child to the top-rated University of Michigan to study to be a teacher.
I asked her why she didn't send her daughter to a school in her home state or somewhere close by so she could commute and reduce the cost of attendance.
"It's where she really wanted to go, and she worked hard to get into Michigan," the mom said with pride.
But studies have shown that the determination and hard work that the child demonstrated would have helped her succeed wherever she ended up going to college.
"A sort of mania has taken hold, and its grip seems to grow tighter and tighter," wrote New York Times op-ed columnist Frank Bruni in his 2015 book "Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be."
It's the "elite edge" that drives many parents and students to put themselves in financial jeopardy, Bruni pointed out.
What about the connections a child will make at a premier institution, you might ask?
Gallup asked 5,100 graduates about the career helpfulness of their undergraduate alumni networks.
Just 9 percent of graduates said the school network has been very helpful or helpful to them in the job market, according to Gallup, which released the findings earlier this year.
Just one in six alumni from schools ranked in the top 50 by U.S. News and World Report reported that their alumni network has been useful to them in the job market.
"While these alumni are slightly more likely than alumni from lower-ranked schools to perceive their alumni network as helpful, the differences are relatively minor and unlikely to offset the significant differences in tuition costs," Gallup said.
What can markedly make a difference in job success for a student?
What helps tremendously is an internship during college in which a graduate can apply what he or she is learning, Gallup said.
Long before the current admissions scandal, Bruni wrote, "The admissions game is too flawed and too rigged to be given so much credit. For another, the nature of a student's college experience -- the work that he or she puts into it, the skills that he or she picks up, the self-examination that's undertaken, the resourcefulness that's honed -- matters more than the name of the institution attended."
Stop the madness. Don't succumb to admissions mania that can condemn you and your kid to a life of crushing debt.

Loss of school kids imperils Cape economy

Texto completo: What happens to a society that loses its children?
Cape Cod may learn the answer the hard way. Economist Michael Goodman posed that provocative question in a New York Times article about three years ago, a reference to the hollowing out of the Cape's school-age population.
The situation, it's fair to say, has not improved since.
A story in the Cape Cod Times over the weekend prompted Goodman to ask the question anew. That article focused on efforts to help young families on the Outer Cape, such as free preschool or after-school programs. But the numbers in an accompanying chart told a disturbing story of their own, one quite familiar to Cape businesses and residents — a story of demographic shifts that threaten the Cape's economy.
Enrollment fell significantly in nearly every school district across the Cape, compared with the 2008-09 school year, according to data from the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The smaller, remote communities on the Outer Cape were hit hard, for sure. Truro was down 25 percent, for example, and Provincetown fell 27 percent. More surprising: Upper Cape towns, where people can commute more easily over the bridges, also suffered. Bourne slid 21 percent, and Sandwich's numbers plunged 30 percent, the worst of any Cape town.
Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce chief executive Wendy Northcross says business leaders have become increasingly concerned about the labor force, since the Cape's overall population peaked in the late 1990s. (Restrictions on visas for foreign workers who come for summer jobs have not helped.) The chamber, she says, tries to advocate for measures that could help reverse the population loss, such as allowing more apartments to be built.
But it can feel like a losing battle with a force as relentless as the waves.
Goodman, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, cites a host of culprits: environmental barriers to new construction such as wastewater and water limits, generally restrictive zoning that prevents multifamily housing, an increasing number of retirees who turn their summer homes into year-round ones.
Robert Dutch, superintendent of the Upper Cape Cod Regional Technical School, sees another force at work: the rise of Airbnb and its ilk, and the investors who use those sites to rent homes on a nightly basis. The primary cause of the Cape's family exodus, Dutch and others say, is the high cost of housing. Dutch says he hears all the time from employers who can't find enough employees because fewer kids are graduating Cape schools. The average age of workers at marinas and boatyards is 50, he says. There simply aren't enough newcomers to replace those who are aging out. That dynamic plays out everywhere you turn, from landscapers to auto mechanics.
Dutch's school bucks the downward trend; he turns away 85 to 150 kids a year. The skills his students learn are in high demand on the Cape. But he worries about the overall population decline in his school's five-town catchment area: The number of school-age kids in those towns fell 12 percent in only the past five years.
Provincetown, on the Cape's farthest edge, felt this pinch early. Town Manager David Panagore says “we're trying everything we can" to react. Buying up a former time-share building and converting it to 26 apartments. Changing property tax rules to favor year-round residents. Requiring residential developers to contribute to affordable housing in town.
Will it be enough? Panagore can't be sure. He worries about what happens to a town — or a region — when police officers and other essential workers can no longer afford to live full time in a vacationland.
From Goodman's perspective, Cape Cod is conducting a social experiment, testing the viability of a society without children. It's hard to blame him for being skeptical of the outcome.

Texto completo: Thailand's first election since a 2014 coup was mired in confusion and recriminations Monday after election officials released only partial results.
Two rival parties each claimed the right to form a government, and an exiled former prime minister accused the military government of rigging a vote riddled with irregularities.
What the junta had billed as a return to elected government instead brought more political turmoil to a Southeast Asian kingdom with a long history of weak governments, military takeovers and fitful experiments with democracy.

The junta-appointed Election Commission, which abruptly stopped releasing results hours after the polls closed Sunday, postponed a news conference twice on Monday before announcing it would disclose the winners of 350 directly elected parliamentary seats -- but not the vote totals.
Those partial results showed the anti-military Pheu Thai party winning 137 seats, with 95% of votes counted. Palang Pracharat, an army-aligned party whose prime ministerial candidate is junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha, was second with 97 seats.
An additional 150 seats were still to be decided based on a complex proportional representation system that was being used for the first time, among several new electoral rules introduced by the military government to weaken large opposition parties such as Pheu Thai, which was ousted in the 2014 coup.
Initial projections for those seats could come Friday, when the commission said it would release vote totals that could also slightly shift the results of the 350 elected seats.
But the winners would not be officially announced until May 9, setting the stage for weeks of political jockeying and controversy that could cast a shadow over the lavish three-day coronation of Thailand's king earlier that month.
Many Thais questioned how Palang Pracharat -- the vehicle for a military government widely criticized for repression and economic mismanagement -- had won 7.6 million votes, compared with about 7.1 million for Pheu Thai, which had led most preelection surveys.
Pheu Thai said that because it had collected the most directly elected seats, it should form a government. Palang Pracharat countered that because its candidates had received more overall votes, it would begin talks with other pro-military parties about forming a coalition that could keep Prayuth, a former general, in power as prime minister.
The army also held an ace up its sleeve: the right to name 250 senators who would also have a say in selecting the prime minister, another change it made in the rules starting with this election. That meant Palang Pracharat only needed to control 126 seats in the House of Representatives for a majority.
"We will discuss with parties that share the same ideology and policy direction with Palang Pracharat about forming a government," party leader Uttama Savanayana said. "I believe this is what the people want to see happen."
The dizzying developments and conduct of the Election Commission sparked a furor among Thais who already believed the junta was using the cover of an election to prolong its power. Prachatai, a news website, asked in a banner headline: "The most questionable election in Thai history?"
Thaksin Shinawatra, the exiled former prime minister who backs Pheu Thai, accused the junta of rigging the outcome and said the results wouldn't be respected at home or abroad.
"Thailand should have a government that reflects the will of the people, not the will of the junta," Thaksin wrote in a New York Times op-ed article published Monday. "This is a terrible, and sad, moment for my country."
Many analysts said Pheu Thai was unlikely to secure many of the 150 "party list" seats because the proportional system devised by the military favored parties that hadn't already won constituency seats.
Pheu Thai was also at a disadvantage because it did not field candidates in dozens of constituencies where it believed an allied party, Thai Raksa Chart, had stood a strong chance of winning.
Thai Raksa Chart was dissolved by a constitutional court this month for the offense of naming King Maha Vajiralongkorn's sister as its prime ministerial candidate. The king, who is revered as godlike under Thai custom, said it would be "extremely inappropriate" for a royal to enter politics.
The Election Commission said it had received 110 reports of irregularities that would be investigated but did not elaborate.
A new opposition party, Future Forward, which won the third most votes, said that in 10 constituencies where its candidates lost by fewer than 2,000 votes, it was "suspicious about whether the ballot counting was accurate." The party said it would seek recounts.
The party urged the commission to quickly release all voting data to allay public concerns about an election that also lacked international observers, which officials had barred from monitoring the process.
If the commission "is really confident about conducting a free and fair election, there are no reasons not to disclose statistical data," said Future Forward's secretary-general, Piyabutr Saengkanokkul.

Texto completo: La profesora, armada con tizas de colores, suma fracciones en el gran encerado, enmarcado en madera rústica, que cubre la pared frontal de la clase. Los niños de cuarto grado, de 9 y 10 años, hacen sus cuentas en los pupitres con lápiz y cuartillas. El aula está forrada de papeles: mensajes, horarios, trabajos de los alumnos. Ninguno ha salido de una impresora. Nada, ni siquiera los libros de texto, que elaboran los propios niños a mano, ha sido realizado por ordenador. No hay detalle alguno en esta clase que pudiera desentonar en los recuerdos escolares de un adulto que asistió al colegio el siglo pasado. Pero estamos en Palo Alto. El corazón de Silicon Valley. Epicentro de la economía digital. Hábitat de quienes piensan, producen y venden la tecnología que transforma la sociedad del siglo XXI.
Escuelas de medio mundo se esfuerzan por introducir ordenadores, tabletas, pizarras interactivas y otros prodigios tecnológicos . Pero aquí, en el Waldorf of Peninsula, colegio privado donde se educan los hijos de directivos de Apple, Google y otros gigantes tecnológicos que rodean a esta antigua granja en la bahía de San Francisco, no entra una pantalla hasta que llegan a secundaria .
“No creemos en la caja negra, esa idea de que metes algo en una máquina y sale un resultado sin que se comprenda lo que pasa dentro. Si haces un círculo perfecto con un ordenador, pierdes al ser humano tratando de lograr esa perfección. Lo que detona el aprendizaje es la emoción, y son los humanos los que producen esa emoción, no las máquinas. La creatividad es algo esencialmente humano. Si le pones una pantalla a un niño pequeño limitas sus habilidades motoras, su tendencia a expandirse, su capacidad de concentración. No hay muchas certezas en todo esto. Tendremos las respuestas en 15 años, cuando estos niños sean adultos. ¿Pero queremos asumir el riesgo?”, se pregunta Pierre Laurent, padre de tres hijos, ingeniero informático que trabajó en Microsoft, Intel y diversas startups, y ahora preside el patronato del colegio.
Sus palabras ilustran lo que empieza a ser un consenso entre las élites de Silicon Valley. Los adultos que mejor comprenden la tecnología de los móviles y las aplicaciones quieren a sus hijos lejos de ella. Los beneficios de las pantallas en la educación temprana son limitados, sostienen, mientras que el riesgo de adicción es alto.
Los pioneros lo tuvieron claro desde muy pronto. Bill Gates, creador de Microsoft, limitó el tiempo de pantalla de sus hijos. “No tenemos los teléfonos en la mesa cuando estamos comiendo y no les dimos móviles hasta que cumplieron los 14 años”, dijo en 2017. “En casa limitamos el uso de tecnología a nuestros hijos”, explicó Steve Jobs, creador de Apple, en una entrevista en The New York Times en 2010, en la que aseguró que prohibía a sus vástagos utilizar su recién creado iPad. “En la escala entre los caramelos y el crack, esto está más cerca del crack”, apuntaba también en The New York Times Chris Anderson, exdirector de la revista Wired, biblia de la cultura digital.
Laurent, que no le dio un móvil a su hijo pequeño hasta noveno grado (14 o 15 años), alerta de un peligroso cambio en el modelo de negocio del que ha sido testigo en su vida profesional. “Cualquiera que hace una aplicación quiere que sea fácil de usar”, explica. “Eso es así desde el principio. Pero antes queríamos que el usuario estuviera contento para que comprase el producto. Ahora, con los smartphones y las tabletas, el modelo de negocio es otro: el producto es gratis, pero se recogen datos y se ponen anuncios. Por eso, el objetivo hoy es que el usuario pase más tiempo en la aplicación, para poder recoger más datos o poner más anuncios. Es decir, la razón de ser de la aplicación es que el usuario pase el mayor tiempo posible ante la pantalla. Están diseñadas para eso”.
El problema de la relación de los niños y la tecnología es que el ritmo vertiginoso al que se transforma dificulta la reflexión y el estudio. Una investigación de Common Sense Media, organización sin ánimo de lucro “dedicada a ayudar a los niños a desarrollarse en un mundo de medios y tecnología”, da una idea de la velocidad de los cambios: los niños estadounidenses de cero a ocho años pasaban en 2017 una media de 48 minutos al día ante el móvil, tres veces más que en 2013 y 10 veces más que en 2011. “¿Cuándo empezó todo este furor por los teléfonos inteligentes?”, se pregunta María Álvarez, vicepresidenta de la organización. “No tiene más que 12 o 13 años. Y las primeras tabletas aún menos. Hace falta que mucha investigación aún para determinar cuál es realmente el impacto que esta exposición a las pantallas puede tener en los niños pequeños. Pero hay algunos estudios que empiezan a ver una relación entre esta tecnología y ciertos hitos en la educación. Ofrecen indicaciones que los padres deben tener en cuenta”.
Una investigación publicada en enero de este año en la revista médica JAMA pediatrics reveló que un tiempo mayor ante la pantalla a los dos y tres años está asociado con retrasos de los niños en alcanzar hitos de desarrollo dos años después. Otros estudios relacionan el uso excesivo de móviles en adolescentes con la falta de sueño, el riesgo de depresión y hasta de suicidios. La Academia de Pediatras de Estados Unidos publicó unas recomendaciones en 2016: evitar el uso de pantallas para los menores de 18 meses; solo contenidos de calidad y visionados en compañía de los padres, para niños entre 18 y 24 meses; una hora al día de contenidos de calidad para niños de entre dos y cinco años; y, a partir de los seis años, límites coherentes en el tiempo de uso y el contenido.
Sucede que poner límites no es fácil para los padres trabajadores. Y eso lleva a una redefinición de lo que significa la brecha digital. Hasta hace no mucho, la preocupación era que los niños más ricos contasen con una ventaja por acceder antes a Internet. Hoy, según Common Sense Media, el 98% de los hogares con hijos en EE UU tienen teléfonos móviles, frente a un 52% en 2011. Cuando la tecnología se ha generalizado, el problema es el contrario: que las familias con un elevado poder adquisitivo tienen más fácil impedir que sus niños se pasen el día ante el móvil. Mientras los hijos de las élites de Silicon Valley se crían entre pizarras y juguetes de madera, los de las clases bajas y medias crecen pegados a pantallas.
Los adolescentes de hogares con menos ingresos, según un estudio de Common Sense Media, pasan dos horas y 45 minutos al día más ante las pantallas que aquellos de hogares de ingresos altos. Otros estudios indican que los niños blancos están significativamente menos expuestos a las pantallas que los negros o hispanos.
La brecha se ve incluso dentro de Silicon Valley. Conduciendo 15 minutos hacia el norte desde el Waldorf of Peninsula, centro cuya matrícula ronda los 30.000 dólares anuales, se llega al colegio público Hillview. El primero no introduce las pantallas hasta la secundaria. El segundo publicita un programa por el que cada alumno cuenta con un iPad. En el primero, recibe al visitante un rústico espantapájaros situado en una huerta que cultivan los alumnos. En el segundo, una pantalla de leds que expone los anuncios del día.
“¿Cuántas familias trabajadoras se pueden permitir el lujo de alejar a sus hijos completamente de las pantallas?”, se pregunta Álvarez, de Common Sense Media. “No creo que sea algo realista para la mayoría de los hogares. Yo tengo un hijo de 12 y otro de 6. Ni sé las veces que se han tirado al suelo gritando como locos si yo les quito la tableta. He estado en esa posición como madre y sé que no es fácil”.
Trabajadores de las grandes tecnológicas se reunieron el año pasado en una iniciativa bautizada como La Verdad Sobre la Tecnología . Su objetivo es convencer a las empresas de la necesidad de introducir parámetros éticos en el diseño de herramientas que utilizan a diario miles de millones de personas, incluidos niños. “La ingeniería informática durante mucho tiempo era algo muy técnico, no había una idea clara del impacto que iba a tener en la gente, y menos aún en los niños”, explica Pierre Laurent. “No existía una conciencia de que había que lidiar con la ética. Algo que sí pasa, por ejemplo, si trabajas en la industria médica. En la tecnología nunca ha habido un código ético claro”.
Es una lucha desigual. Padres multitarea contra equipos de ingenieros y psicólogos que diseñan tecnología para mantener a sus hijos enganchados. Pero algo está empezando a cambiar. Los gigantes tecnológicos, cada vez más cuestionados en sus políticas comerciales y de privacidad, empiezan a introducir cambios en sus productos, tímidas excepciones al sacrosanto principio de captar más atención.
El año pasado, dos grandes inversores de Apple, Jana Partners y CalSTRS (el fondo de jubilación de profesores de California), poseedores conjuntamente de cerca de 2.000 millones de dólares en acciones, enviaron una carta abierta a los jefes de la empresa de Cupertino, pidiendo que tomasen más medidas contra la adicción de los niños a los móviles. “Hemos revisado la evidencia y creemos que hay una clara necesidad de que Apple ofrezca a los padres más opciones y herramientas para ayudarles a asegurarse de que los consumidores jóvenes utilizan vuestros productos de manera óptima”, escribieron.
Apple respondió introduciendo Screen Time, una nueva herramienta que ayuda a controlar y limitar el uso del móvil. Google ha incorporado una herramienta similar, Digital Wellbeing. Para los críticos, son solo parches que no atacan el problema de fondo: la naturaleza adictiva de los productos. Hasta que eso se aborde, serán los padres los responsables de guiar a sus hijos en este mundo de potencial incierto.
“Nosotros animamos a los padres a que sean más proactivos a la hora de buscar el contenido”, concluye Álvarez. “La clave es cómo aprendemos a equilibrar, a sacarle provecho, a limitar el uso y a saber que, por su salud física y mental, tiene que haber momentos en la familia en los que no se use nada. Tenemos una campaña que invita a comer y cenar sin móviles, sin que haya un aparato constantemente interrumpiendo con notificaciones. Recomendamos también el uso compartido de los dispositivos, y hablar con los niños sobre lo que ven. Y es importante el modelo que somos para nuestros hijos. Si estamos compulsivamente viendo el móvil, justificando que es por trabajo, ¿qué mensaje les estamos trasladando?”.
La obsesión en Silicon Valley por alejar a los niños de la tecnología trasciende las paredes de las aulas. Cuando los chavales salen del colegio, se intenta que sigan sin tocar ni ver pantallas. En las familias de los altos ejecutivos de las empresas tecnológicas del valle se está generalizando la práctica de exigir a las niñeras que firmen “contratos sin móvil” .
“Yo he trabajado en casas en las que tenía que dejar el móvil en la garita de seguridad cada vez que entraba”, explica Janie Martinez , que lleva 15 años como niñera en la zona. “No podía mirar el teléfono en toda mi jornada de trabajo, y los niños no podían ver pantallas durante el tiempo que estaban conmigo. Es una locura”.
Martinez ha trabajado en familias de “perfil muy alto” del mundo de la tecnología, incluida la de Mark Zuckerberg , fundador de Facebook, asegura. Trabajos que, en los casos más extremos, pueden estar remunerados con hasta 100.000 dólares anuales. “Cuanto más alto ha sido el perfil de las familias, más preocupadas estaban por este tema”, cuenta . “No querían que sus hijos mirasen una pantalla y, por contrato, me impedían usar el teléfono. Eso me parece frustrante. Como cuidadoras, necesitamos el móvil para una emergencia. No solo para que nos localicen los padres de los niños, también para nuestras propias familias”.
Syma Latif, directora de la agencia de niñeras Bay Area Sitters, que coloca a dos centenares de cuidadoras en la zona de Silicon Valley, confirma esta tendencia. “Cada vez vemos más familias que incluyen estas estipulaciones en los contratos, es sin duda algo muy común”, asegura. “Cuando hablamos de tiempo de pantalla y niñeras, hay dos aspectos a tratar: su propio tiempo de pantalla y el del niño. Los contratos típicamente incluyen algo relacionado con los dos. Pero una cosa es que te digan: ‘Este es mi hijo y solo se le permite tiempo de pantalla a determinadas horas’. Eso está bien, porque trabajas para esa persona. La zona gris empieza cuando tu propio tiempo de pantalla es el que es dictado. ¿Tiene el empleador derecho a decirte que no puedes estar al teléfono? ¿Qué pasa si tienes un hijo en el colegio y necesitas acceso al teléfono por si te tienen que localizar, o un padre o una madre en casa que necesitan ayuda?”.
Algunos padres van aún más allá. Se dedican a pasearse por los parques en busca de niñeras que están pendientes de sus móviles mientras cuidan de los niños de otros. Cuando creen encontrarlas, las fotografían y las denuncian en grupos de madres en Internet. Son los “espías de niñeras”. Existen páginas web como Yo Vi a Tu Niñera en las que se comparten esas fotos.
“Pasa mucho en los parques”, explica Anita Castro , con 10 años de experiencia como cuidadora en la zona. “Ni siquiera nos conocen, sacan una foto, la ponen en redes sociales y preguntan: ‘¿Es esta tu niñera?’. Pero no saben que podemos estar comunicándonos con los padres. Y tampoco si soy la niñera o una familiar. Es una invasión de la privacidad. En algunos trabajos me sentía observada. Me daba cuenta de que tenían cámaras en la casa. Y hasta los niños me vigilaban: miraba la hora y me preguntaban si estaba enviando mensajes y a quién. Así que podía saber que habían tenido esa conversación con sus padres, que les habían pedido que les dijeran si yo estaba al teléfono”.

Mueller report: Collusion by the news media, not Donald Trump, but don't expect apologies

Texto completo: The mountain has labored and brought forth a mouse. After two years of hype, special counsel Robert Mueller has reported to Attorney General William Barr that there was no “collusion,” as Donald Trump would put it, between Trump or the Trump presidential campaign and the Russians regarding the 2016 election.
There will be no new indictments from Mueller beyond the few already issued, none of which charges a U. S. person with anything related to collusion. This is a big disappointment to the people in politics and the press who were openly hoping to see Trump, and his family, kicked out of the White House and thrown into jail.
And there were a lot of those people, as Grabien editor Tom Elliott noted last week:
►In December 2017, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski said the Trump team might be going to jail "for the rest of their lives. "
►Last December, CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Delaware Sen. Chris Coons — as he often does — whether he thought Trump might be facing jail time. Coons said yes, "the issues outlined against both Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, I think, continue to sharpen the ways in which it is clear that the Mueller investigation has produced a whole series of actions not previously exposed to the public. "

Skimpy Barr letter sets up constitutional battle royal to force full Mueller report release
Russian collusion is a dead end. But Mueller report doesn't end the danger for Trump.
Russians! Under my bed!: Glenn Reynolds
►Also in December, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , said Trump could be the first president "to face the real prospect of jail time. "
►In April 2017, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said the evidence he had already seen suggested "people will probably go to jail. "
Actually, it was always a crock, dreamed up immediately after Hillary Clinton’s election-night defeat by her staff to explain away failure. As reported in the campaign book "Shattered," by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, Clinton refused to take responsibility for her defeat, and the day after her concession, top officials gathered “to engineer the case that the election wasn’t entirely on the up-and-up. … Already, Russian hacking was the centerpiece of the argument. "
Though this was a matter of record — the book was hardly obscure — the news media chose to run with the Russia story, which quickly morphed from “hacking” to the more nebulous “collusion,” quite credulously.
Press credibility has taken a hit
The irony, of course, is that while purporting to worry about Russian interference in American politics, by advancing this story the press was actually doing the work of President Vladimir Putin, sowing division and confusion through the American polity.
As former Clinton pollster Mark Penn tweeted, we wasted two years, at least $30 million and a lot of institutional credibility at the FBI and Department of Justice over “a false story of Russia collusion based on oppo research that was always unsubstantiated and preposterous. ”
Liberal journalist Matt Taibbi was even harsher, calling the Russia-collusion story WMD times a million. Taibbi noted that the news media's credibility is a major victim:
Nothing Trump is accused of from now on by the press will be believed by huge chunks of the population, a group that (perhaps thanks to this story) is now larger than his original base. As (New York Times' Peter) Baker notes, a full 50. 3 percent of respondents in a poll conducted this month said they agree with Trump the Mueller probe is a “witch hunt. ”
Well, that’s because it was. Leftist journalist Glenn Greenwald administered a Twitter beat-down to some of his colleagues in the news media, saying: “If you constantly went on TV or wrote things to mislead millions into believing Mueller was coming to arrest Trump, Jr. , Jared and a whole slew of others for conspiring with the Russians, just admit it. Save yourselves the embarrassment of all this whitewashing & pretending. ”
Don’t expect any such apologies.
Collusion between the media and the FBI
We might someday need a press we can trust. But I hope not, because we certainly don’t have one.
So what’s next? Well, there may not have been Russian collusion, but there certainly was collusion between FBI agents and journalists, with agents leaking information and journalists paying them off with “tickets to sporting events, golfing outings, drinks and meals, and admittance to nonpublic social events," according to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice.
Will we see any accountability for the many ethical — and probably legal — breaches involving Trump’s bureaucratic opposition? Stay tuned. But the “Russian collusion” narrative has now imploded.

Texto completo: LONDON -- A cruise ship that set out with more than 1,300 people but became stranded off Norway's coast finally reached the shore on Sunday afternoon, after rescuers launched a harrowing operation in rough weather to evacuate hundreds of people one by one by helicopter.
More than 890 people -- 436 passengers and 458 crew members -- were left on the 47,800-ton ship, the Viking Sky, as it headed to Molde, a coastal town in western Norway. On Sunday about 4:30 p.m. local time, after about six hours of traveling at sea with one tugboat in front and another in the rear, the vessel docked.
In footage shared on Twitter, cheers and whoops could be heard from onshore.
"It has reached Molde; everything has gone according to plan," Einar Knudsen, a spokesman for the Joint Rescue Coordination Center for Southern Norway, which led the rescue operation, said by phone on Sunday.
Earlier, some passengers, who were airlifted from the ship's deck, had arrived onshore bruised and battered, the Red Cross said. Passengers told NBC News that many had been hurt by falling objects and shattered glass as waves rocked the ship.
"Nothing similar has happened before, not in this magnitude," Mr. Knudsen said.
The ship, which left Bergen, Norway, on March 14, had been scheduled to arrive on Tuesday in Tilbury Port on the River Thames in southeastern England. Passengers onboard included people from the United States, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. But when the vessel was traveling between two Norwegian ports, Tromso and Stavanger, it sent a mayday alert on Saturday afternoon that several engines had failed.
It was not immediately clear what had caused the cruise ship to lose power. But it did so along a particularly dangerous part of the Norwegian coastline called Hustadvika, according to Eirik Walle, a coordinator for the southern rescue center.
Five helicopters and several other vessels were involved in the rescue effort. (According to local reports, two helicopters also helped a cargo ship on Saturday, the Hagland Captain, which was in Norwegian waters when it sent an SOS message saying it, too, had "engine problems." The crew members were evacuated.)
Rough weather -- high winds and 26-foot waves -- hampered the effort to evacuate the passengers of the Viking Sky, which began around 2 p.m. local time on Saturday. At least three passengers sustained serious injuries.
"Currently, we understand 20 people suffered injuries as a result of this incident," a spokesman for Viking Cruises, which operates the ship, said by email. He added that they were all receiving medical care in Norway and that some had already been discharged.
The Red Cross said on Sunday that several of the rescued passengers had suffered cuts or broken bones. "Many are also traumatized by what they have experienced, and need to be taken care of when they land," the statement said.
Video footage shared by the cruise ship passengers on social media showed a terrifying ordeal as the ship swayed and furniture, plants and people were sent sliding across the floor. Other footage depicted hundreds of people strapped in fluorescent life jackets as water rushed past their feet inside the ship.
"The ship is rocking and rolling but at anchor," Alexus Sheppard, a passenger, told The New York Times on Saturday after having waited to be evacuated for six hours. "Everyone is calm, except when we get rolled by a big wave," she said.
Others commended the ship's crew members, who gave water to the passengers and made them sandwiches.
One couple, Allen and Susan Dollberg of Novato, Calif., spoke on Sunday to NRK, the Norwegian government-owned broadcaster, about their experience.
"At first we took it lightly," Mr. Dollberg said. "We thought we would be able to to make it through that water." But he added, "Then suddenly the alarms went off that we needed to evacuate ship."
Ms. Dollberg said, "We looked at each other and said, 'This is really happening.' "
"Everything was breaking, furniture, glassware," she said. "The closet doors were banging back and forth." She added, "When we got the signal to evacuate, there was no time to think about getting important things like passports."
The couple said they still had friends aboard the ship, saying it had been "a rough night for them." But Ms. Dollberg praised the rescue operation: "The crew, the Norwegian people and the rescue operation have been stellar."
On Sunday, after the ship was stranded for nearly 24 hours, the operation came under control despite the challenging weather, including strong currents, heavy winds, and high waves.
Mr. Knudsen said of the ship when it was headed to shore, "It's moving at a speed of 8 knots," with three of its four engines working.
The cause of the ship's engine failure was unknown, Torstein Hagen, the Norwegian founder and chairman of Viking Cruises, which has its headquarters in Switzerland, told local news outlets on Sunday.
He also said that the passengers would be compensated. "They will get their money back," he said, adding, "They will also have a letter from me, and be invited back again."
Mr. Hagen told the newspaper VG Sunday: "What happened today is among the worst I ever experienced. But as it seems to all end well, I've got to say we have been lucky. We keep doing the best we can."
In a statement on Sunday, Viking Cruises said, "The 479 passengers who were airlifted from the vessel are currently on shore and arrangements have been made to fly them home, with the first passengers leaving today."
It also said that the company's next sailing, which had been scheduled to embark on March 27, had been canceled. "Guests and their travel agents have been contacted directly. We do not anticipate any additional cancellations at this time," the statement said.
The ship will remain at the port in Molde for a public investigation into what happened, Mr. Knudsen, the spokesman for the rescue operation, said.
The cruise ship industry has suffered a number of disasters in the past decade, including the sinking of the Costa Concordia in 2012 and the deadly fire of the Norman Atlantic in 2014, as well as setbacks such as outbreaks of illness and onboard drug raids.

Texto completo: This week's question: Picking up where we left off last Sunday, we assembled a panel of 10 more experts and asked: What's the one 2020 election storyline you'll be watching between now and next March, when Illinois and 21 other states will hold their presidential primaries?
NANCY GIBBS
First woman to serve as editor-in-chief of Time magazine (2013-17), now visiting Edward R. Murrow Professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government
"I'm watching one storyline, from which all others follow: Will we start coming together or keep coming apart?
"Americans are divided over just about everything other than how divided we are; it's the one concern we all seem to share, with large majorities calling this a serious problem.
"Elections are usually contests between hope and fear, between continuity or change, common ground or battleground. So I'm watching which forces gain more power in the coming months: the ones reflecting values we share, or the ones deepening wounds we've suffered."
PAUL KRUGMAN
New York Times columnist won 2008 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences
"The big policy question for Dems is whether they go for Medicare for All -- complete replacement of private insurance, or Medicare for America -- buy in to Medicare if you want it, but you can keep private insurance.
"Bernie Sanders is on one side, most of the other Dems are on the other."
STEVE MOORE
UI Class of '82, former Trump adviser, Heritage Foundation fellow
"If the economy stays strong, Donald Trump will be re-elected easily. So he has to get the China trade deal done.
"This is much bigger than the nothing burger of the Mueller investigation."
CHARLIE BLACK
John McCain's chief strategist in 2008
"The storyline I'll be watching: the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination and whether it results in the most liberal nominee in history."
PENNY PRITZKER
Governor's sister, former U.S. Secretary of Commerce (2013-17)
"The issue of our time is the need to create more inclusive prosperity for more Americans at a time when the acceleration of automation and technology is impacting millions of lives and livelihoods.
"In the 2020 campaign, I want to see candidates articulate a clear and comprehensive economic growth plan that will help more Americans adapt to this seismic disruption in order to build increased economic opportunity in all corners of our country.
"We can accomplish this goal by making real investments in our workers and economic infrastructure, strengthening the social safety net and creating a culture change for lifelong learning and training support."
ROGER SIMON
UI Class of '70, best-selling author, Politico's chief political columnist
"Considering how much time the journalists, pundits and commentariat spend examining the minutiae of our presidential elections, we seem always to shatter our crystal balls when it comes to predict what will happen only a few years -- and sometimes only a few months -- away.
"Who predicted the election of Donald Trump? Though it is important to keep in mind he lost the popular balloting by nearly three million votes and won only in our bizarre Electoral College, an 18th century construct invented by a slave owner to ensure the continuance of slavery in the U.S.
"In any case, in 2020 I will look for what I always look for: Who is the more likable candidate? And even though my likability theory is usually derided -- as 'who do you want to have a beer with?' or 'who would you rather be stuck in an elevator with?' -- if you go back and examine all modern elections, the most likable candidate almost always wins.
"Go back and do it. And define 'likable' any way you wish. I think you'll find my theory almost always works. Was Donald Trump more likable than Hillary Clinton? No, but Hillary did win the popular vote.
"So in 2020, it will be a scramble not just for the base voters of each party, but for those Americans who don't care much about politics or issues. Who is more likely to start a war, be an international embarrassment or just be the most hateful?
"How do we discern that? There is no foolproof way. But I always imagine myself riding in an elevator and having a beer with the two major candidates. It doesn't always give me a clear answer as to who will win the presidency. But avoiding a drunk candidate in a small space is almost always a step in the right direction."
FRED HIATT
Washington Post editorial page editor
"I'm interested in seeing which candidates take seriously as a challenge the rise of authoritarianism around the world, and what ideas and policies they put forward to defend freedom of speech, freedom of conscience and liberal democratic values."
NIKHIL SINGH
Acclaimed NYU historian, author of 'Black is a Country: Race and the Unfinished Struggle for Democracy'
"The storyline of interest to me is whether a left candidate can prevail in the Democratic primaries -- that means either Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.
"If this occurs and the election becomes a referendum on the economy and the type of deregulated, free-market, stagnant wage, upwardly redistributionist capitalism that has prevailed in the United States over the past 30 years, I think the Democrats are likely to win.
"This would be a genuine sea change in U.S. politics."
KIM PHILLIPS-FEIN
Historian, Pulitzer finalist for 2018's 'Fear City: New York's Fiscal Crisis and the Rise of Austerity Politics'
"The triple crises of economic inequality; the militarization of our society -- a problem that Trump's fantasy of a border wall exacerbates; and climate change are the central dilemmas confronting our country today.
"The way that the candidates address, or seek to evade, these will be the key story of the 2020 election."
ERSKINE BOWLES
White House chief of staff under Bill Clinton, former president of University of North Carolina system
"How can we preserve capitalism while reforming it so more Americans benefit from it?
"I'm increasingly concerned about this issue because I believe the only way we can keep the American Dream alive for all is to increase economic mobility and broad-based economic growth."

Mueller report: Collusion by the news media, not Donald Trump, but don't expect apologies

Texto completo: The mountain has labored and brought forth a mouse. After two years of hype, special counsel Robert Mueller has reported to Attorney General William Barr that there was no “collusion,” as Donald Trump would put it, between Trump or the Trump presidential campaign and the Russians regarding the 2016 election.
There will be no new indictments from Mueller beyond the few already issued, none of which charges a U. S. person with anything related to collusion. This is a big disappointment to the people in politics and the press who were openly hoping to see Trump, and his family, kicked out of the White House and thrown into jail.
And there were a lot of those people, as Grabien editor Tom Elliott noted last week:
►In December 2017, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski said the Trump team might be going to jail "for the rest of their lives. "
►Last December, CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Delaware Sen. Chris Coons — as he often does — whether he thought Trump might be facing jail time. Coons said yes, "the issues outlined against both Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, I think, continue to sharpen the ways in which it is clear that the Mueller investigation has produced a whole series of actions not previously exposed to the public. "
Read more commentary:
Skimpy Barr letter sets up constitutional battle royal to force full Mueller report release
Russian collusion is a dead end. But Mueller report doesn't end the danger for Trump.
Russians! Under my bed!: Glenn Reynolds
►Also in December, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , said Trump could be the first president "to face the real prospect of jail time. "
►In April 2017, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said the evidence he had already seen suggested "people will probably go to jail. "
Actually, it was always a crock, dreamed up immediately after Hillary Clinton’s election-night defeat by her staff to explain away failure. As reported in the campaign book "Shattered," by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, Clinton refused to take responsibility for her defeat, and the day after her concession, top officials gathered “to engineer the case that the election wasn’t entirely on the up-and-up. … Already, Russian hacking was the centerpiece of the argument. "
Though this was a matter of record — the book was hardly obscure — the news media chose to run with the Russia story, which quickly morphed from “hacking” to the more nebulous “collusion,” quite credulously. They did so because they wanted it to be true, because they hoped it would hurt Trump, whom the press almost universally despises, and because it was good for ratings and clicks.
Press credibility has taken a hit
The irony, of course, is that while purporting to worry about Russian interference in American politics, by advancing this story the press was actually doing the work of President Vladimir Putin, sowing division and confusion through the American polity.
As former Clinton pollster Mark Penn tweeted, we wasted two years, at least $30 million and a lot of institutional credibility at the FBI and Department of Justice over “a false story of Russia collusion based on oppo research that was always unsubstantiated and preposterous. ”
Liberal journalist Matt Taibbi was even harsher, calling the Russia-collusion story WMD times a million. Taibbi noted that the news media's credibility is a major victim:
Nothing Trump is accused of from now on by the press will be believed by huge chunks of the population, a group that (perhaps thanks to this story) is now larger than his original base. As (New York Times' Peter) Baker notes, a full 50. 3 percent of respondents in a poll conducted this month said they agree with Trump the Mueller probe is a “witch hunt. ”
Well, that’s because it was. Leftist journalist Glenn Greenwald administered a Twitter beat-down to some of his colleagues in the news media, saying: “If you constantly went on TV or wrote things to mislead millions into believing Mueller was coming to arrest Trump, Jr. , Jared and a whole slew of others for conspiring with the Russians, just admit it. Save yourselves the embarrassment of all this whitewashing & pretending. ”
Don’t expect any such apologies.
Collusion between the media and the FBI
We might someday need a press we can trust. But I hope not, because we certainly don’t have one.
So what’s next? Well, there may not have been Russian collusion, but there certainly was collusion between FBI agents and journalists, with agents leaking information and journalists paying them off with “tickets to sporting events, golfing outings, drinks and meals, and admittance to nonpublic social events," according to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice.
And the connections between the Justice Department and the political opposition-research firm Fusion GPS (where the wife of senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr was paid to dig up dirt on Trump) were particularly egregious.
Roger Simon of of PJ Media writes that there is a lot of corruption yet to be investigated and prosecuted, on the part of Trump’s accusers: “It was a conspiracy and, worse yet, a conspiracy ignited and carried out from within the FBI and the Department of Justice. Nothing could be more dangerous to a democratic society than that. How high this conspiracy went is still somewhat unclear. I say ‘somewhat’ because the likelihood of it having reached into the White House of the previous administration is great. It's hard to imagine how it could have happened otherwise. ”
Will we see any accountability for the many ethical — and probably legal — breaches involving Trump’s bureaucratic opposition? Stay tuned. But the “Russian collusion” narrative has now imploded.

Here's why smart investors should think globally when watching for recessions

Texto completo: Forty-five years ago, in a world unlike now, I loved exploring old books from libraries’ back stacks.
Among my favorite finds was Wesley C. Mitchell’s 1927 opus, "Business Cycles: The Problem and Its Setting. " Mitchell, a visionary, spearheaded the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which pioneered economic data collection to understand recessions and expansions.
In Mitchell’s book, I found a crazy-fun chart I highlighted in my 1987 book, "The Wall Street Waltz," called “Conspectus of Business Cycles in Various Countries, 1790-1925,” which lines up U. S. and other nations’ economic cycles.
Starting with America and England in 1790, it expands to include major European nations in the 19th century. By 1890, it covers Europe, Australia, Asia, Canada and big Latin American nations. It demonstrated that recessions and expansions worldwide lined up globally earlier than anyone thought (via data that weren’t perfectly accurate but basically correct).
Tax season tips: 7 red flags that could trigger an IRS audit of your taxes
Trump vs. Fed: Donald Trump takes fresh shot at Federal Reserve, picks fierce critic for its board
Long before globalization became a buzzword, the world was pretty darned global. The global business cycle linkage was always stronger than commonly perceived – still is.
Throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries, America paralleled England. Maybe European nations’ cycling together in the 19th and early 20th centuries isn’t so shocking.
But China, India and Japan paralleling them, along with North and South America? All had long, 1890s recessions. All suffered recessions paralleling America’s infamous Panic of 1907.
Individual nations wiggle a ways occasionally, but major trends are global. If you understand this, then you understand why and how what goes on overseas affects you directly here at home.
Old books demonstrate the same global patterns for interest rates. Country to country, both long-term interest rates and inflation tracked each other more than people thought 150 years ago or still think now.
U. S. and Western European bond rates have typically aligned since World War II ended. But A. C. Pigou’s 1929 classic, "Industrial Fluctuations," showed retail prices in Germany, England and the U. S. moving in virtual lockstep from 1860 through 1910.
A brutally fun fact? Since our Revolutionary War, inflation spiked routinely, here and overseas, during and right after major wars. People remember the Vietnam-era 1970s’ high inflation but forget prices spiked surrounding the Korean War and the two world wars. Even the Civil War and War of 1812 brought inflation spikes. We don’t have those big disruptive wars anymore, thankfully.
These old studies demonstrate that today it’s highly unlikely interest rates soar and bond prices plunge unless the cause carries global heft. Wobbles in one country don’t ripple globally. It’s the reverse. The bulk of the world pulls wobblers back toward average.
This is truer now than 20, 50 or 150 years ago, due to technology. The biggest global banks from every continent can borrow in one country and lend to another faster than you can read this column. Any huge American bank can arbitrage long-term interest rates globally, effectively ensuring ours move parallel to overseas. So if you’re worried about mortgage rates, bank borrowing, buying or selling bonds, or interest rates’ business impact, think global.
An easy online source for global data including inflation, interest rates, GDP and much more is tradingeconomics. com.
You'll spare yourself lots of angst by thinking globally. Last year, people lost lots betting Italy’s rising long-term rates would continue tied to populist political fears. They forgot rates were rising in America and elsewhere – a global move, mitigating Italian fears. When our rates finally fell back, those speculators got clobbered. Global top-down views keep you calm, centered and wealthier, almost always.

Texto completo: Amber Tamblyn, co-star of "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" films and star of "Joan of Arcadia," has moved away from acting in recent years and toward activism. She was deeply involved in Hillary Clinton's presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2018 and was one of the founders of Time's Up, a nonprofit organization that was formed in 2018 to combat sexual harassment in the workplace.
Tamblyn has also become more interested in writing, contributing to The New York Times, as well as writing books of poetry and the novel "Any Man." Tamblyn's latest work, "Era of Ignition," is equal parts memoir and call to arms. It's a look at the corrosive impact of sexism and misogyny in politics and the entertainment industry, but it's also a hopeful story about the power of social movements to effect change. Tamblyn spoke with Variety about her new book.
The following is an edited transcript.

Q: Can you explain the book's title, "Era of Ignition"?
A: The title encapsulates the place that we are collectively as a nation. It feels like a time of immense change. Things are breaking apart in very big and fundamental ways, which can be terrifying. But it can also be a good thing. It's an opportunity for us to make real, lasting progress.

Q: This period of social unrest and activism, is it in response to Donald Trump's election?
A: Trump was a huge part of why unprecedented numbers of women marched on Washington. It's why an unprecedented number of women ran for office in 2018 and won, and it's also why an unprecedented number of women are running for president in the Democratic primary. It's a fire that we're feeling right now. Part of that is a response to Trump, but I think Hillary Clinton's loss was sort of this cherry on top of a much more deeply rooted feeling of invisibility that women have felt for so long. No matter how anybody feels about her personally or her politics, the truth is that very deeply ingrained misogyny played into the 2016 election. Every woman, at some point, no matter what she's done in her career or what profession she works in, has been like Hillary Clinton. They've been the most capable person in the room or the most qualified person in the room and they still didn't get the job.

Q: Were you disappointed that Hillary Clinton just announced she's not running for president in 2020?
A: I think that's the right thing to do and she knows that. I wouldn't want her to go through that again. I wouldn't want her to go through all the lies and the cruelty. It would be one thing if people were willing to accept her for who she is, but I think she made the smart move. I will forever feel robbed that I didn't get to experience Hillary's presidency.

Q: Where do the Time's Up and #MeToo movements go from here?
A: Well, first I'll clarify the difference between #MeToo and Time's Up. Time's Up is not a movement, it's an organization. #MeToo is a movement. The reason so many of us got together and created Time's Up is because we didn't want a woman or a man to ever have to say "me too" again. We focus on legal and legislative policy that can change the laws that have created these problems in the first place. We want to make sure there are safe and dignified workplaces for all people. The organization has been going into all these different industries where change is really needed in a large-scale way. We just launched Time's Up Healthcare, which is trying to change representation and pay for women and the LGBTQ community in the medical field. We need more women in research. We need more women on hospital boards of directors. We need more female physicians. You can look across almost any industry and see this kind of imbalance. Any person can raise their hand and say, "There's a big problem here. We need help." Time's Up will be there to support them.

Q: In the book you compare Susan Collins and her vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh (to the U.S. Supreme Court) to Soon-Yi Previn's relationship with Woody Allen. What did you mean by that?
A: I wrote that Susan Collins was a version of how men groom women to become partners that they can control. I stand by that and would happily debate anyone over that. In everything that's going on right now, we're just looking at romantic relationships and personal relationships. We're also talking about political affiliations and professional relationships. I brought up (Soon-Yi Previn's) relationship in the book to talk about some of my own abuse that I suffered in my early 20s. It's difficult to know that you're in a groomed relationship if you are a woman who is with a much older man who has groomed you to become a partner that he can ultimately control. I'm not condemning that relationship or comparing it to my own experience, but I am raising questions. How do we know that our day-to-day actions are not totally affected by the men in our lives? We need to be conscious of where men's influence ends and where we begin.

Nursing home closures require bold solutions

Texto completo: To refer to the cascading closures of South Dakota nursing homes as a "crisis" gives crises a bad name. Let's call it what it is: a disaster unfolding in real time.
The pace is accelerating. The South Dakota Health Care Association reports that a Huron facility's end marks the sixth such closure in three years, half of which occurred in 2019.
Two of the most recent closures, in Mobridge and Madison, were managed by Black Hills Receiver, LLC. The state-approved receivership still manages 16 of the South Dakota nursing homes orphaned when New Jersey-based Skyline Healthcare declared bankruptcy. The outlook for those facilities appears bleak.
The culprit is the financial loss long-term care facilities incur with residents who rely on Medicaid. The state's funding formula falls far short of what it costs to provide them care.
We've seen this coming. The party in power in Pierre has ignored South Dakota's rock-bottom Medicaid reimbursement rates for years. Their stubborn refusal to turn out their pockets and fix the problem has driven our nursing home system over the edge.
Gov. Kristi Noem, who has called this situation a priority, proposed a mere 5 percent increase to Medicaid reimbursement. At first glance, the legislature doubling that amount to stanch the financial hemorrhage looks like a bold step in the right direction.
It is a step, but it's hardly bold. It's a Band-Aid on a gut shot.
Former Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard proposed expanding Medicaid, a move that would have netted a windfall of federal funds. He was forced to abandon the effort due to resistance among the most conservative factions in his own party.
As Daugaard told the Argus Leader at the time, if legislators only crunched the numbers, they would have agreed to the expansion. But because such expansion was an element of the Affordable Care Act – Obamacare – it was a political nonstarter. South Dakota is one of the 14 states in the nation that have not yet expanded Medicaid.
That's Pierre in a nutshell: partisanship over practicality for our supermajority. In the case of nursing home closures, such intractable shortsightedness has dire consequences for elderly citizens.
These closures are not just an inconvenience for families who can't visit loved ones as often because they now live hours away. Nor are they merely late-in-life instances of residents forced from towns where they have lived most, or all, of their lives.
The closures are literally a matter of life and death. Research of mortality rates of nursing home populations being suddenly dispersed, their support systems and network pulled out from under them, reveals that it's more likely that residents will die sooner. It's called "transfer trauma."
One of its recent victims was Harold Labrensz, whose story was reported in the New York Times. The nursing home where he lived in Mobridge closed for good this January. Able to find no better option, Harold's wife found a place for him 220 miles away in North Dakota.
Three days after he arrived, he was dead.
The critical state of our nursing homes is not unique to South Dakota, and the challenges facing the industry are many. Operational margins have fallen to around zero, which makes it hard to keep quality employees due to low pay. That makes it difficult to attract private-payer residents, whose fees are needed to bridge the Medicaid reimbursement gap.
Noem's one-time $5 million grant to encourage innovation in care is a nice idea – in the long term. Innovating takes time, while implementing such measures can be costly.
We can certainly explore ways to keep our grandparents and great-grandparents independent longer, or in assisted living for longer. We might be able to find ways to lure more workers to such facilities – big breaks or even forgiveness on student loans for certified nursing assistants, LPN or RN degrees, for instance.
But all that innovation won't help if there are no more nursing homes to benefit from the changes. Lawmakers need to be able to hit the ground running at the beginning of the next legislative session. We know our new governor hates the idea, but this is the perfect time to put smart people from stakeholder agencies and organizations into a room to knock this out.
Task forces aren't the answer to everything, but they're tailor-made to solve problems that we can get our arms around. It's time for our governor and our lawmakers to take measure of their political will and take care of South Dakota.

It's time forall of us toexamine ourown biases

Texto completo: For the Monitor
As the head of a nonprofit known for taking principled stands, I believe the truth is important.
Foundational to our organization is the belief that an informed electorate is critical to our republic. So, before taking a stand or sharing information, we also do our homework to make sure we know what we're talking about, providing not only opinion but the facts we use to back them up.
Often, though, we find those facts really don't carry the weight we thought they would.
I can't tell you how many times I've heard, “If people only knew ‘x,' they would understand they need to do ‘y,' ” but typically that has been far from the case.
I know as I write this that some readers will applaud what I have to say, while others have already discounted it. Those assessments won't be influenced by the information I may share or where it comes from. It will not be viewed as credible simply because of who I am and my own beliefs. It's what researchers call confirmation bias.
And, to be fair, this is not a condition limited to a given religion or political persuasion. Confirmation bias is a very human trait and, in these divided times, is impacting us more than ever before.
Psychology Today describes confirmation bias as “the direct influence of desire on beliefs.” In short, if we want something to be true, we hardwire that belief into our thinking as fact, accepting what supports it and rejecting anything that does not, however compelling it may be.
As a nation, we are greatly divided, and with that division comes markedly different beliefs and realities.
Take social media. I'm not an expert on algorithms, but there are clear political demarcations. We tend to attract and interact with people who agree with us, creating an echo chamber of self-segregated and polarized newsfeeds. There is a certain attraction to limiting our interactions to those who agree with us, but when we do that, we never hear another point of view or learn data that would suggest something different than our world view.
In their book The Enigma of Reason, cognitive scientists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber examine confirmation bias, actually proposing the term “myside bias,” finding that while their study participants were quite adept at spotting flaws in another's argument, they were quite unable to see those same flaws in their own reasoning process – even to the point of being highly critical of their responses when presented as the differing views of another.
There have been real negative impacts of our points of view creating a reality that informs our actions, especially in politics. Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach, authors of The Knowledge Illusion: Why We Never Think Alone point out that, as social beings, we often rely on others' knowledge of an issue to form our own political opinions. When those we listen to have no real factual basis for their opinion, ours is similarly baseless. “As a rule, strong feelings about issues do not emerge from deep understanding.”
So, whom do we listen to?
Often, it's media coverage that informs us. It's one thing to be an individual with confirmation bias, but what of our news outlets? I think it's helpful to understand who comprises today's news media. Investor's Business Daily cites the results of a series of interviews of over 450 financial journalists nationwide by Texas A&M University. The journalists worked for such publications as the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post and the Associated Press, among others. Even in the traditionally conservative world of finance, actual conservatives were hard to find. Less than one-half of 1 percent called themselves “very conservative,” while just shy of 4 percent defined themselves as “somewhat conservative,” for a total of 4.4 percent who hold right-of-center views. What might their confirmation bias be?
By contrast, according to a 2016 Gallup poll, 36 percent of Americans identified as conservative while 25 percent identified as liberal. It's hard to make a case for objective and representative coverage of today's issues with such a lack of media diversity and the views held by those covering the important issues of the day.
We're only human. Isn't it time to be willing to examine our own biases and the impact they have on our thinking, not only challenging our own thought processes but those of the people and media we listen to?
For my part, I will continue to reach out to those who agree and may not agree with us, always with a desire to listen, learn and engage. I'll continue to share our fact-based research and where we stand on the important issues impacting New Hampshire's people.
Agree or not, I hope you'll at least be willing to listen.

Texto completo: Novelist Amor Towles to speak in Portland
New York Times best-selling novelist Amor Towles will talk with Pulitzer Prize-winning writer, and Mainer, Richard Russo for the Wayfinder Schools annual author fundraiser in April.
The Wall Street Journal named Towles' "Rules of Civility" one of the best books of 2011. His "A Gentleman in Moscow" earned the same honor from the Chicago Tribune ("marvelous"), Philadelphia Inquirer ("so beautifully written that every page is a joy"), San Francisco Chronicle, Washington Post ("delightful") and NPR in 2016.
The two writers will converse at 7 p.m. on April 11; an author's reception precedes the event, which will be held at the University of Southern Maine's Hannaford Hall in Portland. Tickets cost between $40 and $125 and support the alternative schools, based in Camden and New Gloucester. The schools target at-risk youth, helping with jobs, academics and life skills. Buy tickets through eventbrite.com, but don't lollygag; they are expected to sell out.
Submissions sought for new climate change anthology
Two local poets are seeking submissions from Maine writers of all ages for an anthology on climate change. Writers should send essays of no more than 1,000 words or no more than two poems on climate change to climateanthology@gmail.com. The poems and essays can be previously published or unpublished, said Portland resident Meghan Sterling, who is organizing the project with Freeport resident Kathleen Sullivan. They seek to represent a range of ages, including children, in the anthology.
How can Maine poets and essayists have an impact on a disaster that requires prodigious practical and scientific effort on a global scale to address?
Sterling and Sullivan replied to that question in an email: "Now it is up to the artists. The scientists have warned us. They have been warning us for 50 years. But we have only 12 years to dramatically reduce our current carbon use before we cross the line into unprecedented climate catastrophe. We are putting together an anthology of Maine poets and essayists whose work will wake us, stir our imaginations both for our global future and our way of life here in Maine. We are looking for writing which helps us find language for the fear, guilt and grief of this moment, and, perhaps, for the hope."
Submissions are due by May 31. Sterling and Sullivan will sort them come summertime, and they hope to get the book published next fall; one publisher has already expressed interest. Why the speed? "A lot of people are really fired up" about climate change, Sterling said, and the anthology is timed to capitalize on that.
What the mix of essays to poems will be is unclear. "I think there is a chance we'll get a nice mix," Sterling said. "We're just going to let it unfold."
Writers can also mail submissions to: It's the Artists' Turn, P.O. Box 11192, Portland, ME, 04104.

Texto completo: A remarkable set of Harvard students took their degrees in June 1976. There was Yo Yo Ma, destined to become perhaps the world's greatest living cellist. There was Jill Abramson, who would become the first female executive editor of The New York Times. And there was John G. Roberts Jr., who in time would sit “at the exact center, the determinative center, of the law in America."
That description of the chief justice comes at the beginning of “The Chief," the new biography of Roberts by Joan Biskupic, the CNN legal analyst who has written biographies of Roberts colleagues Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, and Sonia Sotomayor. What timing. This book comes as interest in the court is sky high, a fact made plain during the confirmation hearing of Brett Kavanaugh. With the bench listing to the right all eyes are focused on Roberts and how he may wield his outsized influence. Buskupic's take? Roberts “is leading a Court increasingly in his own image," she writes, adding that he “is positioned at the center in every way and the law will be what he says it is."
From first to last, this is an approachable volume about subjects often unapproachable. Biskupic, who has covered the Supreme Court for a quarter century, captures the tensions within the group, the interplay among the justices, and the pressures bought to bear on them by outsiders — and, not least, by their colleagues. With seven interviews with Roberts accounting for more than 20 hours of conversation, “The Chief" is an ample and amiable companion to such insider accounts as “The Brethren," the classic 1979 book by Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong, and “The Nine," the influential 2007 book by Jeffrey Toobin.
Biskupic shows how, from the start, Roberts was at work assembling a gold-plated resume: a top Indiana prep school, Harvard and then Harvard Law, two federal court clerkships, including one with the man who would be his predecessor as chief justice, William Rehnquist, before winning a position in the Reagan Justice Department with Ken Starr (later to win fame, or opprobrium, as Bill Clinton's grand inquisitor). Through it all he developed strong feelings about voting-rights legislation and affirmative action. Mostly he was against them.
But for all that, Roberts was, and is, no creature of Washington, nor of the conventions of the capital, though he adopted the ever-upward ethos of working Washington, assuming an ever more prominent role and battling both government remedies for social problems and government assistance to abortion. By the time he joined the D.C. circuit court those inclinations had hardened into ideology.
It was a circuitous route that took him to the chief's perch at the Supreme Court. George W. Bush selected him to replace O'Connor but soon after Rehnquist died an even more alluring vacancy emerged. He won Senate confirmation as chief with precisely the argument that won him the original support of Bush, once the co-owner of the Texas Rangers: “Judges are like umpires. Umpires don't make the rules; they apply them. They make sure everybody plays by the rules. But it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ballgame to see the umpire."
He was confirmed by a 78-22 vote. One of the dissenters was Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.
The youngest and least experienced member of the court he would lead, Roberts displayed impressive political skills in a job he would repeatedly describe as being above politics. In the beginning there were rough patches. He clashed with Justice David Souter, a man not known for range wars or, for that matter, for even the mildest confrontation. He wanted high-court unanimity but rarely got it. He knew he headed what would become known as the Roberts Court and had definite ideas about how it would be conducted — and how it would be remembered.
Biskupic shows us times when Roberts didn't get his way. And she traces how, through his tenure, his conviction that, in race and other matters, people should be considered as individuals rather than members of a group shaped his views and decisions. Identity politics was not for him.
He emerged as the principal advocate for judges (in pay matters) and for the independence of the judiciary (even upbraiding President Trump for some of his more provocative attacks on courts). But for all his efforts to assert judicial impartiality, Buskupic argues, his role in the Citizens United decision, which permitted unrestricted expenditure for election ads, clearly identified him with corporate interests.
Roberts will be remembered, however, just as much for his role in upholding Obamacare and here Biskupic provides us a surpassingly clear analysis: “A pro-business conservative he understood the importance of the insurance industry to US businesses, and he was genuinely concerned about invalidating an entire law that had been approved through the democratic process to solve the intractable health-care problem."
In his dissent in the same-sex marriage case, Roberts asked: “Just who do we think we are? This is a court, not a legislature . . . We have to say what the law is, not what it should be." And in that vote Biskupic sees the essential Roberts:
“[O]ver the course of his legal life, a time when American social attitudes were changing rapidly, John Roberts was not changing. Central to his personality was a constancy, an immovability. He was fixed in his views." For readers of Biskupic's biography, Roberts, too, will become fixed in their views.

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO >> A Minnesota man convicted of making false bomb threats against dozens of targets including President Donald Trump and the Sunnyvale headquarters of Yahoo has been sentenced to five months of home detention, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
According to court records, 34-year-old Kao Xiong wrote about 150 letters containing false information about bombings and assassinations in 2017 while he was living in Oroville.
One was mailed to Yahoo. In the letter, Xiong said he and others were going to bomb the company's Sunnyvale headquarters, according to court records. The threat was reported to the Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety, which in turn notified federal authorities.
"I am one of the UNSTOPPABLE FORCE  I am just informing that we are going to bomb this location," the letter stated.
The New York Times and Myspace received identical letters, according to court records.
Similar letters were mailed to former President George W. Bush, the Trump Organization in New York City, Dallas Fort Worth Airport, the FBI, the White House, Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport and the Mall of America.
Xiong was arrested Dec. 22, 2017, and remained in custody until May 22, 2018, when a magistrate judge ordered him released to the third-party custody of his sister, a resident of Minnesota. He pleaded guilty to a charge of making a false bomb threat in January.
According to court records, Xiong showed signs of mental illness in 2015 after his marriage ended. He received emergency psychiatric treatment in 2016, and his family arranged for him to move to Oroville to live with relatives, "believing that distance would help to relieve the stress he experienced after the end of his marriage in Minnesota."
The move succeeded in part, and Xiong got a job as a material handler at Mary's Gone Crackers, a cracker-making company.
"But he continued to hear voices, to hallucinate being poked and cut, and he became increasingly psychotic," court records state.
In addition to five months of home detention, U.S. District Court Judge Troy L. Nunley ordered Xiong to serve three years of supervised release.

Texto completo: ROME -- On the flight back to Rome after a papal trip to the United Arab Emirates last month, the Mexican journalist Valentina Alazraki got an unexpected surprise.
As the pope's customary news conference with the reporters was winding down, a large square cake was wheeled into the cabin and placed next to him. "They told me we're celebrating Valentina's 150th birthday," he said with a laugh, adding: "She doesn't look so mummified to me."
The celebration was actually for a milestone that even the most seasoned Vatican correspondents rarely reach: It was the 150th papal trip for Ms. Alazraki, who has covered Italy and the Vatican for Televisa, Mexico's largest media conglomerate, since 1974.
After cutting the cake, she offered the first piece to the pope, but he declined, saying, "It will make me get fat." Then the pope -- and the cake -- were whisked away.
That was the last Ms. Alazraki saw of the cake. She did not get one nibble. Even Alessandro Gisotti, the Vatican's spokesman, was unable to clear up the mystery. "I hope it was good," he joked.
Not three weeks later, Ms. Alazraki was again sharing the stage with the pope, this time during a Vatican meeting on the clerical abuse of minors, where she delivered a stern dressing-down to the 200 or so prelates in the audience.
Presenting herself as a journalist, a Roman Catholic lay woman and a mother, Ms. Alazraki warned the clerics that unless the church began to come clean and publicly admit its sins, getting ahead of the scandal instead of covering up or "playing ostrich," the faithful and public opinion would become ever more unforgiving. And reporters, she said, would take no prisoners.
"If you do not decide in a radical way to be on the side of the children, mothers, families, civil society, you are right to be afraid of us, because we journalists, who seek the common good, will be your worst enemies," Ms. Alazraki said.
Pope Francis had called the meeting to drive home the message to the world's bishops -- in particular those who continue to dismiss the scandal as a problem of the West -- that there in no room in the church for abusers or for those who look the other way.
Ms. Alazraki insisted that reporting abuses was the only way forward "if you want us to believe you when you say, 'From now on we will no longer tolerate cover-ups."'
Journalists, she concluded, "are not vicious wolves," but rather potential allies of bishops "against the real wolves." Her remarks drew applause in the plenary hall and from colleagues watching the speech on screens in the Vatican media room.
"It was a totally courageous speech," said Philip Pullella, a correspondent for Reuters who has known Ms. Alazraki for nearly four decades. "Only a woman could have done that, and not every woman could have done that. She spoke as a loving, Roman Catholic mother -- and then she proceeded to read them the riot act."
Ms. Alazraki was born in Mexico City in 1955. Her parents -- an Italian actress and a Mexican screenwriter and film and stage director of Turkish descent -- divorced when she was a toddler.
Though she has spent more of her life in Italy than in Mexico, she proudly considers herself "absolutely Mexican."
"My husband says that I transform when I am in Mexico and when I am with Mexicans," she said. "I am a different person."
She said she admired Mexican people, particularly Mexican women, some of whom she got to know doing research for a book about violence against women for a Catholic foundation. "They react with great strength in very difficult situations," she said.
Only when cooking does her Italian side predominate. "It's my passion, and I am a very good cook."
She was a cub reporter for Televisa when Pope Paul VI died in 1978, and she helped cover the 33-day papacy of John Paul I. Her big break came when she famously ambushed Pope John Paul II shortly after his 1978 election, and before his first trip to Mexico, by jumping out from behind some potted plants to present him with a sombrero. "If I think about it now, I was crazy," she laughed. "But it worked."
The pope was amused, and they exchanged a few words. It was "not a Pulitzer-worthy interview," she said on a recent afternoon, but she made an impression; when she started reporting from the Vatican, she was one of two women who traveled on papal trips.
Giampaolo Iorio, who covered the Vatican for Italian news outlets and has worked as a contributor for The New York Times, recalled a time when reporters who worked at the Vatican could be counted with one hand and a finger or two. "Women came much later," said Mr. Iorio, who is now retired. "And Valentina was one of the first."
Ms. Alazraki became one of the reporters closest to John Paul II. "It was a strange role," she said. "Yes, as a journalist, but also as a small bridge between him and Mexico, a country that he loved, and that loved him very much."
In 1988, during her stint as president of Rome's Foreign Press Association, she persuaded the Polish pope to visit the association (he is still the only pope to have done so). She also asked the pope to invite foreign correspondents and their families to his summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, "because it was bigger," she laughed. He did.
Three decades later, she was called as a witness to testify on the virtues of John Paul II, the first step toward the sainthood that the church acknowledged in 2014. (The reporter in her came out when she noted, in her speech to the bishops, that the pope's memory was tarnished by his protracted support of Marcial Maciel, the Mexican founder of the ultraconservative Legionaries of Christ, who was later found to be a pedophile and womanizer.)
Even now, she thinks that when people stop her on the streets of Mexico or in St. Peter's Square, it is not because she's a television personality but because they associate her with John Paul II. (She has also written several books about him).
"For 26 years, if the pope was on TV they'd hear my voice, so there's this instant pairing," she said. "They want to thank me for being a connection with the popes. It's not fame, it's fondness."
She pulled the surprise sombrero trick on Pope Francis when he went to Mexico in 2016. "The photographers are happiest when the popes put on the sombrero. It's a tradition now," she said -- though she spared Pope Benedict XVI because he is more reserved, "and I thought it would embarrass him."
Francis sat down for an hourlong interview with Ms. Alazraki around the second anniversary of his papacy, one of only a few such interviews he has granted.
Ms. Alazraki said that her great privilege as a journalist was "tied to the sensation of having touched history with my hands." She cited watching John Paul II with Fidel Castro in Cuba, with Mother Teresa in one of her homes for the neglected, and with Nelson Mandela at the end of apartheid. She cited the visit of Benedict XVI, a German pope, to Auschwitz, and a meeting in Cuba between Pope Francis and Patriarch Kirill, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church. "These moments stay with you," she said.
After giving her own presentation to the bishops last month, Ms. Alazraki returned to the Vatican media room and was greeted with sustained applause by the reporters present.
"I hope I represented you well and that you're not angry with me," she said.
Mr. Pullella joked that he was retiring early "to be her agent." Other journalists gathered around her to offer praise. But she did not give them much time.
"Thanks all," she said. "But now I have to go to work."

If you had the money, would you pay off a college admissions officer? 1 in 4 parents say they would, a new poll finds

Texto completo: If you had the money, would you bribe a college official to get your child admitted?
Fifteen percent of all American adults would answer yes, according to a new poll. And that number rises to 25 percent for adults who actually have children ages 18 and under.
It’s a hypothetical question, but certainly a revealing ethical one. There’s been a flood of outrage over the recent college admissions scandal, in which federal prosecutors charged parents with everything from paying off testing proctors to lying about their child’s athletic abilities to win a spot at elite schools. But a new poll from YouGov, a global public opinion and data company, shows that a large percentage of the U.S. population certainly doesn’t rule out the possibility of cheating and bribery when it comes to college admissions.
“It speaks to the pressure of parenting a bit,” said Larry Shannon-Missal, head of data services in the U.S. for YouGov. “Parents are aware of how increasingly competitive it is out there. They’re all reading the same articles we are about kids coming out of college and moving back in with their parents because it’s hard to find jobs that will pay enough to get a living wage.”
Even more parents — 34 percent — said they would be willing to pay someone to take an entrance exam on behalf of their child to get him or her into a good college. Of the general public, 20 percent said they would do so.
Shannon-Missal said these findings might also speak to a level of cynicism among the general population: that people see the wealthy using their resources to take advantage of the higher education system and would therefore be more likely to think that they themselves should also be able to do so, if they had the resources.
About two-thirds of adults polled said they were not surprised at the cheating scandal, and a similar number said the system is rigged in favor of wealthy students. In fact, 44 percent of adults said that, if given the money, most parents would pay to get their kids ahead.
Steering students toward specific extracurricular and academic tracks designed to catch the eye of admissions officers is not uncommon and is available at sky-high prices. A recent New York Times profile of college consultants reported that costs for these services can reach into the millions of dollars. And rigorous, expensive test prep for entrance exams remains at the center of debates around equity and inclusion.
It’s worth noting that the majority of respondents said they would not cheat: About three-quarters said they would probably or definitely not pay off a high school or college official. But if they had the money, 72 percent said they would likely pay for tutoring or test prep to get their child into college.
While the two most high-profile participants accused in the scheme — celebrities Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman — are women, the survey found that more men than women were willing to cheat in the college admissions race. When it came to paying someone to take a college entrance exam for their child, 23 percent of men said they probably or definitely would, compared with 17 percent of women. And 19 percent of men said they would probably or definitely pay a college official to secure their child a spot, versus 12 percent of women.
Some survey questions asked whether the respondent would hypothetically cheat if given the resources, but when other questions inquired as to whether they have actually cheated to get themselves or their children ahead, very few said they had. Only 2 percent said they’ve paid someone to gain an advantage for their child. Only 10 percent admitted to having personally cheated on a pop quiz, and 5 percent said they’ve cheated on a final exam.
“There are a lot of things that people could see, under the right circumstances, being willing to go to an extreme (for), but that doesn’t mean that most people have found that set of circumstances that has driven them to do so,” Shannon-Missal said.
The survey is weighted and representative of U.S. adults. It was conducted online from March 13 and 14 and included 1,259 respondents. The margin of error was 2.76 percentage points.

Texto completo: As authorities rushed to stop a gunman on a mass killing spree in New Zealand, engineers, programmers and content moderators around the globe were scrambling to keep the rampage from going viral.
It didn't work.
The terrorist in Christchurch killed 50 people at two mosques last Friday, livestreaming part of the attack on Facebook. The original video was taken down within an hour. But copies proliferated across the major platforms.
On Saturday night, Facebook announced that it had removed 1.5 million copies of the video, with 1.2 million blocked at the moment they were uploaded. YouTube declined to give numbers, although its chief product officer told The Washington Post that at times, a copy of the video was being uploaded every second.
After decades of shunning responsibility for user content, Big Tech is slowly making its products safer for society — banning anti-vaccine misinformation, for instance, and cracking down on political disinformation. More moderation comes with heavy risks, of course. Decisions about the limits of free speech would shift to companies whose priorities are driven by shareholders. But the viral spread of the Christchurch shooting video shows the limits of the content moderation machine in the face of technologies that have been designed to be attention traps. Stricter moderation or filtering systems are not the answer. It must be a priority to redesign technology to respect the common good, instead of ignoring it.
There is a special urgency when it comes to mass killings, since media amplification can inspire copycat killings, and only so much can be done in a crisis where every hour counts.
Filtering systems have been relatively successful where time is not of the essence — copyright infringement never kills anyone, even if it stays up for a week. On longer time scales, moderation works reasonably well.
For about a decade or longer, the tech companies have automatically filtered out child pornography in a partnership with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which maintains a database of "fingerprinted" videos. Starting in 2016, major platforms adapted that technology to filter for "terrorist" content.
But this kind of filtering only works when new content matches known banned content through a form of digital fingerprinting. Although the video of the New Zealand attack was fingerprinted immediately, countless thousands of people beat the filter over and over again by recutting, editing, watermarking and modifying the video itself. While harder to find on major social media platforms, copies of the video are still easily found online.
Keeping the internet, or at the very least social media, free from vile content is grueling work. The experience of content moderators for Facebook raises troubling questions about the future of human moderation and the wider danger that online content poses to public health.
Repeated exposure to conspiracy theories — say, that the earth is flat or that the Holocaust didn't happen — turns out to sway content moderators, an effect that may very well be playing out in the population at large. Repeated exposure to images of violence and sexual exploitation often leaves moderators with post-traumatic stress disorder. Moderators have reported crying on the job or sleeping with guns by their side. Turnover is high, pay is low, and although they have access to on-site counselors, many moderators develop symptoms of PTSD after leaving the job.
The killer in New Zealand sought to hijack the attention of the internet, and the millions of uploads of his video — both attempted and achieved — were a natural consequence of what the platforms are designed to promote in users: the desire to make content go viral.
In the midst of the crisis this weekend, YouTube resorted to temporarily disabling the ability to search recently uploaded videos. It's not the first time a platform has disabled a function of its product in response to tragedy. In July, WhatsApp limited message forwarding in India in the wake of lynchings fueled by rumors spread by users of the service. The change became global in January in an effort to fight "misinformation and rumors."
What happened last weekend gives an inkling of how intractable the problem may be. Internet platforms have been designed to monopolize human attention by any means necessary, and the content moderation machine is a flimsy check on a system that strives to overcome all forms of friction. The best outcome for the public now may be that Big Tech limits its own usability and reach, even if that comes at the cost of some profitability.
Unfortunately, it's also the outcome least likely to happen.

Texto completo: Michael J. Bobbitt, who has built a track record of expanding audiences and developing new work as the leader of an award-winning children's theater near Washington, D.C., has been appointed the new artistic director at Watertown's New Repertory Theatre, it was announced Thursday.
Bobbitt, 46, whose tenure will begin Aug. 1, will be the fifth artistic director in the New Rep's 35-year history and the first African-American to hold the position. He will succeed Jim Petosa, who has infused the theater's programming with a sense of topical and political urgency in the past seven years. Petosa announced last fall that he would step down at the end of this season.
The appointment of Bobbitt to head the high-profile New Rep is occurring amid what a New York Times story this week described as “a major leadership transition" that is creating more diversity in nonprofit theaters nationwide. In an interview, Bobbitt told the Globe that he sees a primary task for theater leaders as “really looking at who your community is and making sure your community is reflected onstage." He expressed confidence he could do that at New Rep, which has an annual budget of $1.7 million and attracts 30,000 spectators per year to the Mosesian Center for the Arts.
“Theaters need to get to a place of equity, diversity, and inclusivity in a way that is more about social justice than about optics," added Bobbitt. “It's a big part of who I am. In many ways, it is why I do what I do. I've become obsessed with making sure that people that look like me and people from diverse backgrounds know it is their theater."
Even before he officially takes charge at New Rep, Bobbitt has taken a step toward sending that message. He said he collaborated with Petosa and New Rep managing director Harriet Sheets in choosing plays for the 2019-20 season, and it was his suggestion to include “Fences," a drama by the late August Wilson. The story of an African-American family in 1950s Pittsburgh headed by a trash collector anguished by the fact that his dream of playing Major League baseball was thwarted by racial barriers, “Fences" will be presented in April 2020.
There have been a couple of steps toward diversity in the leadership ranks of Boston-area theaters in recent years. In 2015, David C. Howse, who is African-American, became executive director of ArtsEmerson. Two years ago, Christopher V. Edwards, who is the son of a black father and a white mother and identifies as a person of color, was named artistic director of Actors' Shakespeare Project.
The New York Times story about increasing diversity nationwide among artistic directors cited a survey finding that of the 85 leadership jobs filled in the last four years, 41 percent were by women, with people of color accounting for 26 percent. However, one of the survey's authors told the Times that “The bigger the theater, the less likely the board is to hire a woman, and especially a woman of color." Last year, Linda Chin, who is Asian-American, was laid off as producing artistic director at Wheelock Family Theatre as Boston University moved to consolidate control over Wheelock College.
Bobbitt has served since 2007 as artistic director of Adventure Theatre-MTC, based in Glen Echo, Md. During his tenure, Adventure Theatre presented around 30 world premieres, and audiences grew from 15,000 to 45,000 per year (a number that came close to 100,000 if Adventure Theatre's touring productions were counted). He said he anticipates no difficulty transitioning from running a children's theater to overseeing one that caters primarily to adults.
“The production of youth theater is exactly the same as adult theater," said Bobbitt. “It's just that the audiences are tinier and the productions are shorter." A.W. (Chip) Phinney III, board chair at New Rep, said he has no concerns about Bobbitt making the transition, noting that New Rep will require some of the same skills Bobbitt has already proven to possess at Adventure Theatre. “Growing audiences, picking the right plays, leading the staff, partnering in the community — I think those are all transferable skills," said Phinney. Bobbitt brings a host of other skills to Watertown as well, having been a director, choreographer, playwright, dancer, singer, and actor during his career in addition to running a theater.
Phinney declined to specify the length of Bobbitt's contract but said, “We hope that he will be with us for a long time." Asked whether he hopes Bobbitt can attract a younger and more diverse audience to New Rep, Phinney replied: “We absolutely cherish the loyal audience that we have; they are tremendously important to us. But every theater wants to expand its reach and expand the range of its audience, its diversity. Certainly Michael has demonstrated that he can do it."
Bobbitt says he prefers the word “opportunity" to the word “challenge," but when he describes the broader challenge he will face at New Rep, he does so in terms that would probably have all the other artistic directors in the Boston area nodding their heads in agreement. “Art and commerce, marrying," he said. “Finding that sweet spot."

Safety features as an upgrade? That idea doesn't fly

Texto completo: The passenger jets that crashed in Ethiopia and Indonesia, killing hundreds, reportedly lacked special safety features in their cockpits -- features that Boeing charged extra for.
Meanwhile, buyers of new cars have to decide how much extra they want to shell out for add-on safety features such as lane-departure warnings, technology that could save the lives of drivers and those around them.
This raises an intriguing question for the digital age: Should safety be a premium service?

Put another way, if a plane, car or other machine can be made demonstrably safer through something as simple as a software upgrade or a mechanical tweak, is there an obligation for manufacturers to ensure that users are protected by the most up-to-date features?
Put yet another way, should safety be enjoyed only by those who can afford it?
The answers seem obvious.
"Consumers shouldn't have to pay extra for safety features, because paying extra means that they are not available to everyone and they'll cost more than they should," said Jack Gillis, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America.
"By simply incorporating the latest safety features into a product, two things happen," he told me. "They are available to everyone, thus everyone benefits, and they become cheaper due to economies of scale."
But there's the rub. If a product can be manufactured and sold more cheaply yet still have an adequate level of safety, is it truly necessary to require that everything have the latest-and-greatest technological systems?
Computers can be designed, for example, that are far more difficult to hack than off-the-shelf laptops you might find at Best Buy. But they'll cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars more.
I doubt anyone would argue that the cheaper, run-of-the-mill devices shouldn't be sold. Rather, they should be offered on a buyer-beware basis.
Many drivers will say they're willing to take on a heightened risk with themselves at the wheel. On the other hand, most probably agree that when it comes to aircraft, with strangers at the controls, cutting corners is never a good idea.
The New York Times reported Thursday that Boeing and other aircraft manufacturers routinely offer a variety of safety-related features as add-ons for their high-priced jets.
For example, a backup fire extinguisher in the cargo hold. That sounds like a good thing to have in the event of a midair blaze. Some countries require that their carriers have such technology. The Federal Aviation Administration doesn't.
So Boeing charges extra for the system.
The same approach apparently was taken to an early-warning indicator that might have helped prevent the Ethiopian and Indonesian crashes, if it had been installed on the doomed jets, which it was not.
I reached out to Boeing for comment. No one got back to me.
An FAA investigation is underway. A spokeswoman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission said the agency has no official stand on people paying extra for safety technology.
Consumer advocates, meanwhile, are unequivocal in calling for access to the very latest safety measures.
"Safety should never be optional, let alone monetized for extra profit," said Emily Rusch, executive director of the California Public Interest Research Group.
"Regulators should evaluate all safety options provided by manufacturers and err on the side of requiring their inclusion, because people's safety should be the top priority," she said.
Gillis at the Consumer Federation of America pointed out that everyone benefits when products -- and especially modes of transport -- are the safest they can be.
"For example, pedestrian avoidance technology," he said. "Pedestrians benefit even though they don't own a car. Furthermore, safer products across the board reduce the enormous societal costs of accidents and injuries.
"On the other hand," Gillis added, "limiting safety add-ons not only increases their price but decreases their overall effectiveness due to less people using them."
Marsha Cohen, a professor at UC Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, said a key question is whether people can be trusted to use machines responsibly if the level of safety is merely "good enough," as opposed to being as high as possible.
"We know consumers -- humans! -- often fail to consider the need to take actions to protect themselves and others, as we all can observe on the roads with people texting and driving," she said. "Those are risks for others, not me, right?"
She, too, observed that "if everyone has these safety features, the likelihood is that the costs per unit will drop a great deal, making them less expensive for everyone."
At the risk of stirring the nanny-state pot, I'll say Cohen is correct when she suggests we have to protect ourselves from ourselves. Laws against texting while driving are just one example.
Seat-belt laws are another, and helmet laws for motorcyclists. It would be nice if we didn't need laws to safeguard against stupidity, but that's not the world we live in.
That's why I called recently for cellphone signal jammers to be installed in steering wheels.
The bottom line is that the greater the risk to people's lives and well-being, the greater the obligation to ensure that the most current safety features are incorporated.
That seems especially true if such features are little more than software upgrades and cockpit indicators, as is the case with the improvements missing from the crashed jets.
It's offensive to think that plane manufacturers and automakers see enhanced safety as a privilege only for those who can afford it, whether we're talking airlines or car buyers.
"Safety technologies cannot be solely for the wealthy," said Sally Greenberg, executive director of the National Consumers League.
"If there's a way to save lives and prevent injuries through technology, it should be standard equipment available to all consumers, regardless of income."
Boeing apparently agrees. It was reported late Thursday that the company will start including as a standard feature on the 737 Max some of the safety gear that had been optional.
But look what it cost to get there.

Vast areas of the United States are at risk of flooding this spring, even as Nebraska and other Midwestern states are already reeling from record-breaking late-winter floods, federal scientists said on Thursday.
Nearly two-thirds of the lower 48 states will have an elevated risk of some flooding from now until May, and 25 states could experience "major or moderate flooding," according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
"The flooding this year could be worse than anything we've seen in recent years, even worse than the historic floods of 1993 and 2011," said Mary C. Erickson, deputy director of the National Weather Service, in a conference call with reporters. The major flooding this month in Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa and elsewhere is "a preview of what we expect throughout the rest of the spring," she said.
Some 13 million people could be exposed to major flooding, making this a "potentially unprecedented" flood season, said Edward Clark, director of NOAA's National Water Center.
And much of the United States east of the Mississippi River, as well as parts of California and Nevada -- in total, areas home to more than 200 million people -- could see at least some flooding in the spring, the scientists said.
The projections were part of NOAA's annual "Spring Outlook," though the language of the 2019 report carried greater urgency than usual. That is not surprising, since the basins of the Upper Mississippi and the Red River of the North have already been hit with rain and snow this spring of up to twice normal levels.
"We've set over 30 records in Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota" in the last week alone, said Kevin Low, a scientist with the National Weather Service's Missouri River Basin Forecast Center. That flooding has devastated farmers and ranchers across the region, put communities like Hamburg, Iowa, underwater, and wiped out roads and bridges in others.
Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska put a preliminary estimate of $1.4 billion in damages in his request for a federal disaster declaration, including $439 million in damages to public infrastructure and $85 million to homes and businesses.
Above-average rainfall that scientists expect for the spring, along with melting snow, would add to the flooding and extend it through the central and southern United States. NOAA identified the greatest risks for moderate to major flooding in the upper, middle and lower Mississippi River basins, the Red River of the North, the Great Lakes, and the eastern Missouri River, lower Ohio River, lower Cumberland River and Tennessee River basins.
The agency's scientists also predicted that the chemical runoff from the rains would cause above-average hypoxia conditions -- "dead zones" of water with low oxygen caused by nutrient pollution that can kill fish and other marine life -- in the Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay.
More rainfall in the Midwest is a predictable consequence of climate change, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment, which was produced last year by 13 federal agencies. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, which comes down as precipitation.
The current flooding in the Missouri River basin and beyond has been caused in part by heavy rains, but has been further complicated by other factors, like frozen ground that kept water from being absorbed.
Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, said that understanding the role of climate change in weather events like the Nebraska floods required applying the tools of a growing field known as attribution science. "Without doing the analysis, you don't know what role climate change played," he said. "Certainly, floods happened before climate change."
However, he added, heavier rainfall events are among the most common conditions associated with climate change. Humans have loaded so much planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that "the starting assumption has to be that climate change is affecting everything" to some extent, he said.
"The real question isn't, 'Is climate change playing a role?"' Dr. Dessler said. "It's, 'How big a role is climate change playing, and what is the role?"'
The National Weather Service describes moderate flooding as involving some inundation of structures and roads near streams, with some evacuations; major flooding involves extensive inundation of structures and roads and significant evacuations.
By comparing this year's potential flooding to the seasons of 1993 and 2011, Ms. Erickson was citing some of the worst weather disasters the United States has faced since the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.
The 1993 flood in the Midwest killed 50 people and caused $15 billion in damages; a reporter for The New York Times called it "a watery rampage by nature like no other."
In the 2011 floods, the Army Corps of Engineers took the extraordinary measure of blowing up 11,000 feet of Mississippi River levee to let water flow into the Birds Point floodway in Missouri, saving the little Illinois town of Cairo but inundating more than 100,000 acres of farmland and homes.

Texto completo: Mayor Gavin Buckley on Wednesday said a meeting with the governor's office proved "pretty positive" for a potential deal to hand over a waterfront landmark to the city.
If the state sells the Capt. William H. Burtis house to the city, it would give Annapolis control over the current home of the National Sailing Hall of Fame and an essential piece in the revitalization of City Dock. Gov. Larry Hogan's administration will have to authorize the sale, which could include restrictions on use.
Buckley spoke at a Wednesday night meeting of the City Dock action committee, tasked with taking the findings of the Urban Land Institute's recent study and creating short and long-term action the city can take. The action committee comprises Buckley, Alderwoman Elly Tierney, chair Eileen Fogarty, Historic Annapolis board member Bill Kardash, Historic Annapolis president Robert Clark and Historic Annapolis staff Karen Theimer Brown and Ron Jarashow.
It also includes nine subcommittees on various downtown issues, including design, financing, community programming and maritime access, made up of more than 75 volunteers.
The study recommends retaining the Burtis House in its current location, but expanding and repurposing the space for a maritime museum or city offices. Buckley has long-stated his wish to relocate the Harbormaster's office to the historic waterman's home. But the report, a result of two days of interviews with residents, lawmakers and business owners, also tackles flooding, walkability and parking among other development challenges.
The city and nonprofit Historic Annapolis created the action committee to study the findings and expand on the recommendations with specific action items.
Eileen Fogarty, a former city planning and zoning director, lead the group Wednesday. She identified some of the problems plaguing the Annapolis waterfront - dilapidated alleyways and sidewalks, lack of green space - but put them in perspective.
"There was an article in the Sunday New York Times about Baltimore," she said. "You finish reading this article and you say, 'Oh my gosh, we have no real problems,' because we don't ... These are all solvable problems."
Separated into issue-specific groups, the nearly 100 volunteers huddled around tables at the Pip Moyer Recreation Center to come up with preliminary opportunities and challenges. Each group will, by the end of May, present the committee with five actions to improve City Dock in the next six to 12 months and five actions to improve City Dock in the next five years.
The action committee will compile final recommendations by October with an end goal of creating a more accessible, enticing City Dock. The full committee will meet at least four more times before October.
In conversations, the working groups chatted about everything from insufficient parking technology to waterfront walkways to keeping water clean during extreme floods.
At one end of the room, the Programming/Community Access group talked about the walkway around Ego Alley, or lack thereof.
Chris Haley, leaning over an aerial map of City Dock, pointed to the back corner of the Annapolis Waterfront Hotel. A statue of Haley's uncle sits at City Dock, "Roots" author Alex Haley.
"I stop right here," Haley said. "I don't even think I can get that far out," noting there's no continuous loop residents can take to get back to the other side of the water.
Across the room, the Parking/Pedestrian/Bike Connections group talked about tapping the city's contracted parking management firm, SP+, to collaborate on technology to identify open spaces and vary pricing based on realtime demand.
Near the front of the room, the Financial Tools/Development table pointed to different locations the city could leverage to create more parking. Near the back, business owners on the Business/Property Owners & Retail discussed pop-up events and the need for an "anchor" store to pull shoppers toward the water.
Around the room were large, glossy posters of famous waterfronts around the country - Spruce Street Harbor Park in Philadelphia, the Chicago Riverwalk, Smale Riverfront Park in Cincinnati - all examples of the attraction City Dock can become.

Texto completo: "The Invisibles" features documentary interviews with four of the thousands of German Jews who tried to hide in plain sight during World War II without being identified as Jews. Around these interviews, the film weaves dramatic reenactments of their efforts, featuring actors. What results, according to the New York Times, is "neither fish nor fowl, but a disappointingly stilted hybrid that gathers momentum only to hit one roadblock after another." Unrated. At Landmark's E Street Cinema. In German with subtitles. 110 minutes.

Cambridge University shows hideous intellectual weakness

Texto completo: As President Trump wisely uses an executive order to protect free speech against college-campus thought police, news from Cambridge in England reminds us that leftist lunacy isn’t confined just to American universities.

Cambridge University, a pillar of learning for more than 800 years, has rescinded an already accepted offer of a fellowship to Jordan Peterson, a psychology professor from Toronto. Jordan’s sins? Challenging the tenets of political correctness and criticizing an Orwellian proposal by the Canadian government that would criminalize the failure to use bizarre gender-neutral pronouns for those who want them.

In unpacking the multiple elements of this assault on right reason, one hardly knows where to begin. So, let’s posit that Peterson is distinguished in his field, and that he has a huge international following. He dares challenge the speech-controlling merchants of petty grievances who dominate academia, an affront apparently so appalling that critics take to the New York Times to spew breathless prose portraying him as an evil “custodian of the patriarchy.”

And, yes, Canada did institute a law that literally could lead to criminal penalties, including jail time, for repeatedly refusing to use a subject’s preferred pronoun gender or a gender-neutral (non)word such as “ze” and “zir” for “she” and “he.” In a series of lectures, Peterson criticized the proposal, since enacted, as the “dangerous,” “pathological,” freedom-killing abomination that it most undoubtedly is.

Almost as it to prove Peterson’s point that a sort of anti-free thought totalitarianism is on the loose, faculty and students at Cambridge erupted in protest at the idea that a free speech advocate could teach for two months at their bastion of higher thought control. The university caved, and disinvited Peterson from its campus.

Cambridge’s statement explaining its revocation of the already accepted fellowship was the epitome of clueless self-parody:

“[Cambridge] is an inclusive environment and we expect all our staff and visitors to uphold our principles. There is no place here for anyone who cannot.”

Read that again. In the very same sentence in which “a spokesman for the university” says Cambridge is “inclusive,” he/she/ze/zir/it says “there is no place here” for someone who disagrees with the school’s “principles.”

Everyone for inclusive exclusivity, step right up! Cambridge is welcome to all, except for those who are unwelcome!

One wonders if Cambridge also is home to minuscule giants, promiscuous virgins, or Churchillian Nazis. Light is dark, heat is cold, and rain is dry.

Alas, this is all too hideous to be funny. And, speaking of which, this is nothing new; it’s just that it’s worse than ever before. It was nearly three-quarters of a century ago, in his novel That Hideous Strength , that C.S. Lewis portrayed a dystopian, English university setting dominated by a Progressive Element (note the capitalizations) which would not allow dissent. Instead, it demanded “obedience to the indwelling ethos or dialectic of the whole” in which anything involving “the verbal interchange of facts would – er, would defeat its own end.” (Italics in the original.)

Unfortunately, the Cambridge University of today is behaving very much like the fictional Bracton College described by Lewis in 1945.

No dissenting views allowed. “No place here” for such things. And a descent into inhumanity and madness, of the sort that develops whenever human thought and conscience are evicted as threats to the established order.

It’s a simple truth that came to light in Bezos spectacle

Texto completo: Sometimes stories are simpler than they’re made out to be. That appears to be the case with Jeff Bezos. When the National Enquirer reported that Bezos, the Amazon founder who is the world’s richest man, was having an extramarital affair and had sent racy texts, including photos of his penis, to his girlfriend, Bezos assembled a high-priced legal and PR team to mount an aggressive defense.
All of a sudden, sympathetic commentators began suggesting Bezos had been hacked. There was word that a "government entity" had gotten hold of the texts and photos. There was dark speculation of international intrigue, that Saudi Arabia might have used the Enquirer to target Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, in retaliation for the Post’s coverage of the murder of the columnist and Saudi regime critic Jamal Khashoggi. And of course, President Donald Trump played some sort of behind-the-scenes role.
Bezos orchestrated it all, using his security consultant to feed information to his newspaper, and also writing a much-discussed personal statement published on Medium.
"This statement that (Bezos) has released tonight is absolutely extraordinary," MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell said on Feb. 7, "and I think it is a gigantic moment, actually in this history of our digital communication, which everyone has known has been at risk for quite a while, that any one of us could be hacked. We could have private things revealed through stolen emails, stolen texts, that sort of thing. And here is someone who stands up and says, I’m not going to take it anymore."
"The Saudis are being brazen," MSNBC’s Chuck Todd said on Feb. 8. "We’ve caught them being brazen with Qatar. We’ve caught them being brazen with Jamal Khashoggi. This would not surprise if it ends up being more connected to them because they’ve been acting this way."
"The Saudi connection aspect of the allegation from Jeff Bezos," said CNN’s Chris Cuomo, also on Feb. 8. "Bezos says ... that you had (National Enquirer chief David) Pecker go to the White House with a Saudi guy that he was trying to raise money from. The dinner was a reward from the president. The Khashoggi reporting that The Washington Post did would really bother the Saudis, the Saudis wound up giving Pecker the money. Pecker’s now going after Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, maybe this has something to do with the Saudis, maybe even the president."
And so on. The Bezos team spun quite a story. But holes quickly appeared in their handiwork.
In early March, The New York Times published a detailed look at how the long-married Bezos came to be involved with his girlfriend, former Los Angeles local news anchor Lauren Sanchez. As the two got together, the paper reported, a smitten Sanchez was not shy about sharing intimate details of the relationship with her friends.
"By last year, they were having an affair," the Times wrote. "Three people in Ms. Sanchez’s extended social circle said she was giddy and in love, showing amorous texts to a number of Brentwood and Beverly Hills moms."
Sanchez was, to say the least, not particularly discreet in handling the revealing texts and photos Bezos sent to her. And then there was, in the Times’ description, Sanchez’s "fame-hungry brother-manager," Michael Sanchez, described as a "loose cannon" and an "incorrigible gossip even in a town full of them."
Now, The Wall Street Journal reports that Michael Sanchez, "a talent agent who has managed television pundits and reality-show judges," has also "long been a source for the Enquirer." And, according to the paper, Michael Sanchez sold the Bezos texts to the Enquirer for $200,000.
Imagine that. Mogul sends deeply private texts to gossipy L.A. girlfriend who has gossipy, fame-hungry brother, and somehow it gets out! No Saudis required.
It is not unusual for men caught sexting with women not their wives to claim they have been hacked, or that their texts have somehow been stolen. Remember that Anthony Weiner tried the same thing. But few have the resources of Jeff Bezos, and few could rely on so many media commentators to spread the story.
At the same time, the Bezos spectacle also attracted the attention of more serious journalists, who found out that the real Bezos story is much simpler than all the Saudi speculation. It is, in fact, an old story, of people acting foolishly in the course of an extramarital affair. All the money in the world couldn’t change that.

Texto completo: 'The Good Immigrant'
Edited by Nikesh Shukla and Chimene Suleyman, Little, Brown, 324 pages, $28
Two years before the election of President Trump and the bitter politics of border walls, Muslim bans and s---hole countries, the American publishing industry was facing an identity crisis. A viral social media movement led by writers of color called #WeNeedDiverseBooks began pushing the industry to acknowledge and address its resounding whiteness. The failure to cultivate the voices of American writers of minority and immigrant backgrounds was the failure to tell a full national story, writer Junot Diaz explained in a New Yorker essay.
Soon after the 2016 election, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Viet Thanh Nguyen published a piece in The New York Times arguing that the outcome was partly the failure of writers. "The struggle over the direction of our country," he wrote, "is also a fight over whose words will win and whose images will ignite the collective imagination." Immigrants needed to tell their story -- and tell it better.
"The Good Immigrant" is a culmination of the current political moment and a natural extension of the ongoing work to integrate American publishing. The 26 essays in this anthology are deeply personal reflections on adolescence, family, love and identity as experienced and felt by the American immigrant artist. From published heavyweights like Teju Cole and Alexander Chee to newer voices like Muslim American punk-rocker Basim Usmani and Pakistani Kashmiri-American poet Fatimah Asghar, this banquet of writing is a triumphant celebration of American multiplicity.
The book was inspired by an original British edition, which was published at the height of the Brexit debate with a largely different roster of writers. In the introduction to the American edition, the editors, Nikesh Shukla and Chimene Suleyman, explain that what both collections share is their desire to amplify the voices of immigrants through a kind of collective literary activism. In a cultural climate defined by xenophobia and anti-immigrant policies, this book seeks to showcase the gifts and humanity of immigrant artists.
It's a noble mission. And yet, as a reader, I worried that a collection defined by politics could crumble under the weight of good intentions. Essays lifted from social media outrage or powered by reactionary rage can satisfy in the instant but fade as the moment passes. Thankfully, this collection is a resounding success on multiple fronts. Its righteous rage is perfectly matched by its literary rewards.
The American edition of the "The Good Immigrant" is best heard as a surround-sound chorus that bristles with an unpredictable, electric energy. Language, style and rhythm shift with each piece, keeping our attention. In "Luck of the Irish," Maeve Higgins explores how white privilege helped her, an Irish immigrant living in the country illegally, as brown families in similar conditions are prosecuted. In a love letter to her mother, Indian-American writer Krutika Mallikarjuna finds humor in the ridiculous conundrum of dating in the multiracial mayhem of Brooklyn. "Of the many pitfalls of being a queer desi woman swimming through Tinder," she writes, "I never expected to find myself getting trashed in a bar trying to forget that I was on a date with a white girl named India."
Several of the essays are by first-time authors who work in other artistic mediums. My favorite essay is by Nigerian-American fashion designer Wale Oyejide. The African-inspired textiles and silhouettes of his celebrated fashion line Ikire Jones are regularly shown on global runways and featured prominently in the Oscar-winning blockbuster "Black Panther." In an essay about his artistic coming of age, Oyejide explores the struggles of stay-at-home fatherhood with biting humor and then widens his lens to a crisis of masculinity that fails to allow men to be more than conventional breadwinners and pursue the arts. He writes about his designs as a political instrument to restore dignity and beauty to black bodies draped in shades of violence and suffering in popular culture.
"Our uprisings don't always come in the guise of smashed windows, overturned cars or respectable slave owners forcibly torn from their stone housings in front of Capitol buildings. Sometimes they come in the form of building-sized brown faces broadcast on cinema screens, portraying characters who are miles away from the token mistress we have to come to accept for want of more inspiring alternatives," he writes. Immigrant creativity is about imagining new possibility, he explains: "There will be endless stories to write. And, increasingly, there will be audiences filled with us waiting to hear them being told."
The best work here offers reflections on the creative process, alongside the fear of family, society and failure that keeps many immigrant artists from expressing themselves. The collection concludes with a call to arms by novelist Jade Chang, with a practical step-by-step guide to embracing one's voice titled "How to Center Your Own Story."
As I finished "The Good Immigrant," my mind was buzzing with the multitude of voices, stories, heartbreaks and dreams featured in its 300-plus pages. The book is a welcome corrective to the nationalist calls for walls, borders and exclusion that seek to narrow the boundaries of what it means to be American. Each essay is a tantalizing introduction -- and invitation -- to the larger body of work these artists have already created and will continue to make long after this moment passes.

Texto completo: Rep. Devin Nunes' lawsuit against Twitter generated headlines and social media buzz, but it's far less certain it will produce the $250 million payday he's seeking.

The U.S. Constitution, decades of case law from state and federal courts, a 1996 statute passed by a Republican-controlled Congress, and Nunes' own position as a lawmaker all pose formidable hurdles, according to legal scholars and lawmakers.

Twitter has "two separate layers of protections" against the defamation claims at the heart of Nunes' lawsuit, said Jane Bambauer, a law professor at the University of Arizona who specializes in data-gathering and privacy issues. First, a 1996 law generally absolves Internet sites of responsibility for content posted by their users, a move intended to foster development of a then-developing technology.

And second, decades of court rulings have made it particularly difficult for public officials such as members of Congress to win defamation claims.

Despite these obstacles, Nunes' suit is likely to further roil controversy over the role of social media in political debate and fuel Republican claims that tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley are discriminating against conservative viewpoints. Both House and Senate committees held hearings on the matter when Republicans controlled Congress, which Democrats dismissed as farcical.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Henrico County, Va., Superior Court, paints Nunes as the victim of insults and false charges spread on Twitter that cost him significant support in his California district in the 2018 election, when Democrats regained a majority in the House of Representatives. Instead of his usual sweeping majorities, the suit says, Nunes garnered only 53 percent of votes cast.

Additionally, the chamber's power shift cost Nunes his role as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a position he was using to investigate corruption in Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.

Trump, whom Nunes has supported, repeatedly referred to Clinton as "Crooked Hillary" on Twitter and at campaign rallies. His GOP allies have blamed her campaign for a dossier of salacious claims about the president that was turned over to the FBI, which helped fuel an investigation into whether Russia sought to sway the election in the real estate mogul's favor.

The congressman claimed in his lawsuit that Twitter downplayed his posts and promoted those of his critics to "influence the outcome of the 2018 congressional elections." In addition to Twitter, the suit named Republican strategist Liz Mair and unidentified platform users who went by the Twitter handles of "Devin Nunes' Mom" and "Devin Nunes' Cow," a reference to his work as a cattle farmer.

Nunes' attorney, Steven Biss, didn't return a message seeking comment on Tuesday, and a spokesman for Twitter declined to comment. Mair, who declined to address specific claims, said she would respond to the charges in a court filing.

"Suffice it to say that I have a very different view on the applicable law, including the First Amendment, than Rep. Nunes," she said. "I also believe that like every member of Congress, Rep. Nunes has sworn an oath to support and defend the U.S. Constitution, including the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment, and that as a public official, it is entirely proper and correct that his actions, political committee expenditures, voting record and conduct be subject to public scrutiny and debate. That goes to the very core of what the framers intended the First Amendment to protect.”

Nunes, a member of Trump's transition team, became a lightning rod for controversy during the first two years of the president's term, much of which was referenced on Twitter.

In late 2017, he was cleared by the House Ethics Committee of allegations that he mishandled classified information when he said the communications of a Trump aide were monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies. Early the next year, he drew fire from Democrats over the release of a memo he authored claiming the FBI abused the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to spy on Trump's team as he was preparing to take office.

Nunes, however, said in his lawsuit that his career in Congress has been marked by his "honesty, integrity and ethics." Citing tweets that he says falsely linked him to a cocaine-fueled party on a yacht and accused him of serving as a lackey to Trump and Putin while ignoring his constituents, he says he "endured an orchestrated defamation campaign of stunning breadth and scope, one that no human being should ever have to bear and suffer."

He said Twitter acted as a "vehicle of opposition research" and asked the Virginia court to order the company to suspend accounts held by Mair and the other two users and remove any posts containing "false and defamatory statements" about him. He also accused the San Francisco-based firm of quashing content with which it disagrees generally and censoring conservative viewpoints in particular.

While Twitter has denied such behavior, it wouldn't be illegal. The U.S. Constitution bars government from interfering with freedom of speech, but it contains no comparable prohibitions on businesses or individuals doing so, a point Democratic lawmakers made repeatedly during hearings on anti-conservative bias in social media last year.

"Twitter will always default to free and open exchange," CEO Jack Dorsey told the House Energy and Commerce Committee in September. "We believe it’s dangerous to ask Twitter to regulate opinions or to be the arbiter of truth. We’d rather be judged by the impartiality of outcomes and criticized when we fail this principle."

As for Nunes' defamation claim, landmark Supreme Court rulings such as New York Times vs Sullivan , in 1964, set a high bar for such claims by public officials, even beyond the baseline principle in U.S. law that plaintiffs must prove the statements about which they're complaining are false, Bambauer noted. In other countries, including the United Kingdom, the burden of proof rests with defendants, who must prove the statements they made were true.

In Sullivan, the high court said public officials must prove that a defamatory statement was made with "actual malice," which justices defined as knowledge that the statement was false or reckless disregard as to whether it was true.

That and other well-known cases "make clear that in order to be libelous, the author needs to be making a statement of fact that readers understand to be factual and not satirical," Bambauer said. "The author has to know that this is false and be willing to say it anyway."

While Nunes also took issue with Twitter memes such as the one included in his lawsuit showing sketches of himself, Trump, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in a sexually suggestive position, the Supreme Court said in a 1988 ruling that parodies don't constitute libel.

In Hustler v. Falwell , the court unanimously tossed out damages of $150,000 to televangelist Jerry Falwell over a November 1983 magazine piece that depicted him describing a sexual encounter with his mother in an outhouse.

"Despite their sometimes caustic nature, from the early cartoon portraying George Washington as an ass down to the present day, graphic depictions and satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public and political debate," then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote for the majority. "The caricature of [Falwell] and his mother published in Hustler is at best a distant cousin of the political cartoons described above, and a rather poor relation at that. If it were possible by laying down a principled standard to separate the one from the other, public discourse would probably suffer little or no harm. But we doubt that there is any such standard."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The father of Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and a key White House adviser, authored an opinion piece in the Washington Post pushing back against accusations of corruption and conflicts of interest.
"Over the past two years, the news media have told a story about my family and our business with little regard for nuance, logic or even facts," Charles Kushner writes. "Though I am a private person and prefer to keep the details of my family’s business as private as possible, I want to set the record straight. "
Charles Kushner, who founded Kushner Companies, took the rare step of speaking out after a book about his son and daughter-in-law, Ivanka Trump, was released on Tuesday that raised concerns about the pair's influence within the White House and made accusations that their positions stand to increase their personal wealth.
The book, "Kushner, Inc. : Greed. Ambition. Corruption. The Extraordinary Story of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump," details the rise of the couple and gives a behind-the-scenes look at their roles within the White House. It chronicles Kushner's role in the Middle East and the controversy surrounding how he obtained a top-secret security clearance.
"I think that you can't underestimate the dangers of these two," Vicky Ward, the author of the book, told CNN on Wednesday, adding that the pair, who are often regarded as a voice of reason within the White House, are "absolutely not what they seem. "
Charles Kushner addressed the criticism head-on, writing about his father, a Holocaust survivor, teaching him the ropes of real estate. He writes that his son, now a senior adviser to President Donald Trump and a representative for the U. S. in Middle East peace negotiations, did the same and helped their business flourish over the years.
"Jared’s service to the country has brought unprecedented scrutiny of the Kushner Companies from the media and government investigators," he writes. "We are happy to assist with all inquiries, but I must note that we are already voluntarily adhering to the strictest standards to avoid even the appearance of conflicts. "
He wrote about scrutiny the company was under in regards to a building purchased in New York before the 2008 financial crisis, when some media outlets, including the New York Times, reported that to recoup from losses on the purchase, the company was seeking partners and financing from investors in the Middle East and China.

"Critics and media reports suggested that the Kushner Companies itself was somehow jeopardized by 666 Fifth Ave. — and that the company had been forced to seek illicit or inappropriate foreign investors," Kushner wrote. "Both narratives are false. "
He continued, however, saying that a building like that in New York was a "trophy" asset, something that often appeals "to foreign investors," adding, "that's a legal and appropriate stream of funding. "
Charles Kushner says his son gave up all holdings within the company when he took a role within the White House, a decision that has affected the company's dealings.
"We have passed up many business opportunities that we normally would have pursued," he writes. "That might not be as alluring as some of the crazy stuff I read about my family and our business. But it happens to be the truth. "

Texto completo: El presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador se reunió el martes en la noche con Jared Kushner , asesor y yerno del presidente Donald Trump , en casa de un “amigo en común”, reveló el propio mandatario mexicano en su conferencia mañanera.
Aunque el morenista no dijo el nombre del amigo se confirmó que el encuentro fue en la residencia de uno de los vicepresidentes de Televisa, Bernando Gómez , donde se desarrolló una cena a la que acudieron el secretario de Relaciones Exteriores, Marcelo Ebrard , y el encargado de negocios de la Embajada de Estados Unidos en México, John Creamer.
“ Estuvimos cenando hasta las 10 u 11 de la noche (…) básicamente abordamos lo de la cooperación para el desarrollo, el que podamos firmar un acuerdo bilateral para garantizar inversiones en Centroamérica y en el país del orden de $10,000 millones de dólares” , presumió el mandatario, quien no explicó porqué se organizó un evento oficial en una residencia privada, pero destacó la inversión. “Para que haya empleos, que haya trabajo y que la migración sea opcional, no forzada por la falta de oportunidades o la violencia”.
Genaro Villamil , director del Sistema de Radiodifusión del Estado Mexicano reconfirmó en Twitter que el encuentro fue en la residencia de Gómez, quien no es la primera vez que destaca en el escenario político de ese país, ya que durante el Gobierno de Enrique Peña Nieto fue el enlace con la empresa de Emilio Azcárraga Jean .

Texto completo: Diana Kennedy is 95, and she’s still upset about the garlic in your guacamole.
The British firebrand and cookbook author is the subject of a new documentary called “Nothing Fancy” from Austin director Elizabeth Carroll that had its world premiere during South by Southwest. The film won the Special Jury Recognition for Excellence in Storytelling in the full-length documentary category.
Featuring home videos, personal photos, interviews with more than half a dozen chefs, music from Austin composer Graham Reynolds and unprecedented access to Kennedy and her Michoacán homestead, the documentary captures the feistiness and passion of the “adorable narcissist” who continues to teach cooking classes and travel to talk about her work.
The film focuses on Kennedy in her home about 100 miles outside Mexico City, which has become both her personal sanctuary and a living cultural center, housing the cazuelas, comales and molcajetes that Kennedy has gathered during her years of travel. “These are my treasures,” she says pulling down some of the cooking vessels in her kitchen.
“Each represents a journey into someone’s kitchen or a market.”
The documentary features many quiet, poignant moments with Kennedy, as well as the defiant, funny ones when she gives culinary students a hard time about messing up rice or expresses her dismay about how garlic-loving Americans make guacamole.
It was fascinating to learn how she became an authority in Mexican cooking, even more so than chef Rick Bayless, who is interviewed in the film.
During World War II, Kennedy worked in the Women's Timber Corps, a British civilian organization whose workers felled trees. “I’ve been planting trees ever since,” she says.
On holiday in Haiti in the 1950s, Kennedy met her soon-to-be husband, Paul, who was a foreign correspondent with The New York Times. They met and married shortly thereafter, and Kennedy joined him in Mexico City.
When Paul traveled for work, Kennedy would get on a bus to head out for her own work, interviewing Mexican cooks about how they made everyday and specialty dishes, including exacting details about where they got the ingredients and the methods used to prepare the food.
In the mid-1960s, Paul Kennedy fell ill with prostate cancer, and they moved to New York City for his treatments. He died in 1967, and Kennedy says she felt “lonely at sea and shell-shocked” in New York.
She and Paul had hosted New York Times food editor Craig Claiborne in Mexico City, and Claiborne was the first to write about Kennedy’s love of Mexican food in the U.S. She had thought about teaching classes, but she didn’t actually start teaching them until he published an article promoting the classes in the newspaper.
Within a few years, Kennedy, who never remarried, was ready to plant her roots in Mexico and poured herself into her studies. Instead of riding the bus, she started driving around the country. She slept in her truck or in a hammock strung up outside. “I felt more at home the more I went,” she says.
The film touches (too) briefly on Josefina Velázquez de León, a Mexican celebrity chef who published more than 140 cookbooks from the 1930s to the 1960s and was the country’s original culinary anthropologist. Kennedy mentions that de Leon’s work inspired her own but that she wanted to build upon it to find out “how people lived and what the landscape looked like.”
During her travels, she also collected seeds and cuttings, which now grow as well-established plants in a greenhouse at her house — peppers, herbs, vegetables and fruits that Kennedy sees as integral to making the dishes as true to their origins as possible.
Naming the recipes, giving them context and giving credit to where they came from is how Kennedy earned the respect of Mexicans and culinary historians abroad. Kennedy has been recognized many times by the Mexican government for her contributions to the study of Mexican cuisine, and most of her books have been released in Spanish.
The University of Texas Press has published and reissued several of her books, including 2010’s “Oaxaca al Gusto: An Infinite Gastronomy,” “My Mexico” and “Nothing Fancy,” the 1984 book from which the documentary gets its name.
Carroll featured thoughts about Kennedy from Latin chefs Pati Jinich, Jose Andrew and Gabriela Cámara, but the film only features one interview in Spanish. Chef Abigail Mendoza, who has known Kennedy for 35 years through her restaurant, Tlamanalli, in Oaxaca, called her “an adoptive daughter of Mexico.”
What separates Kennedy from many non-Mexican chefs who have studied the cuisine is that she keeps the recipes as she learned them, not adding her own variation, and for that “the people of Mexico will be indebted to her work,” Jinich says.
Although in remarkable health and still driving, Kennedy talks about her anxieties about growing old. “I wish I could make a pact with the devil and retrace all my steps in this country. There’s too much to do,” she says, looking around her office that holds more than 60 years of papers and notes.
What will happen to her life’s work? Carroll said that Kennedy is still trying to figure that out.
Although she doesn’t use social media, Kennedy uses a computer and doesn’t shy away from sending comments to publications that get her story (or her recipes) wrong. “The more we are connected electronically, the less we are unified,” she says. “What’s life about if you can’t make yourself heard? ... Who else is going to start screaming when I’m gone?”
At the premiere at the Alamo Ritz on March 9, Carroll said she hadn’t heard about Diana Kennedy until about six years ago, when she was doing some research about Mexican culinary experts. When she searched for more information about her online, she discovered that Kennedy had a book signing in Austin the next day.
She stopped by the book talk and introduced herself to Kennedy, who was surprisingly open about having a documentary crew follow her, and over several years, Carroll and her crew went to Mexico several times for interviews, each time getting to know Kennedy a little more. At this point, she feels comfortable around the notoriously prickly author. “She hasn’t seen the film, so we’ll see how that goes.”
Kennedy’s legacy has been well-established for decades, but only now have we seen how and why she earned that respect in the first place. Carroll pored through countless hours of home videos and television clips to show the author at various stages during her life, and the footage she gathered over the past five years offers a priceless glimpse into her perseverance and quirky personality.
In one of those scenes, Kennedy’s thoughtfulness, not her prickliness, comes through. She’s cooking beans during a segment of “The Art of Mexican Cooking,” a 1992 cooking show that never aired, and she explains that sometimes things take longer than you think to accomplish. “Cooking is great therapy,” she says. “I think we need things that take a long time.”

Texto completo: "Once you release data or provide data to an entity, the ball is now in their court to be good stewards of that data." Eva Velasquez President and CEO of the nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center
The headlines are constant: Millions of accounts hacked. Health and financial data stolen. Personal information shared widely with advertisers and technology companies.
New Jersey is not immune. More than 4 million New Jersey accounts were affected by security breaches in 2017, according to the most recent state estimates, and a Pew survey published that year found that a majority of Americans have personally experienced some sort of data theft or fraud.
Welcome to the new normal.
Against that backdrop, New Jersey is starting to grapple with some of the thorniest questions of the digital age. Yes, consumers can take steps to protect themselves online, as outlined by the state's cybersecurity unit. But what responsibilities do companies have in collecting your personal information? Who controls that data? And what should be done if it's compromised?
State policymakers are debating those issues right now. New Jersey law already requires companies to tell customers when information such as Social Security or credit card numbers is hacked, but a bill on Gov. Phil Murphy's desk would expand that list to include things like email addresses and passwords, which are often all that is needed to break into an online account.
Other measures working their way through the Legislature would allow online users to opt out of having their personal information shared with third parties and require mobile apps to better inform users of how their location data may be used.
The reexamination of New Jersey's laws governing cybersecurity and online privacy comes in the wake of numerous high-profile data breaches — affecting Marriott, Yahoo, Panera, Under Armour, Target, Equifax and Home Depot, to name just a few companies — and as incidents like the Cambridge Analytica scandal involving the unauthorized use of Facebook profiles have made people more sensitive to how tech firms monetize user-generated information.
This month, The New York Times reported that Facebook is under criminal investigation for data-sharing deals it made with scores of other technology companies that provided intrusive access to users' personal information.
Dozens of other states are looking to update their consumer protection policies, too. At least 31 states, for example, considered legislation to amend existing security breach laws last year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"It is absolutely a best practice for states to be reviewing their current data breach notification laws and any of the laws that are around identity crimes and cybersecurity and things of that nature because this is such a dynamic space," said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that offers free assistance to victims of identity theft and provides educational resources about online fraud and security.
Her organization tracked 1,244 security breaches that occurred throughout the U.S. in 2018, exposing a staggering 447 million records — more than double the number of records exposed the previous year.
The proposals in New Jersey could have sweeping effects on consumers and companies alike.
The measure closest to becoming law, S-52, would force companies to disclose data breaches involving an expanded definition of "personal information." The bipartisan bill was approved unanimously in the Legislature and now awaits a signature or veto by Murphy, a Democrat.
Current state law mandates that companies tell customers when their driver's license numbers, Social Security numbers, account numbers or credit or debit card numbers have been compromised. The bill would expand that list to include user names, email addresses and passwords or security questions and answers that could be used to gain access to an online account.
"You take someone's user name and password — that can already be linked to their credit card account" on many websites, said Sen. Troy Singleton, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the bill. With notification of the breach, however, consumers can potentially take defensive measures or at least monitor the compromised account more closely, he said.
Another bill that has yet to receive a hearing in committee, A-3541, gets to the heart of another big question after security breaches: When do customers have the right to know that their information was compromised?
Current law simply says disclosures must be made "in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay." The bill would accelerate that timeline, requiring companies to disclose a breach to customers within five days of discovering it unless it is still under investigation by the company or law enforcement.
Other proposals would change what data companies have control of in the first place.
One measure, A-4974, would require mobile apps that collect users' GPS data to share how that data is used and require users to opt in to the disclosure of that data to third parties, such as advertisers.
Another measure, S-2834, is modeled on language from the European Union's sweeping new data protection legislation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. It would require commercial websites and services to tell users all the "personally identifiable information" they collect and give users a chance to opt out of having that data shared with third parties.
A similar provision was included in the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was also modeled on the GDPR and signed into law last year.
Those bills, which have been approved in one committee but must clear several more procedural hurdles before becoming law, have encountered resistance from companies whose business models depend on the collection and sale of personal information.
At a hearing in Trenton last month, Gerard Keegan, vice president for state legislative affairs with CTIA, a trade association for the wireless communications industry, argued that the proposals would have unintended consequences and could undercut many of the products and services that people enjoy.
"Many news sites, online content providers, apps provide those services and products free of charge because they are supported by advertising," Keegan said. "To force those companies to still provide those services and products to consumers who won't share identifying information with advertisers is wrong and will possibly lead to those companies' being shut down in the state."
The future of the bills remains uncertain, but their introduction reflects a growing awareness among residents and lawmakers about how information shared online can be used, abused or stolen.
Asked for her suggestions about how people can improve the security of their personal information, Velasquez, of the Identity Theft Resource Center, emphasized the need to think critically about where to share such information in the first place.
"Once you release data or provide data to an entity, the ball is now in their court to be good stewards of that data," she said. "Make that decision carefully. Give it the thought and provide it the internal weight that it deserves."

Texto completo: ASHEVILLE – A libel case against nationally known right-wing "guerrilla journalist" James O'Keefe and his organization Project Veritas will go to a jury trial here in federal court.
That follows a March 19 decision by Judge Martin Reidinger in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina Asheville Division. Jury selection for the civil trial could start as soon as May 20.
O'Keefe is being sued by Shirley Teter, a disabled Asheville woman whom police said was assaulted outside a Sept. 12, 2016, Donald Trump campaign rally at the U.S. Cellular Center.
Project Veritas made a video after the rally stating Teter was a paid Democratic operative. Teter sued, saying that was untrue and that threatening comments posted online with the video have caused her to fear for her and her family's safety. Her lawsuit claims the video amounted to libel and broke a state law against "unfair or deceptive acts or practices" affecting commerce.
Judge: Libel case can move forward, other aspects not In the March 19 court proceedings, Reidinger ruled against O'Keefe's attorneys, who asked for a summary judgment to stop a libel trial.
The judge sided with the defense attorneys on their motion to disallow the state charges found in Chapter 75 of the North Carolina General Statutes. The case is multilayered and involves media freedom issues, questions of whether Teter was a public figure and arguments over whether the allegations in the Project Veritas video amounted to defamation.
Defamation and libel cases face different restrictions, depending on whether a public official or figure is involved.
"On the law it is a very complex case," Reidinger said. "The legal issues here for the lawyers are difficult."
O'Keefe was not at the hearing. Teter attended, wearing a supplemental oxygen device she said needs to treat her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
O'Keefe is known for using hidden cameras and false identities to try to get embarrassing information on media organizations and left-leaning advocacy groups. He has talked openly about his group's deceptive tactics — techniques considered ethically out of bounds by mainstream journalists.
In the video, Americans United for Change consultant Scott Foval says "she was one of our activists." In the footage shown, Foval does not indicate the "she" is Teter.
At the court hearing, a member of Teter's legal team, attorney Jonathan Sasser, pointed to an affidavit by Foval, saying he was not referring to Teter with the statement.
But attorney James Dean of Winston-Salem, a member of O'Keefe's legal team, said O'Keefe understood Foval to be talking about Teter.
"He told us that was Teter's role."
Public figure? Whether O'Keefe believed Foval was talking about Teter will matter less if it is determined Teter was a public figure. That was a point the attorneys and Reidinger spent a large portion of the hearing discussing.
"The media has a certain degree of license when it comes to public figures to present things out of context," the judge said.
O'Keefe's attorneys argued Teter was a public figure at the time because when she was interviewed about the 2016 incident, she "injected" herself into the larger public political debate about Trump supporters being "deplorable."
Teter's attorneys said the national attention she received, including stories from the New York Times, was not enough to make her legally a public figure and that the focus of the articles was not about public policy.
"Every article about her is an article about her being punched," said Sasser.
The allegation she was assaulted came more than two years ago after the downtown Trump rally.
Teter, who said she had walked to the rally from her nearby apartment, joined protesters who were yelling and pressing toward exiting rally goers.
Police said rally attendee Richard Campbell of South Carolina assaulted Teter, but the charge was later dismissed by Buncombe County prosecutors.
About a month after the rally, Project Veritas released the video.

Diversity root cause of dual loyalty?

Texto completo: We can't be divided by race, religion, by tribe. We're defined by those enduring principles in the Constitution, even though we don't necessarily all know them."
So Joe Biden told the firefighters union last week.
But does Joe really believe that? Or does that not sound more like a plea, a wistful hope, rather than a deep conviction?
For Biden surely had in mind the debate that exploded in the House Democratic caucus on how to punish Somali-American and Muslim Congresswoman Ilhan Omar for raising the specter of dual loyalty.
Rebutting accusations of anti-Semitism lodged against her, Omar had fired back: "I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK to push for allegiance to a foreign country."
Omar was talking about Israel.
Republicans raged that Nancy Pelosi's caucus must denounce Omar for anti-Semitism. Journalists described the raising of the "dual loyalty" charge as a unique and awful moment, and perhaps a harbinger of things to come.
Yet, allegations of dual loyalty against ethnic groups, even from statesmen, have a long history in American politics.
In 1915, ex-President Theodore Roosevelt, at a convention of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, bellowed: "There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism ... German-Americans, Irish-Americans, English-Americans, Scandinavian-Americans, or Italian-Americans.
"There is no such thing as a hyphenated American who is a good American. The only man who is a good American is a man who is an American and nothing else."
The New York Times headline the next morning:
"Roosevelt Bars the Hyphenated."
It continued: "No Room in This Country for Dual Nationality, He Tells Knights of Columbus. Treason to Vote as Such."
What would Roosevelt think of the dual citizenship of many Americans today? If someone is a citizen of more than one country, how do we know where his primary allegiance lies?
Does not dual citizenship, de facto, imply dual loyalty?
Nor was the Rough Rider alone in his alarm. As America edged toward intervention in the European war, President Woodrow Wilson, too, tore into "the hyphenates":
"The passions and intrigues of certain active groups and combinations of men amongst us who were born under foreign flags injected the poison of disloyalty into our most critical affairs. ...
"I am the candidate of a party, but I am above all things else, an American citizen. I neither seek the favor nor fear the displeasure of that small alien element amongst us which puts loyalty to any foreign power before loyalty to the United States."
In another address, Wilson declared:
"There is disloyalty active in the United States, and it must be absolutely crushed. It proceeds from ... a very small minority, but a very active and subtle minority. It works underground but it shows its ugly head where we can see it, and there are those at this moment who are trying to levy a species of political blackmail, saying: 'Do what we wish in the interest of foreign sentiment or we will wreak our vengeance at the polls.'"
What did Ilhan Omar say to compare with that?
Roosevelt and Wilson had in mind some German and Irish citizens whose affection for the lands and peoples whence they came made them adversaries of Wilson's war, into which we would soon be dragged by a WASP elite with deep ties to Great Britain.
Our Founding Fathers, too, were ever alert to the dangers of dual loyalty. In his farewell address, President Washington warned against a "passionate attachment" to any foreign nation that might create the illusion of some "common interest ... where no common interest exists."
Did FDR fear dual loyalty? His internment of 110,000 Japanese, mostly U.S. citizens, for the duration of World War II, suggests that he did.
Did not the prosecution of American Communists under the Smith Act, begun by Truman and continued by Eisenhower, suggest that these first postwar presidents saw peril in a secret party that gave allegiance to a hostile foreign power?
Where Wilson, TR and FDR distrusted ethnic and racial minorities, Truman went after the ideological enemies within -- the Communists.
What defines us, said Joe Biden, are the "enduring principles in the Constitution, even though we don't necessarily all know them ."
But if these principles, of which many Americans are not even aware, says Joe, are what define us and hold us together, then what is it that is tearing us apart?
Is it not our differences? Is it not our diversity?
Is it not the powerful and conflicting claims of a multiplicity of races, religions, tribes, ethnicities, and nationalities, as well as clashing ideologies, irreconcilable moral codes, a culture war, and conflicting visions of America's past -- the one side seeing it as horrible and hateful, the other as great and good?
"Diversity is our greatest strength!" we are ever admonished.
But where is the evidence for what appears to be not only an inherently implausible claim but a transparently foolish and false one?

Texto completo: El economista Alan Krueger , quien fuera asesor financiero de los expresidentes Barack Obama y Bill Clinton se suicidó este fin de semana a los 58 años de edad. La noticia de su fallecimiento la anunció este lunes la Universidad de Princeton (Nueva Jersey) donde el economista impartía clases. Más tarde, la familia del difunto hizo público que Krueger había acabado con su propia vida .
En la mañana del sábado, la policía de Princeton encontró el cuerpo sin vida del profesor en su propia casa . Poco después del anuncio del fallecimiento, tanto Bill Clinton como Barack Obama expresaron públicamente su admiración hacia Krueger como economista y servidor público y mostraron sus condolencias hacia su familia.
“Alan Krueger fue un economista brillante para el interés público ” -dijo en Twitter el expresidente Clinton. Y resaltó la investigación de Krueger que desembocó en la subida del salario mínimo . Entre 1994 y 1995, durante la administración Clinton, Krueger fue el economista jefe del Departamento de Trabajo.
Según indicó el rotativo The New York Times, donde Krueger colaboraba habitualmente, el economista investigó la relación entre el salario mínimo y el desempleo . Su conclusión fue que que establecer una cantidad no reducía el empleo de aquellos trabajadores con menor renta. Recientemente, como también resalto Clinton es su tweet, estudió el papel de la epidemia de los opiáceos -emergencia nacional desde 2017- en la reducción del empleo entre los hombres .
Alan Krueger was a brilliant economist for the public interest—from his research proving that raising the minimum wage doesn't increase unemployment, to his recent work showing that America's opioid epidemic has increased it. My thoughts are with his family. We lost him too soon.
— Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) March 18, 2019
Por su parte, Barack Obama dijo en declaraciones que “ Estados Unidos había perdido un economista brillante y muchos de nosotros a un amigo querido “. El expresidente también resaltó que la política económica de Krueger estaba enfocada en “mejorar la vida de la gente”.
Krueger fue asesor de Obama durante la crisis financiera de 2008 y también durante su posterior recuperación . También fue subsecretario del Tesoro y más tarde presidente de Consejo de Asesores Económicos de la Presidencia estadounidense.
Según el Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EEUU (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés); las muertes por suicidios, drogas, medicamentos y alcohol alcanzaron un máximo histórico en 2017: más de 150,000 personas, una cifra que dobla la de 1999 .

Amy Schumer talks about pregnancy and her husband, Chris Fischer

Texto completo: On Monday night, the eve of the premiere of her new Netflix stand-up special “Growing," comedian Amy Schumer wrote a heartfelt Instagram post thanking everyone involved, with a loving shout-out to her husband, Martha's Vineyard chef Chris Fischer . 
“But thank you to my husband, Chris, who has kept me going during this pregnancy," Schumer wrote. “His willingness and desire to be open with the world about himself and our marriage is courageous and beautiful.
“He makes me laugh more than anyone and he laughs at me more than anyone. I am more than grateful to have found such an amazing partner and best friend. I'm shocked. I didn't think this love was out there for me. But it was and it is and I can't wait to spend my life with you and our growing family."
In “Growing," which is now streaming, Schumer focuses on the major updates in her life since her 2017 special: her marriage and pregnancy. But the comedian also touched on some of the more serious parts of her life, namely a diagnostic revelation about her husband.
“I knew from the beginning that my husband's brain was a little different than mine," Schumer said. “My husband was diagnosed with what used to be called Asperger's. He has autism spectrum disorder. He's on the spectrum."
“And once he was diagnosed, it dawned on me how funny it was, because all of the characteristics that make it clear that he's on the spectrum are all of the reasons that I fell madly in love with him," she said. “That's the truth. He says whatever is on his mind. He keeps it so real. He doesn't care about social norms or what you expect him to say or do."
Schumer, who has battled severe nausea throughout her pregnancy, has been open with her fans about preparing for baby — vomiting on video, posting photos that showed her hooked up to an IV, even canceling her comedy tour because of health issues. It's all in keeping with who she is as a person and a performer. As Schumer told the New York Times this month, “Being cool is powerful in this industry, but there's nothing more powerful than not giving a [expletive]."

What The Times's Deputy General Counsel Really Does All Day
______
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
This week on the Book Review podcast, the host and editor of the Book Review, Pamela Paul, was joined by David McCraw. He didn't have far to travel; he works in the building, as The Times's deputy general counsel. They talked about his new book, "Truth in Our Times: Inside the Fight for Press Freedom in the Age of Alternative Facts," and about Mr. McCraw's life on the job, including what it's been like to fight legal battles against President Trump and Harvey Weinstein. A lightly edited excerpt from their conversation follows.
PAMELA PAUL: What drew you specifically to this intersection of journalism and the law?
DAVID MCCRAW: I had been a journalism major in college; after I graduated, I worked at a newspaper in Iowa. I later was a newspaper columnist at a very small paper in upstate New York and did a lot of freelance writing.
PAUL: We now have proof that you've been a writer all along.
MCCRAW: I've been a writer, but nobody cried the day I left journalism. I'm in a much better position to contribute in my current role.
PAUL: What does a day at The Times look like for you?
MCCRAW: It is really a buffet, and a very, very long and varied buffet. I do everything from review contracts for our trucking, when we're delivering newspapers in outer reaches of America and need to have a truck take the papers from a printing plant to a place to be distributed. I spend a lot of time on security, talking about how to keep this building safe. I sit at the top of our pyramid for providing security services to our reporters abroad.
We have been very aggressive in suing the federal government and the state and local governments for Freedom of Information violations, trying to help our reporters get information, get documents. That occupies a big part of our time.
I think what surprises people is that what they assume my job is, vetting stories, actually plays a fairly small role in terms of the time commitment I make over the course of a week.
PAUL: That's what most of us journalists worry about. But what keeps you up at night? What are the things that concern you most?
MCCRAW: These days, it's the incredible pressure our people face abroad, our international correspondents. The world is a very coarse place these days. It used to be that reporters were seen, even in hostile zones, as honest brokers, people you needed to have there. Whichever side you were on in a conflict, you depended on reporters getting your version of the events out. Twitter's changed that, Facebook's changed that; they don't really need us to be telling their story, they can spread their story through their own medium.
What we've seen is that the president of the United States calling the press the enemy of the people, a stain on society, purveyors of fake news, has created an epidemic. The worst governments in the worst places now have adopted that language, and they're using it to oppress their own press.
But we're also seeing how they're using the same tools to make it very difficult for our reporters. We're under criminal investigation in Egypt; we have reporters banned from going into Pakistan; our website's blocked in China.
And when the governments of those countries and other countries justify that, they come back to the very same words we're hearing from the White House. And my concern is that those governments think the way to curry favor with the United States is to take up that kind of behavior.
PAUL: Libel laws differ around the world, and we are now a global newspaper. I think the thing that a lot of people know about libel is it's very tough in the U.S. to bring a libel suit; very easy in the U.K. But what is it like when we're publishing here mostly out of New York, but also all around the world, to readers nearly all around the world, except where we are blocked, like China?
MCCRAW: We obviously have to pay attention to laws elsewhere. The key to that, though, is to keep in mind that our core audience is right here, and we need to report what it is that is happening abroad to the best of our ability. Sometimes that means we challenge the law, sometimes that means we go into court there. Most times it means that we are careful in getting the facts right, and we stand by the idea that the truth is going to matter wherever we are. And that's worked out to a great degree.
I do have to say one thing, because I think it's important to the overall point of the book. One of the reasons we don't see as many foreign libel suits is that the Congress in 2010 passed a law that makes it almost impossible for people who win libel judgments abroad to bring them to the United States and enforce them.

Author of 'the truth about marijuana' to speak in Colorado Springs

Texto completo: Starting at The Denver Post before a decade at The New York Times, Alex Berenson left journalism to launch his fiction career, bursting onto the scene with “The Faithful Spy.” Inspired by his war correspondence, his first mystery thriller was a bestseller.
He continued with a popular series. “Honestly, I was getting paid very well to write those books,” he says from his Hudson Valley, N.Y., home. “It’s funny when people accuse me of doing this for the money. I get paid a lot more to write fiction than to write nonfiction.
“But this is something I feel I need to do. That’s why I’m doing it.”
By “this,” Berenson means his deep dive back into nonfiction. As for accusations, he has faced many since January’s release of “Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence.”
The Nation and Rolling Stone called the book “fear-mongering” and “trolling,” respectively. Vox wrote it off as “an exercise in cherry-picking data and presenting correlation as causation.” But The Marshall Project, the nonpartisan investigative reporting center, deemed it “an intensively researched and passionate dissent from the now prevailing view that marijuana is relatively harmless.”
Berenson also was blasted in an open letter by 75 scholars and clinicians for “irresponsibly and dangerously claim(ing) a causal link between marijuana use and increases in rates of psychosis and schizophrenia.”
Which is all disappointing to Berenson, who will state his case in Colorado Springs and Denver this week during talks sponsored by The Gazette, Colorado Politics and Children’s Hospital Colorado.
IF YOU GO
Alex Berenson will be in Colorado Springs and Denver this week to talk about his latest book, "Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence."
• Noon to 1:30 p.m. Tuesday at Springs' Warehouse Restaurant, 25 West Cimarron St.
• 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Tuesday at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, 2201 East Dry Creek Road, free and open to public
• Noon to 1:30 p.m. Wednesday in Denver at the History Colorado Center at 1200 North Broadway
The opioid epidemic has come in the profiting wake of companies such as Purdue Pharma, “and now a for-profit community has sprung up for the use of” marijuana, Berenson says. Fellow journalists should be asking harder questions, he says. “It’s crazy to me that that hasn’t happened.”
He expected the criticism but not the personal attacks — the suggestions to get his kids high and the harassing calls to his wife, a forensic psychiatrist. It was her repeated mentions of marijuana in violent cases that made Berenson curious in the first place. He previously considered himself “a libertarian” on pot, having smoked “a handful of times in college and after,” he says. “I didn’t particularly care about it one way or another.”
He expected controversy before he even typed the prologue, which establishes the book as an argument and, in his words, “not balanced.” Berenson’s stance is further announced by the title, a nod to “Reefer Madness.” (The early propaganda film originally was called “Tell Your Children.”)
Yes, Berenson knew users wouldn’t appreciate his book.
“People have a really strange attachment to this drug,” he says. “I think most people who use alcohol, if they’re using it every day and certainly if they’re using it all day every day, they’re going to acknowledge, you know what, maybe I have a little problem with this.
“And by the way, if you’re using cocaine or heroine or methamphetamine like that, you’re not even gonna tell people. But cannabis people are proud to tell you they wake and bake.”
Berenson, a 1994 Yale graduate, cites a 2017 study by the National Academy of Medicine that said “cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use, the greater the risk.” In a New Yorker piece stirred by Berenson’s findings and titled “Is Marijuana as Safe as We Think?”, Malcolm Gladwell wrote that the committee’s statement was “one of its few unequivocal conclusions.”
But committee member Ziva Cooper took to Twitter in January to say “we did NOT conclude that cannabis causes schizophrenia.” She wrote that since the report, “we now know that genetic risk for schizophrenia predicts cannabis use” and that cannabidiol “improves outcomes in patients with schizophrenia.”
Berenson has stood by his reporting. After his wife switched the light bulb in 2016, he went to London to meet with concerned psychiatrists at King’s College, among scientists around the world he interviewed. He pulled records from several states and nations. He came to the Colorado prison holding Richard Kirk to talk at length with the man who blamed a marijuana edible for shooting and killing his wife in 2014.
Berenson says he could have reported longer. “But my feeling was, I don’t need to do that, I don’t need to reinvent the wheel here, because science is really clear. And this is a really important issue for public health ... It’s more important that I get it out.”

Texto completo: In search of something to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
"House on Fire" by Bonnie Kistler (Atria Books, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: A blended family is plunged into crisis when the son of one parent kills the daughter of the other in a drunk-driving accident. Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.
"An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System" by Matt Richtel (William Morrow, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Matt Richtel provides a deeply reported and entertainingly written exploration of the human immune system and how it works, told through the intimate stories of four lives grappling with mortality.
The buzz: "Richtel creates a hard-to-put-down account of the body's first line of defense," says Publishers Weekly.
"The Dragonfly Sea" by Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor (Knopf, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: On Pate Island, off the coast of Kenya, a young girl yearning for the father she never knew bonds with a sailor and soon finds herself called to the sea. With a rich and enormous cast of global characters, Owuor depicts the cultural complexities of East Africa in a stirring story of loss and discovery.
The buzz: A starred review in Publishers Weekly calls it a "sprawling, beautiful novel," an epic that "establishes Owuor as a considerable talent."
"Soldier, Sailor, Frogman, Spy, Airman, Gangster, Kill or Die: How the Allies Won on D-Day" by Giles Milton (Henry Holt, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: In time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day comes this anecdotal history of that fateful day when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy. The day is narrated in a symphony of surviving voices – a teenage Allied conscript, a French resistance fighter, a butcher's daughter – placing the reader in the heat of the action.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls the book a "worthy commemoration of a key historical moment."
"Too Much Is Not Enough," by Andrew Rannells (Crown, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Actor and star of Broadway's "The Book of Mormon" and HBO's "Girls" Andrew Rannells tells the story of his life so far in a charming memoir that charts his journey from a hopeful and sexually confused Nebraska kid with big ambitions to the bright lights of New York City.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls it an "inspiring and consistently witty entertainment memoir."
Actor Andrew Rannells' memoir is "Too Much."

Texto completo: After completing its portion of the international investigation into two Boeing 737 Max 8 crashes, the Federal Aviation Administration needs to take a hard look at itself.
The U.S. was the last major country to ground the jets last week in the wake of eerily similar crashes- one March 10 in Ethiopia that killed 157 and one Oct. 29 off the coast of Indonesia that killed 189. Both planes made a series of climbs and dives before plummeting minutes after takeoff.
After the March 10 disaster, some countries quickly moved to ground the Max 8. In other countries, airlines voluntarily grounded the planes until investigators could find out what, if anything, was wrong with them.
But in the U.S. ... nothing.
Chicago-based Boeing stood by its big-selling plane. American and Southwest, the two airlines operating the Max 8, did, too, even as passengers rued their safety and two unions representing airline employees demanded that the jets be grounded.
As late as Tuesday night, after the Max 8 had been banned from the airspace of dozens of countries, the FAA doubled down on its refusal to do the same.Daniel Elwell, the agency's acting chief and perhaps the most tone-deaf bureaucrat in the federal government, insisted that there were "no systemic performance issues" and "no basis to order grounding the aircraft."
On Wednesday, the FAA did an about-face and grounded the Max 8 and its sister, the Max 9, citing"new evidence" about the Ethiopian crash. By then, the agency had embarrassed itself and damaged its credibility.
The FAA, widely considered the world's preeminent aviation agency, should err on the side of caution and public safety, not that of Boeing and the airlines. The agency did nothing until it could ignore the evidence and public pressure no longer.
The FAA's mistakes actually go back several months.
According to the Dallas Morning News, five pilots in recent months had lodged complaints in a federal database about the Max 8's flight-control system- the very system at issue in the two fatal crashes- and about the lack of training they received to fly the two-year-old plane. The FAA should have been aware of the complaints and acted on them.
Also, The New York Times reported Friday that Boeing had promised a software update after October's Max 8 crash but never delivered it. The FAA should have been riding Boeing to complete the work and penalized the company for dragging its feet.
Perhaps this is the sclerosis that develops when a regulatory agency takes on too many former industry workers - in this case, onetime Boeing workers - as employees. The FAA must review its handling of the Max 8 and publicly address its failures. The agency can expect turbulence ahead.

Texto completo: W.S. Merwin
NEW YORK - W.S. Merwin, a prolific and versatile poetry master who evolved through a wide range of styles as he celebrated nature, condemned war and industrialism and reached for the elusive past, died Friday. He was 91.
A Pulitzer Prize winner and former U.S. poet laureate, Merwin completed more than 20 books, from early works inspired by myths and legends to fiery protests against environmental destruction and the conflict in Vietnam to late meditations on age and time.
He wrote rhymes and blank verse, a brief report on the month of January and a book-length story in verse about colonialism and the birth of modern Hawaii. Like his hero, Henry David Thoreau, he was inspired equally by reverence for the planet and anger against injustice.
He died in his sleep at his home on the Hawaiian island of Maui, according to publisher Copper Canyon Press and the Merwin Conservancy, which the poet founded.
"He is an artist with a very clear spiritual profile, and intellectual and moral consistency, which encompasses both his work and his life," fellow poet Edward Hirsch once said of him.
Merwin received virtually every honor a poet could ask for - more, it turned out, than he desired.
Citing the Vietnam War, he declined a Pulitzer in 1971 for "The Carrier of Ladders," saying that he was "too conscious of being an American to accept public congratulation with good grace, or to welcome it except as an occasion for expressing openly a shame which many Americans feel."
He also rejected membership in the National Institute of Arts and Letters, now the American Academy of Arts and Letters, but changed his mind five years later, in 1977.
Among other awards he accepted: a National Book Award for "Migration" in 2005, a Pulitzer in 2009 for "The Shadow of Sirius," and such lifetime achievement honors as the Tanning Prize, the Bollingen Prize and a gold medal from the arts academy. He was chosen the country's poet laureate in 2010 and served a single one-year term.
The changes in his work were no more dramatic than the changes in his life, which spanned continents and religious faiths. The son of a Presbyterian minister, he was raised in the urban East during the Great Depression, spent years as a young man in France, Mexico, Spain and England and lived his final decades as a Buddhist in a solar-powered house he designed on an old pineapple plantation, surrounded by a rain forest, on the northeast coast of Maui.
"There was something incomplete about the world of streets and sidewalks and cement," he told the Paris Review in 1986. "I remember walking in the streets of New York and New Jersey and telling myself, as a kind of reassurance, that the ground was really under there."
William Stanley Merwin was born in New York City in 1927. He soon moved to Union City, New Jersey, living for years on a street now called "W.S. Merwin Way," then to Scranton, Pennsylvania.
In a long, autobiographical poem, "Testimony," he remembered his father as a weary, disappointed man, subsisting on "pinched salaries" and "traveling sick with some nameless illuminating ill." His mother was orphaned early in life and grieved again when her baby, a boy she meant to name after her father, died "when he had scarcely wakened."
In a household as grim as an abandoned parking lot, the way out was pointed by words, which seemed to float around Merwin like magic bubbles. He would try to memorize scripture he heard his father recite and fairy tales his mother told him. By age 13, he was already composing hymns.
He received a scholarship from Princeton University, becoming the first family member to attend college, and began meeting some of the great poets of the present and future. Galway Kinnell was a classmate at Princeton, and John Berryman a teacher.
After graduating, he lived in Spain and tutored the son of Robert Graves. In London, he became close with Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes and was torn by the collapse of their marriage. Merwin's then-wife, Dido Merwin, would allege that Plath had a crush on him.
In Washington, D.C., when he was 18, Merwin had a memorable encounter with Ezra Pound, whom he visited at a psychiatric hospital. Pound urged Merwin to write 75 lines a day (advice he did not follow), warned him he didn't have enough experience to write great poetry and advised him to learn another language as a way of better mastering English. Merwin would translate more than 20 books by other poets, from languages ranging from Sanskrit to Swedish.
Merwin's promise was obvious. His first collection, "A Mask for Janus," was selected by W.H. Auden for the coveted Yale Series of Younger Poets competition and was published in 1952. Throughout the 1950s, he wrote poems and plays, including a verse production of "Rumpelstiltskin."
Times spent in Boston with Robert Lowell convinced him to concentrate on poetry, and by the end of the decade, he was regarded as a highly talented artist immersed in Old English literature, his verse likened by The New York Times to "a broad river flowing through peaceful land."
Peace - the flow of the natural world - was a cause he actively defended. Near the end of World War II, he spent seven months under psychiatric care because he refused to undergo any duties that might lead to violence, which he had feared since the days his father would beat him.
By the early 1960s, he was marching against nuclear weapons and throwing off the rules of grammar as if they were a suit and tie, inspired by his "growing sense that punctuation alluded to an assumed allegiance to the rational protocol of written language."
Meanwhile, Vietnam and urbanization darkened his vision. "I/can hear the blood crawling over the plains," he wrote in "The Child." In "The Crust," the downfall of a tree is a metaphor for the severing of civilization:
And with the tree
Went all the lives in it
That slept in it ate in it
Met in it believed in it
Merwin examined his own mind in "Plane" and found it "infinitely divided and hopeless/like a stockyard seen from above." His poem "Presidents" was a roll call of dishonor, for "the president of shame," the president of lies" and the "president of loyalty," who "recommends blindness to the blind." In "Sunset After Rain," he concluded that "The darkness is cold/because the stars do not believe in each other."
In the 1970s, he settled permanently in Hawaii and studied under the Zen Buddhist master Robert Aitken. Divorced years earlier from Dorothy Jeanne Ferry and from Dido Milroy, he married his third wife, Paula Schwartz, in a Buddhist ceremony in 1983. Paula died in 2017.
Merwin's work became sparer, rooted in the Hawaiian landscape and his personal past - how it's often forgotten, how it's never understood at the moment it's lived, how words themselves were imperfect bridges to lost time. In "Secrets," he noted that "wherever our parents came from is another century/an age which they themselves could barely remember."
A poem from 2010, "By the Front Door," is a three-line tribute to simple wonder: "Rain through the morning/and in the long pool an old toad singing/happiness old as water." His poem "Thanks" is another ode to the natural world:
Listen
With the night falling we are saying thank you
We are stopping on the bridges to bow from the railings
We are running out of the glass rooms
With our mouths full of food to look at the sky
And say thank you

Texto completo: Two years before the election of President Trump and the bitter politics of border walls, Muslim bans and s---hole countries, the American publishing industry was facing an identity crisis. A viral social media movement led by writers of color called #WeNeedDiverseBooks began pushing the industry to acknowledge and address its resounding whiteness. The failure to cultivate the voices of American writers of minority and immigrant backgrounds was the failure to tell a full national story, writer Junot Diaz explained in a New Yorker essay.
Soon after the 2016 election, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Viet Thanh Nguyen published a piece in The New York Times arguing that the outcome was partly the failure of writers. "The struggle over the direction of our country," he wrote, "is also a fight over whose words will win and whose images will ignite the collective imagination." Immigrants needed to tell their story - and tell it better.
"The Good Immigrant" is a culmination of the current political moment and a natural extension of the ongoing work to integrate American publishing. The 26 essays in this anthology are deeply personal reflections on adolescence, family, love and identity as experienced and felt by the American immigrant artist. From published heavyweights like Teju Cole and Alexander Chee to newer voices like Muslim American punk-rocker Basim Usmani and Pakistani Kashmiri-American poet Fatimah Asghar, this banquet of writing is a triumphant celebration of American multiplicity.
The book was inspired by an original British edition, which was published at the height of the Brexit debate with a largely different roster of writers. In the introduction to the American edition, the editors, Nikesh Shukla and Chimene Suleyman, explain that what both collections share is their desire to amplify the voices of immigrants through a kind of collective literary activism. In a cultural climate defined by xenophobia and anti-immigrant policies, this book seeks to showcase the gifts and humanity of immigrant artists.
It's a noble mission. And yet, as a reader, I worried that a collection defined by politics could crumble under the weight of good intentions. Essays lifted from social media outrage or powered by reactionary rage can satisfy in the instant but fade as the moment passes. Thankfully, this collection is a resounding success on multiple fronts. Its righteous rage is perfectly matched by its literary rewards.
The American edition of the "The Good Immigrant" is best heard as a surround-sound chorus that bristles with an unpredictable, electric energy. Language, style and rhythm shift with each piece, keeping our attention. In "Luck of the Irish," Maeve Higgins explores how white privilege helped her, an Irish immigrant living in the country illegally, as brown families in similar conditions are prosecuted. In a love letter to her mother, Indian-American writer Krutika Mallikarjuna finds humor in the ridiculous conundrum of dating in the multiracial mayhem of Brooklyn. "Of the many pitfalls of being a queer desi woman swimming through Tinder," she writes, "I never expected to find myself getting trashed in a bar trying to forget that I was on a date with a white girl named India."
Several of the essays are by first-time authors who work in other artistic mediums. My favorite essay is by Nigerian-American fashion designer Wale Oyejide. The African-inspired textiles and silhouettes of his celebrated fashion line Ikire Jones are regularly shown on global runways and featured prominently in the Oscar-winning blockbuster "Black Panther." In an essay about his artistic coming of age, Oyejide explores the struggles of stay-at-home fatherhood with biting humor and then widens his lens to a crisis of masculinity that fails to allow men to be more than conventional breadwinners and pursue the arts. He writes about his designs as a political instrument to restore dignity and beauty to black bodies draped in shades of violence and suffering in popular culture.
"Our uprisings don't always come in the guise of smashed windows, overturned cars or respectable slave owners forcibly torn from their stone housings in front of Capitol buildings. Sometimes they come in the form of building-sized brown faces broadcast on cinema screens, portraying characters who are miles away from the token mistress we have to come to accept for want of more inspiring alternatives," he writes. Immigrant creativity is about imagining new possibility, he explains: "There will be endless stories to write. And, increasingly, there will be audiences filled with us waiting to hear them being told."
The best work here offers reflections on the creative process, alongside the fear of family, society and failure that keeps many immigrant artists from expressing themselves. The collection concludes with a call to arms by novelist Jade Chang, with a practical step-by-step guide to embracing one's voice titled "How to Center Your Own Story."
As I finished "The Good Immigrant," my mind was buzzing with the multitude of voices, stories, heartbreaks and dreams featured in its 300-plus pages. The book is a welcome corrective to the nationalist calls for walls, borders and exclusion that seek to narrow the boundaries of what it means to be American. Each essay is a tantalizing introduction - and invitation - to the larger body of work these artists have already created and will continue to make long after this moment passes.
Bilal Qureshi is a culture writer and radio journalist whose work has appeared in The Washington Post, The New York Times and Newsweek, and on NPR.

Texto completo: Kathy Griffin's comedy tour last year was a hit. She traveled to 15 countries and played regal venues (such as the Sydney Opera House) as she dished about fallout from a 2017 photo in which she posed with a gory mask that looked like Donald Trump's decapitated head. The set, called "Laugh Your Head Off," raked in $4.4 million and earned her a rave review from The New York Times.
But when Griffin returned to her Bel Air home in October, she realized Hollywood wasn't ready to forgive her. Despite her touring success, executives regarded her as an unemployable comic who'd crossed the line. Finally, she took her fate into her own hands. Griffin self-financed her first concert movie, employing a camera crew to record her last tour performance. She hired director Troy Miller and paid for everything.
This month, she's debuting that film, "Kathy Griffin: A Hell of a Story," at South by Southwest, the annual showcase of buzzy movies in Austin, Texas. "At SXSW, we support freedom of speech, so this felt like a worthy story," says Janet Pierson, the fest's director of film. "We were moved by her hypothesis that this was a cautionary tale: If this could happen to her, it could happen to anyone."
That wasn't the worst of it. According to Griffin, the Trump administration tried to ruin her to make an example of her. She was added to the no-fly list of suspected terrorists, which led to detainments at airports. (A Department of Justice spokesperson declined comment.)
Griffin, who hopes a distributor will buy her film at SXSW, told her story to Variety. This transcript has been edited and condensed.

Q: Do people think you did something wrong?
A: A lot of people thought that I broke the law. And once the investigation started, I can see how they would reach that incorrect conclusion. We're in this information era where Mark Zuckerberg wants to control your news feed, and I've had to roll with it just like everybody else has.

Q: Do you feel blacklisted?
A: Yeah. I've been in controversies, real and fake, and a lot of these guys saying no to me are the same guys that have been saying no to me for 20 years. I think there's still a stigma that can go from ageism to "Am I your cup of tea?" There really aren't very many well-known female comedians over 50. And I think some of (the executives) are going, "What's this chick still doing around?"

Q: When do you think things will turn around?
A: I wish I could go the (Colin) Kaepernick route, where this ends in me getting a $100 billion Nike contract. So I'm sure that's coming. Maybe with Crocs.

Texto completo: In search of something to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
"House on Fire" by Bonnie Kistler (Atria Books, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: A blended family is plunged into crisis when the son of one parent kills the daughter of the other in a drunk-driving accident. Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.
"An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System" by Matt Richtel (William Morrow, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Matt Richtel provides a deeply reported and entertainingly written exploration of the human immune system and how it works, told through the intimate stories of four lives grappling with mortality.
The buzz: "Richtel creates a hard-to-put-down account of the body's first line of defense," says Publishers Weekly.
"The Dragonfly Sea" by Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor (Knopf, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: On Pate Island, off the coast of Kenya, a young girl yearning for the father she never knew bonds with a sailor and soon finds herself called to the sea. With a rich and enormous cast of global characters, Owuor depicts the cultural complexities of East Africa in a stirring story of loss and discovery.
The buzz: A starred review in Publishers Weekly calls it a "sprawling, beautiful novel," an epic that "establishes Owuor as a considerable talent."
"Soldier, Sailor, Frogman, Spy, Airman, Gangster, Kill or Die: How the Allies Won on D-Day" by Giles Milton (Henry Holt, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: In time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day comes this anecdotal history of that fateful day when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy. The day is narrated in a symphony of surviving voices – a teenage Allied conscript, a French resistance fighter, a butcher's daughter – placing the reader in the heat of the action.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls the book a "worthy commemoration of a key historical moment."
"Too Much Is Not Enough," by Andrew Rannells (Crown, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Actor and star of Broadway's "The Book of Mormon" and HBO's "Girls" Andrew Rannells tells the story of his life so far in a charming memoir that charts his journey from a hopeful and sexually confused Nebraska kid with big ambitions to the bright lights of New York City.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls it an "inspiring and consistently witty entertainment memoir."

Cheating your way into top schools

Texto completo: One of the funniest stories I ever heard about the college admissions madness came from an independent consultant who was paid handsomely to guide families through it and increase the odds that Harvard or Yale said yes.
He recounted the involvement of one father and mother in their son's personal (hah!) essay, which they didn't trust him to ace himself. They drafted it, focusing of course on the hardship that he had overcome. But when they showed it to him, he spotted a minor problem. What they'd described - his mom's difficult pregnancy, a sequence of visits to medical specialists, so much fear, so much suspense - predated his arrival in this world. Poignant as it was, he could take zero credit for it.
On Tuesday, the Justice Department announced the indictments of dozens of wealthy parents, including Emmy-winning actress Felicity Huffman, for employing various forms of bribery and fraud to get their kids into highly selective schools. Some allegedly paid college coaches, including at Yale and Stanford, to lie and say their children were special recruits for sports the kids didn't even play. Others allegedly paid exam administrators to let someone smarter take tests for their children. Millions of dollars changed hands.
It's a galling exposé of widespread cheating by families who are already well-to-do and well-connected, but it's not really a surprising one. Anyone who knows anything about the cutthroat competition for precious spots at top-tier schools realizes how ugly and unfair it can be: how many corners are cut, how many schemes are hatched, how big a role money plays, how many advantages privilege can buy.
The wrinkle here is that the schemes were actually criminal and will apparently be prosecuted, and for once the colleges' administrators were in the dark about them. But they're versions of routine favor trading and favoritism that have long corrupted the admissions process, leeching merit from the equation.
It may be legal to pledge $2.5 million to Harvard just as your son is applying - which is what Jared Kushner's father did for him - and illegal to bribe a coach to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars, but how much of a difference is there, really? Both elevate money over accomplishment. Both are ways of cutting in line.
It may be legal to give $50,000 to a private consultant who massages your child's transcript and perfumes your child's essays, and illegal to pay someone for a patently fictive test score, but aren't both exercises in deception reserved for those who can afford them?
And while ghostwriting, whether by consultants or parents, may not be detectable or at least provable, it happens all the time and contributes to applications as bogus as the ones that came to federal prosecutors' attention.
What a message it sends to the children: You're not good enough to do this on your own. You needn't be. Your parents and your counselors know the rules, and when and how to break them. Just sit back and let entitlement run its course.
The Jared Kushner story was uncovered more than a decade ago by Daniel Golden, who showcased it in his 2006 book, "The Price of Admission," a definitive account of the strings pulled by rich families like Kushner's. Jared did get into Harvard, despite grades and test scores that were, according to Golden's reporting, well below what Harvard typically wants.
I spoke with Golden just after the Justice Department detailed the bribery and fraud scam, which he characterized as "an extreme outgrowth of what I wrote about."
"I had a chapter about how the wealthy benefit from athletic preference because there are so many white patrician sports that most kids never get a chance to play," he said.
Golden added that the affluent kids in the just-revealed scam seized an edge beyond that. "They didn't even bother to get on the team," he said.
There are many takeaways from this appalling story. One is how crassly hypocritical parents can be. I bet that more than a few of those charged are proud liberals who talked about the importance of equal opportunity and an even playing field, then went out and did whatever it took to push their kids into the winner's circle. 
While colleges pledge fairer admissions and more diverse student bodies, they don't patrol what's going on with nearly enough earnestness and energy to honor that promise. They're ripe to be gamed because the admissions process is a game.
The spell that some of these colleges cast over applicants and their families - and the magic attributed to them - are absurd. But they are indeed part of an infrastructure of perks and packaging that isn't uniformly accessible.
Our country's best schools are supposed to be engines of social mobility and the gateways to dreams. Sometimes they're just another sour deal.

Thirty Years Later, Was Kurt Schmoke Right?

Texto completo: Headnote Race and Politics
Sept. 30, 1988, 38-year old Mayor of Baltimore Kurt
Schmoke testified before the House Select Committee on Narcotics regarding the impact and efficacy of the so-called "War on Drugs." Schmoke, then a rising star in the Democratic Party, had only been on the job as mayor of Baltimore for a little over a year, inheriting a city imploded by the crack epidemic, which cut a virulent swath through the urban landscape of America.
"We can guarantee that if we continue doing what we're doing, we will fail. If we're going to have a new war on drugs, let it be led by the surgeon general, not the attorney general," said Schmoke. The former Baltimore City College High School football star, Rhodes Scholar and Baltimore City State's Attorney was advocating for the legalization of marijuana and the treatment of drug addicts as patients instead of criminals. The New York Times reported on the day of Schmoke's testimony the following:
"Instead of a drug policy based primarily on law enforcement, Mr. Schmoke proposed 'a measured and carefully implemented program of drug decriminalization,' similar to the repeal of Prohibition. $140 Billion on Illicit Drugs He conceded that there were risks in what he was suggesting.
'"Providing legal access to currently illicit substances carries with it the chance, although by no means the certainty, that the number of people using and abusing drugs will increase,'" Mayor Schmoke said. "But addiction, for all of its attendant medical, social and moral problems, is but one evil associated with drugs. Moreover, the criminalization of narcotics, cocaine and marijuana has not solved the problem of their use.""
Despite Schmoke's cogent, clear-eyed analysis of the catastrophic war on drugs, he was widely ridiculed for even suggesting a national conversation about decriminalization. In fact, three of his Maryland Democratic colleagues from the House of Representatives, Kweisi Mfume, Ben Cardin and Roy Dyson, testified against Schmoke before the House on that day. The late Marion Barry, then the mayor of neighboring Washington, D.C., a city, which had also been ravaged by drug addiction and violence, bolstered Schmoke's premise only to a point. Barry testified it was "time to rethink our policy," but he also said, "I don't know enough about the impact of cocaine addiction." A little more than a year later on Jan. 18, 1990, Barry was captured on videotape smoking crack cocaine (he was targeted in a joint sting by the FBI and D.C. Police) at the Vista International Hotel in Washington, D.C.
This was the toxic milieu in which Schmoke delivered his bold proposal; it all but destroyed the political ascendancy of perhaps the most erudite person to occupy Baltimore's mayor's chair.
But, for those of us who have been here since Schmoke's testimony before Congress more than 30 years ago, do you feel safer now or then?
In September of 1988, I had just returned to Baltimore from Los Angeles and was about 90 days from entering the doors of the AFRO for the first time in January 1989. Do I feel safer in the city now than I did then? No.
Baltimore's population in 1990 was 736,014; the homicide rate that year was 234. In 2019, the city's population is estimated at 611,648 (over 100,000 people fewer than 1990), yet, the murder rate has eclipsed 300 for the last four years in a row. I don't have to be a criminologist to discern a large percentage, if not a majority of murders in our city, are fueled by the illicit drug trade.
Recently, Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby (the office that propelled Schmoke to the mayor's chair), announced her office would no longer prosecute marijuana possession cases. Foundational in Mosby's decision are the stark racial disparities in sentencing and law enforcement in such cases.
I would argue Mosby's policy shift is a good first step. But, in order to neutralize the illicit drug trade you have to take the profit out of it. To begin healing our addicted communities you have to stop treating them as criminal lepers and begin treating them as patients. Because what we are doing now regarding the drug trade isn't working for anybody save those who profit from the misery that engulfs our city.
Maybe it's time we revisit Schmoke's vision he presented more than 30 years ago. We've lost so much already; how much longer can we continue down this perilous path?

California's ever-reforming criminal justice system

Texto completo: Hi, there! Desert Sun political reporter Sam Metz, here. I'm subbing in for Marie McCain on the newsletter this week and next. This week, I'm taking a look at criminal justice reform in California and the complexities of Blythe, a town in eastern Riverside County that sits near the California-Arizona border.
Big criminal justice news dropped Wednesday when Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he was placing a moratorium on the death penalty in California.
Although many Americans see the Golden State as one of the nation's bastions of progressive politics, it has the largest death row in the country, with 737 inmates. And in both 2012 and 2016, voters reaffirmed their support for the death penalty by striking down a proposition to abolish it and approving another to expedite the appeal process.
Even before Newsom's announcement, California's criminal justice system has dominated the news cycle so far in 2019. Since Sen. Kamala Harris announced she's running for president on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Democrats have debated her record as a prosecutor, with detractors coining the Twitter hashtag #KamalaHarrisIsACop.
In a New York Times editorial, University of San Francisco law professor Lara Bazelon wrote, "Time after time, when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state's attorney general, Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent."
Before being elected senator, Harris served as San Francisco County District Attorney and California Attorney General. She's positioned herself as a champion of criminal justice reform on the campaign trail, but, as a prosecutor, she took a cautious approach toward supporting reform initiatives.
Harris said she supported the governor's moratorium after Wednesday's announcement, but as attorney general, she did not take public positions on the ballot initiatives that proposed abolishing the death penalty and expediting the appeals process.
She also didn't take positions on Propositions 47 and 57, the sentencing reform props that, after passing, reclassified some felonies as misdemeanors and made it easier for the incarcerated — including third-strike offenders — to win parole.
Criminal justice reform advocates in the Democratic Party also have mixed feelings toward Harris's successor, Attorney General Xavier Becerra.
Becerra, who recently gave the Spanish-language response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union, has filed 46 lawsuits against the Trump administration, but received criticism for how he's navigated California's new policy transparency laws as well as his support for the Sacramento County district attorney's decision not to prosecute the police officers who shot and killed Stephon Clark in March 2018.
Last year, the California legislature passed State Sen. Nancy Skinner's Senate Bill 1421 which required police departments to make officer misconduct records public, turning California from one of the nation's most secretive states when it comes to police records to one of the most open.
The law has been subject to several court appeals, including in Riverside County, about whether or not it applies to records created before the law's implementation. Becerra was shunned by transparency advocates for his approach. After his office fulfilled a public-record request and gave the Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California, Berkeley a list of officers convicted of crimes over the past decade, the attorney general demanded the records be returned and said possessing the list was a misdemeanor crime, threatening legal action.
Last year, the state legislature also considered a bill that would restrict instances when police officers could use deadly force. The bill's author, Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, D-San Diego, ultimately tabled it before it reached the floor for a vote.
Earlier this month, the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office opted to not prosecute the two police officers in the Clark shooting. That decision reignited debate over Weber's proposal. The legislature will consider two bills on the use of deadly force in this year's session.
Desert Sun reporter Chris Damien, who covers criminal justice reform policy for The Desert Sun, said he was struck by the number of changes in California's criminal justice system over the past few months.
"From the death penalty reprieve to new transparency laws regarding police misconduct, I've seen California's criminal justice system undergo some serious reshaping in a matter of months," he said. "But with many voters and victims' families saying Newsom is overstepping on death row and police unions arguing sunshine laws shouldn't apply to historic cases, local dissent is slowing Sacramento's attempts at rapid reform."
Here's some of The Desert Sun's recent criminal justice reform coverage:
THE DEATH PENALTY: After Gov. Newsom's announcement, Damien and Colin Atagi complied a list of all the death row inmates convicted in Riverside County. Although Riverside County put nobody on death row in 2018, in the past, The Desert Sun has covered how, in many years, the district attorney's office puts more people on death row than any other county in the nation.
LEGISLATIVE COVERAGE: Damien wrote about both the battles over police transparency and use of deadly force in Sacramento. Most recently, he wrote about the Riverside Sheriff Association's lawsuit to block the release of records made before the transparency law's passage. Last year, in a story about the passage of a law to end money-based bail in California, I reported on politicians' fears that ending money-based bail would release dangerous criminals as well as how criminal justice reform advocates were skeptical of the algorithmic system the state intends to use to determine who can be released pre-trial, in place of money-based bail.
BALLOT BOX: Criminal justice reform advocates backed candidates running against "tough on crime" prosecutors in the 2018 election. Most lost, including in Riverside County. In 2016, The Desert Sun wrote about the effects of Proposition 47, which reduced many felonies to misdemeanors in an effort to reduce the state's prison population. Many of the 13,500 low-level offenders released from overcrowded prisons left only to struggle with homelessness and drug addiction, The Desert Sun reported.
HARRIS AND BECERRA: In a story about Harris's announcement, I reported that her memoir contains little about sentencing reform or the prison system. When she does address it, she writes that she rejects the dichotomy of being either "tough on crime" or "soft on crime."
"What was wrong with the system didn't need to be an immutable fact," she writes. "An important part of what that wisdom told me was that when it came to criminal justice, we were being asked to accept false choices."
Ricardo Lopez recently covered Becerra's State of the Union response and reported on his optimistic tone and how positioned himself opposite President Trump on immigration and the declaration of a national emergency.
Meanwhile, in Blythe The Desert Sun recently published two stories on Blythe, a 20,000 person town that lies 120 miles east of Palm Springs.
Three years after Blythe's city council narrowly voted to allow cannabis businesses in the city, hoping to combat poverty and population decline and increase tax revenue, cannabis excise tax revenues have come in lower than projected. Business reporter Amy DiPierropublished a follow-up piece on the industry's development in the town that sits on the California-Arizona border, after first exploring the topic in a January 2018 story.
Health reporter Nicole Hayden also has a story about Blythe this week. Hayden reported on the severe delivery complication rate at Blythe's Palo Verde Hospital as part of USA TODAY "Deadly Deliveries" series. The delivery rate is declining and locals told Hayden many try to avoid delivering there. Palo Verde's 12.2 percent complication rate is more than ten times greater than the median among California hospitals, which is about 1.5 percent.

THE POWER OF PETTY RAGE STRAW POLICE, HAMBURGER PARANOIA AND THE STATE OF THE RIGHT

Texto completo: Today's column is about plastic straws, hamburgers and dishwashing detergent. Also Captain Marvel.
No, I haven't lost my mind, or at least I don't think so. But quite a few other people have - and their rage-filled pettiness is a more important force in modern America than we like to think.
My starting point is a weekend tweet from Rep. Devin Nunes of California, who headed the House Intelligence Committee until the House changed hands after the midterms. In that role, he basically acted as Donald Trump's stonewaller in chief, doing everything he could to prevent any real investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin.
But his tweet wasn't about that. It was about a waitress who, citing the "straw police," asked his dining party if it wanted straws. "Welcome to Socialism in California!" Mr. Nunes thundered.
If this seems like a weird aberration - he wasn't even denied a straw, just asked if he wanted one - you need to realize that rage explosions over seemingly silly things are extremely common on the right. By all accounts, the biggest applause line at the Conservative Political Action Conference - eliciting chants of "U-S-A, U-S-A!" - was the claim that Democrats are coming for your hamburgers, just like Stalin. (They aren't, and for the record, Stalin was a mass murderer, but objectively pro-burger.)
By the way, this isn't a new phenomenon. I'm sure readers can come up with many examples, but I happen to remember a 2009 blog post by the right-wing activist Erick Erickson that was practically an incitement to violence: "At what point do the people tell the politicians to go to hell? At what point do they get off the couch, march down to their state legislator's house, pull him outside, and beat him to a bloody pulp?"
And what was the source of his rage? The observation that dishwasher detergent doesn't work quite as well without phosphates.
What do these things have in common? All of them involve cases where individual choices impose costs on other people. Plastic straws really are a source of ocean pollution. While nobody is planning to ban beef, flatulent cows really are an important source of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. And phosphates contribute to toxic algae blooms.
But the rage seems to come from the suggestion that these costs imposed on others mean that white men - it does seem to always be white men - should consider changing their behavior, even a bit, in the public interest. Which brings me to Captain Marvel.
For those blissfully unaware of the issue, the latest superhero movie features a female protagonist, and the actress who plays her has expressed some mildly feminist views. So?
Well, for a significant number of men, all of this is apparently extremely threatening. Mobs swamped internet sites like rottentomatoes.com with negative reviews before the movie opened, i.e., before they could even have seen it; YouTube filled up with attack videos and predictions that the film would be a disastrous failure.
Marvel rage recognizably drew on the same pathological pettiness as straw rage and hamburger rage. As it happens, the movie appears to be a big hit and is receiving favorable audience scores. This shows that the men afflicted with this syndrome are a fairly small minority.
But it's not a minority without influence. Mr. Nunes was, for a time, among the most important politicians in Washington. CPAC sets the agenda for the party that controls the White House and the Senate. The recently revealed radio rants of Fox News' Tucker Carlson could have come straight out of one of those bizarre anti-Brie Larson screeds.
The point is that demented anger is a significant factor in modern American political life - and overwhelmingly on one side. All that talk about liberal "snowflakes" is projection; if you really want to see people driven wild by tiny perceived slights and insults, you'll generally find them on the right. Nor is it just about racism and misogyny. Although these are big components of the phenomenon, I don't see the obvious connection to hamburger paranoia.
Just to be clear: To paraphrase John Stuart Mill, I'm not saying that most conservatives are filled with rage over petty things. What I'm saying instead is that most of those filled with such rage are conservatives, and they supply much of the movement's energy. Not to put too fine a point on it, pathological pettiness almost surely put Donald Trump over the top in the 2016 election.
At this point, you probably want to know what I think we should do about it. The truth is that I don't know. I guess there's some case for using taxes rather than regulations to control pollution, since you won't be telling people directly what to do. But one suspects that the people I'm talking about will still find something to be hysterical about.
At the very least, however, we should realize what's happening. It may be comforting to believe that politics is driven by more or less rational considerations of costs and benefits. But the reality is that a lot of it is driven by unreasoning rage.

How to respond to the New Zealand shooting

Texto completo: It’s telling that Americans can’t even unite in condemning a mass shooting in New Zealand. The issue is still wrapped up in our debate on gun control laws and rhetoric here. We’ve lost the ability to assume good intentions from people across the aisle.

In his new book, Arthur Brooks argues that this type of animosity arises because of our growing contempt for each other.

The president of AEI and Washington Post columnist says we suffer from “motive attribution asymmetry,” which makes Republicans think Democrats are motivated by evil, while their motives are good, and vice versa. The problem is not disagreement, he argues in the New York Times; it’s disdain.

"People often say that our problem in America today is incivility or intolerance. This is incorrect. Motive attribution asymmetry leads to something far worse: contempt, which is a noxious brew of anger and disgust. And not just contempt for other people’s ideas, but also for other people."

This leads to an outrage that “strokes our own biases while affirming our worst assumptions about those who disagree with us.”

Love Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America from the Culture of Contempt came out this week, and the book arrives at a perfect time.

We say we’re sick of our divided country, but we exploit tragedies to express our hate for the other side. The answer, Brooks argues, is to refuse to voice contempt, and when you face it, respond with levity.

When it comes to tragedy, our response is especially important. Contempt for one another helps nothing, and awful moments such as the shooting Friday give us more reason to unite. The more we look at each other with contempt, the less we see the victims with compassion.

Bernie Sanders campaign workers unionize, becoming likely first presidential campaign to do so

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Workers on Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign voted to unionize on Friday, becoming what is possibly the first presidential campaign staff in history to organize.
A majority of the Democrat's staff signed on to unionize, meaning all current and future employees would be part of the bargaining process for better pay and benefits. The workers, everyone below the title of deputy director, will be represented by United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) Local 400, which represents about 35,000 employees in six states and the District of Columbia.
Jonathan Williams, a spokesman for the UFCW, said to his knowledge the Sanders campaign is the first to unionize in history, marking a new path that could be used for campaigns for years to come.
"The best time to join a union is always now," Williams said. "High working standards should be the standard and I would certainly call upon every presidential campaign to look toward the leadership Bernie Sanders' campaign has shown. "

Williams said the next steps are for workers to set up negotiations, something he said would have to happen very soon due to it being a campaign. The UFCW said the agreement could grow to more than 1,000 workers throughout Sanders' 2020 campaign. Employees who transition to the White House, if Sanders were to win, would not be members of the union.
"I hope this breakthrough serves as a model for other presidential campaigns, as well as party committees and candidates for other offices," UFCW Local 400 President Mark Federici said in a statement. "While political campaigns aren’t the easiest work environment, every worker has the right to respect and dignity. "
MORE ELECTION NEWS: Who is running for president in 2020?
In January, Sanders apologized after multiple women said allegations of sexual assault within his campaign were not properly addressed during his 2016 bid for president.
The allegations from multiple women who worked on Sanders' campaign surfaced in the New York Times, which criticized Sanders' campaign for not adequately addressing incidents of sexual harassment, sexist mistreatment and pay disparities between men and women.
On CNN, Sanders apologized to "any woman who feels like she was not treated appropriately. " When asked if he had been aware of the complaints, Sanders said, "I was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case (to be elected as president). "
The allegations and his perceived failure to rectify the issues, female campaign workers told the Times, bring into question whether he can fight for women's interests if he again seeks the presidency.
"I am not going to sit here and tell you that we did everything right in terms of human resources, in terms of addressing the needs that I'm hearing from now, that women felt they were disrespected, that there was sexual harassment which was not dealt with as effectively as possible," Sanders said on CNN.
The UFCW said Sanders' campaign stayed neutral in the unionizing process. Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, wrote on Twitter the campaign was "very proud" of the unionizing effort.
"Bernie Sander is the most pro-union candidate in the field, he'll be the most pro-union president in the White House and we're honored that his campaign will be the first to have a unionized workforce," Shakir said.

Students Across the World Are on Strike. Here's Why.

Texto completo: What began as one student's vigil calling for action on climate change has gone global, with school strikes planned in more than 100 countries on Friday. Here is a look at how the climate protests spread and how political leaders are responding.
A lonely start to an international movement
When a Swedish teenager, Greta Thunberg, sat before her country's Parliament in August, she was a solitary protester, armed with fliers that said she was refusing to attend school to protest adults' lack of concern for her future.
She sought to draw attention to the perilous state of the climate: Data from NASA has shown the past five years to be the warmest on record, and a report last year by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that without aggressive action, the world will face worsening wildfires, food shortages and other catastrophic effects as early as 2040.
Ms. Thunberg's protest quickly drew notice, with others joining in. After the Swedish elections in September, she made her strike a weekly event most Fridays. Then it began to spread, both online under the hashtags #climatestrike and #FridaysForFuture and on the streets.
In Australia, students from more than 200 schools skipped class on Nov. 30 to protest their country's climate policies and call for a ban on any new coal or gas projects.
A shy teenager becomes a leader
Ms. Thunberg, 16, is in some ways an unlikely figurehead for a worldwide movement.
An introvert prone to crippling depression who did not like to speak in class, she was powerfully shaken by lessons about pollution, species extinction and humans' influence on climate.
As her protest drew attention, she attended a United Nations climate conference in December in Poland, where she criticized negotiators. "You are not mature enough to tell it like it is," she said. "Even that burden you leave to us children."
In January, she traveled by train to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where she told a group of elites that many of them had made "unimaginable amounts of money" at the expense of the planet's future.
A Norwegian lawmaker said on Thursday that he and two colleagues had nominated Ms. Thunberg for the Nobel Peace Prize. She said she was "honored and very grateful."
Now the face of a global movement, Ms. Thunberg says her work has given her a welcome sense of purpose.
"I'm happier now," she told The New York Times last month. "I have meaning. I have something I have to do."
A critical response from some leaders
Some school officials and politicians have criticized the protests, calling them a naïve misuse of class time.
Ms. Thunberg has responded sharply.
When Theresa May, Britain's prime minister, called the walkouts a waste of lesson time last month, Ms. Thunberg tweeted: "That may well be the case. But then again, political leaders have wasted 30 yrs of inaction. And that is slightly worse."
More than 1,600 events planned worldwide
Last year, Ms. Thunberg called on the Swedish government to adopt policies in line with the Paris climate agreement, which sets a goal of limiting the global temperature rise from preindustrial levels to well below 2 degrees Celsius.
Students from other schools followed, and Friday's protests could be the largest yet. By early Thursday, more than 1,600 events were scheduled in at least 105 countries, according to organizers.
"Tomorrow we schoolstrike for our future," Ms. Thunberg tweeted. "And we will continue to do so for as long as it takes."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: I’ve mostly taken this week off, resting up to face the last of this horrid winter. But I break silence briefly just to pass along a New York Times version of a point I’ve made a couple of times before — namely that the rest of the world, and I especially refer to the rich democratic nations of the world, do not have a fainting spell every time the word socialism gets mentioned (even though the Republican fearmongers are counting on such a fainting spell to re-elect their current darling in 2020).
In his Thursday column, Times columnist Roger Cohen takes us to the suffering of France. Two of France’s recent presidents (Valery Giscard d’Estaing and François Hollande) were Socialists. I spell that with a capital S because that wasn’t their closet ideology — that was the name of their party (Giscard won two terms).
France, as you know, is a hellhole, but mostly because the pastry is too rich, not because the people are too poor or deprived of basic liberties. Here’s Cohen’s excellent overview of the hellscape:
France has one of the world’s most elaborate social protection systems. The ratio of tax revenue to gross domestic product, at 46.2 percent, is the highest of all Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. In the United States, that ratio is 27.1 percent. Look no further to grasp Franco-American differences.
This French tax revenue is spent on programs — universal health care, lengthy paid maternity leave, unemployment benefits — designed to render society more cohesive and capitalism less cutthroat. … Socialist presidents have governed France for half of the past 38 years.
The country has paid a price for its social solidarity, particularly in high unemployment. But France has prospered. It has a vibrant private sector. It is a capitalist economy, among the world’s seven largest. Its socialism is no European exception. The Continent decided after World War II that cushioning capitalism was a price worth paying to avoid the social fragmentation that had fed violence.
The parties that produced Europe’s welfare states had different names, but they all embraced the balances — of the free market and the public sector, of enterprise and equity, of profit and protection — that socialism or its cousin social democracy (as opposed to communism) stood for. Socialism, a word reborn, has none of the Red Scare potency in Europe that it carries in the United States. It’s part of life. It’s not Venezuelan misery.
And yet, because some Democrats now actually use the S-word to describe themselves (although the party has never nominated anyone that does), Republicans are hoping to turn the election into a referendum on socialism vs. freedom, truth, justice and the “American Way,” as the opening of the 1950s “Superman” show used to term it.
But if you can stand to get past the scare words, you’ll find that the “democratic socialists” are not talking about borrowing any examples from Venezuela or Stalinist Russia. They’re talking about hellholes like Sweden, Canada and France, where everyone can see a doctor when they need one.
I’ll try not to write about this baloney for at least a month.
The full Cohen column is here.

Texto completo: The Loft’s first Wordplay book festival – a two-day spree of famous authors, books, talks, books, workshops, books, kids’ activities, books, and a concert at First Avenue featuring famous authors (and probably books) – is now just under two months away. If you’re a book lover who hasn’t yet blocked out May 11-12 on your calendar, you might want to do that now.
For a new festival, the lineup is big league: more than 100 authors including marquee names like Stephen King, Amy Tan, Dave Barry, Marlon James, Natasha Tretheway, Mitch Albom, Jamaica Kincaid, Jared Diamond, Tommy Orange, Edwidge Danticat and Bill McKibben.
Tickets (actually, wristbands) go on sale tomorrow (Thursday, March 14) for Loft members, Friday for the rest of us. Steph Opitz, Wordplay’s founding director, told the Star Tribune’s Laurie Hertzel that about 10,000 tickets will be available, so the number is finite. If you’re 17 or under, you get in free to the street festival. For everyone else, it’s a $10 wristband.
Wordplay is practically giving us Stephen King. He’ll be in conversation with Benjamin Percy, another master of the horror genre, at 10 a.m. Saturday on the Loft stage, an outdoor stage on the street. Right after, that stage will host Jamaica Kincaid and Edwidge Danticat in conversation. On Sunday you can see Bill McKibben there at noon.
Events will take place on eight stages: two in the Guthrie (proscenium and Dowling Studio), one in Open Book (the performance hall on the second floor), one in the Mill City Museum (the cooking stage) and four on the street. For Guthrie events, which include Albom, Diamond, Trethewey and James, to name a few, you’ll need a $40 wristband if you want to get in. But that won’t guarantee a seat. Only a $250 wristband will. That’s an all-access pass to everything but the First Avenue concert on Friday night ($40) and generous weekend classes and workshops at the Loft with visiting Wordplay authors ($40-$250).
You can take your chances and just show up, but don’t bring cash. Wordplay is a cashless festival. A safer bet is to decide how involved you want to be and what your budget will allow, then go for it. All wristbands include a $5 book voucher.
The picks
Tonight (Wednesday, March 13) and tomorrow at the Ted Mann: University Opera Theatre and Arbeit Opera Theatre present Menotti’s “The Consul.” Though he’s best known today for his Christmas classic “Amahl and the Night Visitors,” Gian Carlo Menotti won the Pulitzer for “The Consul,” a dark work in three acts that takes place in an unnamed European totalitarian state. Dissident John Sorel is on the run from the secret police; his wife, Magda, must apply for a visa to leave the country. As she waits and waits for a bureaucratic gatekeeper to grant her visa, she loses everything. A performance by students, accompanied by piano. 7:30 p.m. Pre-opera lobby discussion at 6:45. FMI and tickets ($25-5). Arbeit Opera Theatre is a new company in town, created in January 2018 by Kelly Turpin to promote local talent, present socially relevant productions, break down barriers and share the excitement of opera theater with as many communities as possible.
Now at the Children’s Theatre: The Hobbit. The world-premiere production of Greg Banks’ adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s classic fantasy-adventure is one of the season’s most anticipated events. Banks, who has a long history with CTC, has turned the jam-packed book into two hours of theater (including intermission) performed by a cast of five, with everyone except Dean Holt playing multiple roles. Holt is our hero, Bilbo Baggins, who leaves his comfortable life because he must. Joy Dolo is the wizard Gandalf, Bombur, a troll, Gollum, and the Elven Queen; H. Adam Harris is Kili, a troll, and Smaug, the dragon; Becca Hart is Balin, a troll, and a bard; Reed Sigmund is Dwalin, Thorin, and the spider (remember that horrible spider?). For ages 8 and up. FMI and tickets ($15-79); 612-874-0400.
Now at the Film Society’s St. Anthony Main Theatre: “Apollo 11.” July is the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing. This is not the Ryan Gosling “First Man” version, though we’ve heard that’s a pretty good movie. This is a documentary, meticulously pieced together from archival film and audio sources, that the New York Times called “entirely awe-inspiring.” Director Todd Miller mined all-original materials, including a newly discovered trove of 65mm Panavision reels and thousands of hours of uncatalogued audio recordings. See it for the history, the drama, the technological accomplishment, and the thrill. And the seas of white shirts. FMI including trailer, times and tickets.
Thursday at Ramsey County Library – Roseville: Club Book: Emily Bernard. Born in Tennessee, growing up as a person of color in the American South, the mother of two daughters adopted from Ethiopia, authority on Langston Hughes and currently on faculty at a university in the whitest state of America (that would be Vermont), Bernard has perspectives on race worth hearing. She’s touring with her new collection of essays, “Black Is the Body: Story from My Grandmother’s Time, My Mother’s Time, and Mine.” 7 p.m. Free. If you can’t come in person, a podcast will be available soon. FMI.
Friday through Sunday: “Beethoven/5”: Jonathan Biss Plays Beethoven’s Third Piano Concerto. This will be the fourth concert in a remarkable five-year collaboration between pianist Biss and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. Each concert pairs a Beethoven piano concerto with the premiere of a new work by a contemporary composer, written in response. So far we’ve heard Beethoven 2, paired with Timo Andres’ “The Blind Banister”; Beethoven 1 with Sally Beamish’s “City Stanzas”; and Beethoven 4 with Salvatore Sciarrino’s “The Dream of Stradella.” This weekend it’s Beethoven 3 with Pulitzer Prize winner Caroline Shaw’s “Watermark.” The SPCO is the lead commissioner on all five new works. 11 a.m. Friday at the Ordway Concert Hall, 9 p.m. Saturday at the Ordway Concert Hall (wait list) and 3 p.m. Sunday at St. Andrew’s Lutheran Church in Mahtomedi. Mischa Santora will conduct the Shaw. FMI and tickets ($11-50; kids and students free).

Texto completo: President Donald Trump in an emergency ordered grounded two Boeing airplane types Wednesday, March 13, including the 737 Max 9 and Max 8.
After Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash killed 157 people, several nations barred the Boeing 737 Max 8. Until Trump’s announcement, the Federal Aviation Administration had said that it didn’t have any data to show the jets are unsafe.
Trump cited “new information” had come to light in the ongoing investigation into the incident. He didn’t elaborate.
Travelers who need to check flight status and aircraft type can do so a couple of ways. First, check your ticket to determine the aircraft type. It’s often listed as “equipment.”
Flight tracking websites also can help determine what’s flying at any given moment. For example, FlightAware.com shows United 1117, operating a Boeing 737 Max 9, is due to land at LAX by 2:22 p.m. The site said the flight, with the aircraft type listed as “B39M,” is running 8 minutes late. Two other Max 9 aircraft (United 2373 and 417) and were heading to the Hawaiian islands from LAX.
A more generic search for the Max 8 aircraft (listed as aircraft type B38M) shows dozens of the twin-jet airplanes in the sky worldwide.
The travel website kayak.com told MarketWatch it would begin including aircraft type.
If you want to switch flights based on the assigned aircraft, be warned: That will most often come with steep flight-change fees.
Trump’s order to ground the two aircraft types came hours after Canada’s transport minister said newly available satellite-tracking data suggested similarities between the crash in Ethiopia and another accident last October. In a statement released after Trump’s announcement, the FAA also cited “newly refined satellite data” as supporting the decision to ground the jets, the New York Times reported.

Airline pilot: Is it still safe to fly in a Boeing 737 Max? Don't worry about it just yet.

Resumen: Recent crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia of Boeing's 737 Max aircraft have passengers worried. But air travel has actually never been safer.

Texto completo: Last October, a Boeing 737 Max 8, operated by a low-cost Indonesian airline called Lion Air, crashed after takeoff from Jakarta, killing everyone on board. Then, on Sunday, an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed near Addis Ababa, under eerily similar circumstances, killing 157 people from more than 30 countries.
The million dollar question is whether these accidents are linked, and whether Boeing’s 737 Max, the newest and most sophisticated variant of its venerable 737 line, harbors a deadly defect.
Reports of the Lion Air crash point to a flaw in something called MCAS, which stands for Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, an automatic system designed to keep the plane's nose from pitching upward at too steep of an angle. The problem occurs when faulty data sense an impending aerodynamic stall when there isn't one, triggering the plane's stabilizer trim — stabilizers are the wing-like horizontal surfaces beneath the tail — to force the nose down.
Read more commentary:
Ethiopia crash of Boeing 737 Max might be latest example of backfiring safety efforts
Boeing: Safety will always be a core value
Have you gained or lost weight? Congrats, TSA is now tracking you for suspicious activity.
Essentially, evidence suggests that the Lion Air pilots lost control of their ability to maintain level flight and failed to recognize what was happening in time to disconnect the errant system.
Did the same thing happen in Ethiopia?
Grounding their Boeing 737 Max fleets
At this point it's impossible to know, but certainly things are pointing in that direction, and a growing number of countries are worried enough to have ordered the grounding of their carriers' 737 Max fleets. If the investigators do determine a link, there's quite a bit at stake — for the plane’s manufacturer, for the world's airlines and for the traveling public. Boeing will need to implement a fix, be it a hardware solution, a software solution or both, in a process that is likely to take weeks or longer.
In the meantime, is the Max safe to fly? The short answer is yes. Why the Ethiopian pilots didn’t simply override the errant MCAS, if in fact that’s what they were dealing with, isn’t understood. Perhaps, like the Lion Air crew before them, they were simply overwhelmed by a cascade of warnings, faulty messages and unstable aircraft movements.
But disconnecting the system is, or should be, pretty straightforward, and passengers can take some comfort in knowing that Max pilots everywhere, together with the various airline training departments, are acutely aware of the issue and how to deal with it.
The outright grounding of an aircraft model is unusual but not unprecedented. New jets are sometimes beset by technical issues in their early days of service. Normally these problems are minor, if expensive, nuisances (engine problems plagued the first 747s, for example). But there have been catastrophic instances too.
Despite headlines, air travel is remarkably safe
We remember the Comet, the world's first commercial jet, and the stress-crack disasters that led to its grounding and redesign. The McDonnell Douglas DC-10 was plagued by troubles from the start, including a poorly designed cargo door that killed 346 people in the horrific Turkish Airlines crash in 1974. Five years later, all DC-10s in the United States were grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration after the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 killed 271 people at Chicago's O’Hare International Airport — to this day, the deadliest crash ever on U. S. soil, excluding the 9/11 attacks. More recently, the 787's debut was marred by a series of battery fires.
For the airline passenger, these can seem like scary times. Air crashes, perhaps more than any other type of catastrophe, have a way of haunting the public’s consciousness, particularly when the causes are mysterious.
My best advice, maybe, is to take a step back and look at this through a wider lens. The fact is, Lion Air and Ethiopian notwithstanding, air travel has never been safer. Out of 35 million commercial global flights in 2017, only two ended in accidents resulting in deaths of passengers.
Since the Lion Air incident, two fatal crashes in five months is tragic, but in decades past it wasn’t unusual to see a dozen or more air disasters worldwide in a given year. Nowadays, two or more is downright unusual.
In the United States, there hasn’t been a large-scale disaster involving a mainline carrier in a decade — an absolutely astonishing statistic. There are far more planes, carrying far more passengers, than ever before, yet the accident rate is a fraction of what it once was. Despite the recent headlines and until we know more information, then, airline passengers should fly easy.

Texto completo: Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar's comment that the influence of the Israeli lobby in Washington pushes lawmakers to take a pledge of "allegiance to a foreign country" was bad enough. A watered-down House resolution condemning, not Omar, but "all hatred" was as tepid as denouncing drunk driving.
After heated debate within their caucus, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership released a separate statement: "Congresswoman Omar's use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel's supporters is deeply offensive. We condemn these remarks and we call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately apologize for these hurtful comments."
Omar complied, but this is not the first time she's had to walk back controversial comments about Israel.
In 2012, Omar tweeted: "Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."
This old anti-Semitic trope will be familiar to anyone with a minimal understanding of the history of the Jewish people and the genocidal goal of their enemies. Yes, Omar apologized, but not until she got to Congress. This assumes her apology was more political, than sincere. Consider her appeal to Allah. Why would she, or any Muslim, disobey Allah?
Sarah Stern, who heads Endowment for Middle East Truth, which bills itself as "a Washington, D.C.,-based think tank and policy center with an unabashedly pro-America and pro-Israel stance," emailed to say, "We Jews have learned from our long and painful history that words matter. Violence against Jews does not erupt in a vacuum; and the increasing ease with which anti-Semitic comments are uttered within certain segments of our society is deeply painful and disturbing."
You have to be taught to hate, as Oscar Hammerstein wrote in the musical "South Pacific," and hatred is at the heart of anti-Semitism, most notably in radical Islam. It can only get worse if those who harbor anti-Semitic sentiments -- like Omar and her colleague and fellow Muslim, Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib -- are elected to Congress.
According to The Daily Caller, Maher Abdel-qader, a key fundraiser for Tlaib, shared an anti-Semitic video which described Jews as "satanic." The clip included this comment: "Research the truth about the Holocaust, and you'll definitely start to question what you thought you knew." The video's narrator went on to question whether 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust. The Caller writes, "Abdel-qader shared the video both on his personal Facebook page and within the group that now includes Tlaib."
Morton A. Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), the oldest pro-Israel group in the U.S., told Mark Levin on Levin's radio show: "... the Democrat party has shown a lack of will to tell the truth of the Arab-Islamist war against Israel. In a recent BDS vote to stop BDS, boycotting Israel, the innocent Israel, half of the Democrats voted against that bill. Virtually every Republican voted for it. ... So we have a real problem with the Democratic party."
In a New York Times column earlier this month, Bret Stephens, who is Jewish, wrote: "If Pelosi can't muster a powerful and unequivocal resolution condemning anti-Semitism, then Omar will have secured her political future and won a critical battle for the soul of the Democratic Party. At that point, the days when American Jews can live comfortably within the Democratic fold will be numbered."
I wish, but the history of Jewish loyalty to the Democrats is long, which is a mystery since in the end we are again talking about their survival, not just as a Middle East nation, but as a people.

Texto completo: Award-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, the first Latina to anchor a PBS “Frontline” report, will give the 50th Hays Press-Enterprise Lecture next month in Riverside.
Hinojosa is executive producer of “Latino USA,” a Peabody Award-winning program aired on National Public Radio. She has worked for CNN, PBS, CBS during a 30-year news career. Hinojosa’s 2011 “Frontline” report, called “Lost in Detention,” analyzed alleged abuse at immigrant detention centers.
Her topic will be “Latinos in the Media.” The free lecture is set for 11 a.m. Tuesday, April 9, in UC Riverside’s University Theatre. Reservations are suggested and free parking will be in Lot 6 on campus.
“This is a time of unprecedented emphasis on the Latino diaspora in the national media of the United States, and I look forward to the unique insights and rich historical knowledge that Ms. Hinojosa will be able to share with our UCR campus community,” UC Riverside Chancellor Kim Wilcox said in a UCR news release.
The lecture is named for Howard H “Tim” Hays Jr., the former longtime owner and publisher of The Press-Enterprise. His son, Tom Hays, created an endowment to ensure the lecture series continued after his father’s 2011 death.
Hinojosa will join the long list of journalists who have delivered the lecture. They include Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee and Marty Baron from the Washington Post, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni, CNN President Tom Johnson, former Wall Street Journal Publisher Karen House, Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page, former Los Angeles Times editor Davan Maharaj, and Ray Suarez from the PBS NewsHour and Al-Jazeera.
Hinojosa has won four Emmys; the Robert F. Kennedy Award for Reporting on the Disadvantaged; and the Edward R. Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club for best documentary for “Child Brides: Stolen Lives,” the release states.
She has been a syndicated columnist for King Features/Hearst and written two books: “Raising Raul: Adventures Raising Myself and My Son,” and “Crews: Gang Members Talk with Maria Hinojosa.” Hinojosa, born in Mexico City, was raised in Chicago.

Microbiome firms await new FDA chief

Texto completo: NEW YORK — It's not really a stretch of the imagination to think that microbiome companies should care deeply about who will lead the Food and Drug Administration after the current commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, departs in a few weeks. After all, no microbiome-based drug has yet gone through the regulatory process and made it to market, and investors are still skittish about how those drugs will be received by the agency.
Yet a five-person panel of microbiome executives on a panel at the inaugural Chardan Microbiome Summit in New York last week didn't address the shift in leadership until prompted by a member of the audience. And when they did, the response was essentially “meh."
“I'm not anticipating any change. I think the regulatory flexibility we've seen in the last few years has been attributed to Gottlieb," Aoife Brennan, CEO and chief medical officer of Synlogic in Cambridge, said during the panel discussion.
“But I think a lot of the science-based regulation we've seen is a trend that pre-dated him."
Any remaining regulatory issues around microbiome-based drugs will probably become more pronounced as companies get closer to asking the agency to approve a microbiome-based medicine.
It's impossible to say when that might happen. Cambridge-based Seres Therapeutics, considered one of the companies closest to filing for approval, reported in 2018 that it expected to wrap up a Phase 3 trial for a drug to treat C. difficile infections in June 2019.
C. difficile is considered an “urgent threat" by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infection with this bacterium kills about 15,000 people in the United States each year. Most companies working on microbe-based drugs have something to treat C. difficile in their pipelines, including Seres, Vedanta Biosciences, and Finch Therapeutics.
In its most recent annual report, Seres noted that recruiting participants for its trial was difficult because of competition from fecal microbiota transplants, which the company described as an “uncontrolled, understudied, and unapproved product."
These transplants essentially move fecal matter — and the microbes living in it — from a donor into a recipient. In contrast, microbe-based drugs are often manipulated in some way: They may include just one strain of microbe or a group of them, and they're often put into some form that people can take as they would a pill. They may also be small-molecule drugs that are intended to influence the composition of an individual's microbiome.
Fecal microbiota transplants currently fall into a gray area at the FDA. It has chosen to exercise “enforcement discretion," essentially promising not to crack down on companies performing these transplants for some uses without going through the agency first.
Companies working on microbe-based drugs, however, have been assuming that they must go through the agency's drug approval process, and a recent New York Times article implied that draft guidelines from the agency, clarifying that ­microbiome products would be treated as drugs, might create tension between the two parts of the industry once they are ­finalized.
“I'll admit that I was a little surprised that the Times revived that debate" about whether these products were drugs, said Taylor Feehley, a senior research analyst at Chardan who covers biotech and was the organizer of last Thursday's event. “In talking to many people across the space, I thought we were all on board for the regulatory path."

Commit to growing the middle ground during season of sacrifice At work, at play and in our politics and our faith, many of us are living in a time of extremes.

Texto completo: CAPE ELIZABETH -- The season of Lent is here. About a quarter of Americans observe Lent, according to Christianity Today, including 61 percent of Catholics and 20 percent of Protestants. Lent lasts 40 days and goes from Ash Wednesday until the Thursday before Easter. It is a time of abstinence, of giving things up - most often foods and luxuries - as a way to shift focus from the secular to the spiritual.
The Christian observance of Lent does not dominate non-Christians in the way that Christmas does, though many religions engage in the ritual of self-denial as do even non-religious adults. In general, religious self-denial is a way to mean business about honoring God and the sacred and recognizing the reality of suffering in life. This "fasting" - from food or luxuries or worldly activities - balances the magnetic pull of secular life. Ramadan for Muslims is a month-long time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion. It is specific about abstinence requiring no eating from sundown to sunrise, no smoking and no sexual activity. Jews practice an absolute fast for 24 hours at Yom Kippur with no eating and drinking at all. Hinduism has several periods of fasting wrapped around the ascending and descending moon.The New York Times has reported on Lent's observance among secular adults, including former Christians sentimental about their roots, who see it as a time for discipline and self-improvement.
After the fasting comes the feasting. There are special foods in abundance with treats galore. No holds barred. And so, we live in a rhythm of fasting and feasting, feasting, then more fasting. We feast and we are fat in so many ways. We live in a time of extremes with people thinking and being at opposite ends of the continuum. We are workaholics and then playaholics. One percent of the world's population holds most of the world's wealth, while nearly half the world struggles to meet basic needs.
Political parties take positions at opposite ends of their political continuum and rarely venture toward the middle. We act out rightness and wrongness with little awareness that leaves space to find common ground. We are religiously divided, with some hanging on tight to the end of the continuum of traditional belief, allowing for no change, while the ranks of the disenfranchised former believers and atheists grow larger at the other far end.
We are in desperate need of the middle, where balance lives. Could the Lenten season be a time to commit to growing a middle ground? It will be a tough 40 days even if you practice only on your own home. You can grow the middle by:
n
Shifting to only listening when heated differences emerge in conversation.
n
Slow down your reaction to a repugnant idea by asking,"What don't I like? What do I like? What do I find interesting?" - and sharing your thoughts.
n
Build in a count of 30 when you want to indulge in too much food and drink, too much screen time, too much rightness to allow yourself space to truly choose.
n
Give up the concept of "right and wrong" and use the concept of "dilemma" or "conundrum" that needs a practical resolution.
n
Try some silence to create a natural balance in yourself that will help you find the center of any continuum of opposition you happen to be on.
New behavior needs exaggeration and focus. What if this Lenten season were used to abstain from staying in opposition to others and to practice meeting in the middle?

Texto completo: When Matt Hogenauer walks the hallways at Falmouth High School, he wonders whether he is being exposed to preventable infectious diseases - a dangerous health risk for him that wouldn't be a major concern if Maine didn't have so many unvaccinated students.
"There's the potential that all of these things would make me very sick," said Hogenauer, a senior.
Hogenauer has non-rheumatoid arthritis, and the medications he takes suppress his immune system, making him vulnerable to infectious diseases like pertussis, measles, mumps and chickenpox.
Maine has one of the highest vaccination opt-out rates in the nation, as parents forgo school-required immunizations for their children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means the state is susceptible to outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has the worst rate of pertussis, or whooping cough, in the country.
On Wednesday, the Legislature's education committee will hold a public hearing on a bill sponsored by Rep. Ryan Tipping, D-Orono, that would eliminate all non-medical exemptions to school-required vaccinations. If approved, Maine would join California, West Virginia and Mississippi as the only states to do so.
Washington state and New York City are grappling with measles outbreaks caused by unvaccinated people spreading the infectious disease. Seventy-one people have so far fallen ill with measles in Washington, and 133 have been sickened in New York City, according to state and city health officials. In one private school in Brooklyn, one unvaccinated student infected at least 21 others with measles, The New York Times reported.
From Jan. 1 to Feb. 28 of this year, 206 cases of measles were reported in 11 states, from Washington to Connecticut, the Maine CDC said in a Friday. The last reported measles case in Maine was in 2017, the agency said, and the person who was infected had acquired the disease after traveling overseas.
"Measles is still common in many parts of the world, including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa," Maine CDC said in the statement. "People who are not vaccinated can contract measles while traveling, then bring it back to the U.S. and infect others who are unvaccinated."
Meanwhile, Maine has the worst per capita rate of pertussis in the nation, with 446 cases in 2018, a rate that's more than five times the national average. Through February, 95 pertussis cases were reported in Maine this year, tracking ahead of 2018.
Hogenauer will already be out of Maine schools by the time the bill would go into effect - he's due to go into a pre-medicine program at Haverford College near Philadelphia this fall - but he said for the health benefits for other Maine students he's become a strong advocate for the bill.
"I compare not getting vaccinated to drunk driving. You're not only putting yourself at risk, but you could hurt others," he said.
Hogenauer, 17, said he contracted pertussis in 2016, and he suspects - although he can't prove it - that fellow students he knew were unvaccinated and spread the disease to him.
"That's when the anti-vaccine movement became a real, tangible thing to me," Hogenauer said. "I had a really nasty cough for two to three weeks."
Hogenauer's health depends heavily on "herd immunity," which is the protection granted to the immune-compromised or children too young for vaccines. When nearly everyone is vaccinated, the diseases aren't circulating as much, which means they have a much more difficult time spreading.
Some of Maine's schools have reported dangerously low vaccination rates, compromising herd immunity. For some infectious diseases, herd immunity can be weakened if there's less than 95 percent of students vaccinated.
The Maine CDC said 31 public elementary schools were reporting 15 percent or higher rates of unvaccinated kindergarten students in the 2017-18 school year, the latest year for which statistics were available.
In 2017-18, 5 percent of Maine children entering kindergarten - about 600 children statewide - had non-medical exemptions for immunizations, with their parents opting out on philosophic or religious grounds.
Dr. Laura Blaisdell, a Yarmouth pediatrician and advocate for vaccines, said immune-compromised people are not uncommon.
For instance, people who have had organ transplants, adults with cancer, diseases like lupus and arthritis and people who take long-term steroids all have potentially weakened immune systems. Even people with a common condition like asthma can be temporarily immune-compromised when they are taking certain medications.
"There are many individuals in our communities living in an immune-compromised state," Blaisdell said. "If these preventable diseases are circulating, it is unsafe for them. It's the same reason we don't allow smoking in our schools because we've determined that's not safe."
Research has proven that vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective and have prevented millions of diseases and thousands of deaths in the United States since the 1950s, when the polio vaccine was first introduced. Vaccines for measles, mumps and other common diseases became available in the 1960s, while the chickenpox vaccine was introduced in the 1990s.
Myths that vaccines cause autism have been debunked, and 1998 research that claimed a link was withdrawn and retracted. A new study of 650,000 children in Denmark studied over a decade and released this March again showed no link between autism and vaccines.
Blaisdell said people perpetuating scientific falsehoods about vaccines are "infuriating, fundamentally unnecessary and unfair. The parents who are deciding not to vaccinate their children, for the most part, don't have to deal with the consequences of their decisions," she said.
Bre and Doug Sanderson of Kennebunk have a daughter, Ashley, who was immune-compromised as a kindergartner in 2015 when she was finishing chemotherapy treatments for leukemia. She had to be re-immunized for all preventable diseases.
Bre Sanderson, a nurse, said it was a harrowing time, knowing that Ashley would be vulnerable to chickenpox, measles and other diseases that could have resulted in hospitalization or even death. But they also believed it was important for Ashley to attend school, so they closely monitored her classroom for illnesses, and a few times kept her home if too many kids were ill.
No one in her class had chickenpox or measles, but there was one case of pertussis that year in the school. Ashley, now 9, has fully recovered from leukemia and is no longer immune-compromised.
"I feel very lucky it didn't happen to us. It's scary," Bre Sanderson said. "Our child, regardless of her health, deserved an education. A school should be a safe zone for all kids."
Tipping, the lawmaker sponsoring the bill, said he's sensing momentum behind his measure, especially with the news of other infectious disease outbreaks in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere.
"I'm hearing more from families and parents who want this (bill) to happen in Maine, seeing what's happening to families in the Northwest. There is an urgency," Tipping said.
Former Gov. Paul LePage vetoed a similar bill in 2015, and the Legislature came up a few votes short in a veto override attempt. Gov. Janet Mills has not said whether she supports Tipping's bill, but in general she has been more supportive of public health efforts than her predecessor.
Hogenauer, the Falmouth High student, hopes to learn more about the immune system in his college premed studies. If he has to miss weeks of college by contracting an infectious disease, that could set back his schooling. But he hopes Maine and other states strengthen vaccine requirements.
"We should use the public schools as leverage to get as many to vaccinate as possible," he said.

Juan Sanchez stepping down as CEO of Southwest Key Programs

Texto completo: Juan Sanchez, who stirred controversy in recent months as CEO of the nation's largest nonprofit dedicated to sheltering migrant children, is stepping down, Southwest Key Programs said Monday.
“Recent events have convinced me that Southwest Key would benefit from a fresh perspective and new leadership,” Sanchez said in a written statement. “Widespread misunderstanding of our business and unfair criticism of our people has become a distraction our employees do not deserve. It’s time for new beginnings."
The South Texas native started Southwest Key in 1987 with five employees, and over the next three decades he built a nonprofit with almost 8,000 employees in seven U.S. states. In the last five years, the influx of migrant children across the U.S.-Mexico border became a boon for the company, which has pulled in over $1.5 billion in federal contracts in the last decade. But the boost in fortunes also brought additional media scrutiny, particularly last year.
In the wake of the Trump administration's "zero-tolerance" policy that separated thousands of children from their parents — in turn swelling the population of migrant children in Southwest Key's shelters — Sanchez came under fire for a series of controversies. His $1.5 million salary was seen as excessive. Allegations of sexual misconduct and lax vetting procedures at Southwest Key facilities threatened to derail its shelter operations in Arizona. Then last September, Southwest Key told The Texas Tribune that Sanchez had an ownership stake in a property that the nonprofit leased.
In December, after publishing a scathing article that said Southwest Key had "stockpiled tens of millions of taxpayer dollars with little government oversight and possibly engaged in self-dealing with top executives," The New York Times reported that the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating "the possible misuse of federal money" by the nonprofit.
When asked in September about allegations that he he'd profited from aggressive immigration policies, Sanchez said he'd been unfairly scrutinized in part because of his ethnicity.
“When you look at the size of Southwest Key, they wondered, how could a Latino have come up and built a company that big? There must be something wrong,” he said. “People cannot understand conceptually how a Latino can make that much money. People have never seen it.”
Orlando Martinez, the chairman of Southwest Key's board of directors, said the nonprofit would conduct a nationwide search for a CEO to replace the retiring Sanchez as it looks carefully at "what is required to evolve and grow as an organization." In the meantime, Southwest Key's chief operating officer, Joella Brooks, will take over as interim CEO, the company said.

Texto completo: Federal disability recipients may want to watch what they post on social media.
The Trump administration could soon use websites like Facebook and Twitter to help find people who claim Social Security disability benefits who are not actually disabled, The New York Times reported.
About 10 percent of Westmoreland County residents under the age of 65 identified as having a disability between 2013 and 2017, according to the Census Bureau. Between the same years, 9 percent of Allegheny County residents under the age of 65 identified as having a disability.
The number of people receiving disability benefits in both counties was not immediately available Monday.
According to the report, social media would be used to identify fraud and to increase the integrity of the program.
The New York Times said administration officials have been working on the proposal with Social Security, calling social media a possible "treasure trove of information" about people applying for benefits.
On Monday, President Trump announced a $4.75 trillion budget proposal, The New York Times reported, proposing to spend "$26 billion less on Social Security programs, including a $10 billion cut on the Social Security Disability Insurance program."
To apply for disability benefits, a Social Security number must be provided for the applicant, spouses and any kids, along with a routing number from a bank.
Information about the applicants medical condition like dates of treatment for all doctors, hospitals and clinics; names of medications taken and the name of the doctor who prescribed them; and the names and dates of all medical tests done much be provided in the application.
Trump also proposed new work requirements for recipients of federal housing support, food stamps and Medicaid, which could reduce spending by $327 billion on the programs over a decade, according to the newspaper.
About 41,000 people in Westmoreland County and 148,000 people in Allegheny County receive benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program, also called food stamps, according to December state figures.

For a growing number of Americans, socialism is OK

Texto completo: You wouldn’t expect democratic socialists to hit the brakes when it comes to social justice.
But in late February members of Inland Empire Democratic Socialists of America learned how to fix brake lights so they could offer that bit of auto repair service, for free, at an upcoming community event. Working tail lights, they reasoned, would mean fewer police traffic stops and, possibly, fewer fatal outcomes for people of color.
Auto repair is just one part of the chapter’s public outreach about an ideology that, increasingly, is finding a more receptive public audience. Polling shows more Americans, especially Democrats, view socialism more favorably than capitalism, even if they have sometimes wildly different ideas of what socialism is.
“It just doesn’t have the same stigma,” Kimberley Coles, a political anthropologist at the University of Redlands, said of the word “socialism.”
“It doesn’t mean there won’t be … rhetoric and seeing what sticks in terms of the insults.”
A Gallup poll from last summer found that for the first time in 10 years, Democrats had a more positive view of socialism (57 percent) than they did of capitalism (45 percent). That shift among Democrats drove down the overall view of capitalism.
“A majority of Americans have retained a positive view of capitalism over the past eight years, but this year’s 56% positive rating is by four points the lowest recorded since 2010,” Gallup reported. “Americans’ positive views of socialism have varied only between 35% and 39%, with (2018’s) reading of 37% right at the trend average.”
Gallup also found that among young people (ages 18 to 29) capitalism had slipped from 68 percent approval in 2010 to 45 percent approval last year.
Gallup isn’t the only pollster seeing that trend.
Thirty-one percent of Democrats in a YouGov poll from last August said they would be “comfortable” with a socialist presidential candidate, compared to just 8 percent for Republicans.
The same YouGov poll found 44 percent of Americans had a favorable view of capitalism, down from 52 percent in 2015. Americans age 18 through 29 are likelier to see the word “socialist” as a compliment while Americans age 65 and older are more likely to consider it an insult, although the 65-and-up group views socialism more favorably now (25 percent) than in 2015 (15 percent), according to YouGov.
Capitalism’s polling dip — and the corresponding rise in approval for the label “socialism” — coincides with ballot box gains by politicians who are connected with the political organization Democratic Socialists of America.
Running as Democrats, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib in 2018 became the first Democratic Socialists of America members to win congressional seats. Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders’ stronger-than-expected 2016 presidential campaign fueled an effort to turn the Democratic Party leftward, a trend that’s continued with Ocasio-Cortez’s celebrity status.
Nationally, Democratic Socialists of America had just 5,000 members prior to November 2016, but passed the 40,000-member mark following Ocasio-Cortez’s upset in New York’s June 2018 primary, according to published reports.
The organization’s Southern California connections include chapters in the Inland Empire, Orange County and Los Angeles. “Our chapter is continuing to grow and evolve from its humble roots,” the Inland chapter collectively wrote in response to emailed questions. “Fresh faces appear at every monthly member meeting.”
It’s not just about faces and personalities, either.
Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal for a Green New Deal, along with proposals from many candidates for universal health care, higher taxes on the rich and other socialist-favored ideas, figure to loom over the crowded race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
It’s also already become a rallying cry — perhaps even the central theme — of Republican election efforts.
During last month’s State of the Union address, President Donald Trump drew applause from supporters when he invoked socialism as a pejorative.
“We are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” he said before declaring that “America will never be a socialist country.”
Fears of socialism “could become the kind of rhetorical touchstone of (President Trump’s 2020) campaign that sounding the alarm about ‘criminal illegal aliens’ was in 2016,” The New York Times reported.
“Socialism is the greatest vulnerability by far that the House Democrats have,” Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, told the Times.
Socialism replaced Hillary Clinton as the main villain at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, which featured a “bread line” mocking Ocasio-Cortez.
“They want to take away your hamburgers,” former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka warned conference-goers. “This is what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved.”
What is socialism?
Americans fight not only over whether socialism is good or bad, but over what it means. Seventeen percent defined socialism as “government ownership of the means of production,” that was about half the number of Americans who used that definition of socialism in 1949, Gallup reported last October.
“Americans today are most likely to define socialism as connoting equality for everyone, while others understand the term as meaning the provision of benefits and social services, a modified form of communism, or a conception of socialism as people being social and getting along with one another About a quarter of Americans were not able to give an answer.”
The Democratic Socialists of America is “a ‘big tent’ organization,” the Inland chapter said. “Members may embrace a variety of tactics, theoretical frameworks, and emphases, but ultimately work toward a classless society undergirded by an economy in which production and the fruits of production are shared by all.”
To fight what the chapter sees as misconceptions – socialism is “inherently totalitarian” or a “mere matter of welfare state programs,” for example – members stress that socialism is organized from the bottom-up, outside of government, and that socialism emphasizes freedom, including “the ability of working people to resist the private tyranny of the firm and its owners,” the chapter said.
Socialism made Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, not the other way around, the chapter said. “Their ideas were popular because the moment was right for a socialist alternative, after a major recession, stagnant wages, and widespread discontent with the status quo.
“Our chapter as a whole is sympathetic to Bernie/AOC, but we seek also to hold them accountable to their promises, and members may find that their views do not completely overlap with theirs. This being said, among elected officials, their reform agenda is the closest in spirit to our movement …”
Besides fixing brake lights, the Inland chapter, which estimates it has 30 to 40 active members, also stumps for Medicare-for-all at events like Riverside’s monthly Public Arts Walk. It also hosts movie screenings with discussions afterward – “Sorry to Bother You” was a recent feature – and members have traveled to Mexico to help migrants at the border.
“A new idea”
Coles and Harold Clarke, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, think socialism’s surging popularity, especially among millennials, is rooted in recent history.
“Socialism’s kind of a new idea for them and it’s detached from a lot of the economics and brutal politics of the past,” Clarke said.
Millennials “aren’t shaped by Cold War politics, much less attachment to political parties,” Coles said. “They’re interested in a la carte political ideas, rather than being labeled as Republicans or socialist.”
They also grew up during the Great Recession of the late 2000s, when capitalism’s flaws “were highlighted in political rhetoric,” Coles added. “Socialism has historically always offered a critique of capitalism and highlighted the inequality of economic and political power.”
The Trump backlash also might be a factor. “With his hotel empire, numerous side businesses, and history of shortchanging employees and contractors, current President Donald Trump perhaps encapsulates capitalism at its worst … ,” Eillie Anzilotti wrote in an article about the Gallup poll results for Fast Company magazine.
She added that Trump alone likely doesn’t explain the drop in capitalism’s popularity, especially among young people. “Since the 1970s, wages (adjusted for inflation) have barely risen, while (the) cost of living has skyrocketed across the U.S. Meanwhile, the top 1% of earners in America … has captured 85% of income growth that’s occurred since 2009.”
The uptick in socialism’s popularity could be a lasting trend, Coles said.
“I feel that these millennial voters are … more interested in learning from others (and are more) cosmopolitan in being willing to take ideas from lots of places,” she said. “It seems that people are interested in new ideas and socialism is offering one set of solutions.”

Texto completo: Despiterecent measles cases, the deadly virus isfacing high vaccination rates in Bay Area children due to a 2016 law that ended most options for parents to avoid immunizing their kids.
"Measles is extremely contagious and can be very serious. The best defense is vaccination," said Dr. Karen Smith, director of the California Department of Public Health.
Health officials confirmedlast week that at least three Bay Area residents contracted measles in February after an international flight. A sick Santa Cruz County adult inadvertently infected two other passengers one from Santa Clara County and the other from San Francisco who were on the plane.
And in Washington state, a measles outbreak has sickened at least 70 people and forced hundreds of students to stay home from school.
The infections evoke worrisome memories of 2015, when a single sick visitor to Disneyland triggered an outbreak in 146 people from several states, many of them unvaccinated children.
That expanding outbreak was blamed on California's permissive vaccine law, which at the time offered easy-to-obtain exemptions, leaving tens of thousands of children unprotected against exposure to measles, mumps and rubella.
But after a highly contentious political battle, California now requires all children to be vaccinated before entering kindergarten; no "personal belief" exemptions are allowed. Schools also are pushing parents to file necessary paperwork regarding their child's vaccinations, so that fewer records are incomplete.
Almost all California kindergartners 96.9 percent are vaccinated, ranking it among the top 10 states in the U.S. for vaccinations, according to the federal Centers For Disease Control and Prevention.
Before the new law, the vaccination rate was lower: 92.2 percent.
California also reduced the rate from 4.4 percent to 1.9 percent of so-called provisional enrollments, when a student has one dose of a vaccine but not the required full course of all doses.
Meanwhile, some other states, such as Texas, are considering proposals that would allow more vaccine exemptions for personal or philosophical reasons. The internet is contributing to suspicion about vaccine safety by spreading anti-vaccine content, such as linking childhood vaccines to autism, which scientists have said is not true.
On Thursday, Facebook announced a plan to combat vaccine misinformation. It will reduce the ranking of groups and pages that spread false information about vaccines so that they appear less often. Other sites, such as Pinterest and YouTube, are taking steps to block anti-vaccine content from appearing in advertising and search results.
"We are fully committed to the safety of our community and will continue to expand on this work," said a statement by Facebook's Monika Bickert, vice president of Global Policy Management.
An analysis of a state Department of Public Health database shows how much vaccine rates have improved particularly in Santa Cruz and Marin counties, which had some of the largest concentrations of parents who refused to get their children immunized over concerns that the shots caused autism and other illnesses.
In 2014-15, 17 schools in Santa Cruz County had kindergarten vaccination rates below 80 percent. Last year, only two schools did. In Marin County, the number of schools with low vaccination rates fell from 19 to four.
Even in private schools, which typically have larger numbers of unvaccinated children, rates have improved.
Three years ago, 33 percent of the students at the private Waldorf School in upscale Los Altos Hills were fully vaccinated. Last year, 83 percent were full vaccinated.
At Menlo Park's Peninsula School, vaccination rates jumped from 67 percent to 90 percent. Vaccination rates at Sausalito's New Village School have increased from 30 percent to 62 percent.
Meanwhile, schools in lower-income communities are getting better at ensuring that parents get their kids to the doctor and deliver the paperwork.
In Alameda County, where Oakland Unified schools had some of the state's highest percentages of kindergartners whose vaccination records were incomplete, rates have soared from 20 percent at some schools in 2014-15 to 95 percent in 2017-2018.
After news of the recent outbreak, Santa Clara County Public Health Department spokeswoman Britt Ehrhardt offered reassurance.
"The general public is at very low risk of measles as a result of these cases. No other passengers contracted measles as a result of exposure on that flight," she said in a statement issued to this news organization. "Public health investigators have not identified any evidence indicating that measles is spreading within the impacted counties."
Large measles outbreaks are occurring in many countries, including in Europe. So far this year, there have been 206 confirmed measles cases in the United States, mostly among unvaccinated people in New York, Texas and Washington state. Most of the cases in New York affected the Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland County, where an unvaccinated child contracted measles in Israel and spread it to unvaccinated children at home, according to The New York Times.
Despite the gains in overall vaccination rates in California and other states, efforts by some high-ranking officials continue to roil the vaccine debate.
In Texas, some lawmakers want to make it easier to opt out of childhood vaccinations, and they're trying to limit public information about exemption rates. And Darla Shine, the wife of former White House communications director Bill Shine, has repeatedly tweeted out debunked information about vaccines.
In February, she expressed sadness that her vaccinated children "will never have the life long natural immunity I have. Come breathe on me!"
"Bring back our #ChildhoodDiseases they keep you healthy & fight cancer," she tweeted.
Measles can cause pneumonia, vision loss, severe diarrhea and even death. In 2017, it killed 136,000 people around the world, including many young children, according to the World Health Organization.
Health experts say measles can be easily prevented with two doses of a vaccine that has been in use since the 1960s. A large new study publishedlast week in the Annals of Internal Medicine found no link between autism and the vaccine, confirming long-accepted consensus among scientists.
"Vaccination is especially important for those who plan to travel internationally," said Smith, of the California Department of Public Health. "Unvaccinated travelers are at high risk of becoming infected and spreading it to others after they come home."

Paul Waldman: What the Democratic presidential candidates aren’t telling us

Texto completo: Beto O'Rourke is inching closer to running for president, as we learn today from the New York Times:
"As the Democratic presidential field takes final shape, Mr. O'Rourke seems inclined to be in this, according to interviews with people who have spoken to him and other top Democrats. He says he has made a decision about whether to run and could announce it as early as this week, unsettling prospective rival campaigns that consider Mr. O'Rourke a credible threat. [...]
"Few doubt Mr. O'Rourke's capacity to upend the race regardless, buoyed by a talent for relentless retail politics, a formidable low-dollar fund-raising army and an unsubtle contrast to front-runners in their 70s, like Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders."
Not only that, the conservative Club for Growth has already put out an ad against him that amounts to a kind of false-flag attack, criticizing O'Rourke for not being progressive enough.
As a general matter I think anyone who wants to should run for president, and if they turn out to be the most compelling candidate then they'll win (though I make an exception for billionaire businessmen). But O'Rourke is among the most unlikely of the major candidates, in ways that call attention to a vital part of the case the candidates ought to be making but largely aren't.
Think about it this way: If you're a Beto O'Rourke admirer, are you excited about the prospect of him running for president, or the prospect of him being president?
To be clear, this applies to lots of candidates; I’m just using O’Rourke as an example. If you watched his unsuccessful Senate race in 2018, you have a good idea of what his presidential campaign would be. He’s enthusiastic, idealistic, and charismatic. He takes unashamedly progressive positions and has shown his ability to activate a grassroots army of volunteers and contributors. He calls people to be hopeful and ambitious without spending too much time tearing down his opponents.
But for the moment - and this could change if he actually runs — it’s hard to know what an O’Rourke presidency would be like; people who like him are mostly attracted to the idea of an O’Rourke candidacy. That isn’t only true of him. Before Sen. Sherrod Brown opted out of the race, there were many Democrats talking about how great he would be; they always pointed to his proven ability to connect to white blue-collar voters and win votes in the Midwest. But you seldom heard anything about why Brown would be a better president than the other candidates. It was just that people thought he could beat Trump.
Which is important, of course. But if you run down the list of Democratic candidates, you’ll see that for most it’s hard to picture them in the Oval Office and know what they’d be doing. Could you rattle off Amy Klobuchar’s top policy priorities, or Kamala Harris', or Cory Booker’s, or John Hickenlooper’s? If you had to describe their fundamental approach to foreign or domestic policy, what would you say?
That doesn’t apply to all of them. It’s pretty clear what Bernie Sanders would try to do if he won, at least in some areas. Jay Inslee has promised to put fighting climate change at the center of his presidency. Elizabeth Warren has the most fully fleshed-out agenda, not only in its particulars - she has issued a series of bold proposals, the latest of which is to use antitrust authority to break up the tech giants — but also in its general approach, which is to reorient capitalism away from the interests of the rich and toward the interests of everyone else.
But for the rest of them, even if they have plenty of policy positions they endorse, it’s hard to know what sort of presidents they’d be. It’s particularly difficult for someone like Beto O’Rourke, who for all his virtues was basically a replacement-level congressman and hasn’t had any executive positions we could judge from.
To be clear, that doesn't mean he or anybody else couldn't become a great president. O'Rourke is often compared to Barack Obama, who was also young and had a limited resume, but turned out to be pretty good at the job. And history is full of presidents who looked on paper like they had the right tools and experience but turned out to be awful.
Which is why what we need from all these candidates isn’t just a recitation of their biographies and a list of policy prescriptions, but also a picture of how they think about the presidency, how their personalities suit them for it, and what they want to do with it. The good news is that they have some time to fill in that picture.

One Twin Did The Crime, But Which One? A New DNA Test Can Find The Culprit

Texto completo: One night in November 1999, a 26-year-old woman was raped in a parking lot in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Police officers managed to get the perpetrator’s DNA from a semen sample, but it matched no one in their databases.
Detectives found no fingerprints at the scene and located no witnesses. The woman, who had been attacked from behind, could not offer a description. It looked as if the rapist would never be found.
Five years later, there was a break in the case. A man serving time for another sexual offense submitted a DNA sample with his parole application. The sample matched DNA from the rape scene.
There was just one catch: The parolee had an identical twin, and standard DNA tests can’t distinguish between identical twins. Prosecutors had no additional evidence to rule out one or the other. Because they couldn’t press charges against either of the men, the case remains open nearly 20 years later.
But maybe not forever.
In recent years, scientists have gained a clearer picture of the early development of the embryos of identical twins. Originating from a single fertilized egg, they later acquire unique genetic mutations. New advances in DNA sequencing are making it possible to pinpoint those mutations - and to tell identical twins apart.
This kind of test could well determine which of the brothers committed the rape. In a recently published study, researchers concluded that the technique was “a realistic option, fit for practical forensic casework.”
Forensic DNA testing arose in the 1990s, years before the first human genome was sequenced. Scientists found that they needed only tiny snippets of genetic material to tell people apart.
That’s because our genomes are sprinkled with segments, known as short tandem repeats (STRs), that mutate much faster than the rest of our DNA. Because of this rapid changeability, these genetic bits tend to vary distinctively from person to person.
Researchers identified 13 STRs that were very effective in matching people to DNA samples. The probability of the STRs all being identical in two unrelated people is less than one in a trillion.
DNA testing became a standard legal tool for identifying criminal suspects and resolving paternity disputes. But for all its power, the test could not tell identical twins apart. And that led to some Kafkaesque impasses.
In 2004, for example, Holly Marie Adams won a paternity suit in Missouri against Raymon Miller for child support. A standard DNA test indicated that he was the father. Miller appealed the case because Adams had also had sex with his twin brother, Richard. A DNA test on Richard also yielded a match.
“The results of blood tests performed on the two brothers demonstrated that both had a 99.999 percent probability of being the father,” Judge Phillip Garrison wrote. The court was forced to rely on other evidence to decide that Raymon Miller was in fact the father.
Faced with such cases, forensic DNA experts tried something once thought impossible: building a test that could tell twins apart. The researchers took advantage of the fact that identical twins are not, in fact, genetically identical.
When a fertilized egg starts dividing, there’s a small chance each new cell will gain a new mutation. When the cells separate into twin embryos, one gets some of the mutant cells and the other gets the rest. Unique mutations will end up in cells throughout each twin’s body.
In the mid-2000s, scientists at the University of Hanover in Germany wondered if new STRs could arise in one twin and not the other. They developed a test to examine thousands of STRs instead of just 13.
It didn’t work. Their experimental test couldn’t tell identical twins apart. “Our attempts with STRs were probably totally naive,” said Michael Krawczak, a geneticist who now teaches at Kiel University in Germany.
At the time, the costs of DNA sequencing were dropping drastically, raising another possibility. If a test could compare not just STRs but the entire genomes of twins, Krawczak and his colleagues wondered, could it tell them apart?
In 2012, the researchers offered some calculations suggesting that the answer was yes.
Krawczak’s thought experiment captured the imaginations of researchers at Eurofins Scientific, a laboratory testing company based in Brussels.
They decided to give the method a try.
They found twin brothers willing to volunteer their DNA, as well as the DNA of one twin’s child and his wife. The researchers sequenced each person’s whole genome and found enough mutations to distinguish the child’s father from the child’s uncle.
The Eurofins team published this proof of concept in 2014. Soon the news reached David Deakin, an assistant district attorney in Boston, who had been working for years on a rape case against a man named Dwayne McNair.
McNair had come under suspicion for two rapes in 2004. In 2007, the police managed to get DNA from a cigarette McNair cast away, and the STRs were a match to sample from both crime scenes.
But then detectives discovered that McNair had a twin brother, Dwight. Deakin got a court order for a new DNA test, hoping the McNair brothers were fraternal twins.
“No such luck,” Deakin said.
Try as they might, investigators couldn’t firmly determine which of the identical brothers had participated in the rapes. The case stalled until 2010, when detectives tracked down the second rapist in both crimes, Anwar Thomas.
As part of his plea deal, Thomas agreed to identify Dwayne McNair as the other rapist. He had known the McNair twins since high school and said he had no trouble telling them apart. But Deakin would have nothing to offer a jury to prove Thomas was telling the truth.
Then Deakin learned of the Eurofins test. It would be expensive - $130,000 - but Deakin became convinced it could seal the case.
“We were persuaded their science was sound,” he said.
After hearing expert witnesses for both sides, Judge Linda Giles ruled that the test was based on valid scientific principles. But it had yet to be replicated by any other lab or to be laid out in sufficient detail in a peer-reviewed journal article.
“Although the court has the utmost respect for the ability of jurors to comprehend complicated scientific principles, they would not have the luxury of many days of rumination, as this gatekeeper has needed, to untie this Gordian knot,” she wrote in a decision handed down in April 2017.
“So we were out of luck and back where we started,” Deakin said.
The decision was not just a disappointment to Deakin. Prosecutors in Michigan had been considering using the technique to distinguish between the twins in the Grand Rapids rape case. Now they decided against it.
In Boston, the case continued, with a conventional DNA test narrowing the suspects to the twins and the testimony of Thomas specifically against Dwayne McNair.
That turned out to be enough. McNair was found guilty in January 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison.
Since Eurofins published the initial test in 2014, only one other court has asked the company to test twins - in a civil paternity case in Germany, said Burkhard Rolf, director of DNA forensic services at Eurofins.
Rolf, Krawczak and their colleagues decided to write up a mathematically detailed account of their methods. The journal PLOS Genetics accepted the paper but then required them to remove details about the McNair rape case and the German paternity case before publishing it.
Chris Becker, the prosecuting attorney for Kent County, Michigan, said the publication of the paper was a step in the right direction - but not enough for him to make arrests in the Grand Rapids rape case.
Deakin, the Boston prosecutor, was optimistic that such research could lead to its adoption by the courts. “If five or six labs did it, and four or five them reproduced the results and there were no negative results, I think you could get it in pretty easily almost anywhere,” he said.
Krawczak and his colleagues estimate that roughly 1 percent of crime cases and paternity disputes may involve identical twins.
“It’s not something that’s going to happen every day in every laboratory,” Krawczak said. “But once people become aware of this, there may be a lot of cold cases that come back to life.”

Texto completo: [Video: Acorn TV Original | Manhunt | Premieres March 11 Watch on YouTube.]
Binge your way through a British crime series on Acorn TV. Or tune into ABC for the season finale of "The Good Doctor."
What's Streaming
MANHUNT stream on Acorn TV. Martin Clunes, known for portraying the title character of "Doc Martin," a comedy about a grouchy physician practicing medicine in the English countryside, sheds the white coat and dons his serious cap in this three-part crime drama series. Based on a memoir by Colin Sutton, the British detective who led an investigation into the killings of three women that shocked London in the early 2000s, "Manhunt" begins when a young French student is found dead in the suburbs. With no witnesses or forensic evidence on which to rely, Sutton (Clunes) has his team turn over every stone until they find clues that link the murder to two others from years before. The show is already a huge hit in Britain, although critics there disagree about its treatment of murders that really happened -- The Guardian called it sober and responsible, but The Independent found the dramatization "exploitative."
THE PARTY'S JUST BEGINNING (2018) stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. Karen Gillan ("Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle") writes, directs and stars in this dark coming-of-age dramedy about a young Scottish woman who sells cheese at a supermarket by day and drowns her sorrows in alcohol at night. But her wild lifestyle hides somber truths: She's haunted by her best friend's suicide, and no amount of partying can help her overcome her grief.
What's on TV
THE GOOD DOCTOR 10 p.m. on ABC. Last week, Shaun (Freddie Highmore) reached a breaking point. After saving a patient's life, he stormed into Han's office and demanded to be reinstated. But his outburst may have cost him his job. In the season finale, Shaun gets into a bar fight that lands him in the hospital, and Neil (Nicholas Gonzalez) and Audrey (Christina Chang) reveal their relationship to the rest of the staff.
THE PASSAGE 8 p.m. on Fox. Amy (Saniyya Sidney) tells it like it is in this two-part season finale: "I saw the future -- it was bad." When Tim (Jamie McShane) and the rest of the creatures are close to escaping the medical facility, Amy must decide whether to stop them with an explosion that could harm Brad (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) and Sykes (Caroline Chikezie). Even worse, it could rid any trace of a cure for the virus. In his review for The New York Times, Mike Hale wrote that "what makes 'The Passage' a better-than-average show of its type" isn't its supernatural or conspiracy elements, but the "crowd-pleasing" relationship between Amy and Brad.

Texto completo: "America would be more secure and stronger economically if we recognized that we have largely achieved our objectives in Afghanistan and moved aggressively to bring our troops and tax dollars home," Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.) write in an op-ed article. "Today, despite vast investment in training and equipping Afghan forces, the country's deep-seated instability, rampant corruption and, in some cases, compromised loyalties endure. Extending our commitment of combat troops will not remedy that situation."
The senators are right, just as they were right eight years ago when they penned those words for the New York Times with Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). In the near-decade since, the White House has gained a new occupant from a different party, congressional control has shifted and the United States' 17-year Afghan war has been governed by ostensibly new strategies implemented by six different commanders. But the U.S. stalemate in Afghanistan remains fundamentally the same: The war is still a costly and futile project that does nothing to serve U.S. interests or move Afghanistan meaningfully toward political reconciliation or peace.
So little has changed in eight years that Paul and Udall last week introduced legislation that nearly duplicates their 2011 push for withdrawal. The 2019 American Forces Going Home After Noble (AFGHAN) Service Act has updated numbers -- higher counts of U.S. troops killed or wounded, and a larger tally of borrowed tax dollars spent and often wasted -- but its core demand for a quick and responsible exit from the longest war in U.S. history is unaltered.
All the senators' arguments against the war in Afghanistan -- that it is a reckless strategic failure that benefits no one -- are no less applicable now than they were in 2011. Just as then, those against withdrawal show no sign of ever wanting this war to end. And once again, Paul and Udall are faced with a president who has promised to bring American forces home but refused to commit to any reasonably expeditious timeline.
That stagnation is a telling indictment of what passes for foreign policy in Washington. Too many policymakers seem incapable, if not unwilling, of considering the big picture, of asking whether continuing this war is in any sense good, useful, or even in conformity with the will of the people they ostensibly represent. There is plenty of energy for fiddling with the details -- a few thousand more troops here, a new infrastructure project there, drone and other aerial strikes scaled up or down or back up again, with civilian casualty rates following suit.
But in the task of adjusting anything more substantive than tactics in Afghanistan, Washington is generally content with stalemate or slow loss. A war undertaken right after 9/11 has devolved into a generational conflict; it is now being fought by soldiers born after the terrorist attack that precipitated it. And though, according to an October study from the Charles Koch Institute, 57 percent of Americans -- and 7 in 10 veterans -- support a full U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, our government has no such clarity.
President Trump, like President Obama before him, campaigned on shuttering reckless wars of choice, lambasting mission creep and the ineffectual nation building it so often entails. Yet neither president has succeeded in pushing past the inertia of what's been called the foreign policy "blob" -- the Washington establishment who, as one pundit put it, "whine ceaselessly about the collapse of the American security order."
While the rest of the country is past ready to move on, the locus of Washington's foreign policy conversation about Afghanistan (and our half a dozen other conflicts in the Mideast and North Africa) is about the scale at which military intervention should continue forever, not whether it should continue at all.
A less narrow and more realistic assessment makes evident what Paul, Udall and other voices crying in Washington's wilderness contend: There is no U.S.-imposed, militarily enforced solution to Afghanistan's woes, and indefinitely prolonging our occupation cannot and will not change that. Our government is trying to bomb and spend Afghanistan into a political order that can only be achieved by those who must live with the outcomes, both through promising (if still uncertain) diplomatic efforts led by U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and through conversations among various factions of the Afghan people themselves.
Whatever course and time frame those negotiations may take, the business at hand for Washington remains the same: U.S. military intervention in Afghanistan must come to an end. It would be an appalling -- if not exactly shocking -- state of affairs if this point must still be made another eight years hence.

Texto completo: The unsolicited letter arrived too late to save Winston Moseley's soul.
The writer was a pre-med student at Boston University, a good Christian woman, eager to spread the gospel of the Lord.
Melody McCloud was already part of a Massachusetts prison ministry program when she saw Moseley, poised and articulate, doing a New York television interview around Christmas 1975. The naive young woman was moved to write the inmate about God's love.
Inmate No. 64A0102 in the Attica Correctional Facility responded quickly. The name on the envelope with the 13-cent stamp rang no warning bells for McCloud, but a subsequent letter mentioned perhaps the most notorious killing in New York history.
"I was convicted of a murder that has been highly publicized off and on ever since it happened," Moseley explained in one of his neatly-typed, double-spaced letters. "You were only eight in 1964, but I'm talking about the Kitty Genovese case."
McCloud, now 63, eventually received 15 Moseley letters comprising 43 pages, along with four cards and five poems, during an increasingly unsettling correspondence that she ended after six months.
The writings offer insights into Moseley's twisted mind as he discusses the Genovese murder, issues with his wife and his parents, his 1968 prison escape and even his father's dog.
For decades, McCloud kept the letters to herself. But with Moseley dead for two years and the 55th anniversary of the March 13, 1964 murder approaching, she made selected excerpts of his writings available to the Daily News.
"What's a nice girl like me doing in a story like this?" asked McCloud, reflecting on her homicidal pen pal. "I did not know Winston Moseley. I never met him. Had never spoke to him. I wasn't looking for a love match with a prisoner. I stumbled into this."
In one of three letters shared with Daily News, Moseley writes that he suffered "a psychological disturbance" brought on the "serious problems" of his mother and father, among other issues.
"As for Kitty - no I didn't know her," Moseley wrote. "That was just a robbery that went all wrong. She resisted and called me a few different kind of n-----s and I kind of lost my head ... I didn't mean to kill her.
"So for a few minutes I stopped being human."
The facts of the horrifying crime, as detailed in Moseley's confession, are far more chilling.
The killer was cruising in his car through Queens around 3:15 a.m. when he randomly targeted Genovese. He followed his prey back to Kew Gardens, chasing down the terrified 28-year-old before twice plunging a hunting knife into her back.
Genovese's cries for help awoke some neighbors, with one shouting down at her assailant.
Moseley left - but only to cover up his crime. The killer parked his car farther away, and donned a wide-brimmed hat to hide his face. He then returned to stab his pleading, bleeding victim another dozen times, raped her and left Kitty to die on Austin St.
The slaying became a sensation after a New York Times story claimed that 38 neighbors ignored Genovese's screams, and still remains undeniably hard-wired into the American psyche.
The case inspired a 1996 episode of TV crime show "Law & Order," and new books on the case still arrive - including three new biographies for the 50th anniversary. The 2016 documentary "The Witness" followed Kitty's brother Bill as he searched for the truth hidden in the Queens darkness that night.
This Wednesday, a Fordham University forum will discuss the killing's role in the creation of citizen anti-crime patrols like the Guardian Angels.
"The Genovese tragedy remains unique in many ways - a non-celebrity homicide victim who is better known than her killer," wrote Fordham professor Harold Takooshian. "Kitty is known only for the last 28 minutes of her life, not the first 28 years."
Even Moseley, in his letters, referenced the killing as if it was his calling card.
"I was convicted of that crime Melody and I'm not going to try to tell you that I didn't do it," he wrote. "There were extenuating circumstances, and those I may go into with you at some time later."
By mid-1975, Melody was uncomfortable with the changing tenor of their letters. She recalled how Moseley asked her to send him a photo, writing that "you can put yourself in the envelope" as a birthday present.
"I never in my life had a birthday party," he added.
McCloud enclosed the photo with her next letter - followed by a moment of divine intervention. The voice of God, she recalled, actually sounded in her head: "Don't mail that letter 'til you go to the library."
She ignored it, sent the letter and then discovered the details of Moseley's past from articles on an old library microfiche machine: Two other murders, his 1968 escape from a Buffalo hospital, his rape of a woman while on the lam.
A shaken McCloud contacted a postal official near Attica and stopped the letter's delivery. The man told her sternly to to stop writing: "He escaped once. I wouldn't put it past him him to do it again - and kill you."
That was her last letter. Moseley, 81, died behind bars on March 28, 2016, his parole rejected 18 times. McCloud, certain the letters hold a deeper meaning, believes the time is now right to let others read them.
"The documents I have," she said, "can help criminologists and psychologists who study serial killers learn more."

Kushner got a security clearance but I never did

Texto completo: On the surface you wouldn't think Jared Kushner and I have much in common, but we both have an interest in access to secret information.
As a private eye in the 1970s and 80s, I started tracking down skipped debtors, then performed due diligence employment investigations and finally graduated to high profile corporate accountability cases. In the 1990s I became a congressional investigator — like those working for the House Committee on Oversight and Reform chaired by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md.
Cummings in January launched an investigation into security irregularities in the Trump White House, focused in particular on top-secret clearances for nine current and former high level White House appointees. Kushner is now at the top of the list in light of what Cummings called "grave new reports" that President Donald Trump "may have falsely claimed that he played no role" in the clearance process for his son-in-law and senior White House adviser, a highly leveraged real estate developer whose foreign partners include Saudi Arabia and other countries potentially at odds with U.S. policies and interests.
I worked on the Senate Judiciary Committee staff for Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, for three years researching judicial nominees and high-ranking Justice Department appointees seeking confirmations. Typically the individuals whose backgrounds I delved into had long, impressive resumes and abundant bona fides. They had been vetted by the FBI, had completed long detailed questionnaires, and had provided reams of financial records, academic papers and speeches for review.
While I had access to power, I had none of my own. I had an edgy past that included dropping out of college and living in Mexico among hippies and drug dealers. I knew for sure I would never be confirmable. I sat on the bench behind my senator boss during Anita Hill's devastating testimony, but watched Clarence Thomas survive the vote. I saw Zoe Baird's attorney general bid go down in flames over a nanny. I eventually left government for journalism.
On paper, Kushner is even less fit for high-level access than I am. He omitted potentially disqualifying details from his background questionnaire, suggested setting up a back channel to a hostile foreign government during the transition, and has been discussed as a weak link by foreign powers, according to a Washington Post report sourced to "current and former U.S. officials familiar with intelligence reports on the matter."
But, while he may not be qualified, Kushner is deeply persistent and impeccably connected. He was a key player in his father-in-law's election and was responsible for bringing (later disgraced) Cambridge Analytica into the digital campaign. When they arrived in Washington, among other chores, Trump tasked Kushner with brokering Middle East peace.
Kushner given access despite concerns When his original security clearance was delayed, Kushner was assigned an interim designation approved for top-secret access to intelligence reports. The privilege allowed him access to our government's most sensitive secrets — including his own preview copy of the president's daily intelligence briefing.
Provisional approvals are typically issued to allow appropriately vetted individuals to start a security level job right away while the bureaucratic wheels turn. In the months following Trump's inauguration, interim approvals were apparently handed out like Halloween candy. NBC recently reported, based on "two sources familiar with the matter," that career bureaucrats recommending against top-secret clearances for inexperienced officials and unsuitable candidates were overruled in "at least 30 cases."
The indefinite interims came under scrutiny in February 2018 after White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter, working on conditional authority, was publicly accused of domestic abuse. The alleged battering had been disclosed to the FBI agents conducting Porter's background investigation a year before, but Trump's assistant was nevertheless still privy to the president's highly classified papers and phone calls.
Trump's chief of staff, John F. Kelly, a retired 4-star Marine general, took considerable heat from the press on whether he had previously known about Porter's transgressions. Within weeks Kelly revoked or downgraded dozens of the interim clearances, including Kushner's. The New York Times, citing "four people briefed on the matter," reported last week that in May 2018, three months after the interim clearances were revoked, former White House General Counsel Don McGahn cited CIA concerns and continued to refuse to recommend Kushner for a permanent top secret pass. Trump, with ultimate authority in the decision, directed Kelly to give Jared what he wanted.
I didn't make the cut for far less Both McGahn and Kelly, perhaps anticipating future requests from Cummings and other authorities, documented their objections in internal memoranda. The president announced McGahn's departure three months later and Kelly was gone before the year ended. Kushner is still enjoying his West Wing office.
After many years of vetting others, in 2013 I was finally recruited for a clearance level job by a U.S. agency with most of its focus in the Middle East. I was flattered, but I suggested that a history of substance indiscretion would surely eliminate me in a review. My backers and would-be colleagues assured me such past activity would not be a problem ("they are looking for spies, not pot smokers").
I filled out the questionnaire, but it was not to be. The week my application file was assigned for clearance, Edward Snowden turned up in Hong Kong fresh off his National Security Agency desk to humiliate the same federal agency that would review my file. They had repeatedly cleared the talented cyber analyst-turned-whistleblower and were suddenly facing finger-pointing from Congress. My interrogators were especially concerned by a blog post I'd written a few years earlier confessing my respect for hackers as a component of transparency. My job offer was regretfully withdrawn.

Texto completo: LANSING — The Rev. Mark Thompson is openly gay. He serves Lansing Central Methodist Church.
And after the decision last week by the United Methodist Church to continue its ban on same-sex marriage and gay clergy, he is speaking up about his sexual orientation and continuing to protest the church's position.
Thompson, who said he is celibate, is the only active openly gay Methodist minister in the state, according to the state's top Methodist leader, Bishop David Bard. There are more than 800 Methodist churches with 130,000 members in Michigan.
"While our Book of Discipline limits the ordination of gay and lesbian persons, it has always allowed gay and lesbian persons who are not in relationships to be ordained and appointed," Bard said in a written statement to the Lansing State Journal.
Thompson said he will perform same-sex weddings and is discussing with his congregation whether those ceremonies can take place in the church in defiance of church law.
"I'm very clear. I've thought about it, prayed about it. If I'm going to do wedding ceremonies for straight people then, I feel called that I'm going to do them, want to do them, for same-gender people," he said.
As of now, he will only do those outside the church. He declined to say if he's already presided at same-sex weddings. Same-sex marriage was ruled legal by the United States Supreme Court in 2015.
The Methodist General Conference met in St. Louis last week. More than 800 conference members from around the world voted 53 percent to 47 percent to keep the traditional ban in place and strengthen punishment for violating it.
Many Methodists in the U.S., including Thompson, supported a "One Church Plan" that would have allowed individual congregations to decide whether to allow gay clergy and same-sex weddings.
Thompson, 61, was an ordained pastor and married with a family when he came out at age 50. He said he's able to keep his job in the church by remaining celibate.
"I've not made a big issue out of it, but, currently, because of the General Conference situation, I've been speaking out more. I want people to know that I support them, whether they be allies or be LGBTQ people," he said.
Thompson said he was at his last church, Faith United Church in Grand Rapids, for two years before he told the congregation that he was gay. When he was appointed to Central Methodist in Lansing, a church that dates back to 1888, he asked that he be introduced as openly gay. That was 18 months ago.
A few members protested and left, he said, but mostly the 230-member congregation accepted him. A monthly support group meets at the church for LGBTQ people and their allies.
Thompson said he grew up in a small community near Midland. He knew at age 10 that he was gay but said he didn't have the words for it. "I kept it hidden. I didn't want to even look in the mirror and say I was gay," he said.
After he was ordained in 1987, he led Methodist churches around the state. He and his former wife raised three children, who are now adults.
Thompson attended the General Conference meeting last week as a protester, not a delegate. When it became clear that the conference was only going to take up what was called the Traditional Plan, Thompson left in shock and in pain before the final vote. He took 14 hours to make the eight-hour drive, stopping to sleep in his car and hurting.
On Sunday, he shared his experiences at the conference with the congregation but also read a letter from Bishop David Bard, the leader of the church in Michigan. Bard acknowledged the pain of LGBTQ church members and asked for calm. The General Conference's decision is under review of a church judicial body.
Bard said he atttended Thompson's Sunday service as a show of support for the pastor.
Thompson said members of his church will soon begin discussing whether to defy the ban on same-sex weddings. And Thompson is joining other pastors in an upcoming ad in the New York Times stating their opposition to the Traditional Plan.
Thompson said he's uncertain what will happen to the church he's served for more than three decades.
"We just know it can't stay the way it is now," he said

Texto completo: We're letting the cat out of the bag to bring you this mews — the uber-popular "CatVideoFest" is headed to Louisville.
It's 70 carefully curated minutes of purr-fectly entertaining cat videos. You know the ones — the cat who slips off the kitchen counter or the kitten licked clean by the family dog.
Cute, crazy and comical, we have all watched these videos alone on our cellphones, but what happens when we come out of the shadows and watch them as a group?
This communal offline experience is quite simply, the cat's pajamas, said Dean Otto, curator of the Speed Cinema, at the Speed Art Museum, 2035 S. 3rd St., which will show "CatVideoFest" this month.
"This all got started in 2012 while I was working at the Walker Art Center (in Minneapolis)," Otto remembers. "We wanted an idea that would bring people out on a warm summer evening to a grassy hillside next to the museum and someone suggested putting up a big screen and showing internet cat videos."
To Otto's surprise, about 10,000 people showed up that first year to watch viral cat videos cat on the lawn at the Walker, a well-regarded museum of modern art. They wore cat ears and cat-themed T-shirts. Some even brought their own cats. (No, you can't bring your kitty to the Speed for the event in Louisville.)
The internet cat video festival at the Walker gained even more momentum after its first year and moved venues a few times in order to accommodate growing crowds. Around 13,000 people showed up for sold-out screenings at the Minnesota State Fair Grandstand and the CHS Field baseball stadium in St. Paul.
By its second year, the festival began touring to other cities. The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and Time magazine all wrote articles about this new festival focused on feline hijinks.
As its popularity ballooned, so did the fame of several featured mousers — Grumpy Cat, Lil Bub, Pudge and Henri, aka "Le Chat Noir," who won the festival's first Golden Kitty award.
In fact, Henri's pet-parent, Will Braden, picked up the ball when Walker decided to end the festival and mew-ve on to other projects.
A filmmaker from Seattle, Braden is now the "fat cat" of the video festival and curating a new yearly edition of the film is his full-time job. During the month of March alone, the family-friendly "CatVideoFest" will be shown in close to 150 venues nationwide.
Creating a new film each year is a bit like, well, herding cats. Braden figures he watches around 20,000 videos to compile the fresh hour-and-10-minute reel. Thousands of videos get sent to him directly through a submission tab on the "CatVideoFest" homepage. Others he discovers by scouring the internet.
"If I laugh out loud, I know I have found something others will also want to watch," said Braden. "I have learned how to spell 'funny cat video' in many languages."
"CatVideoFest" isn't only about silly antics, although there are plenty. Braden selects clips that fit into various categories, a lot like an actual film-festival — although this one is a bit furrier.
He selects the best art house segments, sourced animations, short documentaries, music videos and fan favorites or "celebrity cats."
"People ask if I will make a funny dog compilation but I don't think so. No one wants to see a big dog fall off a chair," Braden said. "But we tend to think of cats as being sort of regal and in charge of everything so when they try to jump on something and miss, it's kind of funny. It takes them down a bit and cats land on their feet so they aren't getting hurt, but a puppy might and that wouldn't be funny."
"CatVestVideo" is only shown in theaters and raises money for cats in need through partnerships with local cat charities, animal welfare organizations and shelters to best serve cats in the area. Braden points out the festival also supports animal welfare abroad.
"We've held events in Australia, Austria and Ireland, and are actively searching for more worldwide events so we can support animal welfare everywhere," he said.
The fest stops at the 138-seat Cinema at the Speed Art Museum, 2035 S. 3rd St. on March 14-17. The event at the Speed will benefit the Kentucky Humane Society and Alley Cat Advocates, with 10 percent of the ticket sales to be donated to the local non-profits.
So, what if you aren't a cat person? Some people are dragged along to the event by a spouse, a parent or on a date and may expect they'll grab a cat nap when the cinema lights come down.
But not so fast, Braden says. Those are the people who are most often surprised and delighted by the film.
"In almost every city where I take the festival, people come up to me afterward and tell me they didn't think they would enjoy the film but it ended up being a great experience and they are glad they came," he said.
To that, we say "meow!"

The rise, set and rise of daylight saving time; Why we spring ahead so it stays light later has to do with war - and hobbies

Texto completo: As you grumble about your lost hour of sleep this weekend, just remember: Don't blame Benjamin Franklin. Despite legend, the nerdiest founding father did not invent daylight saving time. (He suggested cities wake residents earlier on summer mornings by the sound of cannon fire, so perhaps it's best he didn't get his way.)
No, the reason you may need an extra cup of coffee Sunday is because of World War I. And golf.
Changing clocks in the summer was first proposed around the turn of the 20th century by two guys who came up with it separately, though for the same reason. New Zealander George Hudson and Englishman William Willett both wanted more time after work in the summer for their sunlight-required pastimes - in Willett's case, hitting the links, and in Hudson's, collecting bugs. And really, why let time itself keep you from your hobbies?
Neither men's proposals gained much traction, however, until the outbreak of the World War I. The Germans were the first to do it, on April 30, 1916, as a way to save on coal-powered lighting in factories. British politicians moved to follow suit two days later and had set their clocks forward by the end of May. Most other European countries weren't far behind.
Time was a little slower to change in the United States, which did not join the war until 1917. Stockbrokers and manufacturers made a flurry of patriotic posters in support of daylight saving. But railroad companies, afraid confusion around the time change could cause a deadly crash, were adamantly against it. So were farmers, who worked by the sun anyway and did not want interactions with the clock-keeping world to get screwy.
"If you're a farmer, you can't just go work an hour early, because you need the sunlight to see what you're doing, especially in those days," says David Prerau, author of "Seize the Daylight: The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time." This was especially hard on dairy farmers, who would have to start milking cows in the dark to meet train schedules for delivery.
"Plus, the sun, beside giving light, it gives heat, and it drives off the dew on a lot of the things that have to be harvested. And you can't harvest things when they're wet," Prerau says.
The stockbrokers won; a bill passed Congress and President Woodrow Wilson signed it. But the first nationwide time change suffered from some seriously unfortunate scheduling. It was March 31, 1918 - Easter Sunday. Newspapers published instructions on how and when to set clocks forward, and churches posted signs out front warning parishioners.
The Chicago Tribune called it "a lie that will benefit you and your country," which is a pretty weird way to put it.
At 2 a.m., a reception at Madison Square Garden marked the occasion, and in the U.S. Capitol, a few senators stayed awake with the Sergeant-at-Arms to reset the Ohio Clock.
The next day, things went surprisingly smoothly. "Some churchgoers were an hour late, but no baseball games were called on account of darkness," reported The New York Times. "Those looking to the sky at nightfall expecting to see a miracle were disappointed."
By the next year, the war had ended, and many thought daylight saving time should end with it, Prerau says. Lawmakers representing farmers introduced nearly two dozen bills to repeal it; one Mississippi congressman urged, "Repeal the law and have the clocks proclaim God's time and tell the truth!" A New Jersey congressman who supported it told people to think of the veterans coming home from the war, "Are they not deserving of the extra hour of recreation?"
A repeal sailed through the House, cleared the Senate and landed on Wilson's desk. He vetoed it, saying it could cause an economic downturn.
A vote to override the president's veto failed, but haters were unbowed. They passed another repeal bill, which the president vetoed again. But this time, they were better prepared, getting the two-thirds majority in the House and Senate needed to override the president. (All of this happened in a month; Congress used to be productive!) Daylight saving time was dead.
So if they got rid of it, then why are you late to brunch now?
Cities like New York and Pittsburgh passed their own daylight saving time laws, and it was brought back nationally for a little while during World War II. As The Post's Michael S. Rosenwald has written, all the time laws among cities and states got so messed up that in Iowa, there were 23 different daylight saving dates, depending on what town you were in. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson finally smoothed it out, making daylight saving time the law of the land.

THEATER; Hitting his peak -- in his 70s; Dakin Matthews' acting career didn't really take off till he went to New York. His latest: 'Mockingbird.'

Texto completo: He directed Annette Bening in her first role and wrote Robin Williams' reference letter for Juilliard, but Dakin Matthews says his own acting career didn't really take off until he was in his 70s.
Now, at age 78, he's in one of the hottest shows on Broadway, with a plum role to boot: Judge Taylor of Maycomb County in Aaron Sorkin's hit adaptation of Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird."
"Hey, just about every show needs a judge or a grandfather," says Matthews, who has scored big with his salty interpretation. Times theater critic Charles McNulty noted the "tart irony" in his performance, while the New York Times' Jesse Green declared him "hilarious."

Says the play's director, Bart- lett Sher: "I find it extraordinary that audiences leave 'Mockingbird' and always find the judge one of their favorite characters."
For Matthews, "Mockingbird" is simply the continuation of a remarkable streak.
"I've done eight Broadway shows in the past decade," he said over a glass of Malbec at the National Arts Club in Manhattan.
He never imagined he would do song and dance in his later years, yet he was called upon to do both in "Rocky the Musical" (2014) and "Waitress" (2016). He played Winston Churchill opposite Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth II in "The Audience" (2015). Somewhere in there, he managed to get back home to Los Angeles, where he performed in "The Nether" (2014) at Center Theatre Group's Kirk Douglas Theatre and "Yes, Prime Minister" (2013) alongside Jefferson Mays at the Geffen Playhouse.
The run of late-career roles comes after Matthews, who was born in Oakland, spent more than three decades teaching English while acting, directing and writing on Northern California stages. He eventually settled in Los Angeles, adding TV work (including playing Santa on "The Big Bang Theory") and film ("Bridge of Spies") to his resume. But he has been a true force in theater, co-founding in 1991 the classical ensemble Antaeus Theatre Company, now based in Glendale.
"It was a marvel that he could gather such quality actors for the original company and originate the idea of double casting," longtime Antaeus member Armin Shimerman says, referring to the dual sets of actors who alternate performances.
Matthews is a fan of the region's theater companies and cites the Road Theatre Company in North Hollywood and Skylight Theatre in Los Feliz in particular, but he says Angelenos are always coping with a weak theatergoing tradition -- not to mention traffic. In 2013, the actor announced he was packing up and heading east to make his Broadway debut at age 73.
Now, as Judge Taylor, Matthews serves as a pivotal bookend of sorts: He talks lawyer Atticus Finch (Jeff Daniels) into taking the case that frames the play, and he delivers a key passage at the end. "Plus, I am the one who gets to say the title," Matthews says proudly.
Matthews said the development process was particularly long and arduous. "Aaron was working on the script every day until we locked it in," something that didn't happen until two weeks before opening night, Matthews says. "There were real issues to grapple with. Someone gets killed in the show, and neither Bart nor Aaron initially knew how much to show and how much to narrate. Aaron was dealing with an iconic book and movie and a message that doesn't really work 50 years later."
Sorkin "did not want this to be about another white hero," Matthews says. "He wanted him to be flawed and the black characters to be fleshed out."
Matthews has only praise for Daniels, whom he described as "a working actor who also happens to be a star." He's not some Hollywood name dipping into theater for some quick cred. He said the same of Denzel Washington, with whom Matthews worked as a dramaturg on Broadway's "Julius Caesar" in 2005, and Ethan Hawke, with whom he traveled the world for a year as part of Sam Mendes' Bridge Project (performing Shakespeare and Chekhov). He also dramaturged Hawke in Lincoln Center's 2013 production of "Macbeth," although Matthews acknowledges that that one flopped. ("I don't think that was Ethan's part," he says. "But there's no shame in failing as Macbeth.")
Shimerman, who teaches Shakespeare at USC, extols Matthews' dramaturgy with the Bard, and sure enough, during a talk on "The Merchant of Venice" at the National Arts Club, Matthews skillfully unpacks the iambic pentameter into conver- sational English.
Matthews' process is to memorize a script quickly, then break down every line to its subtext.
"You don't know what you don't know till you don't know it," he says, recalling that just the day before, he had forgotten some words in "Mockingbird." "The actual line is, 'He had it coming,' but I could not think of it, so I said, 'He deserved it.' So even if I forget a word, I remember the meaning."
Physically too the risks arise. Broadway dressing rooms are dangerous places, he says. "The other night, right before my entrance, I took four steps in a complete tumble and could feel my shoulders getting crushed," he says.
But on he went. And sore shoulder or not, he can hardly believe his good fortune. On Monday, he sang alongside Lin-Manuel Miranda in a Lincoln Center Theater benefit concert of "Camelot." TV and film offers come, but his real love remains the stage. Says Matthews: "It's where you actually earn the money they give you."

Texto completo: A new Starz series follows a group of Los Angeles millennials. And Janelle Monáe, SZA and Yolanda Adams are among the performers at an Aretha Franklin tribute show on CBS.
What's on TV
NOW APOCALYPSE 9 p.m. on Starz. If you have premium cable, you might as well enjoy the freedom it offers filmmakers who want to explore adult matters. Or millennial matters. This proudly hookup-stuffed comedy series, a brainchild of the New Queer Cinema pioneer Gregg Araki and the Vogue sex columnist Karley Sciortino, follows a group of 20-somethings, including Avan Jogia and Kelli Berglund, exploring themselves -- and each other -- in a color-drenched Los Angeles. It shares some themes with Araki's "teenage apocalypse trilogy," about teens dealing with isolation and sexuality. "We started during the twilight years of the Obama administration," Araki recently told The New York Times. "That's why the show has that almost utopian quality of free love -- these kids having sex and figuring themselves out. Then 2016 happened. There's always been that darker, Lynchian aspect of the show, but that became more pronounced."
FINDING JUSTICE 8 p.m. on BET. This documentary series looks at inequality in predominantly black communities in six American cities. Sunday night's debut episode looks at activists in Tampa, Fla., protesting the state's "Stand Your Ground" law. Later episodes center on Baltimore, Minneapolis and St. Paul, Atlanta, Los Angeles and St. Louis.
THE CASE AGAINST ADNAN SYED 9 p.m. on HBO. When the first season of the podcast "Serial" debuted in 2014, it introduced listeners to a number of new things, including the concept of a blockbuster podcast and the case of the murder of Hae Min Lee. Lee was 18 when she was found dead in a park in Baltimore in 1999. In 2000, Adnan Syed, Lee's former boyfriend, was convicted of her murder. The case was the focus of the first season of "Serial." This four-part documentary series, helmed by the Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker Amy Berg, revisits the case through new interviews and archival footage. It also updates the story; in the years since "Serial" covered the case, Syed has been granted a retrial.
ARETHA! A GRAMMY CELEBRATION FOR THE QUEEN OF SOUL 9 p.m. on CBS. Yolanda Adams, John Legend, Janelle Monáe, SZA, Shirley Caesar and Alicia Keys are among the many Aretha Franklin admirers who perform at this tribute show, which was taped in Los Angeles in January. It's never a bad time to revisit Franklin's music, but this month is particularly good: Consider the program an hors d'oeuvre to the wide theatrical release of the Franklin concert film "Amazing Grace" in April.
What's Streaming
MADE IN HEAVEN Stream on Amazon. Splendorous weddings meet secret romantic pursuits and drama (as they so often do) in this new Indian series. The show centers on a pair of fictional Delhi wedding planners, Tara (Sobhita Dhulipala) and Karan (Arjun Mathur), navigating a world of big-money ceremonies.

Texto completo: "Why are parents not vaccinating their kids? What the hell is wrong with people?"
As a father of two young children, I've had outbursts like this on more than one occasion as I sit in my Play-Doh- and Lego-littered family room, reading the latest news about measles and other preventable viruses making a global comeback.
This week, Senator Rand Paul, who has previously fueled the dangerous myth that vaccines cause harm by saying in 2016 that it's "wrong to say there are no risks to vaccines," spoke out against government-mandated vaccines at a Senate Health Committee hearing, saying, "I believe that the benefits of vaccines greatly outweigh the risks, but I still do not favor giving up on liberty for a false sense of security." This was just days after the news that passengers might have been exposed to measles at Chicago's Midway Airport, even though the virus has been considered eradicated in the United States since 2000.
With a measles outbreak affecting over 200 people this year and a recent study proving yet again that there is no reason to believe that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, known as M.M.R., causes autism, it's infuriating to know that parents still resist vaccinating their children. But I know people whom I think of as otherwise intelligent and well intentioned who aren't convinced that vaccines are safe. In the face of their dangerous choices, I've been thinking seriously about what I can do to get through to them.
Medical professionals refer to these parents as "vaccine-hesitant." As much satisfaction as it might offer to bring my family-room rants -- What is wrong with you? -- to my conversations with them, I'm starting to believe I can't simply write them off as idiots. Even presenting facts might not be enough. Those of us who understand how important and safe vaccines are might need to meet them where they are, trying to express empathy for the misguided fear they're obviously experiencing, if we're to break through to them and encourage them to make choices that can save lives.
This outlook is inspired by conversations I've had at home. My wife, Sarah, is a family medicine physician with a public health degree. She has told me that most of the skeptical parents she sees each week aren't raving conspiracy theorists -- bug-eyed stereotypes who write manifestoes in crayon, listen to Alex Jones and live off the grid. They're people who seem to make rational choices in most other areas of their lives. "Parents are worried about the vaccine side effects," she said. "They believe they might cause autism in their children or some debilitating illness."
"Vaccine-hesitant" parents are often influenced by a thoroughly debunked, nearly two-decade-old study that erroneously concluded that the M.M.R. vaccine is linked to autism in children. Since then, a small but highly organized and zealous group referred to as the "anti-vaxx" movement has promoted this misguided propaganda and also intimidated and harassed pro-vaccine doctors. Russia has strategically weaponized this doubt, unleashing bots on social media to spread disinformation and promote discord, creating a false equivalency between "both sides" of the debate and "eroding public consensus on vaccination."
All of this has influenced friends of mine from the Bay Area and Virginia, otherwise highly informed individuals who pride themselves on sniffing out fake news, to remain skeptical about vaccines. Sarah described their mind-set and those of the patients she sees: "The parents don't trust big pharma. They don't trust scientific studies, and they think evidence is always changing. They don't understand how vaccines work. Some will be like 'I don't want to overload my kid's immune system with too many shots at once."'
This global "doubt" explains why measles reached a 20-year high in Europe in the first six months of 2018. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing last week to discuss response efforts to this "growing public health threat" that can easily be prevented. A top Washington State official just declared that the United States needs a national campaign to combat the anti-vaccination movement. Washington has recently been hit with a measles outbreak costing the state over $1 million.
Part of the solution is legislation. California, for example, has a law requiring all public and private school students to be vaccinated. That being said, we're still seeing measles cases pop up in the state. Parents in 17 states can still opt out of vaccines because of philosophical and personal exemptions. And an Arizona House committee has approved three bills to expand vaccine exemptions. It's clear that we can't depend on laws alone to solve this problem.
I've begun to agree with Sarah, who believes education, personal relationships and counter-narratives are the long-term keys to success and rebuilding trust in health professionals and experts. Her mantra: "Don't vilify, bully or mock the parents, but try to empathize and teach, and then empower them." She encourages doctors to actually listen to their patients' unfounded fears before jumping in with the kind of harsh critiques or judgment that can backfire and solidify their false beliefs. Instead, she suggests doctors acknowledge their concerns and build trust over time, while also providing correct information, facts and relatable personal stories.
It's obviously difficult to empathize with parents who are "vaccine-hesitant," as they engage in reckless behavior that is far too dangerous to be left unchecked. The World Health Organization listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 global threats of 2019. And it's important to remember that these parents are not making choices that endanger just themselves or even just their children -- they're putting vulnerable groups at risk. People who can't receive vaccines depend on herd immunity to protect them from diseases.
Still, I try to remember that some vaccine-hesitant parents are victims themselves -- of misinformation spread through social media. When I meet parents who don't believe vaccines are safe, it reminds me of my experiences talking to people who believed conspiracy theories about President Barack Obama being a Muslim born in Kenya. I'm not naïve enough to think I can change the minds of all, but I hold on to the hope that by establishing a relationship and offering facts, we can get many of them to come around. (For those who don't, I hope they enjoyed having a Muslim president.)
My wife recently persuaded a vaccine-hesitant parent to give her baby some of the four-month vaccines -- but not all of them. The mom said she'll strongly consider it next time, and there's an appointment on the calendar. When that day comes, Sarah will try again -- in a visit that starts with listening.

Don’t blame the rain for deaths at Santa Anita, the problem is much more complicated

Texto completo: It wasn’t just the stormy weather that led to the deaths of 21 horses in less than three months at Santa Anita racetrack. More likely, it was a perfect storm, one that’s been brewing for years.
The heavy rains since December contributed, certainly, but an analysis of two decades of horse racing statistics published by the California Horsing Racing Board shows the world renowned track has weathered worse with fewer fatalities.
Just two years ago, 17 inches of rain — 2 more inches than this year — fell from December to March. Eleven horses died at the Arcadia facility in that time period.
Only two of Santa Anita’s five deadliest years from 1997 to 2018 correspond with higher-than-usual rainfall. The worst year, 71 deaths in 2011-12, was during the drought.
In this case, the various factors at play include the types of horses, the track, the training and racing schedules, and the weather’s impact on each of those, said Rick Arthur, equine medical director for the California Horse Racing Board. Necropsies on the horses will also determine if the animals had any pre-existing conditions or medication in their systems.
“It’s like a plane crash,” Arthur said in an earlier interview. “There’s seldom one factor that explains everything, and I wouldn’t expect that to be the case here.”
New protocols announced
On Friday, Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita and several other racetracks, announced a series of new protocols to increase safety when racing resumes later this month.
Consultants are still reviewing the weather’s impact on the main track, but the initial changes extend far beyond the rainy season. Under the new rules, Santa Anita will scrutinize horses’ medical records — even during training — and control the number of horses on the track for high-speed exercises.
On Saturday, Santa Anita announced its main dirt track would reopen at 5 a.m. Monday for limited workouts — “joggers and gallopers” only.
“Over the past four days, we’ve been able to do a great deal in terms of amending the soil and inspecting it,” said Dennis Moore, who served as track superintendent at Santa Anita until Dec. 31 and recently returned to analyze the racing surfaces.
“Things can happen even under perfect circumstances,” Moore said, “but from everything we’ve been able to learn, this track is in outstanding condition and it’s ready for training.”
Santa Anita’s fixes mirror successful changes made by the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, which cut back on horses on the track in the mornings and tightened up its inspections in the aftermath of a disastrous 2016 summer season, with 17 deaths in 23 days.
Experts: Overuse of track a factor
The increased traffic at Santa Anita is likely one of the main factors in the deaths, according to experts.
Bad weather can upset the consistency of a track, but it also forces horses into the barns, sometimes for days, according to Richard Tedesco, a veteran track consultant with experience as a superintendent at most of Southern California’s racetracks.
Disruptions make trainers and owners anxious to get their horses back out as soon as possible. Once the gates reopen, there’s a flood of horses all at once on a track already weakened by rains.
“You’ve got all of these guys foaming at the mouth to get their horse ready again,” Tedesco said. “The dirt gets pretty well chewed up.”
Too many horses running at the same time is an accident waiting to happen, he said.
Santa Anita shut its track down for two days at the end of February in response to outcry over the first 19 deaths. Track expert Mick Peterson, of the University of Kentucky’s Agricultural Equine Programs, examined and cleared the course as “100 percent ready” before the track reopened Feb. 28.
The horse racing statistics website Equibase tracked 862 workouts in the six days following the reopening. On March 1, 326 horses hit the track before the afternoon races began. Then another 70 ran in those events. The 20th horse died in a race the next day. On March 5, 273 horses worked on the track where the 21st horse died.
“That’s quite a bit,” Tedesco said of the workouts. He estimates an average day is about 150 horses.
In Europe, horses exercise at training centers and race mostly on the weekends, Tedesco said. But in Southern California, the loss of venues has condensed much of the thoroughbred racing to Santa Anita. Trainers say they don’t change locations as often as they did in the past.
Santa Anita scaled up and extended its season when Hollywood Park closed in 2013.
“The bulk of the dates went to Santa Anita,” said Jack Liebau, the director of Los Alamitos Thoroughbred Racing in Orange County. “You have a lot more stress on the track and it’s difficult.”
‘Real art form’ to maintain a track
Heavy rains, a well-worn track, and even the loss of Moore as track superintendent may have all played a part, Liebau said.
Moore, who most recently has been serving as a consultant at Del Mar and Los Alamitos, helped Del Mar with its crisis in 2016. He returned to Santa Anita as a consultant earlier this month to help with the track inspections.
“It’s a real art form to maintain a track in a safe manner,” Liebau said. “Everybody seems to be very happy that Dennis is back.”
Fewer deaths at Los Alamitos
At Los Alamitos Race Course, which runs quarter horses and thoroughbreds, 10,354 horses raced last year, compared to 8,922 at Santa Anita, according to statistics compiled from reports by the CHRB.
Los Alamitos also uses a dirt main track, like Santa Anita, and in the past three months experienced heavier rain. At both venues, the track is tightly compacted to keep out moisture. This creates another potential risk as the harder-than-expected surface can throw off a horse’s fragile footing.
Since Dec. 26, only three horses have died on the track at Los Alamitos, compared to the 21 at Santa Anita. That’s despite the fact that the state’s data shows Los Alamitos had 23 percent more deaths per year on average in the past decade.
Though the tracks share similarities, the big difference between the two venues is the daily traffic. Nine of Santa Anita’s 21 deaths occurred during training on the dirt track, seven were during races. The other five happened on the venue’s storied turf track.
Los Alamitos has added more thoroughbred racing in recent years, but the majority of horses at the venue are quarter horses. These sprinters of the racing world have less intensive training regimens than thoroughbreds, Santa Anita’s bread and butter.
Los Alamitos had less than 200 workouts in the same six day period as Santa Anita’s 862, according to Equibase.
‘Everybody worried’
Last week, the New York Times reported that trainers at Santa Anita appear to be more demanding than counterparts elsewhere in the state. Santa Anita averages 3.02 workouts per start, compared with 0.88 workouts per start for horses running at Gulfstream Park in Florida and 0.42 at Aqueduct in New York.
“Ninety-nine percent of the trainers take very good care of their horses, there’s less than 1 percent that you have to watch,” said Tedesco, the track consultant. “Owners spend a lot of money, the trainers want to win races. It all comes down to, ‘Let’s keep them going.’ “
Everyone at the track is working to ensure safety of horses during training and the races, he said. Tedesco said he’s fielded concerned calls from racetrack officials across the country..
“What is going on is really bad for the industry,” he said. “It’s gotten everybody worried, everywhere.”

Texto completo: On Friday, all 28 players on the United States women's soccer team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, an escalation in their increasingly public battle for equality.
The players have said that they play more games than the men's team -- and win more of them -- yet still receive less pay. They said "institutionalized gender discrimination" affected not only their paychecks, but also where they played and how often, how they trained, the medical care and coaching they received, and even how they traveled to matches.
They are not alone in their fight for fairer pay and better treatment. Here are eight times in recent memory when women fought for equality in sports.
Finishing the Boston Marathon despite an attempt to eject her
Experts claimed for years that distance running was damaging to women's health and femininity.
In 1967, women weren't allowed to officially enter the Boston Marathon, so Kathrine Switzer entered that year as "K.V. Switzer" to hide her gender.
Two miles in, an official tried to eject her from the course, a moment captured in dramatic photographs. She finished anyway, becoming the first woman to complete the race as an official entrant.
"We learned that women are not deficient in endurance and stamina, and that running requires no fancy facilities or equipment," Switzer wrote in The New York Times in 2007.
Women were officially allowed to enter the race in 1972. Women's marathoning joined the Olympics in 1984.

The year 1973 was a big one for Billie Jean King, the trailblazing tennis star.
She founded the Women's Tennis Association. She led a movement for female players to earn equal prize money in tournaments that featured players of both sexes.
And, on a September night at the Astrodome in Houston, she epitomized her crusade for gender equality when she handily beat Bobby Riggs, a self-described male chauvinist pig, in the Battle of the Sexes.
King went on to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 for her work championing the rights of women and gay people. She is considered to be one of the most important athletes of the 20th century.
"Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs," King once said. "I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too."
Yale rowers strip to protest lack of women's showers
Chris Ernst is a two-time Olympic rower. But in the spring of 1976, she was the captain of Yale University's women's crew team -- and sick of not having proper showers to use after practice.
She led 18 teammates in an eye-catching protest at Yale's athletic office. The athletes stripped to their waists, revealing the words "Title IX," which had been drawn in blue marker on each woman's back and breasts.
The Times ran an article in the next day's paper, and a photograph of the history-making event also ran in The Yale Daily News.
Within two weeks, the female rowers had new locker rooms. And, across the country, educators began viewing Title IX -- which had been in effect for just four years -- as a law that required compliance.
Venus Williams wins a victory for women off the court
In 2007, after pressure from the tennis great Venus Williams and others, Wimbledon announced that women's tennis players would receive prize money equal to the men's.
Williams had made a failed plea to Wimbledon's governing body the night before she won the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed essay in The Times of London titled "Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I'm Only a Second Class Champion."
"Have you ever been let down by someone that you had long admired, respected and looked up to?" she wrote. "Little in life is more disappointing, particularly when that person does something that goes against the very heart of what you believe is right and fair."
After the policies changed in 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her fourth Wimbledon victory, the same amount as the men's champion, Roger Federer.
A first for women's hockey
In March 2017, the women's national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey, the sport's national governing body, did not increase the women's wages.
"It's hard to believe that in 2017, we have to fight so hard just to get equitable support," Meghan Duggan, the team's captain, said at the time. "We want to do the fair thing, and the right thing -- not just for hockey but for all women."
They put their careers on the line, but the risk paid off.
Less than two weeks later, the team reached a four-year deal with U.S.A. Hockey. It provided the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. The team also received the same travel and insurance provisions that the men's national team did, and a pool of prize money to be split each year.
Female surfers receive equal prize money
Three prominent female big-wave surfers, Bianca Valenti, Andrea Moller and Paige Alms, spent years fighting for equal pay in the largely male sport where they regularly risk their lives.
Last July, the Committee for Equity in Women's Surfing, an organization formed by the three women and others, sent a letter to the California Coastal Commission arguing that by treating them unequally, the World Surf League was in violation of state civil rights law.
Months later, in September, Valenti and other female surfers earned a victory when the World Surf League announced it would offer equal prize money to men and women.
Valenti and others also successfully pushed for women to be included in the Maverick's Challenge, a big-wave surfing competition that had traditionally invited only men.
"Some people would tell me that by trying to get the (prize) pie redistributed I was ruining it for everyone," Moller said in December. "But I would just say: 'That's wrong. We're fighting for the industry. People love watching women surf big waves, so the whole sport will grow."'
W.N.B.A. players speak up
In the world of professional basketball, pay disparities are well-documented: In the N.B.A., a multibillion-dollar industry where players often make millions, the minimum starting salary is about eight times what the average W.N.B.A. player makes.
And female players are speaking up, on social media and on TV.
Skylar Diggins-Smith, the W.N.B.A. All-Star who plays guard for the Dallas Wings, recently appeared in a commercial to raise awareness about pay inequity.
The commercial, by the investment adviser Wealthsimple, contrasts the paths of two young players, a boy and a girl. Each lists their basketball dreams and accomplishments, but only one will grow up to receive a multimillion-dollar rookie contract.
A'ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the first overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, has also weighed in: "must. be. nice," she wrote about LeBron James's $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. "We over here looking for a M but Lord, let me get back in my lane."
Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, was expected to earn about $6.8 million in his first year playing for the Phoenix Suns.
The best female soccer player boycotts the World Cup
Ada Hegerberg, a 23-year-old Norwegian, was recognized as the best female soccer player in the world last year when she became the first person to win the women's Ballon d'Or, a prestigious individual honor in soccer that had previously been reserved for men.
Despite the big award, she has decided not to play on the biggest stage of all, the Women's World Cup, in France this summer.
Hegerberg quit the Norwegian national team in 2017 in protest of what she said was a lack of support for women's soccer in her home country.
"I was quite clear with them about what I thought needed to be better," she said in an interview after winning the Ballon d'Or. "I gave them the reasons. I wish my national team all the best. I love my country. I wish I could play for them. In this case, I had to move on."

Texto completo: Saudi Arabia is letting men track women, and two of the United States' top tech companies are helping -- still.
Last month, Google and Apple pledged to investigate an app in their stores called Absher. The name roughly translates as "yes sir," which is fitting: Absher is an e-government service, and the Saudi government is an engine of sexist repression -- so in addition to the app's innocuous uses, the app is a tool for enforcing the regime's guardianship system. That includes allowing men to input where and when women under their watch are allowed to travel, so that the government may serve them alerts when those wards leave or enter the country. It also includes giving them access to women's flight logs.
Apparently, Google is done investigating. Satisfied that Absher does not violate its terms of service, the company has decided to allow the app to remain in its store. Apple still has not made its decision but, in the meantime, Absher is still around, and Saudi women are still under constant surveillance.
Saudi Arabia's treatment of women is a much bigger problem than Absher: On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that an American woman now divorced from a Saudi man is trapped in the country because her ex-husband let her residency expire and she cannot get authorization to leave. But one way of chipping away at a system of oppression is to make that system more difficult to enforce. Instead, Google and Apple, if the latter does not come to a different conclusion in its review, are allowing abuse to occur at the tap of a smartphone screen.
Google's excuse for abdicating its commitment to human rights is far from convincing. Terms of service are not an unalterable set of commandments engraved in stone. On the contrary, Google can revise the rules an app must follow to remain in its store whenever it wants -- and it does. Every one of those rules and every one of those revisions, from not allowing pornography to prohibiting harassment, is a choice.
How those rules are applied is a choice, too. If Absher violated any of Google's existing terms, it could be in the "hate speech" category: Google bars apps that "promote violence, or incite hatred against individuals or groups" based on characteristics "associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization." Absher may not explicitly promote violence or incite hatred. But what does Absher do if not further the same systemic discrimination Google highlights?
No one asked Google whether Absher violated the letter of its current rules. Instead they asked whether Google, Apple or any other company would facilitate the sexist strictures of a regime that not only oppresses women but also tortures and kills journalists, activists and other critics. The answer should be no.

Texto completo: After a difficult and emotional few weeks, Mandy Moore is ready to power forward.
The "This is Us" actress, 34, opened up about how she's feeling in the aftermath of participating in an expose by the New York Times, which delved into her ex-husband Ryan Adams's alleged history of championing aspiring female artists and then manipulating and harassing them.
Moore revealed a new, much shorter haircut Thursday and later shared the inspiring reason for the change-up.
She called the last few weeks "emotionally turbulent" while talking to Access Hollywood. "And I think there is something significant about shedding dead weight, and I’m moving forward. ”
Moore added that the support she's received since the article published has been "really overwhelming. "
“I think it’s important to, if possible, speak your truth," she said. "But I had no idea the overwhelming amount of support that not only I would receive, but so many other women who also came forward for this particular situation and story. ”
More: Ryan Adams' U. K. tour is canceled following sexual misconduct allegations
More: FBI reportedly looking into allegations Ryan Adams sexted with underage fan
She continued: “I’m happy that people, and women specially, who perhaps have been in abusive situations of any form feel seen and heard and recognized. Because that was what I was most surprised about by speaking out – feeling like other women were like, ‘Thank you, I’m encouraged to come forward now and share my story as well or just to know that I’m not alone in the situation. ’ ”

It's inhumane to execute someone too impaired to recall crime

Texto completo: In a series of rulings over the past several decades interpreting the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, the Supreme Court has prohibited the execution of some of the most helpless people in the nation, including children and people with intellectual disabilities.
On Wednesday, the court spared from execution Vernon Madison, who cannot remember the circumstances surrounding his 1985 conviction in Alabama for the murder of a police officer. Mr. Madison suffered at least two severe strokes after his conviction, and his lawyers had told the justices that he had vascular dementia and attendant cognitive decline.
As Justice Elena Kagan explained in a 5-to-3 decision siding with Mr. Madison, a faulty memory alone does not trigger the protections of the Eighth Amendment, just as the diagnosis of a mental illness alone would not. Instead, Justice Kagan wrote, what's relevant is whether the person possesses a "rational understanding" of why the state wants to impose the ultimate punishment. (Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who hadn't yet been confirmed when the court first heard the dispute, did not participate in Mr. Madison's case.)
In prior cases laying the foundation for this principle, the Supreme Court justices have reasoned that executing someone who can't rationally understand his crime or punishment "simply offends humanity" and would serve no "retributive value." Which is to say: If a man condemned to die can't comprehend the true meaning of society's judgment against him, what is the value of that condemnation?
"Do you have an independent recollection of the Civil War?" asked Justice Kagan in her opinion in Madison v. Alabama. "Obviously not. But you may still be able to reach a rational — indeed, a sophisticated — understanding of that conflict and its consequences."
The justice went on: "Do you recall your first day of school? Probably not. But if your mother told you years later that you were sent home for hitting a classmate, you would have no trouble grasping the story."
The same goes for a person who blacks out before committing a crime: She may still come to appreciate why a prosecutor seeks to punish her.
In Mr. Madison's case, the Supreme Court recognized that the Alabama court that weighed his mental capacities offered a cursory ruling, with "only one sentence of explanation" that didn't take into account the "sole question" that matters: "whether he can reach a 'rational understanding' of why the State wants to execute him."
The high court sent the case back to the lower courts for what Justice Kagan called a "do-over."
The lower courts may again conclude, based on the Supreme Court's guidance and expert medical testimony, that executing Mr. Madison doesn't qualify as cruel and unusual. But until then, the Supreme Court's decision — joined by the rest of the liberal bloc and Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. — provides hope that officials may yet realize that it's inhumane to put to death someone too impaired to remember the crime he committed or comprehend the punishment he is facing.

Texto completo: "It takes guts to print what they planned to release on him."
Lance Ulanoff, tech blogger and regular Medium poster
When Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos decided to publicly accuse lawyers from the parent company of the National Enquirer of blackmail and extortion, his outlet of choice wasn't The Washington Post, which he owns, but instead the Medium blog website.
The world's richest man could have easily posted his claims as a Post op-ed or done a high-profile TV interview.
Instead, he turned to Medium, which has become the go-to website for people who want to get something off their chest. High-profile names like Tesla founder Elon Musk, former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and actor Wil Wheaton have also posted there.
"It's a logical place to publish," CNN media critic Brian Stelter wrote in his media newsletter. "A neutral space where the emphasis is on the words, nothing else – and kept the message away from any Amazon or Post-owned website."
Posting to Medium is easy, which is why so many CEOs, tech journalists, venture capitalists and authors like it. You register, create a handle, open a blank document and add photos and videos to your words and hit publish. This lets you blog, without the bother of having to create your own personal blog that's constantly in need of updating.
The National Enquirer previously shared details of Bezos and his relationship with Lauren Sanchez, a former Los Angeles TV anchor, including romantic text messages the two had sent each other. Bezos and wife MacKenzie announced last month that they would be divorcing after 25 years of marriage, just ahead of The Enquirer posting the intimate exchanges with Sanchez.
The leak of the texts, which Bezos confirmed in his post, prompted the Amazon founder to have Gavin de Becker from his security team investigate how the Enquirer got the messages.
Bezos said AMI CEO David Pecker was "apoplectic" over a separate investigation The Washington Post was doing into Pecker and AMI's interest in expanding to Saudi Arabia, including AMI's publication of a pro-Saudi Arabia tabloid last year before the arrival of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Bezos also noted how Pecker "recently entered into an immunity deal with the Department of Justice related to their role in the so-called 'Catch and Kill' process on behalf of President Trump and his election campaign," linking to a New York Times report that said Trump invited Pecker to a White House dinner in which the AMI CEO brought a guest that the Times describes as having "important ties to the royals in Saudi Arabia."
Bezos and his investigators accuse the Enquirer of a politically charged reporting job on behalf of President Donald Trump, who Bezos says believes him to be an "enemy," due to his ownership of The Washington Post.
In his Medium post, Bezos referred to potentially embarrassing photos of him the Enquirer said it had of him in various states of undress.
In the emails published by Bezos, Enquirer representatives say it won't publish the lurid photos if Bezos agrees to say publicly that the Enquirer coverage wasn't "politically motivated."
The post had 130,000 "claps" – Medium's version of the Like button – by Friday morning.
Casey Newton, an editor for tech news site TheVerge, also blogs on Medium and says it has replaced the concept of a blog that needs to be constantly updated, "with a place where you could just say something whenever you had a point to make. It lowered the barrier of entry and, thanks to a beautiful text editor, felt very approachable to lots of folks from the start."
Alex Kruglov, who runs the Los Angeles tech startup pop.in, uses Medium to speak directly to his audience, because its "really simple" and "they give you all the tools to make the page look good and publish properly on both desktop and mobile."
Medium was founded in 2012 by Evan Williams, a co-founder of Twitter and the old Blogger platform, for people who had more to say than the old 140 character limit of Twitter. In the latest version of the blogging site, users can read up to five articles monthly for free, or read more by paying $5 monthly.
The most popular post of 2018 was by James Bridle, who described himself in the post as "a writer and artist concerned with technology and culture." In writing his piece about his concern of seeing sexually themed videos targeting children on YouTube, he said, "I usually write on my own blog, but frankly I don't want what I'm talking about here anywhere near my own site"
The post got nearly 200,000 views. Many media organizations, including USA TODAY, jumped on points raised in the piece. YouTube was forced a few months later to announce changes to its policies, saying children's content on the YouTube Kids app would be curated and not left for automatic postings.
Jackson Cunningham, who makes cat furniture in Vancouver, Canada, wrote about getting banned for life from Airbnb for writing a bad review of his host on Google, while short story writer David Hopkins went for a less controversial take on bow the 1990s TV show "Friends," "triggered the downfall of Western Civilization."
Lance Ulanoff, a tech blogger who posts regularly on Medium, says he was "blown away," by Bezos' decision to make his announcement on Medium.
"It takes guts to print what they planned to release on him," he says. "I mean, there will be ramifications for a CEO of one of the world's biggest and most important companies acting so irresponsibly, but I do love how he pulled the rug out from under the (alleged) extortionists, assuming this is all true."
"It takes guts to print what they planned to release on him."

Texto completo: At 29, with her Puerto Rican heritage, megawatt smile and 3 million-plus Twitter followers, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez embodies the rising power of younger female nonwhite digital natives in American politics. If Hillary Rodham Clinton, or HRC, reflects the past, AOC foreshadows the future.
But as a role model for Democrats who desperately want to defeat Donald Trump, AOC is not A-OK. She represents New York City, one of the most liberal cities in the country, and as a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, her radical views on issues like "Medicare-for-all" and a "Green New Deal" fall far outside her party’s mainstream — let alone the national consensus. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 18 percent viewed the term "socialist" favorably.
"There is, without a doubt, a myth that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez somehow represents the narrative of Democratic primary voters in the country," Democratic pollster John Anzalone told The Washington Post. "Almost half of them identify themselves as moderates or conservatives."
Moreover, she reflects an intolerant impulse among Democratic leftists to purge the party of moderate heretics. After 26 of her fellow House members voted with Republicans to make it harder for undocumented immigrants to purchase guns, AOC threatened to put them "on a list" for primary challenges.
"Since when is it OK to put you on a Nixonian list?" Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, co-chair of the centrist Problem Solvers Caucus, protested in the Post. "We need to have a big tent in our party, or we won’t keep the House or win the White House."
The myth Anzalone identifies has bedeviled the Democratic Party since the death of Franklin Roosevelt 74 years ago. Liberals do form a critical component of the party’s "big tent" coalition, and no Democratic nominee can win the White House without their support. That’s why the far-too-late and far-too-grudging endorsement of Clinton by Bernie Sanders (or BS) was so damaging.
That said, Democrats cannot capture the presidency or either branch of Congress by lurching leftward. A candidate in the AOC/BS mold would be a hero in New York, California and Massachusetts — and a disaster in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which handed Trump the presidency in 2016 and will be critical again next year.
Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania, stressed this point to The New York Times: "The more we have presidential candidates or newly elected congresspeople talking about the Green New Deal, talking about ‘Medicare-for-all,’ talking about socialism, the more that plays into the Trump campaign’s hands."
Christopher Borick, a political scientist at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, added: "If you want to lock up Pennsylvania for a Democrat, the more moderate Democrats are the key."
The numbers support them. A Gallup poll in January reported that 35 percent of Americans call themselves conservatives, the same number that identify as moderates. Only 26 percent are self-described liberals, the same portion who chose that label in 2016 exit polls.
It’s true that within the Democrats’ ranks, the percentage of liberals is rising, hitting 51 percent this year according to Gallup. But pragmatists still dominate the party. Fifty-four percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want the party to "move closer to the center" while 41 percent "would rather it shift further left."
The same tension between purists and pragmatists is playing out in the House, where the AOC types are calling for the rapid impeachment of the president. But Democratic leaders are taking a much slower approach, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, insisting that impeachment must meet a "very high bar."
No president has ever been removed through impeachment (although Richard Nixon probably would have been the first, had he not resigned). The bar is and should be "very high."
But denying a president a second term through the ballot box is quite common, and in fact happened three times in five elections between 1976 and 1992. That bar is much lower and well within the reach of Democrats if they can avoid the mythmaking of leftists like AOC and BS and focus on political reality.

Corporations' gender pay reporting may start in weeks

Texto completo: Companies with more than 100 employees will have to report to the U.S. government data about how much workers' are paid broken down by sex, race and ethnicity, possibly as soon as this spring, according to a new court ruling.
The pay disclosures were finalized by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the summer of 2016, but the Office of Management and Budget froze the expanded requirements after President Trump took office. The National Women's Law Center and other groups sued, and on March 4, Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled in their favor, saying that the government didn't properly justify its decision.
The OMB could appeal, and it's not clear whether companies will have to comply by the original deadline of May 31. Still, the decision comes amid a rising global push to get companies to show that their pay practices are fair.
Under shareholder pressure, most of the big U.S. banks last year released modified information on the gender pay gaps in their workforce. The U.K.'s new gender pay gap reporting requirements are entering their second year.
"This is part of a real cultural shift we're seeing around transparency in pay, said Emily Martin, vice president for education and workplace justice for the National Women's Law Center, one of the groups that sued to get the wage information included. "In order to have equal and fair pay, employees need more information about their employers' pay policies. So this is one step, but it's not the last step.
Employers already submit demographic data to the EEOC annually. The new disclosures would call for more granular analysis, requiring them to report the racial and gender makeup of employees in each job category (executive level, professionals, sales workers, etc.) within 12 pay ranges, for each of a company's physical locations. The current form fits on one page. The expanded form could need 10.It's kind of in the weeds, really technical detailed stuff, said Michael Eastman, senior vice president with the Center for Workplace Compliance. "That's where the burden comes in.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which strongly opposed the expanded reporting, says it would cost businesses more than $400 million annually. The EEOC says it's more like $53 million. In a 2017 letter to OMB director Mick Mulvaney, the Chamber urged the agency to reconsider the approved collection, saying the EEOC "materially underestimated the burden that the revised form would impose.
Under rules adopted in 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires public companies to compare their workers' median pay with their CEO's total compensation, including salary, bonus and equity awards. After companies registered similar concerns about the burden of reporting based on their entire payroll, the SEC allowed them to use statistical sampling. The first results were posted last year.
"This is not some radical new calculation that they are being asked to do, said Martin, pointing out that companies provide a wide range of pay information to a range of entities and can draw the rest of the data from employee tax forms. "They are being asked to submit the data they already collect.
The demographic data provided to the EEOC is confidential, and the pay data would be too. Even so, research suggests the act of measuring and reporting can have an effect. A study from several business schools, including INSEAD, Columbia University and the University of Copenhagen, found that in Denmark, which requires companies with over 35 employees to report pay data by gender, the gender pay gap shrunk by 7 percent.
And once the data exists, it becomes a target for activists and investors. New York City pension funds helped pressure Goldman Sachs and MetLife to disclose diversity data in 2012, according to the New York Times.
Natasha Lamb, a managing partner at Arjuna Capital, is for similar transparency around pay: Late last year, she filed shareholder proposals with 11 banks and tech companies asking them to publicly report their median gender pay gaps. So far, only Citigroup has done so.Even if there's a regulatory mandate from the EEOC, that might help narrow those gaps, but it won't make the data transparent to investors, Lamb said. "We want to be able to measure apples to apples on how companies are doing on narrowing those gaps.

Texto completo: Illustration Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary, speaks in May 2017 at the Higher Ed Leaders Forum, hosted by The New York Times.

The Congressional Budget Office recently released its revised Budget and Economic Outlook. Its economists estimate that, on present policy, annual deficits of a trillion dollars — between 4 percent and 5 percent of gross domestic product — will persist over the next decade. They expect this to push government debt from 78 percent of GDP to 93 percent by 2029.
Remember that the U.S. is at or close to full employment. Note as well that the CBO's numbers assume that automatic corrective measures built into current legislation will be allowed to take effect. On the alternative and up-to-now reliable assumption that they'll be blocked, the debt would rise to 105 percent after 10 years. Beyond the end of the decade, even on the more favorable projection, debt would keep on going up — passing 150 percent of GDP by 2049.
Is this a problem? You bet it is.
In a new essay, Jason Furman and Lawrence Summers — economists of renown, top advisers to Democratic presidents and in the case of Summers, a former Treasury Secretary — seem to say otherwise. They urge Washington to get over its "obsession" with government debt. "Politicians and policymakers should focus on urgent social problems, not deficits," they advise.
At the moment, the warning hardly seems necessary: Excessive fiscal discipline isn't much in evidence. The numbers, and the steady policy preferences of Democrats and Republicans alike, demonstrate no great inhibition about government borrowing. If anything, they suggest the opposite — complete disregard for the need under any circumstances to finance government spending responsibly. Most Republicans favor tax cuts regardless of the implications for borrowing. And many Democrats favor all manner of additional public spending, again regardless of the deficit. If the CBO's projections reflect obsessive fiscal control, one dreads to think what fiscal negligence would look like.
The approach Furman and Summers recommend as an alternative to all this austerity would tolerate substantial deficits as long as debt didn't rise over time, except during recessions. If the CBO is right, however, and government debt is on a firm upward trend, the authors' recommended policy requires higher taxes or lower public spending — making this a strange moment to advise policymakers to stop worrying so much about deficits.


Furman and Summers are right to emphasize that the composition of the government's budget counts for much more than the traditional debate about debt and deficits would suggest. It matters to spend on the right things, and raise the needed revenue in ways that are fair and efficient. But the suggestion that concerns about public debt have gotten out of hand and need to be dialed back is both wrong and, given the fiscal outlook, perplexing. Intelligent fiscal discipline isn't passc: It needs to make a comeback.

Texto completo: FARGO - A book published three years ago that was written by North Dakota native and former Secret Service officer Clint Hill is getting fresh attention thanks to TV host Mike Rowe.
It began when Rowe described in a Facebook post a chance encounter with Hill and encouraged people to buy Hill's book, "Five Presidents," which came out in 2016.
The post went viral with more than 175,000 shares and sparked something of a book-buying frenzy that pushed Hill's book on to Amazon's bestseller list, which as of Tuesday, ranked Hill's book at #4.
Now an author with several books under his belt, Hill is perhaps best known as the Secret Service agent who jumped on the back of the presidential limousine in Dallas, Texas, on Nov. 22, 1963, in an effort to save President John F. Kennedy from assassination.
His firsthand account of the assassination figures prominently in his memoir, "Mrs. Kennedy and Me," which was a #1 New York Times bestseller.
Last year, Hill was named the 44th recipient of the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award, which has been described as the state's highest commendation for its citizens.
Hill was born in Larimore but grew up in Washburn.
He is a graduate of Concordia College in Moorhead and applied for the Secret Service after his honorable discharge from the U.S. Army.
He served five presidential administrations, beginning with President Dwight Eisenhower and ending with President Gerald Ford.
Rowe shared in a Feb. 19 Facebook post information from CNN's website, which stated that Hill's book "Five Presidents" was enjoying a sudden rush of sales thanks to an earlier posting on Rowe's Facebook page that mentioned Hill.
"Let's be clear, friends. This happened because the world wants to hear real stories about real people who live their lives as best they can, even as they risk everything for others," Rowe wrote in his Feb. 19 Facebook post.

Texto completo: Goodness knows I'm loath to write anything these days that would feed Donald Trump's ego. But this time it's unavoidable. There is a new global political era emerging that, while not entirely attributable to Trump, his party and his administration, they've surely played a huge role in fostering. A variety of analysts have now given this era the same name: "Anything goes." And for good reason.
Look around the world and not only do you see a democratic recession -- the number of democracies abandoning their democratic bona fides with sham elections is steadily mounting -- but you see something much more grotesque: Leaders are grabbing power for life, murdering or jailing even the mildest of critics and shamelessly building coalitions with openly racist and bigoted parties.
Most important, they're doing it with utter impunity -- confident that either no one is watching or no one will meaningfully call them out.
This is what happens when people think America isn't looking, doesn't care or worse, has a president, himself having uttered over 9,000 lies and misleading statements, who has zero moral authority to call out others. When it comes to being a global watchdog that tries to enforce some basic norms of decency, America under Trump is out to lunch -- and a lot of people have figured that out, and so anything goes.
"It's not just that liberal democracy is retreating under pressure from demagogic politicians exploiting the stresses of globalization, rising inequality, economic insecurity, job displacement, immigration, and so on," argues Larry Diamond, author of a prescient new book, "Ill Winds: Saving Democracy From Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition, and American Complacency." "It's that authoritarian forces everywhere perceive that there is no longer any price to pay for ruling as nastily as they want."
So, today, "every type of regime is getting worse," Diamond adds. "Liberal democracies are becoming more intolerant. Illiberal democracies are electing authoritarian personalities like President Duterte in the Philippines, who are purging judges and locking up journalists who dare to criticize them. Authoritarian regimes that once coexisted with pockets of opposition no longer see the need to bother. In Cambodia, the party of the long-ruling dictator, Hun Sen, now controls every seat in Parliament. And China is now constructing the first truly Orwellian surveillance state."
It all makes some of the lyrics of Cole Porter's classic song seem so ahead of their time:
The world has gone mad today/ And good's bad today/ And black's white today/ And day's night today/ And that gent today/ You gave a cent today/ Once had several chateaux .../ Anything goes.
Just think of those shocks you've got/ And those knocks you've got/ And those blues you've got/ From that news you've got/ And those pains you've got/ (If any brains you've got) .../ 'Cause Franklin knows/ Anything goes.
When America, the world's most influential democracy, has a leader without shame, who is backed by a party without spine willing to prostitute itself to Trump no matter how low he goes -- and both are protected by a virtually state-run network without integrity, called Fox -- it becomes a hunting license for leaders everywhere to go after their own domestic opponents and cross any human rights redline to stay in power.
And we're talking about some close allies. Last week, Israel's attorney general recommended that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu be indicted on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust in connection with three different corruption cases. This comes just after Netanyahu forged a political alliance with an openly racist, anti-Arab party.
Netanyahu's new political ally, the Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party, traces its lineage to Rabbi Meir Kahane's outlawed Kach Party, which advocated annexing the West Bank, expelling the Palestinians who lived there and resettling Israeli Arabs in Arab countries. Otzma's leader, Michael Ben-Ari, with whom Bibi made his alliance, was denied a visa to the U.S. in 2012 on the grounds of being associated with a violent extremist group.
Among Otzma's leaders, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported, "is former Kahane aide Baruch Marzel, a resident of Hebron who holds a party every year at the grave of Baruch Goldstein, who in 1994 massacred 29 Palestinians at the Cave of the Patriarchs."
These are the people Netanyahu wants to bring into his government. Why not? Bibi knows that no matter how low he sinks, Trump will always have his back.
Yes, politics can be a dirty business, "but there are sacred areas in which you don't play politics, where there has to be a boundary," says Hebrew University philosopher Moshe Halbertal. And making an alliance "with a racist party is one of them. Because when you do that you actually inflate them and send a message about what kind of speech is permissible."
You may think that "they are just a means to your ends," adds Halbertal. "But in the end, they will control you, they will dominate your identity," and, in Bibi's case, "they will define who he is, who is Israel, who is Israel in the eyes of world Jewry and who is Israel in the eyes of the world."
Our enemies and rivals are also worse than ever. Iran has been deeply complicit in the ethnic cleansing of Sunnis in Iraq and Syria, in the use of poison gas by Syria's regime and in the crushing of Lebanese democracy through its proxy the Hezbollah militia.
But Iran gets away with it. The Iranians know that U.S. human rights activists are so focused on Saudi Arabia's vile murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and its bombings in Yemen that they're ignoring Iran's misbehavior. So anything goes.
China's government has felt free enough to admit that it's been forcing religious minorities, particularly Chinese Muslims, into "re-education camps" to eliminate "extremism." But news seeping out of these camps indicates they have "a lot more in common with concentration camps. Thousands of guards carrying spiked clubs, tear gas and stun guns surveil the government's 'students,' who are held in buildings ringed with razor wire and infrared cameras," said Vox, citing a recent report by Agence France-Presse.
Allies of Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, are well on their way to amending the Egyptian Constitution to make him, in effect, president for life, or at least until 2034, and give even more power to the military. El-Sisi, who made this power grab after a visit from and praise by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has also arrested far more Egyptians for the mildest of criticism, and snuffed out far more press freedoms, than his predecessor Hosni Mubarak -- without a peep out of America.
In Uganda, 74-year-old President Yoweri Museveni got age limits abolished so he can, in effect, also become president for life, after sending troops onto the floor of Parliament to beat up opposition lawmakers objecting to the move.
Larry Diamond says, "A leading Ugandan human rights lawyer wrote to me that with Trump in the White House and Europe silent and democratic norms generally in retreat, African rulers like Museveni now feel emboldened to rule as long and as brutally as they want."
Again, whether it is the presidents of China, Egypt, Uganda, Russia and Turkey all basically making themselves into presidents for life, or Bibi forging an alliance with a racist politician banned from America so that he can cling to power in Israel, or the Saudi crown prince's team murdering moderate journalist/critic Jamal Khashoggi, or allies Poland, Brazil and Hungary all drifting away from democracy under the sway of power-hungry nationalists, it's obvious that none of them, none of them, ever bothered to ask themselves before their respective moves, "But what will the Americans say if we do this?"
They knew the answer: Anything goes.

Texto completo: move comes in wake of Cohen testimony
As probes multiply, president claims 'harassment' New York state regulators have subpoenaed President Trump's insurance broker, following testimony from former Trump attorney Michael Cohen that Trump exaggerated his wealth to insurance companies.
That subpoena - acknowledged Tuesday by broker Aon PLC - signaled another line of inquiry into Trump's private business, this time by New York's Department of Financial Services.
"As is our policy, we intend to cooperate with all regulatory bodies," Aon spokeswoman Donna Mirandola wrote in an email. She declined to answer further questions, saying, "We do not comment on specific client matters."
Tuesday was a case study in Trump's new reality of besiegement as multiplying investigations by state authorities, federal investigators and congressional Democrats began to dig into his business, charity and presidency simultaneously.
The White House rebuffed one such inquiry, telling House Democrats it would not provide documents about its process for granting security clearances. But that did not end the confrontation. It probably just delayed it: Democrats are discussing whether to demand that information under subpoena.
And, for Trump, other troubles were just behind that one. Another committee of House Democrats said it was preparing to ask for about 10 years of Trump's tax returns. Trump has declined to release his tax returns, unlike other presidents in the recent past.
And still another committee - House Intelligence - announced that it had hired a former federal prosecutor to lead its investigation of Trump's alleged ties to Russia. Daniel Goldman, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, has a history of prosecuting securities fraud, racketeering and international organized crime.
As the inquiries multiplied, Trump's tweets got short.
"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!" the president wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, seemingly viewing all these inquiries as an effort by his enemies to overwhelm him.
At an afternoon event at the White House, Trump told reporters that Democrats had hurt their chances of working with him on policy issues.
"It's too bad, because I'd rather see them do legislation," Trump said. "Instead of doing infrastructure, instead of doing health care, instead of doing so many things that they should be doing, they want to play games."
The Trump Organization declined to comment Tuesday. Trump still owns his business, although he has handed day-to-day control of it to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, and to longtime executive Allen Weisselberg.
The past few days have accelerated the probes into Trump's past and present, particularly following testimony last week by Cohen, once Trump's self-described "fixer." Cohen spent seven hours telling a House committee about the inner workings of Trump's company.
At one point, Cohen said that Trump used exaggerated statements of his own wealth to impress journalists, reassure lenders and persuade insurance companies to lower his premiums.
"When we were dealing . . . with insurance companies, we would provide them with these copies so that they would understand that the premium, which is based sometimes upon the individual's capabilities to pay, would be reduced," Cohen testified.
"And all of this was done at the president's direction and with his knowledge?" asked Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.).
"Yes," Cohen said.
That testimony preceded the subpoena from New York's Department of Financial Services, which regulates insurance in the state. The Trump Organization is headquartered in Manhattan.
The department sent Aon a nine-page subpoena, according to the New York Times, which first reported that it had been issued. The department asked for all communications between Aon and Trump or the Trump Organization, as well as internal documents in which Aon employees discuss Trump.
Two people familiar with the subpoena said the Times' description was accurate. The Department of Financial Services did not respond to requests for comment. The scope of the inquiry and the department's focus are still unclear.
Separately, congressional Democrats spent the early days of this week laying out detailed demands for documents from Trump, his family, his underlings and his business partners. On Monday, the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to 81 people and entities asking for documents the committee wants to examine in a host of Trump-related inquiries.
Judiciary's document request seeks information from Trump's two adult sons, business associates, political confidants and others. It touches on a wide array of matters, including the president's business dealings with Russia, the firing of James B. Comey as FBI director and hush payments made to women who say they had affairs with Trump.
Democrats, led by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (Mass.), plan to seek Trump's tax returns under a 1924 law that gives chairmen of the House and Senate tax-writing committees broad powers to demand the tax returns of White House officials, according to people briefed on those plans.
People involved in that effort said they are being deliberate so as not to make a mistake that jeopardizes the investigation.
"If we had done this a month and a half ago, we would not be prepared, we would be falling on our face, and we'd be looking at the rationale for what we're doing," said Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.).
Trump has made clear to associates that he will resist this demand, according to three people who have been briefed on the discussions but spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.
If Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refuse, that would be likely to set off a court battle that would drag the process out for months or more than a year and into the 2020 election season.
"What the president will do is: He will, first of all, respond grudgingly and slowly. They will then negotiate," said former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a staunch ally of Trump's. "They will be subpoenaed. They will take that all the way to the Supreme Court."
But the more-immediate fight centers on Democrats' request for documents pertaining to the White House security clearance process.
In a letter to the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), White House Counsel Pat Cipollone said the committee request for the information was "without legal support, clearly premature, and suggests a breach of the constitutionally required accommodation process."
Cipollone said his staff would brief the panel and allow them to view documents related to their investigation, though that offer has not been sufficient for committee Democrats in the past.
"We believe the best course is to move forward with this agreed-upon accommodation and then speak again once your review of the documents and the briefing are complete," said the letter, which was dated Monday and released Tuesday.
The standoff comes just days after reports that Trump directed his then-chief of staff, John F. Kelly, to give his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a security clearance despite concerns from the intelligence community. The New York Times first reported the news, which was later confirmed by The Washington Post.
Cummings, however, has been asking questions about the security clearance process for months, even garnering bipartisan support for his inquiry in the previous, Republican-controlled Congress.
In a statement, Cummings rejected the White House lawyer's assertion that Congress does not have jurisdiction over security-clearance matters.
"The White House's argument defies the constitutional separation of powers, decades of precedent before this committee, and just plain common-sense," Cummings said. "The White House security clearance system is broken, and it needs both congressional oversight and legislative reform."
A variety of other inquiries churned away in the background, including congressional investigations of Russian election interference and the Russia-related probe being conducted by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Also ongoing are state inquiries into Trump's use of his charity and into the hiring of undocumented workers at Trump's golf courses.
Eric Trump said Tuesday on Fox News Radio that all of these probes are designed to undermine Trump's success as president.
"These people are so desperate," he said. "If you can't win, what do you do? You obstruct, you try and impeach, you try and harass, you try and distract. I mean, that's all these people know how to do. I mean, they can't win."

Texto completo: You may have three small children who leave a trail of toys in their wake. Or maybe a two-car garage that serves merely as storage space for long-forgotten items. The mess is manageable until it's not. When it becomes too overwhelming to tackle , who are you going to call? Maybe try a professional organizer.
By now, you've probably heard of Marie Kondo, the Japanese organizational maven whose hit Netflix series "Tidying Up" has sparked a donate-or-toss movement across U.S. households. But Kondo is far from the only expert at her craft.
In Southwest Florida, there are a handful of professional organizers who use their tried-and-true methods to help families take control of their mess and live in harmony.
But what is a professional organizer and when do you need one? And if you don't have money to spend, what are some helpful tips to tackle the mess on your own?
Three local organizers answer your burning questions.
What does a professional organizer do? Marla Ottenstein calls herself a "problem solver."
She drops into someone's home Mary Poppins-style and helps them declutter and organize, everything from the kitchen pantry to the garage. The North Naples resident shares much of her knowledge in her Get Organized columns.
"I come into someone's home and work with a client to teach them how to become and stay organized," Ottenstein said. She also offers moving and staging services.
The Naples-based organizer is one of six in Southwest Florida certified by the National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals(NAPO).
NAPO defines a professional organizer as someone who "supports evaluation, decision-making, and action around objects, space and data; helping clients achieve desired outcomes regarding function, order and clarity."
Ottenstein wants to be clear she isn't a maid, although she does help clients clean their houses throughout the organizational process. Her ultimate goal is to transfer her organizing skills to her client.
"There's nothing better than someone saying I don't need your services anymore."
When do I need one? Roxy Hambleton says she gets usually gets the call when someone is facing a major life change like a divorce, death, moving or retirement.
"At that point in their lives, they may stop to look around their house and say to themselves, 'How did it get like this?' " said Hambleton, a certified professional organizer who owns and operates Positively Organized serving clients in Naples, Bonita Springs and Fort Myers.
Like Ottenstein, Hambleton is a general professional organizer who offers corporate and residential services but also specializes in hoarding cases.
Learning how to properly declutter and organize isn't just beneficial for keeping up with appearances, Hambleton said. These skills can leave a lasting psychological impact.
A clean space helps raise a person's self-esteem and shifts their energy and focus. Although we live in a consumer-driven society, where more is seen as best, some people crave the peace that may come with less stuff, she said.
The approach works for her clients with hoarding tendencies and those who are slightly unorganized.
"Both groups are all so filled with shame because of the mess and often succumb to negative self-talk."
Hambleton transfers her skills to her clients to help turn their negative mindset into a positive one.
When working with hoarders, she uses a slightly different approach. Hoarding is a disorder diagnosed as a mental illness.
The American Psychiatric Association defines a person suffering from a hoarding disorder as someone who excessively saves items that others may view as worthless. They have difficulty getting rid of or parting with possessions, leading to endless clutter. People with a hoarding disorder often save random items and store them haphazardly.
"They give items a lot of meaning, and it's literally painful for them to let them go, so they end up keeping everything," said Hambleton, also a member of the Lee County Task Force on Hoarding.
She helps these clients by teaching them how to let go, developing a plan to prevent future clutter and connecting them to a support group or coach.
What to expect when you're expecting an organizer Typically a consultation takes place before an organizer gets to work. That's when a client and the organizer form a plan of action and see if their visions align.
If everything goes well, then the work begins.
When Ottenstein walks into a home or office, she's not coming in with the intent of throwing everything away.
"We don't make someone get rid of stuff. I suggest they may get rid of an item if they don't need it anymore. It's a gentler process, especially if they have trouble giving sentimental items away," she said.
Let's say someone wants to hold on to their mother's fur coat for sentimental reasons. Instead of letting it gather dust in a closet or giving it away completely, Ottenstein suggests they repurpose it.
"I'd say something like, 'let's make a pillow cover or a throw blanket out of it,'" she said.
If boxes and boxes of old photos are taking up most of her client's closet space, rather than throwing away most of the photos, Ottenstein would suggest saving many of them on a flash drive while still keeping some stored in a box or two.
Every client is different, she said. Sometimes all they need is a few hours of her time, while others need her for several months.
And the way Ottenstein approaches the organizational process depends on her client as well.
She likes using the room-by-room approach where you organize one room at a time. She tailors it to her client's needs and wants.
"There is no cookie-cutter method when it comes to organizing," Ottenstein said. "There are no rules. ... The goal is to help people so they can enjoy their lives."
Then there's Marie Kondo's KonMari method that encourages tidying by category — not by location — like clothes, books, papers, miscellaneous items and sentimental items. She's often heard telling clients on her Netflix series to keep only those items that "spark joy."
When Hambleton works with clients, she likes taking away any and all distractions.
"The TV shouldn't be on and they should avoid taking a call unless it's an emergency. Once we get going, it's best not to slow the momentum," she said.
What to do with old paperwork If you have mountains and mountains of paperwork, Tracy Colleran can help with that. This certified professional organizer specializes in bookkeeping. She owns and operates Straighten Up Inc. based in Southwest Florida.
Colleran started her professional organizing company in 2007 to help disorganized individuals feel more in control of their surroundings.
Paperwork may not be as sentimental as household items, but she said many of her clients end up accumulating so much paper they don't know what's trash and what's worth keeping. Often important documents get lost in the shuffle.
"A lot of residents living here rely on physical copies of documents, but they don't know when it's OK to let it go or keep," Colleran said.
Depending on her client, she may use a digital or traditional approach like file cabinets to get their life in order.
Tips for organizing on your own Start small, says Hambleton.
If you're thinking of tackling mess on your own because you don't have money or time to invest in a professional organizer, Hambleton recommends starting with small spaces like junk drawers before moving on to a large space like a garage.
For her own clients, Hambleton often follows a specific guideline which she said can be helpful for do-it-yourself organizers. It's called SPACE, an acronym that stands for sort, purge, assign a home, containerize and equalize. It was created by New York Times best-selling author and organizer Julie Morgenstern.
How does it work? Let's say you plan on organizing your bedroom closet first. Start by removing everything and grouping similar categories together like purses and pants. Then decide what you want to donate, toss or keep. That's the purging process. The next step is to assign a home in your closet for all the items you want to keep. You can categorize your clothes and accessories based on color or type. For smaller accessories like shoes and handbags, use bins or containers to keep the items organized. That's the containerize step. Equalize is the last thing on your list. That's when you create a maintenance program by incorporating daily cleanups for starters.

TERRIFYING THREAT NUKES AREN'T THE TOOL IN NORTH KOREA'S ARESENAL

Texto completo: In the wake of the summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Vietnam, there is a major danger that the narrow focus on nuclear weapons obscures: Mr. Kim holds the whip in a three-ring circus of weapons of mass destruction. The other two rings, adjacent and in many ways more frightening, feature chemical weapons and -above all -biological threats.
The North Koreans are suspected by U.S. and South Korean intelligence agencies of holding substantial amounts of a variety of biological agents including smallpox, botulism, typhoid and anthrax. In 2015, the North Korean media showed Mr. Kim touring a biological plant. A former Pentagon official in charge of countering such programs told reporters that North Korean bioweapons are "advanced, underestimated and highly lethal."
I remember that as the U.S. military prepared for the Gulf War in the early 1990s, most of us in uniform took a series of a dozen shots we were informed might reduce the effect of anthrax should Saddam Hussein launch a bio-attack. Bioweapons have some advantages over nuclear weapons in terms of spreading terror: They can easily be smuggled across borders, and their use can be very hard to attribute, unlike a nuclear weapon with an obvious origin.
The final ring of the WMD circus -chemical weapons -is equally disturbing. In 2017, two North Korean agents allegedly killed Mr. Kim's half-brother at a Malaysian airport using the nerve agent VX. The North Korean military routinely uses simulated chemical weapons in drills and exercises, and could easily incorporate nerve agents into artillery barrages of Seoul from just over the border. South Korean intelligence agencies say the North may have as much as 5,000 tons of chemical agents, possibly including ricin, mustard gas, hydrogen cyanide and the nerve agent tabun. North Korea is one of just three nations that has refused to sign the international Chemical Weapons Convention.
Would Mr. Kim dare such an attack? There might be some strategic sense. He knows that deploying a nuclear weapon would be signing his own death warrant. But he might be able to create a far more ambiguous situation in which he could consider using some biological or chemical element. And while U.S. and South Korean forces are trained to operate after such an attack, the civilians on the peninsula are essentially undefended -including the families of 28,000 U.S. servicemen stationed there.
In preparing for this threat, Washington has considerable work to do. It should start by increasing intelligence collection specifically regarding chemical and bio-threats, working in concert with the South Korean allies. At home, there needs to be more research and development of technological counters to known agents. This will require a far higher level of interagency cooperation between the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. American troops need more exercises that simulate operating in the lethal environment of a chemical or biological attack.
Above all, the U.S. must bring greater global attention to the threat. This means international pressure on North Korea to sign global agreements banning such weapons; making those weapons part of the agenda alongside nukes in summit negotiations; and pressuring Russia and China to persuade Mr. Kim to rid himself of any stockpiles before sanctions can be fully lifted.
The chances of Mr. Kim quickly surrendering his entire nuclear arsenal are roughly the same as that of Mexico paying for Mr. Trump's beautiful wall. Still, pursuing a diplomatic conclusion -not Mr. Trump's loose talk of "fire and fury" -to the standoff on the Korean peninsula is the path forward. But the U.S. shouldn't forget to put other weapons of mass destruction on the table as well.

Where do lawmakers go; who pays for it?

Texto completo: Lawmakers' travel has been scrutinized since former Speaker Cliff Rosenberger resigned last April. Rosenberger, R-Clarksville, took trips to destinations such as England, Israel and France – paid for by outside groups or campaign accounts, both his and House Republicans'. The FBI is still looking into that spending, but Rosenberger's attorney says the former lawmaker did nothing wrong.
COLUMBUS – A gaming conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil. A trip to Israel to talk about cybersecurity and mental health. A New Orleans conference for consumer credit advocates.
Each year, several Southwest Ohio lawmakers spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on out-of-state travel. They meet legislators from other states, learn about how foreign countries tackle problems and make connections that could help them professionally and politically.
But figuring out how much each lawmaker travels and who pays for those trips is far from easy. Legislators must report some travel for official business on annual ethics forms but not all. Some lawmakers use campaign contributions to pay for travel and document trips there. But lawmakers can also receive free trips from national groups or pay for the trips themselves — it's impossible to tell.
Some lawmakers keep diligent records. Since 2013, Butler County Sen. Bill Coley has spent at least $80,000 on out-of-state travel to conferences in places like London, Brazil and Miami using his campaign contributions.
Coley reported spending more on out-of-state travel than other Southwest Ohio lawmakers, according to an Enquirer review of 23 legislators' financial disclosure forms and campaign expenditures. Former Rep. Alicia Reece, D-Roselawn, came in second, spending at least $21,000 in campaign money on out-of-state travel since 2013.
If other Cincinnati-area lawmakers traveled more than Coley, there's no way to tell. A loophole in Ohio's ethics forms allows legislators to travel to certain conferences without disclosing the cost of their trip.
Coley sees the travel as vital to his role as a lawmaker. At one conference, he discovered Ohio was one of nine states that don't tax promotional gaming. At another, he learned about transmitting patient data wirelessly.
"My staff hates it when I travel. The whole time I'm texting them ideas. I'm constantly bothering them," Coley told The Enquirer.
And he pays for the trips with campaign donations.
"My supporters are aware I utilize campaign funds to do that. I don't want to use taxpayer funds," Coley said.
Travel trips up ex-speaker Lawmakers' travel has been scrutinized since former Speaker Cliff Rosenberger resigned last April. Rosenberger, R-Clarksville, took trips to destinations such as England, Israel and France — paid for by outside groups or campaign accounts, both his and House Republicans'. The FBI is still looking into that spending, but Rosenberger's attorney says the former lawmaker did nothing wrong.
The full scope of Rosenberger's travel wasn't detailed on any single form. The Enquirer and other Ohio reporters requested the former speaker's emails, calendars and flight details to detail the scope of it. The FBI subpoenaed hundreds of pages of documents.
Those records revealed Rosenberger took about 50 trips — some personal, but most professional — to locales, such as Normandy, France and Italy; Iceland before his London trip; Los Angeles; Bonita Springs, Florida, for an annual GOP fundraiser and China over three years.
Rosenberger disclosed spending nearly $60,000 on travel (in addition to mileage to the Ohio Statehouse) between 2013 and 2017, according to ethics forms. In comparison, Ryan Smith, who became speaker after Rosenberger resigned, disclosed $5,400 in travel during that time. Ohio Senate President Larry Obhof reported nearly $2,400 and current House Speaker Larry Householder reported $0. In January 2017, Householder and his sons took a FirstEnergy corporate airplane to the presidential inauguration in Washington D.C., according to a Dayton Daily News report.
Rosenberger's travel went far beyond that of most other lawmakers — even those in leadership positions. Still, local legislators have booked expensive trips as well. Sen. Cecil Thomas, D-North Avondale, traveled to Israel to learn about cybersecurity in 2016. Rep. Bill Seitz, R-Green Township, reported a $1,200 trip from the conservative Heartland Institute in 2015. Hyde Park Rep. Brigid Kelly joined a bipartisan group to Israel's University of Haifa in 2017.
Despite outrage over Rosenberger's expensive and extensive travel, no changes have been made to curtail legislators' out-of-state travel or force them to disclose more details about who paid for it.
Ohio's travel disclosure loophole Ohio lawmakers report some of their travel to the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee, a bipartisan group that oversees legislators and lobbyists.
But there's a big loophole: lawmakers are not required to list travel to conferences of national or state organizations that receive dues from the Legislature. That list includes the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which recently held meetings in Grand Rapids, New Orleans and Nashville, and the National Conference of State Legislatures, which held its annual conference in Los Angeles last summer.
Several lawmakers attended these conferences, but none were required to detail who paid for their flights, hotels or food. Some used campaign money for the travel and reported the expenses there, but many did not.
Groups like ALEC draft model bills for lawmakers nationwide and have "tremendous influence," said Catherine Turcer, executive director of the good government group Common Cause Ohio. "We should be able to follow the money of lawmakers who travel to those conferences."
The risk: lawmakers are wined and dined by lobbyists without constituents in Ohio ever knowing, Turcer said.
"Anytime we make a decision not to require really good disclosure, wealthy interests or special interests are going to get in there," Turcer said.
But Coley said he sees no problem with the loophole on certain travel. It encourages lawmakers to attend conferences where they can learn from policymakers across the nation and beyond.
"You want to make sure you have people that are well informed and coming up with the best ideas to improve things in Ohio," Coley said. "It's hard to do that when you're not availing yourself of every opportunity to learn."
No push for change There's little pressure to change a rule that benefits both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. The last time legislators took a hard look at ethics rules, New Richmond Republican Tom Niehaus was leading the Ohio Senate, and he left in 2012, Turcer said.
Last year, Rep. Niraj Antani, R-Miamisburg, proposed banning lawmakers from accepting free international trips and documenting more information about the food and gifts they receive. The bill received no hearings. Antani hasn't yet decided if he will try again.
Ohioans aren't alone in struggling to document lawmakers' travel. While wildfires burned in California, some of its legislators were in Maui being lobbied by utility officials, according to a New York Times report. In response, a progressive advocacy group demanded that lawmakers report travel in real time.
Ohio lawmakers aren't required to file travel expenses in real time either. Ethics forms for the previous year aren't available until the spring, so constituents can't look up their lawmaker's 2018 travel for another several months. If lawmakers use their campaign contributions to pay for travel, those receipts are filed more regularly — but are still months behind.
"It's never too late for somebody to step forward," Turcer said. "This is really the time to think about good rules."
Lawmakers' travel has been scrutinized since former Speaker Cliff Rosenberger resigned last April. Rosenberger, R-Clarksville, took trips to destinations such as England, Israel and France – paid for by outside groups or campaign accounts, both his and House Republicans'.

Texto completo: Florida State University will host a talk by a scholar and author often described as "The Father of Environmental Justice."
Robert Bullard, distinguished professor of urban planning and environmental policy at Texas Southern University, will speak on "Building Just and Sustainable Communities in the Era of Climate Change."
Bullard will address his passion for the intersectionality of social justice, the environment, human health, racial equity and urban planning.
The lecture, which is free and open to the public, is 7 p.m. Wednesday, March 6, at Ruby Diamond Concert Hall. Doors open at 6 p.m.
Bullard is the co-founder of the HBCU Climate Change Consortium and an award-winning author of 18 books on race, equity and environmental justice.
The first 100 FSU students to arrive for the event will receive a free copy of "The Wrong Complexion for Protection," the acclaimed 2012 book by Bullard and Beverly Wright, founding director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice.
Bullard will autograph his book after his lecture. Additional copies will be available for purchase.
FSU Classics presents a marathon reading of Homer's 'Odyssey' Florida State University's Department of Classics will present a marathon reading of Homer's "Odyssey" as part of Classics Week at FSU, which runs March 4-7.
The reading will take place from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wednesday, March 6, at Landis Green. Anyone interested in reading is invited to sign up for a timed reading slot on the FSU Marathon Odyssey Reading Facebook Page.
The "Odyssey" is one of two epic poems attributed to the ancient Greek poet Homer, the other being the "Iliad."
This particular version of the "Odyssey" is Emily Wilson's groundbreaking new translation.
Wilson, a professor of classical studies at the University of Pennsylvania, is the first woman to translate the "Odyssey" into English, and her translation has received wide praise for its novel perspective on the epic.
Written in iambic pentameter verse, Wilson's "Odyssey" is an angular, expeditious translation that recaptures what Wilson describes as Homer's "nimble gallop" and brings an ancient epic to new life. The New York Times listed Wilson's translation as one of its 100 notable books of 2018.
The Department of Classics at FSU is the oldest of its kind in Florida and has become one of the leading centers of classical studies in the United States.
FAMU Concert Choir, Morehouse Glee Club, to perform with TSO The Morehouse College Glee Club and the FAMU Concert Choir will join the Tallahassee Symphony Orchestra in concert at 8 p.m. Saturday, March 30.
For the first time, the HBCUs will perform the "Seven Last Words of the Unarmed."
This new composition is unique because it includes the last words of seven unarmed black men before they were killed and received national attention.
Tickets range from $31 - $70, $25 for students at their campus box offices. On the night of the concert, there will be a "Student Rush" where students will have the opportunity to purchase any outstanding seats for $10.

Texto completo: Nobody wakes up on their wedding day and thinks, I bet we'll be divorced by this time next year. At least, I hope not.
Most of us have the highest hopes and dreams for our marriages. Sometimes, though, after a few years, reality sets in — in the form of debt, credit cards and financial infidelity — and we give up hope. That's why money problems are a leading cause of divorce in America, and it's why I'm so passionate about helping people take control of their money.
When I speak at events or talk to couples across the country, I hear time and time again that money is at the root of so much marital stress. It's amazing how appearance, status and stuff can take over our lives and ruin our relationships if we aren't careful. The good news is that there is an antidote. It all comes down to common sense.
Whether you're just dating or are already an "old married couple," here are a few tips to make money a blessing in your relationship — not a cause of stress and fights.
Work together, not separate How can you be on the same page about money if you have two separate bank accounts? Didn't the pastor at your wedding ceremony say, "You will become one"? Keeping your accounts separate is one of the most effective ways to completely wreck your financial life — and maybe even your marriage. If you want to win with money in your marriage, you must be on the same team.
Make a routine At the end of every month, sit down with your spouse for your monthly budget meeting. Plan out how you will spend every dollar for the coming month — groceries, gas, bills, everything. And don't forget to budget a small percentage of "fun" money!
Stay involved It's okay if one of you is in charge of budgeting and paying bills, but you both need to communicate and know what's going on. My husband and I use the budgeting app EveryDollar, because it's easy to use and gives us both visibility into what's going on with our money.
Be willing to say "no" If it's not in the budget, then it's not in the budget. That might mean you can't have the latest iPhone or designer shoes. Remember, it's only no for now. Once you're debt-free, you'll have more freedom to afford the things you really want. My dad, Dave Ramsey, taught me to "Live like no one else, so later, you can live like no one else."
Don't compare your marriage to anyone else's You may think other couples have it all together based on what you see on social media, but their marriage may very well be stressed. Maybe they have no margin with their money, because their paycheck comes in and goes right back out in payments. Their "perfect life" may be just one money fight away from divorce. Stay focused on your marriage and your goals.
If you and your spouse are struggling right now, change won't come overnight. But you've got to start somewhere. Getting started is the hardest part, but once you start those conversations with your spouse, it will change your marriage. If you're struggling with how to approach it, check out my list of six money conversation starters to help.
So, sit down for a heart-to-heart with your spouse, be honest, and be proactive. Don't let your marriage fall apart because you're not paying attention to money issues.

Texto completo: The future isn't as wireless as we were promised. Whether you're looking for a second charger for your phone or need a new video cable for your home theater, you need cords you can trust.
Unfortunately, when you're shopping for cables and chargers of any kind -- from phone chargers to home theater equipment -- your search results will inevitably be flooded with low-quality brands that either cut corners to keep prices low or use marketing jargon to confuse you into paying more. To save you some time when you're doing your research, we checked with the experts at Wirecutter, the New York Times company that reviews products, and rounded up a few brands you can generally trust to make high-quality products at a lower price point.
First, a few things to watch for
For the most part, cables only really have one job: transfer information or power from one place to another. There are few things an expensive cable does better than a cheaper one. However, there are still a few distinguishing features to watch for when you're cable shopping, depending on your needs. Here are a few tips:
■ Check reviews on USB-C cables. Because of a change in the way that USB-C cables charge devices, it's possible for a manufacturer to cut corners and create a cable that can physically damage your devices. The problem can be so bad that a Google engineer spent his free time reviewing individual cables for safety. We'll recommend some generally safe ones, but if you're not buying from the brands below, always check the reviews.
■ Pick the right fast charger for your phone. Generic fast chargers can be cheaper than the ones your phone manufacturer sells, but they're not all compatible with each other. We have a bit more information on how to find the right fast charger here. The brands below offer a variety of fast chargers, but it's always worth checking to ensure they work with your phone.
■ Get high-bandwidth USB cables only if you need them. If you have a 4K HDR TV, you'll need cables that can support the bandwidth. These cables are usually branded with "High-Speed" or "Premium Certified" labels. These cables are growing increasingly common, and almost any HDMI cable will work for regular HDTVs, but if you're upgrading your home theater, make sure the cable is rated for 4K and HDR. When it comes to USB cables, it's even more important to find the right cable speeds. If you need a cable for a portable hard drive, get a USB 3.0 cable that can handle higher data transfer speeds. For charging your phone, cheaper USB 2.0 cables will be fine.
Outside of these few distinguishing features, there's not much you need to look for in a cable or charger. If a company advertises something crazy like gold plated connectors or "nitrogen injected dielectric gas," it's usually marketing hype to try to convince you there's a reason to spend more than a few bucks on a cable.
AmazonBasics
Just as retailers like Walmart and Target have their own store brand versions of various products, Amazon has its own line called AmazonBasics to cover your everyday needs. You can get AmazonBasics versions of everything from dinner plates to office chairs at relatively low prices. You could probably get something better from another company, but if you just want something that does the job, Amazon's own brand is usually reliable.
Where it really stands out, though, is in cables and chargers. The AmazonBasics line includes HDMI cables, lightning cables, micro USB cables, USB-C cables, and all the other essentials you need for charging your phone or tablet, hooking up your home theater or connecting your desktop computer. You can generally trust them to at least be wired properly and not damage your equipment. As Wirecutter contributor Geoff Morrison explained, "A company like Amazon isn't going to put out something that doesn't work. It'd be too expensive and damaging to the brand."
When it comes to HDMI cables, though, Wirecutter chose AmazonBasics as its top pick. Other cables are at least serviceable. Best of all, they're cheap enough that buying replacements is trivial. You could buy a $35 cable that promises to be "durable" and last a while, but when that same $35 could buy you seven AmazonBasics cables, it's hard to justify the extra cost.
Anker
Like AmazonBasics, Anker sells a selection of micro USB, USB-C, and Lightning cables to charge your phone. The company doesn't sell as many home theater or desktop cables, but it does have a wide array of chargers for your phones and tablets. You can find wireless fast charging stands, USB car chargers, fast charging wall blocks, and portable power banks.
Better yet, Anker has a reputation for being reliable. Wirecutter editor Mark Smirniotis explained that if you're looking for an accessory that's less expensive than the official ones, but more reliable than the dirt cheap, no-name brands, Anker is one of your best bets.
"The middle ground is held by companies like Anker or RAVPower -- less expensive than official accessories, but well-made and well-supported," he said. "Anker has been around for well over five years now, and Wirecutter has tested and reviewed dozens -- maybe hundreds -- of their products. We see that both companies put a lot of thought into their designs and update them regularly. In our own long-term testing and reviews of reader experiences, we've also found that they're well-made and generally reliable."
When Wirecutter has reviewed categories that Anker has an entry for, the brand regularly at least gets a runner-up slot, if not the top choice. While it doesn't hurt to check around for the specific product you need if you want the absolute best, if you're buying Anker there's a higher than average chance you're getting a product that works well.
Monoprice
Like Anker, Monoprice sells more than just cables. The company sells home theater equipment, smart home accessories, networking gear and a lot more. It's also been around and selling off-brand accessories since 2002, giving it a strong leg up on some of the competition. Some of their gear is high quality at a low price, from these subwoofers to these banana plugs, both of which earned top marks from Wirecutter. They also found that Monoprice's HDMI cables were just as good as AmazonBasics, but slightly cheaper.
Mr. Morrison, author of the site's guide to cheap HDMI cables, lauded the cable selection. "Monoprice has been around for many years and nearly every cable in my theater is from them," he said.
However, Monoprice has been around long enough and has a big enough product library that there are bound to be some stinkers. When Wirecutter reviewed earbuds under $50, several Monoprice headphones came up short. Wirecutter staff editor Nick Guy also suggests paying close attention to what you're buying from Monoprice.
"Stock levels can be inconsistent, to start. It's not uncommon to see a product listed as out of stock with a return date several weeks in the future," he said. "Monoprice also has a habit of quietly swapping out commodity accessories like cables with newer models. While that new model still might be a good buy, it may not be the same model that was listed last week."
For basic products like cables, adapters and chargers, Monoprice's products are generally reliable, but you might want to comparison shop a bit to make sure you're getting the best deal. If you're going to move up to bigger, more important home theater, networking, or smart home accessories, Monoprice can be good, but we still recommend checking out additional reviews first.

More Moon Shots Worth Watching

Texto completo: The documentary "Apollo 11" -- playing in select IMAX theaters now, before opening more widely in regular cinemas on Friday -- is one of the most rousing movies ever made about NASA and space exploration. The director Todd Douglas Miller and a team of archivists and editors found rare footage of the original manned lunar landing mission, and compiled it into a film that's an immersive and inspiring record of the voyage, from launch to splashdown.
But "Apollo 11" is far from the only great documentary about humanity's efforts to explore beyond Earth's atmosphere. The "space doc" is a small but fertile nonfiction cinema subgenre, populated by filmmakers who often partner with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to combine astonishing images with recollections from the small handful of men and women who have dared to venture to the stars.
[Read our review of "Apollo 11," a Times Critic's Pick]
Here are five of the best of these movies, and how to stream them.
'For All Mankind' (1989)
How to watch: Stream it on Kanopy; buy or rent it on Amazon, iTunes and Vudu.
The gold standard for NASA documentaries, this Oscar-nominated 1989 film is rich with the alien wonder of a trip to the moon. The director Al Reinert was granted access to footage shot by astronauts during the various Apollo missions, and he and his editors (led by Susan Korda) cut them into an approximation of a single voyage, with a focus on scenes that are eerie and awe-inspiring. With its score by the ambient music pioneers Brian Eno, Roger Eno and Daniel Lanois -- and its narration provided by the original Mission Control audio recordings, combined with reflective astronaut interviews -- "For All Mankind" evokes the grand science-fiction adventure of Apollo. (For a more straightforward, less experimental account of the program, the 2007 British documentary "In the Shadow of the Moon" is also highly recommended. It's available to stream for free on the ad-supported Tubi.)

'The Last Man on the Moon' (2016)
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix; buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
As a bittersweet bookend to "Apollo 11," watch this documentary about the final moon mission, and see how it changed the life of its commander, Eugene Cernan. The director Mark Craig keeps his film fairly equally divided between the personal, professional and political sides of Cernan's NASA career. "The Last Man on the Moon" covers the public's growing frustration with the expense of the space program, and also gets into the technical complexities of that last trip in 1972, and into how an astronaut's job conflicts with family life. This is the rare space-doc that's also a poignant character sketch. And it doesn't lack for great lunar footage, either. Apollo 17 had access to color video cameras far beyond what Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin worked with, and the images Cernan and his crew captured on the moon are stunning in their clarity.

'The Farthest' (2017)
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix; buy or rent it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube.
When NASA launched its two deep-space Voyager probes in 1977, the missions sparked conversations among scientists, artists, philosophers and ordinary folks, all wondering what information about Earth should be sent out into the universe, and what data -- or even communication -- might come back from the distant planets and stars. The director Emer Reynolds's documentary "The Farthest" describes the work that went into crafting these enduring marvels of mid-'70s technology, which are still zooming away out there. The film is a reminder of the idealism and optimism of the people who worked in the space program over 40 years ago, and serves as a call to recapture their spirit and ingenuity.
[Read the New York Times review.]
'The Mars Generation' (2017)
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
Manned space exploration has slowed lately, but the nonprofit organization the Mars Generation has been working since 2015 to keep the next wave of astronauts and rocket scientists ready anyway, just in case. The documentary "The Mars Generation" introduces some brilliant, space-obsessed teens, who take part in special camps designed to simulate what it might be like to travel to and even live on Mars. These kids are sometimes socially awkward, but always sweetly earnest. It's heartwarming to watch them work together toward a goal they may never achieve in real life, unless the public broadly supports another big, expensive project on the scale of the Apollo missions.
'Mercury 13' (2018)
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
How about a little historical "what if?" In 1960, the NASA adviser Dr. William Randolph Lovelace II began an experiment to see if ace female pilots could endure the series of physical and mental challenges he had originally devised for the "Mercury Seven" astronauts. When he discovered that some women scored higher on some tests than the men, the privately funded "Woman in Space" program started lobbying the media and the U.S. government, arguing that in order to compete with the Soviets in the space race, America needed to overcome its deep-rooted sexism. The documentary "Mercury 13" features interviews with some of the accomplished pilots and scientists who worked on this project, many of whom remain certain that the space program -- and perhaps even the culture -- might have been different if NASA had been more open to Lovelace's experiments.
Photograph The images in "For All Mankind," right, nominated for a best documentary Oscar, are eerie and awe-inspiring. (PHOTOGRAPH BY APOLLO ASSOCIATES) (C1); Clockwise from above, "The Mars Generation" is about teenagers at camps that simulate a Mars voyage; "Mercury 13" documents a program to send women into space; and Eugene Cernan in "The Last Man on the Moon."

Texto completo: After all the drama and controversy surrounding the first host-less Academy Awards in 30 years, Anne Hathaway is here to remind us that it might not be so bad.
The actress, 36, co-hosted the 2011 Oscars with James Franco, in what became one of the most awkward and infamous moments in the award show's now-91 year history. Critics complained Franco looked half-asleep, leaving Hathaway to overcompensate with her own enthusiasm.
"No matter what happens with today's show, just remember, it's already been worse," she wrote. "Happy Oscars!"

This isn't the first time Hathaway has acknowledged her disappointment in the hosting gig. In a 2015 interview with The New York Times Magazine, she gave a word of advice to the next Oscars host, Neil Patrick Harris.
"Do the opposite of what I did, and you’ll be fine," she joked. "He’ll be great. "

Texto completo: The first part of the much-anticipated Michael Jackson documentary airs on HBO. And, on NBC, "Good Girls" returns.
What's on TV
LEAVING NEVERLAND 8 p.m. on HBO. In these #MeToo times, will the revival of conversations about Michael Jackson's alleged pedophilia lead to a reckoning? This documentary by Dan Reed focuses on the accounts of Wade Robson and James Safechuck, two men who claim that Jackson sexually abused them for years when they were minors. HBO is showing the four-hour, two-part work over two nights -- on Sunday and Monday. The second part will be followed by "Oprah Winfrey Presents: After Neverland," a separate interview with the two men by Winfrey, which will air at 10 p.m. on HBO and OWN. In a recent article for The New York Times, Wesley Morris called the documentary "long but delicately, patiently done -- and so quiet; you can practically hear yourself listening."
DIVIDE AND CONQUER: THE STORY OF ROGER AILES (2018) 9 p.m. on A&E. Another complex legacy, that of Roger E. Ailes, the former Fox News executive, is the focus of the filmmaker Alexis Bloom's work. The film looks at Ailes's life -- and, by extension, the creation of Fox News itself -- with interviews with his peers and archival footage chronicling a career that helped create the images of former Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. He also profoundly affected the way politics is discussed in America. Ailes's career ended amid sexual-harassment allegations and played a role in furthering political divisions in the country. "You leave 'Divide and Conquer' energized and incensed, and with a grudging admiration for Ailes's pugnacious instincts," Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The Times.
GOOD GIRLS 10 p.m. on NBC. Retta, Christina Hendricks and Mae Whitman star in this comedy about three women breaking bad. They got into trouble in Season 1; now their misdeeds might be catching up with them. The first episode of Season 2, debuting on Sunday, involves the surfacing of evidence that brings them one step closer to discovery by the F.B.I.
What's Streaming
APOLLO 13 (1995) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Between Todd Douglas Miller's new documentary on Apollo 11 and the visual effects victory for "First Man" at the Oscars, America's attempts to send humans to the moon's surface have been getting an unusual amount of attention. Ron Howard's space travel drama, which was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1996 (it won two), is "absolutely thrilling," Janet Maslin wrote in her review for The Times. It also popularized the phrase "Houston, we have a problem," a variation on what was actually said (that would be "Houston, we've had a problem"). "It's a small but important change," Maslin wrote. "One more way that 'Apollo 13' unfolds with perfect immediacy, drawing viewers into the nail-biting suspense of a spellbinding true story."

Texto completo: In last week’s New York Times, several authorities — including former Yale Medical School Dean, and FDA Commissioner, Dr. David Kessler — made the case for a National Institute of Nutrition. Some colleagues appended an “amen” in social media.
I am partly tempted to join that chorus of support, but I have a reservation. The piece was entitled “We Need Better Answers on Nutrition.” Such headlines are inevitably the work of an editor, not the content-expert authors, and are more about attracting attention (i.e., “clickbait”) than representing the actual message with fidelity.
Still, it’s enough to give one pause — because what we really need is better questions. Science is a powerful means to answer questions, but those answers are never better than the questions we pose. In the area of nutrition, we have richly demonstrated our penchant for asking bad ones.
Imagining an entire new institute of the NIH devoted to answering bad questions, my thoughts turned to Sisyphus. For defying the will of the gods, this king of Corinth was punished in Hades by the obligation to push a boulder up a hill. As soon as the boulder reached the pointed peak of that hill, it rolled down the other side. The process repeats, infinitely- and pointlessly.
All that stands between science, and Sisyphus, is sense.
Science should display no vulnerability to so capricious and aimless a fate, anathema to its nature. Science acquires information and understanding incrementally, additively, and relentlessly — the very definition of progress. Science took us from fingers, to abacus, to calculator, to iPad. Science took us from feet, to wheel, to rickshaw, to rocket. Science has taken us to vistas within the atom, and at the edges of the observable universe.
But while hardly anyone casually dabbles in astrophysics, nearly everyone eats. So the “science” of nutrition plays out in rather different currents, where legitimate expertise, constant pop culture fascination, and something like contempt born of universal familiarity converge. The result is a unique propensity for bad questions.
For example, the role of whole fruit (and vegetables, of course) in both health and weight control was robustly established when misguided infatuation with the glycemic index caused us to question these answers, already reliably in hand. Legions renounced whole fruit — and high glycemic vegetables such as carrots. I am on record for saying that if you can find me the person who can honestly blame their obesity or diabetes on carrots, I will renounce my day job and become a hula dancer. I reaffirm the pledge.
Science was obligated to confirm, again, that yes, indeed — eating whole fruits and vegetables really is good for us, not bad, whatever the glycemic index. This pointless exercise played out in the shadow of Sisyphus. We did it again when the high crimes and misdemeanors of fructose were impressed upon us. Legions again renounced fruit; we were obligated again to take up the same question, and re-re-establish the same answer.
We could apply science, repetitively and endlessly, to the question: is whole fruit really good for us? But no matter how many times we prove the answer to be yes, some new provocation could come along. Only sense will ever serve to say: enough. We know this answer already. So, too, for whole grains — despite the pop culture fascination with gluten. So, too, for beans and lentils — despite the aspersions cast at lectins.
We have long known enough about diet and other lifestyle factors to prevent more than 80 percent of chronic disease and premature death that occurs in the modern world. We have long known it, and done very little with the knowledge. Knowledge is not power when it goes unused.
I like the idea of an Institute of Nutrition very much. But if it is, indeed, to provide us “better answers,” we need the sense to ask better questions. The first of those is: what sense does it make to pursue the answers we don’t yet have, while neglecting those we do — answers we know could prevent countless calamities, could add years to lives and life to years around the globe? If we start there, I’m all in. Otherwise — well — beware Greek mythology, bearing gifts.

Don't discount virtues of oldsters

Texto completo: Dianne Feinstein doesn't get it. How could she? She's 85. Ancient. She has had too many decades to resign herself to the status quo, and she won't be around to watch the fires rage and the oceans boil. Step aside, Granny. Sturdier legs will lead the way.
That was the subtext - actually, that was the text - of the California senator's clash with schoolchildren in her San Francisco office last week, as they lamented her coolness to the Green New Deal and she pushed back that she knows a thing or two. She's right. She does. And while that's largely a function of smarts, it's also a function of age. The building blocks of wisdom are experiences, which come only with the passage of time.
Nancy Pelosi is 78. There was a lot of hand-wringing about that in the buildup to the midterms. I participated in it, joining many younger Democrats who questioned her determination to become House speaker. How about some fresh energy and new blood?
Thank heaven she swatted us away, because she smacks down Donald Trump more effectively than any other politician, and the reasons include her poise and steel, the kind forged by many battles over many years. They accrue as wrinkles do, with prolonged exposure to the elements.
Is the Democratic Party too long in the tooth and gray at the temples? You bet. The leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination include Bernie Sanders, 77, Elizabeth Warren, 69, and - if he runs - Joe Biden, 76. That's worrisome. In the past century, the country has never elected a first-term Democratic president over the age of 52. Plenty of pundits have noted that.
The No. 2 and No. 3 Democrats in the House - Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn - are 79 and 78. That concentrates one generation's sensibility and perspective at the summit, and, strategically speaking, the optics aren't optimal.
So it's good that the party recently seeded the stratum just below them with younger lawmakers and that many newly elected Democrats are well under 50. With age as well as gender and race, diversity matters.
But the attention to age can go too far. It degrades the virtues of oldsters. It romanticizes the dewiness of youngsters.
Sure, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's youth (she's 29) is crucial to the passion in her voice, the ambition of her ideas and her ability to rouse a contingent of young voters who too often go missing from politics. But it probably also contributes to her heedlessness - to how cavalier she can be with facts. (Not that we don't have a 72-year-old president who surpasses her in this regard.)
At 37, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., is the youngest of the candidates to jump into the 2020 presidential race, and he is trying to turn his age to his advantage, arguing that he grew up with mass shootings in schools and that his generation will inherit the full consequences of climate change.
But there was gun violence galore before Columbine, Newtown and Parkland. Feinstein can attest to that. She was at San Francisco City Hall on the November 1978 day when Mayor George Moscone and her fellow city supervisor Harvey Milk were fatally shot.
As for the notion that young voters and politicians care more about the future because they have more skin in the game: Show me even one decent parent who doesn't vote with his or her kids in mind. Show me one decent grandparent. I can't see how anyone would invest so much time, money and heart in a child's tomorrow only to ignore that future in the political realm.
Characterizations of Congress as a gerontocracy are often accompanied by complaints about the ruinous gluttony of the baby boom generation, which encompasses people from about Donald Trump's age down to mine, 54. We're rightly charged with befouling the environment, running up the debt and letting the American dream slip away from the middle class.
But you know what else baby boomers did? Helped bring an end to the Vietnam War. Advanced the causes of equality for women, for black people and for LGBT Americans. Engineered the digital revolution. If we're not the dynamos we once were, maybe it's not because we're sanguine or jaded. We could just be pooped.
Or we could just be seasoned, because part of what you discover on the far side of 50 is that aspirations and ardor carry you only so far. Progress ultimately comes from a deep understanding of systems and a thorough familiarity with the most tedious details. 
It's best to have plenty of younger politicians in the mix: It's only from a multiplicity of perspectives that some problems - and some solutions - come clearly into view. And older generations need younger ones to reconnect them with their idealism.
But younger generations need older ones to turn that idealism into more than pretty words. They need the moral authority reserved for people who've done so much loving, so much losing and so much figuring out how to press on. They need the life lessons, which have grown from a pamphlet to an encyclopedia. What a waste not to read every last syllable of it.

Transplant rulechange can mean life, death

Texto completo: This story is the second of two parts.
One of the biggest changes in liver transplant policy in years — set to take effect in April — could greatly affect Iowans on waiting lists for the lifesaving surgery.
But some of the state's top transplant surgeons disagree about whether it will actually help or hurt.
The change, enacted in December by the organization overseeing all organ procurement organizations in the U.S., replaces local and regional geographic boundaries that were used to match liver candidates based on donor location. For years that meant, barring emergency cases elsewhere, local patients received preferential access to the limited number of livers donated in their areas.
The new policy prioritizes cases based on concentric circles around transplant centers and medical necessity. In practice, many believe that would favor those who have been on waiting lists longer, often those in bigger cities in a given region.
In late January, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Joni Ernst and 20 other senators sent a bipartisan letter to the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services questioning how the policy change will affect rural and low-income Americans.
Grassley's staff inquired in part because of concerns raised by Dr. Alan Reed, who heads the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics' Transplant Center.
Reed said the policy change will harm those with liver disease in Iowa who are awaiting donors and could threaten the viability of the center's liver transplant program.
UIHC is the only transplant center of four in the state that performs liver transplants — about 23 last year.
"Patients selected for liver transplants have to meet a number of requirements, including the ability to locate near their transplant center just to be placed on the transplant waiting list," Reed wrote.
Reed said under the new policy, patients in Detroit, Chicago and Minneapolis would have to turn down a liver recovered in Iowa before it would become available to a patient on the center's waiting list.
The odds that would happen is high given the disparity in population bases under the new rules, he said. "So high that I fear for the sustainability of our program," he said.
Reed added: "If UI Health Care either receives fewer livers for transplant or has to close our liver transplant program due to lack of sustainable volume and ability to maintain our transplant team, Iowans will have to travel elsewhere for transplants."
Not everyone agrees But most Iowans already leave the state for liver transplants, and most livers recovered in Iowa go to patients elsewhere, statistics obtained from the Iowa Donor Network show.
The UIHC imports only a small number of livers recovered outside Iowa, and it used Iowa-donated livers in the 23 transplants conducted last year. Thirty-five livers recovered in Iowa went to patients outside the state.
Iowa's waiting list for livers is shorter than many, and included 28 this month.
The distribution change enacted on a federal level was initiated in part because of legal action facing organ procurement programs with longer waiting lists and poor track records.
Investigative reports in the past year in both the New York Times and the Washington Post have highlighted those failings.
Last summer, reporters at the New York Times found New Yorkers donate organs at a much lower rate — about 15 percent — than anywhere else in the country. That's despite the fact the city boasts world-class hospitals and transplant surgeons.
Problems meeting minimum performance standards were so great at LiveOnNY, New York's procurement organization, that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, which oversees all such organizations, threatened to let its certification lapse. It opted not to.
LiveOnNY loses a quarter of its most promising cases because workers are unable to secure consent from the families of prospective donors — a loss of about 3,000 donors a year, the Times found.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has repeatedly found that organ procurement programs "do a poor job of recovering enough organs to meet the need," the Times report said.
The bipartisan letter drafted by Grassley's staff said the distribution change ignores the recommendation of the Liver and Intestine Transplantation Committee, whose members include leading transplant experts.
The change also failed to take into account regional variations in liver donation rates and disparities in the performance of organ procurement organizations, the letter said, and it appears to reward procurement organizations with histories of performance problems, like New York's.
But Qasim Chaudhry, who heads Iowa Methodist Medical Center's transplant program, said the distribution changes could ultimately save more lives.
Because transplant centers will compete in a wider region, they will have to take steps to procure more marginal organs to reduce wait times for patients, he said.
Chaudhry said both Iowa's procurement program and the UIHC have a reputation for being more conservative when it comes to placing donors' organs.
The University of Nebraska Medical Center's program in Omaha, where he trained, performs about twice as many liver donations in a year as the program at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, national statistics show.
That's even though Nebraska has roughly 1.2 million fewer residents.
UIHC's waiting list is longer than other transplant centers in the region. As a result, most Iowans needing liver transplants leave for centers with shorter waiting lists, Chaudhry said.
Next up: Kidney transplants? Methodist has greatly increased its kidney transplants, obtaining donations from other Midwest states, Chaudhry said.
The center accepts some marginalized kidneys turned away by other transplant programs, but focuses more on patient care to assure strong outcomes after the transplant, he said. He acknowledges the hospital takes on a bit more risk, but says it's consistent with the mission of better outcomes for patients.
"It has to do with the leadership of the transplant center's philosophy," he said. "Until they change their mindset, it won't improve. Then the machinery kicks in to make more transplants happen."
Nine years ago, Methodist performed about 15 kidney transplants a year, he said.
Now it does about 55 to 60, he said.
"We transplant people from New York, California and Alabama," he said. "People find us through Google because of the shorter waiting times. For a kidney, our wait is about a year or a year and a half. At Mercy, it's about five years. At the UIHC, it's about three years. Without competition, you can't raise your game."
But Suzanne Conrad, who heads the Iowa Donor Network, Iowa's only procurement program, said criteria for organ distribution depend on the organ. "And what may be fair for liver or heart may not be fair for kidney," she said.
The United Network of Organ Sharing, UNOS, which oversees all procurement programs, also has been exploring a concept of "continuous sharing" for kidneys, or sharing in concentric rings starting at 150 miles and going up to 500 miles from transplant centers.
Dr. Cass Franklin, who heads the transplant program at Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines, said the reason is that organs are considered under law a national resource, and the government is responsible for the distribution. UNOS has been trying to strike a better balance between necessity and equity.
But under the new liver policy, there will be a larger radius of potential recipients under consideration, and decisions will hinge more on on medical necessity.
"The bar is so high, you have to be sicker to get the organ," Franklin said.
"A lot of us would agree you don't want to wait until you are so sick, you run the possibility of not doing well after a liver transplant."
Franklin said transplant surgeons generally have "less better outcomes" using more marginal donors.
"Not only that, if a patient presents earlier in their disease, it gives you an opportunity to select better donors and a better outcome."
Franklin said many liver transplants happen in Nebraska because that program has a long pedigree, and Iowans on the western end of the state are often referred there.
The bottom line, he said, is the nation needs more organ doors. "If we don't increase the resource, we're just dividing the pot differently."
Terri Doocy, a 44-year-old home health care worker in Algona, said people like her who are on waiting lists have to become their own experts, including researching average wait times.
Doocy was diagnosed at 30 with polycystic kidney disease, a genetic disorder shared by her brother.
She said she tried beginning last May to get on a kidney waiting list at Mercy Medical Center, but the process was taking too long.
She said it took less time — about two months — to be placed on the transplant list at Iowa Methodist.
"Methodist told me 18 months was the average wait," she said. "Mercy told me four to five years."
Waits for livers
in Iowa City
In a 100-year period nationally, 12 percent of people would die while waiting for a liver.
At the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, 22.9 percent of people would die per 100 years of waiting for a liver, according to Waitlist Mortality Rates from 2016 to 2018.
Nationally, 43.2 percent of people waiting for a liver transplant get one within a year of joining a center's waiting list. At UIHC, the percentage was 53 percent.
Those who received livers at the UIHC had a 93.6 percent success rate after one year.
Success rates
with kidney transplants
Success rates at one year:
Mercy Medical Center: 93.3 percent
Iowa Methodist Medical Center: 94.2 percent
UIHC: 97.8 percent
Iowa City VA: 100 percent

Texto completo: Cerca de un centenar de sindicatos, comerciantes, grupos comunitarios y políticos de Nueva York pidieron en una carta abierta a Jeff Bezos, consejero delegado de Amazon, que reconsidere la decisión de no establecerse en Queens, al tiempo que el gobernador Andrew Cuomo indicó que por la misma razón ha conversado con ejecutivos de la empresa.
Los firmantes de la carta aseguran que los neoyorquinos no quieren resignarse a perder 25 mil empleos ni los $28 mil millones de dólares en ingresos de impuestos que el proyecto traería al estado.
La carta, que también firman líderes religiosos, asegura que la mayoría de los neoyorquinos apoyan el proyecto de Amazon.
“Las opiniones en Nueva York son fuertes y a veces estridentes. ¡Consideramos eso parte del encanto de Nueva York!. Pero, cuando nos comprometemos con un proyecto tan importante como éste tratamos de encontrar una solución que funcione para todos “, afirman.
En noviembre el gigante de las ventas al menor por internet informó que establecería dos nuevas sedes, una de ellas en Nueva York, con el apoyo del alcalde Bill de Blasio y el gobernador Cuomo, en oposición a otros líderes demócratas, desatando una batalla en el partido a nivel regional.
Finalmente, tras el rechazo de algunos sectores de la comunidad, activistas y políticos, entre ellos la nueva congresista Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, el 14 de febrero Amazon anunció que desistía de la idea.
Muchos acusaron al gobernador y al alcalde de negociar de espaldas a la comunidad. Las críticas al proyecto fueron principalmente por los $500 millones de dólares de incentivos fiscales y el potencial impacto sobre los servicios públicos.
La carta asegura además que Cuomo se responsabilizará de que el proyecto sea avalado por el parlamento del estado y que el alcalde trabajará junto con el gobernador para atender el proceso de desarrollo en la comunidad.
Desde que Amazon anunció que no continuaría con el proyecto, Cuomo ha mantenido conversaciones con ejecutivos de la compañía en un intento por convencerlos de cambiar de opinión, señaló The New York Times.
Entre los que firman la carta figura el sindicato 32BJ (que representa a trabajadores de limpieza, porteros y encargados de edificios), el presidente y consejero delegado de Mastercard, Ajay Banga, el director ejecutivo de la Corporación para el Desarrollo Económico de Queens, Seth Bernstein, los congresistas demócratas Hakeem Jeffries y Max Rose, y la presidenta de la Universidad pública del Estado (SUNY), Kristina Johnson, informó EFE.
Cuomo señaló esta semana que Amazon debió continuar con sus planes para establecerse en Nueva York “y pelear la oposición”, y aseguró que 70% de los neoyorquinos apoyaban los planes de la empresa.

Texto completo: Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.
ATHENA FILM FESTIVAL at Barnard College (through March 3). This annual event showcases films that are mainly recent and broadly involve the theme of female leadership. Friday night's screening of the Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic "On the Basis of Sex" will be followed by a panel that includes Jane Ginsburg, the justice's daughter, and Daniel Stiepleman, her nephew (and the film's screenwriter). The festival will close with "Knock Down the House," which was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in January. For this documentary, the director, Rachel Lears, trailed four women running in primaries for House seats in the 2018 election. She chose wisely: One of the candidates was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who will be at the screening on Sunday night. It has sold out, but a rush line will form 45 minutes beforehand.

CRAIG BALDWIN at the Metrograph (March 3-4). This experimental filmmaker will appear at the Metrograph for screenings of his movies, which typically use found footage and create paranoia- and science-fiction-tinged fringe takes on history. (Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott likened his "Spectres of the Spectrum," showing on Sunday, to "a 90-minute compendium of conspiracy theories, propounded more or less in earnest and with great urgency.") The lineup even features some "custom-cut" remixes. Separately, Light Industry, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, will host an evening with Baldwin on Wednesday.

FORBIDDEN FRUIT: THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE EXPLOITATION PICTURE at Film Forum (March 1-30). Exploitation films didn't begin with the grindhouse era. This monthlong series celebrates -- in incongruously good-looking restorations -- films of the 1930s and '40s that bucked the Production Code by feigning an educational pretext, Bret Wood, the curator of the program, told The New York Times in 1999. These movies had titles like "Marihuana: Weed With Roots in Hell" (on March 8) and "Sex Madness" (on March 16). Wood, who co-authored a book on the subject, will introduce this weekend's screenings, starting with "Narcotic" (on Friday), a 1933 feature that Film Forum is calling an "almost avant-garde treatise on opium addiction."

WILLIAM FOX PRESENTS: MORE RESTORATIONS AND REDISCOVERIES FROM THE FOX FILM CORPORATION at the Museum of Modern Art (March 1-26). Last year's series on William Fox offered a sampling of the innovation that the studio head brought to Fox Film -- a fostering of artistry that persisted even after he was forced from control of the company in 1930. This sequel retrospective has "Street Angel" (on Friday and March 24), which reunited the director Frank Borzage and the actress Janet Gaynor after their hit "7th Heaven," along with a whopping nine films from John Ford and "Hello, Sister!" (on Sunday and March 16), mostly directed by Erich von Stroheim.

BEN HECHT: FIGHTING WORDS, MOVING PICTURES at the Museum of the Moving Image (March 1-3). A secret screenwriting weapon for Alfred Hitchcock ("Notorious," on Friday), Josef von Sternberg (the silent-era gangland picture "Underworld," on Saturday) and Howard Hawks ("Twentieth Century," on Sunday), Hecht also paid his dues as a newspaperman -- the kind he immortalized (with Charles MacArthur) in "The Front Page." Perhaps the least well-known movies in this retrospective, timed to the release of a new biography on Hecht by Adina Hoffman, are two films Hecht and MacArthur not only wrote but also directed together, "Crime Without Passion" and "The Scoundrel," showing as a doubleheader on Saturday. Both were filmed at the studio where the museum now sits.

RENDEZ-VOUS WITH FRENCH CINEMA at the Film Society of Lincoln Center (through March 10). Francophiles, unite: The Film Society's annual blockbuster series is offering a chance to catch up with nominees from the Césars (the French Oscars, just held on Feb. 22), like "Amanda" (on Saturday and March 9) and "Sink or Swim" (on Saturday and Monday), as well as "Girls of the Sun" (on Friday and Sunday), a 2018 Cannes competition selection that stars Golshifteh Farahani as the leader of a band of Kurdish female fighters and Emmanuelle Bercot as a war correspondent. Those with more auteurist inclinations will want to seek out "Maya" (on Wednesday and Thursday), from Mia Hansen-Love. It is also about a war-zone journalist, but in this case one who takes a sojourn in India to escape the violence. Bruno Dumont's "Coincoin and the Extra-Humans" (on Sunday) is a sequel to his "Li'l Quinquin," a murder mystery that combined his brutal worldview with top notes of Peter Sellers and Jerry Lewis.

OSCAR-WINNING COMPOSER, FORMER PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA MUSIC DIRECTOR, DIES 1929-2019

Texto completo: By the time Andre Previn became music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, he had long rejected the trappings of Hollywood, where he had launched his career.
The four-time Oscar-winning composer had made a decisive switch to the classical music world, conducting the world's great orchestras, performing as a pianist and composing music for the concert hall.
Still, a bit of show business seemed to accompany his time in Pittsburgh. When his PSO tenure started in 1976, billboards announced "Previn!" was in town. Hollywood or not, he was a star, and he delivered a shot of energy into the orchestra and the city.
Andre Previn, the esteemed conductor, composer and pianist, died Thursday morning at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
His death was confirmed by his manager, Linda Petrikova, according to The New York Times.
Mr. Previn's arrival in Pittsburgh was greeted with such enthusiasm that the PSO added Thursday concerts and still sold out the season on subscriptions alone. And his style quickly made an impact, eliciting a transparent, warm sound from the orchestra.
The partnership soon after resulted in the Emmy-nominated show, "Previn and the Pittsburgh," produced by WQED-TV, which featured interviews; performances by the orchestra and Mr. Previn, who was an accomplished jazz and classical pianist; and appearances by guests such as Oscar Peterson, Yo-Yo Ma and Ella Fitzgerald.
Under his baton, the PSO hired several principal musicians, initiated a composer-in-residence program, garnered new recording contracts, and went on international tours for the first time in more than a decade, renewing the PSO's stature both locally and abroad.
Mr. Previn lived on Mount Washington during his time in Pittsburgh. His open-necked white shirt and sleeveless black tunic vest became a trademark of his style, at the same time that his attire raised eyebrows among conservative audience members. In 1980, one New York Times critic wondered whether the brawny Steel City was compatible with the Previn elegance and lightly textured musical style.
As the city's mood and spending power declined with the collapse of the steel industry, attendance at Heinz Hall followed suit. The sold-out houses, further tested by construction in Downtown, sank to 80 percent capacity in the 1982-83 season. The honeymoon was cut short, too, by criticisms of his interpretations and narrow preferences for repertoire of France, England, Russia and Eastern Europe.
The tension came to a head in 1984, when Mr. Previn suddenly resigned after an acrimonious power struggle with PSO managing director Marshall Turkin. He was released from his contract two years early and accepted the music directorship of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, thrusting the PSO into a period of artistic insecurity.
For the man who had spurned Hollywood, Hollywood-level drama thus accompanied his sudden split from Pittsburgh. But the wounds would heal, and he returned to Heinz Hall as a guest conductor, most recently in 2012, when he led the world premiere of his Triple Concerto for Trumpet, Horn and Tuba, featuring three principal musicians.
"I never had a happier eight years," he told The Pittsburgh Press in 1984, after his resignation. "Not only will I never forget the audiences and this great orchestra, those memories will never dim. Things here were as good as I can imagine."
Born in Berlin as Andreas Ludwig Priwin, Mr. Previn studied at the Hochschule fur Musik and the Paris Conservatoire. His Jewish family fled from the Nazis in 1938 and settled in Los Angeles, where, as a teenager, Mr. Previn arranged music for MGM Studios and played chamber music with violinist Joseph Szigeti, according to "Play On," a book about the PSO by Hax McCullough and Mary Brignano.
He studied conducting with Pierre Monteaux while stationed in San Francisco with the U.S. Army. He won four Oscars for his music for "Gigi," "Porgy and Bess," "Irma la Douce" and "My Fair Lady."
He soon tired of the Hollywood world, however, and devoted his focus to classical music.
"I stayed in the movies too long," he told The Press in 1975, after he was named the PSO music director. "Hollywood is a dead-end street. Its music is dictated by the film, and that's the way it has to be. I cut way down in 1960, and have done nothing for the movies since 1964. That's a long time."
In 1963, he made his professional conducting debut with the St. Louis Symphony and held top conducting positions with the Houston Symphony Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, in addition to Pittsburgh and Los Angeles.
Among his numerous prizes, he won lifetime achievement awards from the Kennedy Center and the Recording Academy, having won Grammys in various categories.
He married five times, including to actress Mia Farrow and violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. Mr. Previn's other wives were Betty Bennett, Dory Previn and Heather Hales.
His compositional output included the violin concerto "Anne-Sophie," written for fifth wife Ms. Mutter, whom he divorced in 2006, and the opera "A Streetcar Named Desire," which starred Renee Fleming as Blanche DuBois. He played piano with artists such as Ms. Mutter and cellist Lynn Harrell, and wrote several books about music.
In the twilight of his career, Mr. Previn was asked whether he felt he sometimes spread himself too thin.
"It's been thrown up to me most of my life: 'Why don't I just concentrate on conducting or composing or my own playing or on jazz?'" he replied.
"But the thing is that I'm naturally curious about a lot of different disciplines in music and I enjoy doing them. And as long as people are nice enough to let me, I'll keep on trying."
His motto, according to his website, was "A day without music is a wasted day," and by that mark, he wasted very few of them.
The New York Times and The Associated Press contributed.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump personally ordered his former chief of staff John Kelly to grant a top-secret security clearance to his son-in-law Jared Kushner despite concerns from officials, according to media reports.
The New York Times and Washington Post reported Thursday that Kelly documented Trump's request in a memo. Both outlets cited unnamed sources. USA TODAY has not verified the claims and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said “we don’t comment on security clearances. ”
Trump's directive reportedly took place last year amid concerns from White House officials about Kushner's clearance level. The reports starkly contradict comments the president has made, in which Trump declared he had nothing to do with Kushner's clearance.
The Times reported that former White House Counsel Don McGahn documented his concerns with Kushner's clearance in a memo. The paper said it is unclear exactly what resulted in such concern relating to Kushner's security level.
Kushner, a senior advisor to the president, was granted a permanent clearance in May of last year after almost three months in security limbo.

Responding to the reports of Trump's conduct on Thursday, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , chairman of House Committee on Oversight and Reform, issued a warning to the White House.
He said the committee, which is investigating the security clearance process at the White House, had not received any of the documents they had requested about the security clearances.
"The Committee expects full compliance with its requests a soon as possible, or it may become necessary to consider alternative means to compel compliance," Cummings said.
Cummings on Friday sent a letter to the White House demanding "full and immediate compliance" with the request.
Rep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, also commented late Thursday, saying in a statement that the reports showed Trump's "utter disregard for our national security. "
"There is no nepotism exception for background investigations," he said.
Kushner's lawyer has said previously that his client completed the background check process and that it was held up in part because he neglected to fully account for his contacts with foreign nationals.
"His application was properly submitted, reviewed by career officials and went through the normal process," attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement at the time. "Having completed these processes, Mr. Kushner is looking forward to continuing the work the president has asked him to do. ”
Kushner's permission to view top secret information was revoked in February 2018 after Kelly declared a moratorium on temporary security clearances.
Kushner was the most high-profile of several top White House staffers caught in the aftermath of a scandal involving Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary accused by former wives of domestic violence. Porter's security clearance was held up for almost a year while he worked on an interim clearance — though he continued to have access to almost every classified and unclassified document coming in and out of the Oval Office.
Kelly left his position as Trump's chief of staff at the beginning of the year after a series of internal tensions spilled into public view.

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, Republican who represents Northern Kentucky, has voted with the Democratic-majority House to overturn President Donald Trump's emergency declaration.
Massie was one of just 13 Republican representatives who broke party lines to support the resolution, which aims to prevent the president from circumventing congressional approval to fund the construction of a 234-mile wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
In a statement on Twitter preceding the vote, Massie voiced his intent to support the resolution, saying it is "not an emergency when Congress doesn't spend money how the President wants," despite reiterating his support for the wall.
House Democrats voted unanimously for the resolution, which passed 245-182.
Greater Cincinnati Reps. Steve Chabot, Brad Wenstrup and Warren Davidson – who represent Ohio's 1st, 2nd and 8th congressional districts, respectively – all voted against the measure.
"Unfortunately, the situation on our border is a humanitarian, health, and security crisis," Wenstrup said in a statement.
"Trump is within the authority of his office to declare a national emergency, and this is an emergency that is not over."
Massie, a constitutional conservative, has a history of going against the grain.
In March 2014, he was the only representative to vote against a bill to name Israel a strategic partner.
He was the lone dissenter again in May 2017 when he voted against imposing economic sanctions on North Korea.
The resolution now moves to the Senate floor, where it must receive a majority vote to overturn the president's emergency declaration.
Three Republican senators have voiced their support for the measure so far, according to the New York Times.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate will likely vote on the issue before March 18, CNN reported.

Painter Jasper Johns’ CT home to become artists’ retreat

Texto completo: Jasper Johns, America’s foremost living artist, has no plans to travel to the Broad Museum’s 60-year retrospective of his works in Los Angeles.
At 87 years, Johns recently told The New York Times that “I am not going anywhere.”
The Times reported that his friends say that he prefers to wake up in his own bed in Sharon, Conn., “amid the familiarity of his rambling country estate, to eat tomatoes and lettuce he picks from his garden, to know that he is no longer a guest.”
The show - “Jasper Johns: Something Resembling Truth.” -mixes work from different decades, sometimes on the same wall. It will run through May 13. It features more than extraordinary paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings by one of America's greatest artists. Featuring signature works from the Broad collection with loans from more than 50 international public and private collections, The Broad's presentation marks the first comprehensive survey of Jasper Johns in Southern California in more than 50 years.
It was announced last fall that his house and property will eventually become an artist’s retreat.
The Sharon zoning commission voted unanimously in September to approve the request.
“It is hardly Mr. Johns’s first philanthropic undertaking,” the Times reported. “In 1963, he and the musician John Cage co-founded the Foundation for Contemporary Arts in Manhattan. Just last month, the organization announced its latest raft of grant recipients, some 19 artists who will each receive $40,000. Mr. Johns’s planned residency program in Connecticut, by contrast, will provide up to 24 artists at a time with three-month stays in rustic barns and outbuildings on Mr. Johns’s property. Meals will be communal, in the main house.”

Texto completo: In the early 1980s, Americans were absorbed by the forbidden love of a dashingly handsome Roman Catholic cardinal and the equally beguiling woman with whom he'd fathered a child.
Would the cleric, Ralph de Bricassart, renounce his holy orders and forego the riches and power of his position at the Vatican for the love of a woman? Would he join his beloved Meggie Cleary and her son, the young man he adored, who was in fact his son, too?
Alas, "The Thorn Birds" was a television miniseries, after "Roots" the most watched of its time.
The romance was so alluring because the love was forbidden. Yet even to my then young Catholic mind it seemed quite plausible. Of course priests sometimes violate the discipline of celibate chastity, fall in love and desire a family.
This past week (Feb. 18), the Vatican made a telling admission that the church has guidelines for what to do with "children of the ordained" - and, as the New York Times reported, those guidelines are secret.
Wouldn't it seem, at this point, that there should be no more big revelations about sex that the church needs to admit?
No, we're not there yet.
The Times published the revelation just days before the Vatican opened a three-day summit of the presidents of the world's bishops' conferences in Rome (Feb. 21 to 24). The reason for the gathering? To address the global sexual abuse scandal involving priests.
How many children, acknowledged or not, have priests fathered? It's impossible to say, but most reporters who have delved deeply into the church's sex scandals know of such children. I do.
There have always been ethical dilemmas in reporting about such unions. Revealing much about a mother would risk exposing the child's identity. Proving paternity without the cooperation of the father would be extremely difficult. And it should not be surprising that many priest-fathers emphatically do not want to admit paternity and accept the responsibilities that come with it.
A child whose father is a priest has a right to know that father and have his love and support. Indeed, as the Times reported, the church guidelines stressed that the "fundamental principle" was the "protection of the child." But in too many cases, recognition of paternity - much less love and protection - has not been given.
The Times quoted a canon lawyer in Rome who said that there is "zero" obligation in canon law for a man to leave the priesthood because he has fathered a child. "As it is not a canonical crime, there are no grounds for dismissal," said Laura Sgro.
Here is yet another example of the Catholic Church's unwillingness to deal honestly and openly with this most basic aspect of being human, sexuality.
Rapes of nuns by priests have been covered up and denied no doubt out of fear of scandal. Pedophilia has been widely covered up for the same reason, but also out of a shocking and reprehensible failure on the part of church authorities to understand these acts as crimes. In the course of cases being exposed and investigated, it is clear that many Catholic bishops don't grasp that there is a difference between homosexuality and sexually assaulting children.
The failure to admit the active sex lives of its clergy - the church's seemingly instinctive reflex to shroud them in shame and secrecy - is at the root of so many of the horrific abuses of power by the hierarchy. The same impulse that drives the church to cover up sex crimes urges them to cover up more benign sex acts most of us recognize as peccadillos, or just facts of life.
Not much is expected from the meeting in Rome. These ecclesiastical gatherings often feel disconnected from and irrelevant to the day-to-day lives of most Catholics.
The hierarchy's challenge is to close that space openly and honestly. They can start by admitting that they are all too human.

Patrick Caddell, prominent former pollster, dies at 68

Texto completo: The nation, Patrick Caddell once told the Globe, “is a very different place than it was two years ago or five years ago. Much less 10 years ago."
The year was 1975 and he was only 25 — not long out of Harvard University and speaking in the Cambridge office of his polling firm, Cambridge Survey Research — though some of his observations then might easily have found a home in subsequent eras.
“Consider the basic values which not long ago were almost inviolate, but in recent times have been seriously questioned, if not destroyed," he said.
Mr. Caddell, who launched his polling firm while he was a Harvard student and went on to work for some of the most memorable Democratic candidates of the 1970s and '80s, died Feb. 16 in Charleston, S.C., of complications from a stroke. He was 68.
His colleague Kendra Stewart, a political science professor at the College of Charleston, confirmed Mr. Caddell's death to media organizations.
With a presence as unforgettable as his polling, Mr. Caddell was “a bear of a man, in a body without angles, brooding dark eyes staring out from a broad face mostly camouflaged by a full beard, with its distinctive stripe of white hair running from the right side of his chin up to the right corner of a mouth that is seldom silent," the Globe's Walter V. Robinson wrote in 1984.
While still in his mid-20s, Mr. Caddell achieved political prominence though his work helping to elect Jimmy Carter president in 1976.
“Pat Caddell was a brilliant pollster who at a young age provided me with key information and over his career helped to shape the future of professional research," Carter said in a statement released by a spokeswoman. “Rosalynn and I are grateful for his counsel in our campaigns and while we were in the White House."
As a Harvard senior, Mr. Caddell began conducting polling for Senator George McGovern, when the South Dakota Democrat was competing in primaries during his failed 1972 presidential bid.
Over the years, Mr. Caddell also worked on campaigns for then-US Senators Gary Hart of Colorado and Joe Biden of Delaware, including during their respective presidential campaigns in 1984 and 1988.
In Massachusetts, Mr. Caddell's political clients included Michael S. Dukakis, when he took a step toward regaining the governor's office by defeating then-Governor Edward J. King in the 1982 Democratic primary.
In a 1984 Globe interview, John Marttila, a Boston-based campaign manager and strategist who died last November, called Mr. Caddell “the best broad strategic thinker in the business. He has truly brilliant insight."
Carter's 1976 election was arguably Mr. Caddell's greatest success, and one particular piece of later advice to the president was also historic. In 1979, when the economy was faltering and the energy crisis had led to long lines at gasoline stations, Mr. Caddell advised Carter to speak to the nation. On TV, Carter gave what became known as the “malaise" speech, though he never used that word.
In more recent years, Mr. Caddell had grown disillusioned with the Democratic Party and had appeared on Fox News as a commentator. Democrats, Mr. Caddell once said, were no longer the “party of the people."
The New York Times reported that Mr. Caddell had also been an adviser to Stephen Bannon, a former leader of the conservative Breitbart News organization who served as the chief White House strategist during President Trump's early months in office.
Throughout Mr. Caddell's life, an unstinting belief in his convictions had fueled such restless energy that he sometimes never seemed to stay still.
“It isn't that Patrick moves too fast," one of his friends told the Globe in 1984. “It's just that the rest of the world moves too slowly."
Born in Rock Hill, S.C., in 1950, Patrick Hayward Caddell was a son of Janie Burns and Newton Caddell.
His father, a Coast Guard officer, was from Massachusetts, according to “The Permanent Campaign," a 1980 book by Sidney Blumenthal that was excerpted in the Globe Sunday Magazine, prior to publication.
Mr. Caddell spent some of his childhood on Cape Cod, where his family would go to Otis Air Force Base to be among those greeting John F. Kennedy when his plane landed.
After Mr. Caddell's family moved to Florida, he made his first foray into politics in 1968, while in high school in Jacksonville.
“I hated math, but I loved statistics, so I decided to do a project predicting the outcome of local elections," he recalled in the 1975 Globe interview.
“The local paper did a story about me, then the speaker of the House in Florida hired me to do some work for him," Mr. Caddell said. “In those days, I could do a poll for $200 because I'd hire my classmates to help."
He went to Harvard and graduated in 1972 with a bachelor's degree in political science. During his senior year, he launched the Cambridge Survey Research polling firm. The fall of his senior year, he began conducting polling for McGovern's campaign.
Mr. Caddell's work on campaigns drew admirers and detractors. Jack Beatty, a longtime senior editor at The Atlantic, suggested that the term “Caddellism" should be added to political dictionaries.
“Caddellism differs from conventional political merchandising in a radical way," Beatty wrote in the Globe in 1984. “It does not merely emboss a candidate's political identity but invents one for him, investing him with an aura of mystery that makes him seem all things to all people. Practitioners of Caddellism poll the public not to see whether it likes candidate X, but to discover its ideal candidate and then tailor someone to that ideal."
Others said Mr. Caddell's forceful energy could often come off as too aggressive.
“He hasn't learned the art of schmoozing," Frank Mankiewicz, the late former NPR president, told the Globe in 1984.
“He's like a lot of people who make it very young: He's certainly had a late adolescence," said Mankiewicz. “When you're polling at 21 for a presidential campaign, you're missing something. Maybe those are the years when you normally acquire the social graces that make you less abrasive."
Mr. Caddell said for Blumenthal's 1980 book that “it's a little schizophrenic being younger. You have to act like a grownup even at times when you're not. Growing up when you have to be grownup in a political sense is a little difficult to balance."
The New York Times reported that Mr. Caddell leaves a daughter, Heidi Caddell Eichelberger; a brother, Daniel; a sister, Patricia Roberts; and three grandchildren.
Among Mr. Caddell's lasting contributions to politics was a 10,000-word memo he wrote to Carter a month after his election in 1976, laying out the need for a permanent campaign. The theory provided the title for Blumenthal's book and a blueprint for many future politicians.
“It is important to recognize we cannot successfully separate politics and government," Mr. Caddell wrote, adding that “essentially, it is my thesis that governing with public approval requires a continuing political campaign."

Texto completo: The Pat Conroy Literary Center will hold its third annual March Forth day of learning from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. March 3 at the Frissell Community House at Penn Center.
Commemorating the anniversary of Pat Conroy's death, March Forth is a day-long embrace of nature, education and fellowship among writers and readers honoring the author's last act as a teacher: his burial site on St. Helena Island.
The lineup includes New York Times best-selling novelist Nic Stone, civil rights leader Cleveland Sellers and his biographer Adam Parker, and "Our Prince of Scribes: Writers Remember Pat Conroy" contributing writers Cassandra King Conroy, Tim Conroy, Jonathan Haupt, Ellen Malphrus, Sallie Ann Robinson and Valerie Sayers.
There also will be a guided nature walk led by master naturalists Chris Marsh of the Spring Island Trust and Lowcountry Institute and Bob Speare of Hilton Head Audubon, and catered lunches available for advance purchase from Debbi Covington.
This event is sponsored by a gift from Erin and Matt Devlin and presented by the Pat Conroy Literary Center in partnership with Penn Center.
Seating is limited and last year's event sold out. All-day admission to is $22 with four box lunch options for an additional $18. Tickets are available at https://marchforth2019.brownpapertickets.com.
This year's events also include a trio of school visits by Stone on March 4, including an assembly at Beaufort High
School, where students have been reading and discussing Stone's acclaimed social justice-themed novel "Dear Martin."
About the presenters
Cassandra King Conroy is the award-winning author of five novels, a book of nonfiction, numerous short stories and magazine articles, most recently in Coastal Living and Southern Living. Honored as a 2017 Alabama Humanities Foundation Fellow, Conroy is working on a memoir about life with her late husband Pat.
Tim Conroy is a former special education teacher and school administrator. He is the author of the debut poetry collection "Theologies of Terrain."
Jonathan Haupt is executive director of the Pat Conroy Literary Center and the co-editor (with novelist Nicole Seitz) of "Our Prince of Scribes: Writers Remember Pat Conroy."
Ellen Malphrus is the writer in residence at the University of South Carolina Beaufort, where she teaches literature and creative writing. She is the author of the novel "Untying the Moon."
Charleston Post & Courier journalist Adam Parker is a longtime student of the civil rights movement and race in America, and he has written extensively about the African-American experience. "Outside Agitator: The Civil Rights Struggle of Cleveland Sellers Jr." is his first book.
One of Pat Conroy's Daufuskie Island students, Sallie Ann Robinson is a celebrity chef, tour guide, author of two cookbooks, and coauthor of "Daufuskie Island" in the "Images of America" series. She appears as Ethel in Conroy's memoir "The Water Is Wide."
The William R. Kenan Jr. professor of English at the University of Notre Dame, Valerie Sayers is the author of six novels, most recently "The Powers," a two-time winner of the Pushcart Prize, and a 2018 inductee in the South Carolina Academy of Authors, the state's literary hall of fame.

NYT V. Sullivan More Important Than Ever Before

Texto completo: In calling for a re-examination of the landmark case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas adopted an unduly generous view of the conduct of local and state governments regarding free press rights under the First Amendment.
The Supreme Court decided Sullivan in 1964, after a federal district court in Alabama found that a civil rights organization’s ad in the New York Times had damaged the reputation of an Alabama sheriff who was identified by implication in the ad.
Sullivan established a higher standard for public officials and public figures to prove defamation of character. They would have to prove actual malice on the part of the accused defamer, that the publication had acted with “reckless disregard for the truth.”
Thomas, in an opinion related to a case in which one of Bill Cosby’s sexual assault victims had sued him for defamation, said the Founders did not deal specifically with the status of public officials or public figures when crafting the First Amendment.
“The states,” he wrote, “are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm.”
Well, they might be capable of it but there is abundant evidence that they did not do so prior to the Sullivan decision. Public officials in Southern states regularly used libel suits to stifle press coverage of the civil rights movement. At the time of Sullivan, suits seeking more than $300 million in damages were pending in Southern state courts over such coverage.
Thomas accused his predecessors of, basically, making up the decision as a matter of public policy rather than of constitutional law.
But Justice William Brennan, who wrote the Sullivan opinion, said the First Amendment’s press freedom guarantee represented the Founders’ “commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.”
It is extraordinarily naïve to believe that many public officials would attack the press for routine news coverage in the absence of Sullivan. President Donald Trump has said as much, including even satire such as that on “Saturday Night Live.”
Sullivan is not just constitutionally valid; it is more important than ever.

THE REAL THREAT ON OUR ROADS WHY U.S. CITIES ARE BECOMING MORE DANGEROUS FOR CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS

Texto completo: As cities strive to improve the quality of life for their residents, many are working to promote walking and biking. Such policies make sense, since they can, in the long run, lead to less traffic, cleaner air and healthier people. But the results aren't all positive, especially in the short to medium term.
In Washington, D.C., for example, traffic fatalities as a whole declined in 2018 compared to the year before, but the number of pedestrian and bicyclist deaths increased by 20 percent. Pedestrian deaths also have risen in New York, and pedestrian and cycling fatalities have increased in Los Angeles in the past several years.
Across the nation, cyclist fatalities have increased by 25 percent since 2010 and pedestrian deaths have risen by a staggering 45 percent. More people are being killed because cities are encouraging residents to walk and bike, but their roads are still dominated by fast-moving vehicular traffic. As my research has shown, this shifting mix can be deadly.
The long decline in traffic fatalities
From a long-term perspective, traffic fatalities in the United States are declining. In the early 1970s, almost 55,000 Americans were killed in traffic accidents yearly, including people in vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists. By 2017, that figure had fallen to around 40,000, even with an increase in the number of vehicle miles driven.
The overall decline is a confirmation of Smeed's Law, named after R.J. Smeed, a scholar at the United Kingdom's Road Research Laboratory. Smeed found that initially, with the early introduction of motor vehicles, traffic deaths tend to rise. Around the world, almost 1.35 million people die each year in traffic accidents, but 93 percent of those fatalities occur in low- and middle- income countries where mass vehicle usage is a recent phenomenon.
As manufacturers produce safer vehicles, cities improve roads and drivers become more adept, fatalities tend to decline. But Smeed's Law only seems to hold up for people in cars -not for other road users.
A global status report shows that road traffic injuries are now the single biggest cause of death for children and young adults, and that more than half of all traffic deaths are pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists. In the United States, driver fatalities fell from 27,348 in 2006 to 23,611 in 2017, but pedestrian and cyclist fatalities increased from 5,567 to 6,760.
The vehicle-centric city
Modern U.S. cities are designed largely for motor vehicles. At the turn of the 19th century, people and cars shared city streets, which served as places for children to play, adults to walk and neighbors to meet. From the 1900s to the early 1930s, a battle was fought as motor vehicles became increasingly dominant. As traffic fatalities rose, angry mobs dragged reckless drivers from their cars, and some cities printed "murder maps" showing where people had been killed in traffic.
However, automotive interests won out. From the 1950s forward, city streets lost their conviviality. Roads were engineered for fast-moving and unhindered vehicular traffic, with few pedestrian crossings or bike lanes.
Even today, motorists in many cities are able to turn onto streets at intersections where pedestrians are also crossing. Most pedestrians and bicyclists are killed or injured while they are obeying the law.
A new Wild West
In the 21st century, a new city ideal has emerged of a more bike-friendly, walking-oriented city. But piecemeal implementation of bike lanes, pedestrianized zones and traffic-calming measures often just adds to the confusion.
Many bike lanes and pedestrianized zones only extend for short distances. Most American drivers have yet to fully appreciate that urban streets are to be shared. And even in the best of times, cars and trucks are not good at sharing the road. Vehicle drivers are often moving too fast to identify and respond to pedestrians and bicyclists. Blind spots for drivers can be death traps for other road users.
Then there's the asymmetry. Drivers are operating fast-moving lethal weapons, and are encased in a protective shield. And speed literally kills. A car hitting a pedestrian at 36 to 45 mph per hour is four times more likely to cause death than a vehicle traveling between 26 to 30 mph.
Adding to the dangers are distracted drivers and pedestrians and the introduction of electric scooters. Some observers also believe an epidemic of narcissism is causing more aggressive driving.
All of these factors are making walking and bicycling more dangerous. While pedestrian deaths in Norway declined by 37 percent from 2010 to 2016, in the United States they increased by 39 percent. Non-driver traffic fatalities are increasing in the United States at higher rates than most other wealthy nations.
A better vision
Vision Zero, a strategy first proposed in Sweden in 1997, imagines cities with no traffic fatalities or serious injuries. At least 18 U.S. cities and states have signed on to reach that goal by 2024, including Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington, D.C.
Strategies vary from one city to another. Boston, for example, has reduced the city speed limit from 30 miles per hour to 25 mph. Washington, D.C. is improving 36 intersections that pose threats to pedestrians and enacting more bicycle-friendly policies. These cities still have far to go, but they are moving in the right direction.
There are many more options. Manufacturers can make vehicles less threatening to pedestrians and bicyclists by reducing the height of front bumpers. And cities can make streets safer with a combination of speed limit reductions, traffic-calming measures, "road diets" for neighborhoods that limit traffic speed and volume, and better education for all road users.
Initiatives to create more pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly infrastructure should also be sensitive to social and class differences that may shape local priorities. And advocates contend that shifting to autonomous vehicles could make streets safer, although the verdict is still out on this claim.
The most radical shift will require not only re-engineering urban traffic, but also reimagining our cities. In my view, we need to think of them as shared spaces with slower traffic, and see neighborhood streets as places to live in and share, not just to drive through at high speed.
John Rennie Short is a public policy professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. He wrote this for The Conversation.com.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Monday that an American oil worker who was abducted in Yemen in 2017 had been reunited with his wife and children.
Danny Burch, a Texas man, was kidnapped on a busy street in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, according to a 2017 New York Times story. Yemen has been locked in civil war since 2015.
“It is my honor today to announce that Danny Burch, a United States citizen who has been held hostage in Yemen for 18 months, has been recovered and reunited with his wife and children," Trump tweeted from Air Force One as he traveled to Vietnam for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
The State Department confirmed Burch's release, saying he was freed last week. But officials declined to say when or where he was reunited with his family. "Out of respect for the family’s privacy and for their security, we will not comment on their current condition or location," a State Department spokesperson said.
The Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, controlled the area where Burch was seized, although it's not clear why he was taken or by whom. The Yemen conflict has become a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
Burch was living and working in Yemen at the time of his capture. He had married a Yemeni woman, and his wife told the Times that he disappeared "in broad daylight" after dropping their three children off at a sports club.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday that the United Arab Emirates had played a key role in securing Burch's release.
"In 2017, U. S. citizen Danny Burch was taken hostage from Sanaa, Yemen. Today he is safe and secure, and is reunited with his wife and children," Pompeo said in a statement. "The family has asked for privacy as they recover from this ordeal. "
"Danny’s recovery reflects the best of what the United States & its partners can accomplish," Trump wrote in his tweet.

Texto completo: Earlier this month, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chair of the Senate's Finance Committee, and Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, penned a commentary in USA Today telling Americans they've got it all wrong when it comes to the Republican tax reform and their own personal finances. If you received a surprisingly small tax refund for 2018, don't you worry. You received the money last year, when you got paid. "Since many workers and their families live paycheck-to-paycheck, getting at least some of their tax cut in advance rather than delaying it a year is a life saver," they wrote. Besides, they added, "You get to control your money. Not the IRS."
Note to Republicans: When you need to scold Americans on how they handle their money, you lose, even if you've got a point. Tax refunds are down more than $5 billion from this time last year, according to an analysis performed by Investor's Business Daily. People are squawking -- on Instagram, on Twitter and/or to any reporter who will listen to them. Republicans assumed Americans would become converts when they saw they were getting a slightly bigger paycheck, after withholding tables were recalculated in early 2018. They assumed wrong.
First, most people never noticed they were receiving more money in their regular take-home paycheck. This isn't because they like or dislike President Donald Trump. It's because there's plenty of evidence that small tax cuts -- the typical middle-income filer received a break of less than $20 a week -- often go unnoticed. The same thing happened when Barack Obama enacted a temporary tax cut early in his presidency. According to a New York Times-CBS News poll conducted in 2010, more than a year after Americans should have been seeing an increase in take-home pay, a solid majority of people had no clue they'd received a tax rollback. More people, in fact, thought their taxes had increased than decreased.
Second, taking a tax refund is not a financially optimal decision, and one that many personal-finance gurus howl about every year, but people like it. The reason for that is rooted in human psychology. Tax refunds work as a form of forced savings for many people, a way of making themselves put money aside for post-holiday bills, vacations or a household repair. Yes, they could set up a savings strategy themselves, but that would leave it there, forever available to spend on a passing fancy or immediate need. More relevant: Many people don't get around to setting aside dollars. They spend their money as it comes in. As a result, they rely on their tax refund. They would, apparently, prefer to receive something like a lump sum of $2,135, the average tax refund received in 2018 for a 2017 return. (About 75 percent of all filers got refunds in recent years.) Real estate -- if you don't take the money out in the form of a second mortgage or refinancing -- works in a similar fashion. It's an expensive savings vehicle, but it's a savings strategy nonetheless, something that accounts for the fact that for many Americans, their home is their main source of wealth.
This behavior around tax refunds, contra congressional Republicans, is not a surrender of control. It's knowing your weaknesses and making them work for you. People plan on their refunds and react to them in unsurprising ways. According to the recent paper, "Tax Refund Expectations and Financial Behavior," when low- and moderate-income filers receive the refund they expect, they use about 15 percent of it to pay down debt. An unexpected refund, on the hand, leads to increased spending and debt.
Finally, as millions of Americans grapple with their smaller-than-expected refunds, they are hearing more and more about the big winner of the tax-reform scam: corporate America. Amazon (whose founder, Jeff Bezos, is the owner of The Washington Post) owed zero in corporate income tax last year. And as Axios reported recently, General Motors, which made $11.8 billion in profit last year, filed for a refund of slightly more than $100 million.
There is no argument the Republicans can come up with to get around this reality. It's not just that getting into arguments with people about human nature is a loser's game. It's that the GOP tax scam was always designed to benefit one group and one group only -- the richest and wealthiest among us. Remember when Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., claimed, "My donors are basically saying, 'Get it done or don't ever call me again'"? It's why they pushed their reform effort as hard as they did. The refund imbroglio is bringing this point home to voters once again. Little wonder majorities of Americans say they support raising taxes on the highest earners and the wealthiest Americans. They know they've been had.

Texto completo: Mr. Del Real is one of a team of New York Times journalists currently deployed along the border. Each week they'll be sharing a slice of their reporting about the border and the people who spend time on both sides of it in the weekly newsletter, Crossing the Border . This dispatch is from Calexico, Calif., and Mexicali, Mexico.
When Brian Posada was growing up in the Mexican border city of Mexicali, the other children would tease him about his name. "Brian," the name, was so American; Brian, the boy, never identified that way. He had been born in Las Vegas, yes, but he lived there for just one year with his undocumented mother before moving with her back to Mexico. He never learned English.
These days, Mr. Posada, 19, sees things differently. He makes the short trip between his two lives several times a week, crossing from Mexicali, where he still lives, over a broad walkway to the California border town of Calexico, where he sees his future.
I walked home with him one day last week, beginning in Calexico's overcast downtown plaza, within sight of the border fence. Music blasted loudly in Spanish from a nearby stereo store. As he pushed past the turnstile to cross into Mexico, Mr. Posada gazed quietly at the farm workers on their way back to Mexico from American field jobs, their faces worn and muddy.
In Mexicali, his tone turned a bit caustic. He averted his gaze from indigent seniors splayed out on the ground asking for money. He pointed at the irony of a church situated next door to a brothel.
"This is what you'll find here," he said. "Poverty, drugs and prostitution."
If his feelings toward his American citizenship had been fraught in the past, adulthood clarified a few things. He began to wonder what it meant that he was technically American, what opportunities might be open. He started working toward an American high school equivalency diploma, though he admits his lack of English proficiency remains a significant obstacle.
"My mom told me a short time ago, 'Look, I couldn't give you nice things like other people have. But I gave you American citizenship, which is what so many people are fighting for,"' he said.
He recognizes that now. "But I feel Mexican, I'm not going to lie to you," he said.
When he turned 18, seeking a foothold to life in the United States, Mr. Posada got a job at one of the nearby farms that supply a large portion of Americans' winter vegetables. It was backbreaking work. He would awaken at 1 a.m. and cross the border with other migrant farmworkers and begin picking by 3. He saw the physical toll the work had taken on Mexican men who had done it for decades.
That was not the future he wanted, he thought. "It's a job that kills you."
Now, he has a job registering low-income residents of Calexico for government-funded wireless plans on cellphones once colloquially known as "Obama phones." Because nearly everyone in Calexico speaks Spanish, Mr. Posada can do the job without language getting in the way.
But it's a competitive business in a poor area like Calexico, and not necessarily lucrative for people like Mr. Posada, who works on commission. On the day that we met up, he had signed up two customers, making $20 for a day's work.
We crossed back into Mexicali to meet with a friend of his at the Plaza la Cachanilla, a mall with clothing stores, piercing stands and anime shops. His friend, Ivan, is also Mexican and speaks good English. He agreed to help Mr. Posada draw up a study plan to work on the diploma coursework. They'd work together, he offered.
"How's that? He's Mexican, but he can speak English," Mr. Posada said, smiling toward his friend. "Hopefully he can help me."
As I waited for a taxi to head back across the border, I shouted to him, "See you soon!"
He asked me to say it again. Then one more time after that. He repeated the words to himself a few times under his breath, then grinned. "See you soon!" he yelled back.

A change to libel law could backfire on President Trump

Texto completo: Is Justice Clarence Thomas joining President Donald Trump's war on news media?
Trump's near-constant complaints about the "fake news" media received an unexpected boost Wednesday. In a solo opinion, Justice Thomas said the high court should make it easier for public figures to sue for libel.
Sure, it might not get anywhere. But it could.
His argument is not totally without merit. The late Justice Antonin Scalia, with whom Thomas occupied the conservative end of the high court, also criticized the landmark 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan decision that sharply limited defamation claims in state court by famous people.
Trump has said since his days as a candidate in 2016 that we should "open up" libel laws so politicians could sue the networks and big newspapers for "fake news," which, as we have learned through ample experience, he tends to define as stories that he doesn't like.
And Trump doesn't confine his wrath to straight news coverage. Earlier in the week, for example, he tweeted his wrath against NBC's "Saturday Night Live," a program that, by the way, our former reality TV star has hosted twice and criticized many times.
This time Trump found "Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC!" Then he asked, "how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution? Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real collusion!"
Really? "Retribution?"
Ah, how our president must envy the sweeping powers of his despotic pals such as the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan or Russia's Vladimir Putin. Those guys know how to rid themselves of critics without necessarily bothering to stop in a courtroom.
We're not there yet. But if the right case comes along and let's say Trump's two appointees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, agree with Thomas' or Scalia's views, they could help to ring a death knell for a long-standing and very important protection of free speech and political news coverage.
At issue is an appropriate case to discuss during African-American History Month. L.B. Sullivan, an Alabama county commissioner, had sued The New York Times over an advertisement it published that sought funding for Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights campaign. Sullivan claimed to be defamed, even though the ad did not mention his name, because it described police abuses and an "unprecedented wave of terror." Alabama courts awarded him $500,000 in damages, a ruling unanimously reversed by the Supreme Court.
The justices set a higher standard for suing public officials, partly to protect the ability of the national press to cover the civil rights movement in the segregated South without crippling libel verdicts.
But Thomas says the court made a mistake in 1964 when it set a high barrier for public officials allegedly defamed by a story, a standard that later was expanded to include famous individuals and other, less-famous people who inject themselves into big news stories.
The ruling calls for public officials seeking damages to show the news publishers knew the report was false or otherwise displayed a "reckless disregard" for the truth.
But Thomas believes the states can set their own standards for libel without federal intrusion. The Sullivan case was wrongly decided, he said, describing it as "policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law."
He may have a technical point in saying the court was legislating from the bench, not just "calling balls and strikes," as Chief Justice John Roberts has described the proper role of the high court.
But, as in the court's landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation decision -- which Thomas, among other conservatives, also has criticized -- even if they had the wrong reasoning, the justices did the right thing.
The Sullivan ruling puts a lid on the ability of offended public officials to harass or intimidate legitimate news organizations or use frivolous lawsuits to publicize themselves or their own interests.
Besides, Trump in his rage may be forgetting that libel suits cut both ways. Imagine "Crooked Hillary" Clinton, "Lyin' Ted" Cruz and the multitude of other figures, pubic or otherwise, whom he has insulted with colorful slurs to the delight of his base.
This is the president whose false or misleading claims topped 5,000 in his first two years, according to a Washington Post tally -- and we, the voters, hardly even blink anymore when we hear that number.
Twitter-loving Trump is well familiar with the need to keep speech and the media as free as possible to express their views. Trump can dish criticism out. He needs to learn how to take it. That's the American way.

Texto completo: Joe Iconis exploded out of N.Y.U. on a wave of hope. A songwriter with a knack for story and a taste for strange, he won the Jonathan Larson grant for early career composers. He scooped up the Kleban prize for most promising lyricist. He was hailed by Newsday as "ginormously talented."
The descriptors piled up until they made no sense any more. Emerging. Rising. Up-and-coming.
But something wasn't clicking. Year after year he wrote song after song, show after show. Small-scale productions came and went; big-time producers did not.
He sustained himself on determination. And side jobs. And borrowed money.
But mostly, he sustained himself with an unusual artistic collective -- the Family, an evolving cohort of multitalented misfits (their word) -- that, for more than a decade, has plied basements and barns, singing Mr. Iconis's rock- and pop-influenced songs to a growing audience of fans.
It is fandom that is finally propelling Mr. Iconis to Broadway.
The sci-fi high school musical "Be More Chill," for which he wrote music and lyrics, was left for dead in New Jersey after a tepid review from The New York Times. Resurrection has come thanks to young enthusiasts, who created YouTube videos using the show's music, shared fan art on Tumblr, and have streamed the cast album more than 200 million times.
The show, adapted from a young adult novel by Ned Vizzini about a nerdy teenager who swallows a pill-sized supercomputer that promises to improve his life, is now in previews at the Lyceum Theater; about half the cast are performers who are part of Mr. Iconis's crew.
Now he is spending his nights where he has long wanted to be, in the row of creators cradling laptops and binders at the back of a Broadway theater, polishing the show before it opens March 10. On his right forearm he sports a tattoo of a mule. "Hairy and stubborn," he explains. "Just like me."
Mr. Iconis, 37, says his life changed forever when, as a 6-year-old growing up on Long Island, he saw his first Off Broadway musical: the original production of "Little Shop of Horrors," a zany rock romp about a blood-craving, flesh-eating houseplant. "I was a little kid who was really scared -- I would always cry in movies, and I never wanted to be away from my parents," he said. "But 'Little Shop' didn't scare me. It made me feel alive."
Each year for his birthday, and sometimes on holidays, he would see another show. He tracked theater seasons by reading newspaper ads; he tried to estimate box office grosses by calling ticket sellers to ask about seat availability.
He loved theater. But he hated performing. "I was always terrible," he said. "I knew I was terrible. And it terrified me."
So he took to the piano, writing songs, directing shows, doing anything that allowed him to make theater without being center stage. "I both gravitate toward and identify with people who feel like they don't quite fit in," he said. In college and grad school, both at New York University, he zeroed in on writing, and for his thesis in 2005, he crafted a musical about a garage band, "The Black Suits," that seemed to have promise.
"I thought, 'This show will be produced Off Broadway, it will be well received, it will go to Broadway, and this is how I will enter into the musical theater world,"' he said.
The universe had other ideas. And Mr. Iconis, a prolific writer, was impatient to get his songs heard.
So in 2006 he staged a concert at Ars Nova, a small but prestigious theater that seeks to develop early-career artists. He thought of "Things to Ruin," as he called it, as a theatrical version of a rock album that never existed. He was the de facto frontman, playing the piano and occasionally singing, and he found that he now relished that. But his shows were also a showcase for his friends.
The cabaret scene in New York was dominated by solo acts and celebrities, but Mr. Iconis wanted something different -- a sort of troupe of troubadours, most of them unknown. He had inspirations in mind -- the filmmaker Robert Altman, for one, but also the Muppets, because, in Mr. Iconis's fervid imagination, they are the model of an ensemble that successfully integrates friendship and theatermaking.
There were maybe 10 participants to start -- among them Jason Tam and Jason SweetTooth Williams, both of whom are in the cast of "Be More Chill," Mr. Tam as the Squip (that's the supercomputer) and Mr. Williams in three roles, including a high school drama teacher.

By last Christmas, when Joe Iconis and Friends performed what are now their annual Christmas shows at Feinstein's/54 Below, directed by his longtime collaborator John Simpkins, there were 65 performers -- onstage, interspersed among the audience, even caroling in the bathrooms.
"We were a bunch of rambunctious punk kids that loved musical theater but maybe didn't quite fit into the quintessential musical theater mold," Mr. Tam said. "But we found each other and we found Joe Iconis."
Many of his songs are clever and raw, like "Everybody's at the Bar Without Me," a furious ballad about feeling left out, and "The Goodbye Song," the raucous singalong which closes most shows, inspired by a dying father bidding farewell to his child, but also weaving in affectionate allusions to E.T.'s return home in the great 1982 Spielberg movie.
In the early years, the concerts were mostly at the Laurie Beechman Theater, a basement space underneath a Times Square restaurant, and at Joe's Pub, part of the Public Theater. In recent years, the main performances have been over Labor Day weekend at Barrington Stage Company in the Berkshires, and in December with a series of Christmas-themed shows at 54 Below, but there have been lots of others -- even a private party attended by James Earl Jones.
"It feels like this crazy circus that has followed him and helped put the music out there and spread the word about what he does," said Lauren Marcus, who met Mr. Iconis when she was at N.Y.U., sang in one of his earliest concerts, and then married him at a ceremony followed by a jamboree.
The performances are silly and celebratory and self-referential. The recent Christmas show included jokes about "making people go viral" (an allusion to "Be More Chill"), and managed to be at once ever-so-winkingly politically incorrect and super-woke. ("Baby, It's Cold Outside" featured an interpolated exchange between the two performers about the gender politics of the song.)
Over the years, artists have come, and gone, and come again. "The more I met people, the more it started to become this idea -- like I'm driving a bus, and I would tell people to hop on, and they could stay as long as they want to," Mr. Iconis said. "The whole Family idea is loose enough to accommodate the lives of working artists -- it needed to allow people to come and go as their life allowed."
Some are on Broadway -- Eric William Morris, a longtime member of the Family who portrays an addled bartender in the Christmas shows, is now starring in a musical adaptation of "King Kong" -- but many, like Mr. Iconis, have long been waiting for a big break.
"We shared that feeling -- when is this going to happen, and should we just go be investment bankers?" Mr. Williams said. "What got him and all of us through these struggling times were these concerts that we did together."
There's been some blowback. "I definitely have a reputation of being very loyal, and that's important to me -- I love creating art with artists I have a history and a relationship with," Mr. Iconis said. "But there was this notion of me as a frat boy working with his college friends. People got so insane about this idea of me just working with my buds."
He is unapologetic about wanting to advance his collaborators, and not simply allow them to be replaced by "someone who was on a TV show in 2003," which is how he often sees theater casting. "Many people have performed my stuff brilliantly for years, and I feel like it's my responsibility to do whatever I can to help," he said.
George Salazar, an actor who was featured in a Broadway revival of "Godspell" when he met Mr. Iconis, started singing in his concerts, and is now starring in "Be More Chill" as the protagonist's best friend; his emotional rendition of the show's big number, "Michael in the Bathroom," has made him an internet sensation.
"The Family is a group of misfits," Mr. Salazar said, "but the things that make us strange and different are the very things Joe enjoys."
Mr. Iconis likes to write in public spaces -- coffee shops and bars -- away from the piano, focusing on lyric and drama, and letting that drive melody. He has been prolific, helping to create 10 full-length musicals, but has also been increasingly disappointed that none found commercial success, and at times has even wondered whether he should try to convert one of his side jobs, graphic design, into a full-time career.
"He's had a tough time getting shows on, because people don't know where to place his shows -- they have a childlike exuberance for adults," said Julianne Boyd, the artistic director of Barrington Stage.
He is culturally omnivorous, and often turns to musicals or films to explain his own feelings. Asked about his frustration, he cites a scene in "Boogie Nights" when the porn star protagonist realizes he is not going to get where he wanted, and a moment in "Synecdoche, New York" when a character buys a house on fire, knowing it might kill her.
But one doesn't have to look far to see how taxing his long journey has been: His breakout song, "Broadway, Here I Come!," an oft-covered number featured on the NBC television series "Smash," is, at its most literal, about someone hoping to get to Broadway who contemplates suicide.

"I never stopped working, and I never stopped doing concerts, but it started to feel like there was a bit of doom hanging over everything, and then I started to see other people now coming up, and they were the next big things, and I was passed over," he said. "After a while it started to feel exhausting."
He was introduced to "Be More Chill" by his agent, who suggested that he and the book writer, Joe Tracz, take a look at the novel.
From the beginning, members of the Family have been part of the development process. The Broadway cast includes not only Mr. Tam, Mr. Williams, Ms. Marcus and Mr. Salazar, but also stars Will Roland, who as an N.Y.U. student in 2008 had a cameo in the Christmas show.
And one of the show's producers, Jennifer Ashley Tepper, was a college student interning at the York Theater Company when she stumbled across an Iconis demo tape; she was wowed, and has been helping produce his concerts and shows for the last decade. "The path has been hard," she said. "There was one night when I was so upset about a bad review a show of Joe's got that I threw a glass out a window."
"Be More Chill," directed by Stephen Brackett, had its initial production at Two River Theater in New Jersey; Mr. Iconis and his collaborators thought it was going well, but after The New York Times disagreed, that was the end of that. "We spent nearly two years trying to get producers and regional theaters interested, and it was very clear no one was," Mr. Iconis said. So he agreed to license the show for community productions, and many signed up; since June of 2017, R&H Theatricals has issued 145 licenses for the show.
Among those who licensed the show was Jerry Goehring, the director of the theater arts program at a Connecticut college, Sacred Heart University. He was startled at how quickly the school's production, which he directed, sold out, and how many people traveled from afar to see it, so he optioned the rights.
Last summer, Mr. Goehring and Ms. Tepper rented space Off Broadway to stage a commercial run of the show. That, too, sold out, with throngs of young people defying the critics and flocking to the show. So Broadway, here they come.
And now that Mr. Iconis is a Broadway composer, the theater world is opening to him further.
Emboldened by "Be More Chill," which is selling well in early previews, Ms. Tepper is planning this week to announce a commercial Off Broadway production of another Iconis show, "Broadway Bounty Hunter," about an out-of-work actor who finds a job hunting criminals. It stars Annie Golden, who, although more than a generation older than Mr. Iconis and his college friends, is one of his most loyal collaborators.
He has two more high-profile works in process: "The Untitled Unauthorized Hunter S. Thompson Musical," commissioned by La Jolla Playhouse, with a Tony-winning director, Christopher Ashley, attached; and "Punk Rock Girl," a jukebox musical featuring songs popularized by female musicians.
"The dream is that it's a show done by school groups, and that it would be impossible not to cast the strangest kids -- the kids who would normally do tech," Mr. Iconis said. "That was my guiding principle -- to write roles for the weird kids."
As he watches "Be More Chill" through the preview process, he is obviously nervous, aware that critics still may not embrace his work. But he is determined to use the energy surrounding this show to fuel his other projects.
"You can use your theater cred to do film or TV or music, but I'm just not interested," he said. "The thing I want to do is have musicals running in theaters, hopefully close to, or on, Broadway."

Texto completo: Welcome to the D.C. Memo, which — like the federal government — likes to take a day off whenever there’s even a rumor of snow in the forecast. This week, we’ll look at Amy’s 2020 debut and why it may finally be Mueller Time. But first, let’s get to the most pressing story of the week: an interview with a guy who’s been dead for 40 years.
Three big things
1. Investigation investigation
Wait, not the one you were thinking of? Right, there was another story that everybody was talking about, this one about a guy who isn’t dead (but was once endorsed by the dead guy’s daughter): The New York Times’ report on President Donald Trump’s “war” on the investigations threatening his presidency. Though there aren’t multiple bombshell revelations in the story — at least when graded on the Trumpian curve of conspicuous calamities — it does serve as something of the ultimate plate-cleaner when it comes to the president’s alleged attempts to thwart the investigation of special counsel Robert S. Mueller :
An examination by The New York Times reveals the extent of an even more sustained, more secretive assault by Mr. Trump on the machinery of federal law enforcement. Interviews with dozens of current and former government officials and others close to Mr. Trump, as well as a review of confidential White House documents, reveal numerous unreported episodes in a two-year drama.
White House lawyers wrote a confidential memo expressing concern about the president’s staff peddling misleading information in public about the firing of Michael T. Flynn, the Trump administration’s first national security adviser. Mr. Trump had private conversations with Republican lawmakers about a campaign to attack the Mueller investigation. And there was the episode when he asked his attorney general about putting [Trump loyalist Geoffrey S.] Berman in charge of the Manhattan investigation. …
The story of Mr. Trump’s attempts to defang the investigations has been voluminously covered in the news media, to such a degree that many Americans have lost track of how unusual his behavior is. But fusing the strands reveals an extraordinary story of a president who has attacked the law enforcement apparatus of his own government like no other president in history, and who has turned the effort into an obsession. Mr. Trump has done it with the same tactics he once used in his business empire: demanding fierce loyalty from employees, applying pressure tactics to keep people in line and protecting the brand — himself — at all costs.
It is a public relations strategy as much as a legal strategy — a campaign to create a narrative of a president hounded by his “deep state” foes. The new Democratic majority in the House, and the prospect of a wave of investigations on Capitol Hill this year, will test whether the strategy shores up Mr. Trump’s political support or puts his presidency in greater peril. The president has spent much of his time venting publicly about there being “no collusion” with Russia before the 2016 election, which has diverted attention from a growing body of evidence that he has tried to impede the various investigations.
Granted, we could still be a little loopy from accidentally inhaling some ice melt while trying to keep track of Minneapolis’ Snow Emergency Rules, but seems to us that having phrases like “misleading information,” “no other president in history,” and “puts his presidency in greater peril” that close together in The New York Times are not the ideal ingredients for the making of a great week.
That said, things could always be worse.
2. Reports of summary of report
Except for that, well, things just might be getting worse for the president : On Wednesday, CNN reported that newly installed Attorney General Bill Barr is getting ready to announce — possibly next week — that Mueller’s Russia investigation is complete, and that, soon after, Barr plans to submit a summary of the report to Congress. According to the network:
The scope and contours of what Barr will send to Congress remain unclear. Also unclear is how long it will take Justice officials to prepare what will be submitted to lawmakers.
But with President Donald Trump soon to travel overseas for a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Justice officials are mindful of not interfering with the White House’s diplomatic efforts, which could impact the timing.
Barr has said that he wants to be as “transparent” as possible with Congress and the public, “consistent with the rules and the law.”
Helpfully, Wired’s Garrett Graff breaks down what the hell all that could mean: “There remain many open questions, even as the consensus around Washington appears to be zeroing in on Mueller ‘wrapping up.’ … Are we just hours away from a sweeping indictment that makes public the pee tape and explains every intimate detail of a years-long plot to co-opt Donald Trump as a Russian intelligence asset that dates all the way back to 1987, as Jonathan Chait has argued? Or are we heading to what the president’s lawyers have argued all along — that, as awful as all the unrelated criminality of Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, and Michael Cohen was, none of it amounted to ‘collusion,’ and this entire enterprise has been a worthless Witch Hunt by 13 Angry Democrats?”
3. Chasing Amy
Speaking of Democrats, this week marked Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s first real jaunt out on the campaign trail since she announced her bid for president, with swings through Wisconsin and Iowa and culminating with a town hall in New Hampshire on Presidents Day.
In Eau Claire, Klobuchar “sought to portray herself as Heartland pragmatist who can unite a divided country,” writes the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “She discussed the challenges of the rural-urban divide in the country and said she will ‘go to places maybe we didn’t focus on enough the last few years, and that includes the rural areas.’ She mapped out an agenda on a collection of issues. They included connecting ‘all the households with rural broadband by 2022,’ backing comprehensive immigration reform and dealing with climate change by bringing back gas mileage standards and putting back in place clean power rules.”
Meanwhile, in Mason City, Iowa, she “emphasized her willingness to work with both sides,” said the Des Moines Register. “‘In my three elections for the U.S. Senate, I didn’t just win in the urban areas, I didn’t just win in the suburbs,’ said Klobuchar, who announced her bid on Feb. 10. ‘I won in the rural areas, and I won every single congressional district — including Michele Bachmann’s. And it’s because I believe in meeting people where they are.’ Klobuchar touted her goals should she become president — including returning to the international climate agreement, a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s Citizens United campaign finance decision, and ‘taking on pharmaceutical companies’ to lower drug prices.”
In New Hampshire, reported the Star Tribune’s Pat Condon: “Klobuchar hit on most of the same points she made at her first campaign stops last weekend in Wisconsin and Iowa and in her Minneapolis campaign kickoff on Feb. 10. She talked about health care, calling for a public option and for lower prescription drug prices. … Klobuchar called for swift action to fight climate change and lessen income inequality, and efforts to boost what she described as an American democracy under threat. That includes automatic voter registration for all 18-year-olds, a strengthened Voting Rights Act and a more strongly regulated campaign finance system.”
She also talked about grit. Like, a lot.
Coming out of Monday’s town hall, which was broadcast on CNN and hosted by the network’s Don Lemon, much of the media coverage focused on Klobuchar’s comments concerning Medicare for all. While the idea was something to aspire to, she said, “I’m just looking at something that will work now,” a response that got a lot of attention from the most progressive corners of the Democratic Party, little of it positive.
More charitable about her comments was Slate’s Jordan Weissmann: “Lefty Twitter was, predictably, displeased. (There was a lot of “thank u, next,” which has become a stock tweet from very online socialists whenever a candidate fails to back full-on single-payer.) But even if you didn’t particularly like the substance of Klobuchar’s response, I think she deserves credit for being forthright; Democrats would be better off if more candidates talked about health care with her level of candor.”
Not forgiving, though? The ratings for the Kloby-talk. From Deadline: “CNN’s Don Lemon-hosted town hall with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar came in third on Presidents Day to MSNBC and Fox News Channel, both in total viewers and in the news demo. CNN’s 10-11:15 PM sit-down with the Dem presidential candidate clocked 1.139M viewers. Only 294K of them fell into the 25-54 demo that is the currency of news programming. Running more than a million viewers ahead of Klobuchar: MSNBC with 2.391M viewers, ahead of FNC (2.390M).”

Your weekend longread
As anyone within shouting distance of MinnPost HQ can attest to, D.C. Memo can’t recommend the book “Bad Blood,” by Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou, highly enough. It tells the story of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos, the health tech company that told the world it had developed a blood test that only needed a tiny amount of blood, only to have Carreyrou reveal that the whole thing was a massive fraud. If you don’t have time to read the book, though, or simply want a taste of just how bonkers the story is, we offer up Nick Bilton’s latest in Vanity Fair, “She Never Looks Back: Inside Elizabeth Holmes’s Chilling Final Months at Theranos.”
Owing largely to Carreyrou’s reporting, the fallout had been colossal, unprecedented. Theranos was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It had been sued by investors. Walgreens, its largest partner, terminated the relationship and shut down 40 testing sites. Forbes, which once estimated Holmes’s wealth at $4.5 billion, wrote it down to zero. The young founder, who was once compared to Steve Jobs, had recently been dubbed a “millennial Madoff” by the New York Post. According to two former executives at the company, Theranos had as many as nine different law firms on retainer, including the formidable Boies Schiller Flexner, to handle the mess—what appeared to be the end of a long, labored, highly visible, and heinous corporate death march.
But Holmes had other ideas. Despite the chaos, she believed that Theranos could still be saved, and she had an unconventional plan for redemption. That September, according to the two former executives, Holmes asked her security detail and one of her drivers to escort her to the airport in her designated black Cadillac Escalade. She flew first class across the country and was subsequently chauffeured to a dog breeder who supplied her with a 9-week-old Siberian husky. The puppy had long white paws, and a grey and black body. Holmes had already picked out a name: Balto.
That’s all for this week. Thanks for sticking around. Until next week, feel free to send tips, suggestions, and sound advice to: feedback@minnpost.com.

Folk musician best known for TV band the Monkees

Texto completo: Peter Tork, a blues and folk musician who became a teeny-bopper sensation as a member of the Monkees, the wisecracking, made-for-TV pop group that imitated and briefly outsold the Beatles, died Feb. 21. He was 77.
His death was confirmed by his sister Anne Thorkelson, who did not say where or how he died. Tork was diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma, a rare cancer affecting his tongue, in 2009.
If the Monkees were a manufactured version of the Beatles, a "prefab four" who auditioned for a rock 'n' roll sitcom and were selected more for their long-haired good looks than their musical abilities, Tork was the group's Ringo, its lovably goofy supporting player.
A versatile multi-instrumentalist, Tork mostly played bass and keyboard for the Monkees.
At 24, he was also the band's oldest member when "The Monkees" premiered on NBC in 1966. Not that it mattered: "The emotional age of all of us," he told The New York Times that year, "is 13."
Created by producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, "The Monkees" was designed to replicate the success of "A Hard Day's Night" and "Help!" - director Richard Lester's musical comedies about the Beatles.
The band featured Tork alongside Michael Nesmith, a singer-songwriter who played guitar, and former child actors Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, who played the drums and sang lead, respectively.
"The Monkees" ran for only two seasons but won an Emmy Award for outstanding comedy. In 1967, according to one report in The Washington Post, the Monkees sold 35 million albums - "twice as many as the Beatles and Rolling Stones combined" - on the strength of songs such as "Daydream Believer," "I'm a Believer" and "Last Train to Clarksville," which all rose to No. 1 on the Billboard record chart.
While the band scored a total of six Top 10 songs and five Top 10 albums, it engendered as much critical scorn as commercial success.
Detractors pointed to the fact that the band, at least initially, existed only in name. While the Monkees appeared on the cover of their debut album and were shown performing on TV, their instruments were unplugged. The songs were mostly done by session musicians - much to the shock of Tork.
After the release of the band's second album, "More of the Monkees" (1967), Tork and his bandmates wrested control of the recording process. They also started touring, playing to sold-out stadium crowds and backed by opening acts that briefly included guitarist Jimi Hendrix.
But as Tork's musical ambitions grew, and he began to clash with bandmates who saw the Monkees as more of a novelty act. He left the group soon after the release of "Head," a satirical, nearly plot-free film flop that featured a screenplay co-written by actor Jack Nicholson.
For much of the 1970s, Tork struggled to find his own way. He formed an unsuccessful band called Release, was imprisoned for several months in 1972 after being caught with "$3 worth of hashish in my pocket," and worked as a high school teacher and "singing waiter" as his Monkees wealth dried up. He said he struggled with alcohol addiction before quitting in the early 1980s.
By then, television reruns and album reissues had fueled a resurgence of interest in the Monkees, and Tork had come around to what he described as the essential nature of the music group, which he joined for major reunion tours about once a decade, beginning in the mid-'80s. Tork also performed during that time as a solo artist.
Tork's marriages to Jody Babb, Reine Stewart and Barbara Iannoli ended in divorce. In addition to his sister, survivors include his wife, Pamela Grapes, two daughters, a son and a brother.

Texto completo: The most powerful person in the world is using his bully pulpit to put rhetorical crosshairs on the backs of some of the nation's best journalists. No one who values the truth can take Donald Trump's frontal assault on those who work hard daily to deliver it, his veritable invitation for deranged individuals to convert hostile words into violent deeds, lying down.
Wednesday morning, in reaction to an exhaustively reported New York Times investigation into Trump's two-year attempt to thwart probes into his inner circle's dealings with Russia, came the President's primal scream on Twitter: "The New York Times reporting is false. They are a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!"
Lest you need a refresher course in that vile capitalized phrase, it was a Russian - a Georgian, actually - who made it famous. Branding those perceived to be threats traitors and counter-revolutionaries, Joseph Stalin spied on them and murdered them and sent them to the gulag. So corrosive was the dictator's use of the invective, his successor, Nikita Khrushchev, banned it.
A man who not long ago yearned to be Vladimir Putin's best friend revives the terminology not to dispute specific facts in a narrative supported by two dozen sources and documentary evidence, but to brand an entire news organization as hostile to the nation.
At a time when partisans already too often make their own reality, in a world where dictators jail and torture dissidents, the so-called leader of the free world seeks to brand inconvenient truths as threats to the state. Among many stomach-turning legacies, it is his most sickening.

Texto completo: It's too early to take away any clear lessons from the Trump era, except one: Whatever you do, never fire the FBI director.
Yes, as president, it is fully within your power to cashier inferior executive-branch officers. But if the aftermath of the James Comey firing is any indication, it risks backlash from FBI and Justice Department officials who will take umbrage — and extraordinary steps in response.
This is the upshot of the "60 Minutes" interview of former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. The Comey firing was ham-fisted and unsettling given the ongoing investigation of Russian interference into the 2016 election. But what ensued was an embarrassing freakout by law-enforcement officials entrusted with awesome powers.
According to McCabe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein brought up invoking the 25th Amendment.
It's worth considering how this Rube Goldberg amendment is supposed to work: The vice president takes power if he and a majority of the Cabinet declare in writing to the Senate and the House that the president is "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."
Then the president can contest the declaration, also in writing, to the Senate and the House. If the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet still say he can't serve, Congress has 21 days to vote on the question. If two-thirds of both houses says he can't, the vice president remains acting president.
Anyone who believes that this was a remotely plausible or appropriate means to depose Donald Trump should have his own ability to discharge his duties examined.
First of all, Trump obviously was perfectly capable of discharging his duties; he just discharged them in a way alarming to McCabe and Rosenstein. His response to an effort by his Cabinet to join such an exercise would have been to fire anyone involved, which he could have done because, again, he wasn't incapacitated.
McCabe also says that Rosenstein twice discussed wearing a wire to record the president and wasn't joking. (A source told the New York Times when it originally broke the story that Rosenstein meant it sarcastically; his own denials have been carefully worded.)
The FBI didn't go this far, but it did open, per McCabe, two probes into the president to determine if he was a Russian agent or had obstructed justice.
Consider the lunacy of this: By providing Trump with a memo justifying Comey's firing, Rosenstein participated in the scheme that the FBI considered a possible crime, or the culmination of a Russian plot. Then Rosenstein turned around and appointed a special counsel, whom he oversaw, to investigate the possible crime to which he was a party.
It's also absurd that the FBI officials considered the firing of Comey to be potential obstruction of the investigation that they were continuing, and indeed making more serious by making the president an explicit target.
The comments that Trump made about Russia that McCabe and Co. found so disturbing were hardly damning. In his cover letter over Rosenstein's memo, Trump mentioned that Comey had told him three times that he wasn't under investigation. This was true, and Trump was frustrated that Comey wouldn't make it public. That doesn't make him a Russian agent.
In his notorious Lester Holt interview, Trump said he fired Comey because there wasn't anything to him and Russia. He didn't say he wanted to shut down the probe; indeed, he said he understood it would now probably go on longer.
Perhaps Trump's comments in his ill-considered meeting with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in the immediate aftermath of the Comey firing were worse, but it's hard to say absent a transcript.
What McCabe's version strongly suggests is that the FBI took upon itself to be a check on the president. This is not its appointed role. If the president abuses his powers, that's for Congress to take up, not executive-branch officials whose panic eclipsed their judgment.

Texto completo: He's picking on the wrong old gray lady.
The ongoing war of words between President Trump and The New York Times reached a fever pitch Wednesday, with both sides slinging insults as they argued over one of the fundamental principles of American democracy: the rights of the free press.
The commander-in-chief set off the fiery exchange with one of his most inflammatory anti-media insults - this one prompted by yet another damning news story about his administration in the Times.
"The New York Times reporting is false. They are a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!" Trump tweeted as part of a chain of media-hating morning posts.
Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger quickly hit back - branding Trump as a "reckless" despot for continuing to use the ugly phrase to demean and diminish news coverage he doesn't like, and at a time when violence against journalism is on the rise globally.
"The phrase 'enemy of the people' is not just false, it's dangerous," Sulzberger said. "As I have repeatedly told President Trump face-to-face, there are mounting signs that this incendiary rhetoric is encouraging threats and violence against journalists at home and abroad."
The assertive public push-back came after the President attacked the Times for reporting Tuesday that he had asked then-Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to put a political ally in charge of the federal investigation into Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen last year.
The Times cited interviews with dozens of current and former U.S. officials to back up the allegation that raises serious questions of whether the President tried to obstruct a criminal investigation he has a direct stake in.
And when Trump falsely claimed in another tweet that the "dishonest" newspaper didn't reach out to the White House for comment on the bombshell piece, the Times communications team didn't hesitate to slap him down.
"The White House was given 5 days to respond to the details of our investigation," the team's Twitter handle responded directly to Trump's post. "The Times followed up multiple times but no response was given on the record until the President addressed the story after its publication."
Trump's love-hate relationship with the press has been on full display since the very earliest days of his 2016 presidential campaign - and it's only grown more heated since he took up residence in the Oval Office.
At times, he's openly derided reporters at press conferences, grown combative when urged to answer questions, threatened to revoke credentials, and told journalists to sit down and shut up - and heckled the mainstream press in general as being the mouthpiece of "fake news." Only Fox News host Sean Hannity, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh and other media that show support for his policies earn presidential praise.
At rallies, Trump frequently elicits cheers from the audience by mocking the press. He's referred to journalists as "sick people," questioned their patriotism and said they are trying "to take away our history and our heritage."
"I really think they don't like our country," he said at one rally in 2017 - remarks that were highlighted by the Times.
Sulzberger on Wednesday blasted Trump's constant raging at the press for doing its job, saying the President's inflammatory insults and "enemy of the people" attitude was a dangerous throwback to dark times.
"It has an ugly history of being wielded by dictators and tyrants who sought to control public information," Sulzberger said. "And it is particularly reckless coming from someone whose office gives him broad powers to fight or imprison the nation's enemies." Former Presidents Thomas Jefferson, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were all committed to the idea that "a free press was essential to democracy," he added..

City Bans Discrimination Based on Hair

Texto completo: Under new guidelines to be released this week by the New York City Commission on Human Rights, the targeting of people based on their hair or hairstyle, at work, school or in public spaces, will now be considered racial discrimination.
The change in law applies to anyone in New York City but is aimed at remedying the disparate treatment of black people; the guidelines specifically mention the right of New Yorkers to maintain their "natural hair, treated or untreated hairstyles such as locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, fades, Afros, and/or the right to keep hair in an uncut or untrimmed state."
In practice, the guidelines give legal recourse to individuals who have been harassed, threatened, punished, demoted or fired because of the texture or style of their hair. The city commission can levy penalties up to $250,000 on defendants that are found in violation of the guidelines and there is no cap on damages. The commission can also force internal policy changes and rehirings at offending institutions.
The move was prompted in part by investigations after complaints from workers at two Bronx businesses -- a medical facility in Morris Park and a nonprofit in Morrisania -- as well as workers at an Upper East Side hair salon and a restaurant in the Howard Beach section of Queens. (The new guidelines do not interfere with health and safety reasons for wearing hair up or in a net, as long as the rules apply to everyone.)
The guidelines, obtained by The New York Times before their public release, are based on the argument that hair is inherent to one's race (and can be closely associated with "racial, ethnic, or cultural identities") and is therefore protected under the city's human rights laws, which outlaw discrimination on the basis of race, gender, national origin, religion and other protected classes.
To date, there is no legal precedent in federal court for the protection of hair. Indeed, last spring the United States Supreme Court refused an NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund request to review a case in which a black woman, Chastity Jones, had her job offer rescinded in 2010 at an Alabama insurance company after she refused to cut off her dreadlocks.
But New York City's human rights commission is one of the most progressive in the nation; it recognizes many more areas of discrimination than federal law, including in employment, housing, pregnancy and marital status. Its legal enforcement bureau can conduct investigations, and has the ability to subpoena witnesses and prosecute violations.
"There's nothing keeping us from calling out these policies prohibiting natural hair or hairstyles most closely associated with black people," said Carmelyn P. Malalis, the commissioner and chairwoman of the New York City Commission on Human Rights.
"They are based on racist standards of appearance," Ms. Malalis continued, saying that they perpetuate "racist stereotypes that say black hairstyles are unprofessional or improper."
In New York, it isn't difficult to find black women and men who can speak about how their hair has affected their lives in both subtle and substantial ways, ranging from veiled comments from co-workers to ultimatums from bosses to look "more professional" or find another job.
For Avery, 39, who works in Manhattan in court administration and declined to provide her last name for fear of reprisal at work, the answer to how often she fields remarks on her hair in a professional setting is "every day."
Avery said her supervisor, who is white, encourages her to relax her hair, which she was wearing in shoulder-length chestnut-colored braids. "She's like, 'You should do your hair,' when it is already styled, or she says, 'straight is better,"' Avery said. She added that the only hair color her supervisor approves of is black.
Georbina DaRosa, who is interning to be a social worker, had her hair in box braids as she ate lunch with a colleague at Shake Shack on East 86th Street on a recent weekend afternoon. Ms. DaRosa said her hair sometimes elicited "microaggressions" from her superiors at work.
"Like, people say, 'I wouldn't be able to recognize you because you keep changing your hairstyle,' that's typical," said Ms. DaRosa, 24.
Her lunch partner, Pahola Capellan, who is also black and whose ringlets were bobbed just above her shoulders, said, of her own experience: "It's very different. There's no discrimination because my hair is more acceptable."
A 21-year-old black woman who gave her name only as Enie said she quit her job as a cashier at a Manhattan Wendy's six months ago when a manager asked her to cut off her 14-inch hair extensions. "I quit because you can't tell me my hair is too long, but the other females who are other races don't have to cut their hair," said Enie, who now works at a hospital.
There has long been a professional toll for those with certain hairstyles. Almost 18 percent of United States soldiers in active duty are black, but it is only in recent years that the military has dropped its prohibitions on hairstyles associated with black culture. The Marines approved braid, twist and "lock" (usually spelled loc) hairstyles in 2015, with some caveats, and the Army lifted its ban on dreadlocks in 2017.

And certain black hairstyles are freighted with history. Wearing an Afro in the 1960s, for instance, was often seen as a political statement instead of a purely aesthetic choice, said Noliwe Rooks, an author and professor at Cornell University whose work explores race and gender. Dr. Rooks said that today, black men who shave designs into their hair as a stylistic choice may be perceived as telegraphing gang membership.
"People read our bodies in ways we don't always intend," Dr. Rooks said. "As Zora Neale Hurston said, there is the 'will to adorn,' but there is often a backlash against it."
Chaumtoli Huq, an associate professor of labor and employment law at City University of New York School of Law, said that attitudes will change as black politicians, like Stacey Abrams, who ran for governor of Georgia, and Ayanna Pressley, who represents Massachusetts in Congress, rise in prominence.
"As more high-profile black women like Abrams and Pressley opt for natural hairstyles, twists, braids, we may see a positive cultural shift that would impact how courts view these guidelines that seek to prevent discrimination based on hair," Ms. Huq said.
Hair discrimination affects people of all ages. In the past several years, there have been a number of cases of black students sent home or punished for their hairstyles. In New Jersey, the state civil rights division and its interscholastic athletic association started separate investigations in December when Andrew Johnson, a black high school student, was told to cut off his dreadlocks or forfeit a wrestling match.
Last August, an 11-year-old student in Terrytown, La., was sent home from school for wearing braids, as was a 6-year-old boy in Florida who wore dreadlocks. In 2017, Mya and Deana Cook, twin sisters in Massachusetts, were forced to serve detentions because officials said their braids violated their school's grooming policy.
Similar instances in New York City could fall under the human rights commission's expansive mandate, as do instances of retailers that sell and display racist iconography.
In December, the commission issued a cease-and-desist order to Prada, the Italian luxury fashion house, after the window of its SoHo store was adorned with charms and key chains featuring blackface imagery.
The fashion company instituted training in the city's human rights law for employees, executives, and independent contractors. It also immediately pulled the line of goods from its United States stores.

A Good App for a Reporter With Bad Handwriting

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Isabella Kwai, a correspondent in Sydney, Australia, discussed the tech she's using.
What are the most important tech tools for doing your job, and how do you use them?
At this point, my iPhone 6S is basically another limb. We don't have desk phones in our bureau and everyone bounces around, so it pays to be as mobile as possible. I have Slack, Google Hangouts and the Google Docs app downloaded on my phone. I'll also take pictures and videos to remind me of scenes when I'm reporting a feature. I'll use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to both share our bureau's stories and find potential ones.
It looks like Apple doesn't even sell the iPhone 6S anymore. They want us to upgrade. But it's been only a few years, so I refuse.
I still keep a notebook on hand that I'll occasionally use. But to be honest, I have atrocious handwriting, and deciphering it is arduous. Instead, I use the Notes app. I find it easier to write up thoughts and notes that way -- though once, it did freak out a source, who asked me how I was able to type and look her in the eye. (Disturbingly agile millennial thumbs is how.)
For reporting in the field, I had a Sony ICD-PX470 voice recorder with a built-in USB that was the slimmest, most unobtrusive device -- until I dropped it on a recent assignment. I'm using the Voice Memos app for now until I can pick up a new one. The TapeACall app works for recording phone interviews. And after a few too many inventive attempts at finding power outlets, I always carry a Cygnett power bank.
My beloved battered laptop is a MacBook Air that does everything it needs to do. While trying to keep organized, I've been loving Google Keep lately as a to-do list, because it's not too fussy. Wunderlist is another app I'd recommend for that.
My favorite Chrome extensions and Mac apps are Momentum for a dose of nature on my dashboard, OneTab for my crazy tab collection and Self Control, which bars access to Twitter, Facebook and any other time wasters for a set period. Sometimes you need technology to keep you from your basest instincts.
Also, I'd like to formally thank Lane 8's deep house sets on SoundCloud for hauling me through long hours of writing. Please never stop making music.
Australia has a reputation for trying to limit transparency. And are there tech tools you've found that help to improve transparency?
The lack of transparency is more of a general suspicion from officials and people in the corporate sector about journalists. Questions for government officials or corporate executives are heavily filtered through publicists and communications people. It's harder to get someone in a powerful position on the phone. Certain applications, statistics or reports are surprisingly difficult to find.
It just means having more conversations with different sources to try to get information. One handy trick I did learn is that you can click on the arrow next to a search engine result. It pulls up the previously published versions of the site, even if the current version of a website is down.
What tech do Australians love?
As long as it's available here, we love many of the same apps and gadgets Americans do.
One thing that doesn't exist here is Venmo, the peer-to-peer payments app, which I used to miss. But to make up for it, the apps for the major banks here are amazing -- super easy to use, with built-in budgeting systems and pretty aesthetics. People use them to transfer money almost immediately from bank to bank.
Also, because there's so much natural beauty here, a fair few of my Australian friends seem to have drones or GoPro cameras and make travel videos for a hobby.
Another thing I've noticed, though it might not be isolated to Australia: For most people I've encountered in their 20s who use social media to document their lives, Facebook is pretty much dead. Every new person I meet asks to add me on Instagram now.
Amazon only recently arrived in Australia. Are Australians embracing it?
When I lived in the United States, Amazon Prime was practically a way of life. But it hasn't quite taken off here in the same way. For me, it's because the selection of products was limited until November, and shipping here has been slow and unreliable, so it hasn't quite distinguished itself from Australian retailers.
I'll still order the occasional clothing and electronics item online -- but for everything else, I'll go in person to browse the stores. That used to include books -- until I got a Kindle for my birthday last year. I really hate to say it, but I love reading on it! If there's one area Amazon is raking in my cash, it's e-books.
Outside of work, what tech are you obsessed with, and why?
For personal budgeting, I'd really recommend the You Need a Budget app, which has a mysterious way of making saving money seem like a game. Headspace, a meditation and mindfulness app, helps me wind down. We even had a nice lunchtime meditation at the office together with it once -- before a call from a publicist interrupted proceedings.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Roger Stone to appear in court for a hearing to consider whether to revoke his bail after the longtime Donald Trump confidant posted a photo on Instagram of the judge with what appeared to be crosshairs of a gun.
US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Stone must show for a hearing Thursday afternoon and prove why she shouldn't modify or revoke his bail or implement a full gag order in his case.
On Monday, Stone posted a photo of Jackson with what appeared to be crosshairs near her head. Later in the day, Stone and his attorneys filed a notice with the court that they recognized the "photograph and comment today was improper and should not have been posted."
Stone later said that the picture had been "misinterpreted" and that any suggestion he intended to threaten Jackson was "categorically false."
Stone is charged with lying to Congress, obstruction, and witness tampering related to discussions he had during the 2016 election about WikiLeaks. He has denied guilt.

Suit aiming to block Obama center in park can proceed
CHICAGO — A judge on Tuesday gave the green light to a lawsuit filed by a parks-advocacy group that aims to stop for good the delayed construction of former president Barack Obama's $500 million presidential center in a Chicago park beside Lake Michigan.
Some supporters of the project fear the lawsuit filed by Protect Our Parks could force Obama — who launched his political career in Chicago — to build the Obama Presidential Center elsewhere. A 2016 suit brought by another group helped to scuttle a $400 million plan by "Star Wars" creator George Lucas to build a museum on public land on Chicago's lakefront. That museum is now under construction in Los Angeles.
US District Judge John Robert Blakey heard arguments last week on the city's motion to dismiss the suit and was largely focused on the question of whether the group had standing to sue. His ruling doesn't mean the group will necessarily prevail, but confirms that the suit poses a formidable threat to the project.
Plans call for the center to be built in Jackson Park, which was named after President Andrew Jackson and was a site for the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. The site 7 miles south of downtown Chicago is near low-income neighborhoods where Obama once worked as a community organizer and is just blocks from the University of Chicago, where Obama was a law professor. It is also close to the home where the Obamas lived until he won the presidency in 2008.
In its 2018 suit, Protect Our Parks accused the city of illegally transferring park land to a private entity, The Obama Foundation. The group said city officials manipulated the approval process and tinkered with legislation to skirt longstanding laws designed to ensure residents had unobstructed access to lakeside parks.
"Defendants have chosen to deal with it in a classic Chicago political way . . . to deceive and seemingly legitimize an illegal land grab," the lawsuit says. It also described the city as "gifting" prized land to a Chicago favorite son.
To make the park available for the project, the Chicago Park District first sold the land to the city for $1. Illinois legislators amended the state's Illinois Aquarium and Museum Act to include presidential libraries as an exception to the no-development rules if there's a compelling public interest. The Chicago City Council approved the project by a 47-to-1 vote last May.
The Obama Foundation, a private nonprofit, would pay $10 to the city for use of the park land for 99 years, cover the costs of building the complex, and be responsible for covering operating costs for 99 years. Once built, the Obama Presidential Center's physical structures would be transferred to the city for free, meaning the city would own the center but not control what happens there.

Trump signs order to start establishing Space Force
President Trump moved forward with his planned Space Force on Tuesday, signing an order to begin the process for establishing a new branch of the military that would be dedicated to handling threats in space.
Trump's directive orders the Defense Department to “marshal its space resources to deter and counter threats in space" — which the Pentagon already does. The newly created Space Force would be overseen by the Air Force, a concession to congressional critics who say the Pentagon does not need to add to its sprawling bureaucracy.
The president needs congressional approval to create a Space Force; his initial proposal for it to be a separate branch of the military was met with resistance. Congress and the Pentagon recommended that the force be placed under the Air Force's purview.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The New York Times on Tuesday won two George Polk awards for reporting on the Trump family's use of dubious tax schemes and the trend of social media giants choosing profit over users' privacy.
And for the first time, the organization gave an award to a podcast, "In the Dark: Season 2," about a death row inmate in Mississippi who has been tried six times for the same crime.
"It marks the growing influence in radio and podcasts -- and radio programming in general -- in our daily news diet," said John Darnton, the curator of the awards.
Long Island University, which gives the awards annually in memory of George Polk, a CBS correspondent murdered in 1948 while covering the Greek Civil War, said it received 554 entries for consideration -- the most in the program's 70-year history.
In all, 14 news organizations and Netflix were recognized for outstanding journalism during 2018 and will receive their awards at an April luncheon.
The New York Times reporters David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner won the Polk award for political reporting for their investigation of President Trump and his family's use of questionable tax schemes over decades and the true source of Mr. Trump's wealth -- his father, Fred C. Trump -- despite the president's assertions that he received little financial help from him.
In response to the article, Mr. Trump lashed out on Twitter, saying that "The Failing New York Times" did an old and boring "hit piece" on him. He also estimated, without evidence, that 97 percent of The Times's articles about him "are bad."
The award for national reporting went to the Times staff with contributions from Carole Cadwalladr for The Guardian/The Observer of London for coverage of Facebook and other social media giants and their propensity to prioritize profit over users' privacy. The coverage included accounts of how Trump campaign advisers used a voter profiling company, Cambridge Analytica, that exploited the social media activity of American voters during the 2016 campaign.
Two Reuters reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, won the foreign reporting award for their coverage of a massacre in Myanmar in which 10 Rohingya Muslims were executed. The two journalists were arrested in Myanmar during their reporting.
Bill Siemering, a founding father of National Public Radio, received the Polk career award. And two Washington Post journalists, David Ignatius and Karen Attiah, won a special award for their coverage of the killing of their colleague, Jamal Khashoggi, inside the Saudi Consulate in Turkey.
The director Kirby Dick and the journalists Amy Ziering and Amy Herdy won the Polk award for medical reporting for the Netflix documentary "The Bleeding Edge," about the use of poorly researched medical devices and the pain inflicted on victims.
Madeleine Baran and Samara Freemark of APM Reports in St. Paul received the first Polk award given to a podcast for "In the Dark," which explored the case of a Mississippi man who has been tried six times for the 1996 killings of four people.
Speaking on a panel in Washington after the awards were announced on Tuesday, Ms. Baran said the investigation started with a listener's tip.
"This story began with an email from a woman who has never contacted me again. And she said, 'There is a man here in Mississippi named Curtis Flowers who has been tried six times for the same crime,"' Ms. Baran said. "That was the first I'd ever heard of Curtis Flowers."

Roberts sides with liberal justices

Texto completo: For the second time in as many weeks, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has sided with liberal Supreme Court justices to disagree with how lower courts have interpreted Supreme Court precedent.
On Tuesday, Roberts was pointed in saying the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has "misapplied" a 2017 ruling that instructed that court to reconsider its analysis of whether death-row inmate Bobby James Moore was intellectually disabled, and thus ineligible for execution.
Less than two weeks ago, Roberts joined the liberals in stopping a Louisiana abortion law that was nearly identical to a Texas law the court had struck down in 2016.
It was a busy day Tuesday, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg rejoined her colleagues for a public hearing for the first time since she underwent lung surgery in December:
l Justice Clarence Thomas called for reconsidering the Supreme Court's landmark decision making it more difficult for public officials to claim defamation as the court turned down a request from an accuser of Bill Cosby.
l The court agreed to hear a case next term that could define the scope of the Clean Water Act, which regulates pollution discharges into what are called "navigable waters." In this case, the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility in Hawaii first releases water into groundwater, some of which eventually reaches the Pacific Ocean.
Roberts's role in the abortion and death penalty cases was notable partly because he had been in dissent in the original decisions. His actions are not a sign that he has changed his mind; the ruling that the Louisiana law could not go into effect at this time was not a decision on the merits.
But they do seem to be an indication the chief justice believes lower courts must comply with Supreme Court precedents so long as they stand.
"On remand, the court repeated the same errors that this court previously condemned," Roberts wrote, concurring in the majority's finding Tuesday that Moore, the inmate, "is a person with intellectual disability."
The Texas court's review of Moore's case "did not pass muster under this court's analysis last time," Roberts wrote in a separate opinion. "It still doesn't."
The court, in an unsigned opinion, said the Texas court was wrong to reaffirm that Moore was mentally capable and eligible for execution. Three of the court's conservatives - Justices Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch - noted their disagreement in a dissent written by Alito.
He said the court's instructions in the 2015 ruling on Moore were so gauzy it is no surprise that the Texas court had trouble following them. The proper response, he said, would have been to return the case with more specific instructions, not to take the decision away.
"The court's foray into fact-finding is an unsound departure from our usual practice," Alito wrote.
In a 5-to-3 decision written in 2017 by Ginsburg, the court sent back the case of Moore, who fatally shot store clerk James McCardle in a botched robbery in 1980. Moore's decades-long trip through the appeals courts has been marked by conflicting opinions on whether he is intellectually disabled.
Texas's Court of Criminal Appeals eventually determined he was not. But the Supreme Court concluded that this decision improperly relied on outdated medical standards, borderline IQ scores and a list of unique-to-Texas factors that Ginsburg termed an "invention . . . untied to any acknowledged source."
On remand, the Texas court once again considered Moore's intellectual abilities, and again found him competent.
But on Tuesday, the Supreme Court majority was unimpressed:
"We have found in its opinion too many instances in which, with small variations, it repeats the analysis we previously found wanting, and these same parts are critical to its ultimate conclusion."
In the Louisiana abortion case, Roberts did not spell out his reasoning. Instead, he joined the liberal justices in keeping the law - which required doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals - from taking effect. Challengers had said it would probably leave only one clinic open, and one doctor who could provide abortions.
It is likely that because of the granted stay, the court will next term consider the merits of the law.
In that stay decision Feb. 7, Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, along with new Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Thomas's call for overturning the landmark 1964 decision New York Times v. Sullivan came as the court declined to take the case of Kathrine McKee, who accused actor and comedian Bill Cosby of raping her more than 40 years ago. She sued after Cosby's attorney leaked a letter that she said distorted her background to "damage her reputation for truthfulness and honesty," and to shame her.
But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit said McKee had "thrust" herself into the national #MeToo movement with her allegations. As a public figure, the court said, she had to show that comments about her were made with "actual malice" and disregard for the truth, the standard set by the Supreme Court.
Thomas said he agreed with his colleagues not to accept McKee's "factbound" appeal.
But he launched a detailed critique of the landmark defamation ruling, which he said was a "policy-driven" decision "masquerading as constitutional law." No other justice joined his concurrence.
President Trump has expressed support for making it easier to sue for defamation, and during the campaign - and after - complained about "hit pieces" in The Washington Post and New York Times.
"I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money," Trump said during the campaign. Over the weekend, he complained about a "Saturday Night Live" skit and wondered about "retribution."
Thomas and the late Justice Antonin Scalia have said the court may have intruded into a space in which it was not needed.
"We should not continue to reflexively apply this policy driven approach to the Constitution," Thomas wrote. "Instead, we should carefully examine the original meaning of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. If the Constitution does not require public figures to satisfy an actual-malice standard in state-law defamation suits, then neither should we."

Kaiser Permanente to open medical school in Pasadena, offer free tuition for first classes in 2020

Texto completo: Kaiser Permanente is opening a hospital-run school of medicine in Pasadena, announcing Tuesday, Feb. 19 it would waive tuition for its first five graduating classes in an attempt to jump-start medical careers minus the typical crushing student debt.
The Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine said it has received preliminary accreditation and will begin accepting applications from prospective students in June for admission in the summer of 2020.
This will be a unique learning institution for Kaiser, which plans to waive all tuition for the full four years of school at its campus at 98 S. Los Robles Ave. Those classes — with 48 students each — will run from 2020 through 2024.
Tuition would typically cost $55,000 a year, saving each student $275,000.
“This is primarily about making sure all students, regardless of backgrounds, aren’t deterred from pursuing a career in medicine due to the prospect of going into massive debt,” said Kaiser spokesman Vincent Staupe. “This is also about wanting students to be able to choose a medical specialty that they are truly passionate about, rather than choosing one based solely off financial need.”
Kaiser hopes the strategy will prompt more students to pursue lower-paying specialties in the primary care field, or work in under-served areas since they wouldn’t be burdened with overwhelming debt.
The school will use a “small-group, case-based medical curriculum” that are designed to prepare future physicians to become collaborative leaders committed to prevention, fluent in data-driven care and adept at addressing the needs of under-served patients and communities.
Dr. Mark A. Schuster, the school’s founding dean and CEO, said the health care giant is developing a school committed to providing “outstanding patient care in our nation’s complex and evolving health care system.”
The school said it has recruited a diverse group of leaders with vast health care experience who, in turn, created a curriculum that includes three academic pillars — foundational science, clinical science and health systems science.
The school’s clinical education will take place primarily in Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics in the greater Los Angeles area and in partnered community health centers.
Other medical schools at universities have taken steps recently to decrease their students’ financial burden. Columbia University, for example, is using a $250 million gift for a new endowment that will fund a range of scholarships and grants meant to ensure none of its medical students incur debt.
About three-quarters of medical school students graduate with debt, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges; members of the 2017 graduating class who had debt reported a median amount of $192,000.
Kaiser’s medical school has received preliminary accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, a different process than usual because, unlike the universities that open medical schools, it is not already a degree-granting institution.
The New York Times contributed to this report.

Texto completo: Actress and singer Mandy Moore said that she be making new music soon.
"I'll be recording music during the [This Is Us] hiatus," Moore told reporters at Paramount Studios last week, according to People.com.
She said that she will be making music with new husband, musician Taylor Goldsmith.
"Yes! With my husband! We have things written, ready to go," she told reporters. "Our hiatus starts soon, so I'm getting ready to go in the studio."
Moore, 34, is one of the stars of "This Is Us," the NBC show set in Pittsburgh, and she has occasionally sung on the show. Goldsmith co-wrote a song for an episode from season 3.
Moore began her career in 1999 as singer but has not released new music since 2009.
The actress' statement comes amid allegations against her ex-husband, singer Ryan Adams, who she was married to from 2009 to 2016.
Moore and six other women came forward last week in The New York Times and accused Adams of harassment and emotional abuse.
Moore also posted a message to Instagram to fans, saying, "Speaking your truth can be painful and triggering but it's always worth it. My heart is with all women who have suffered any sort of trauma or abuse. You are seen and heard. #sisterhoodforever"

Texto completo: It's always a special occasion when the Paul Taylor Dance Company comes to Pittsburgh. Its namesake and founder, who was born in Wilkinsburg and grew up in Edgewood, is revered as a prolific and influential choreographer in American modern dance.
On Saturday, the New York City-based company will return here for the first time since Mr. Taylor's passing in August at age 88. The cause of death was renal failure.
Michael Novak, handpicked by Mr. Taylor as artistic director, said the company's return to his hometown as part of the Pittsburgh Dance Council's 2018-19 season is bittersweet. They last performed here in 2011.
"The only thing he would talk about is that his father, Paul Taylor Sr., worked at Westinghouse. He was a physicist there," he said.
His parents divorced early on, and his mother moved and supported the four Taylor children by managing restaurants in the Washington, D.C., area.
While Mr. Taylor's time in Pittsburgh was minimal, the city is no stranger to his choreographic ingenuity. His company first performed here in the early 1970s, Mr. Novak said, and several times since. Patricia Wilde helped Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre flex its modern muscle by incorporating Taylor works into the repertoire during her time as its artistic director. Her successor, Terrence Orr, also has featured his pieces in PBT programs in recent years.
To honor the company's first visit here since Mr. Taylor's death, proclamations are to be issued by the City of Pittsburgh and Wilkinsburg (where Mr. Taylor was born in 1930), said Dance Council executive director Randal Miller. A tribute video by the Paul Taylor Dance Company also will play on a loop that Saturday night in the Byham Theater lobby.
"There's an incredible range in his work," said Mr. Novak, who started dancing with the company in 2010. "Here was this repertory where I would be given the opportunity to dance works that are truly beautiful and full of love and hope and joy ... and in the next dance I could do another work that was completely dark and devastating and gut-wrenching."
In the months since Mr. Taylor's passing, Mr. Novak has been thinking hard about how to get future generations excited about Mr. Taylor's breadth of work. He is only the second artistic director in the company's 65-year history.
"I did not see it coming. No one saw it coming," he said. "Usually no news was good news [with Paul], so when I got an invitation to go over to his apartment I wasn't sure what it was about."
Mr. Taylor didn't ask him if he wanted the job. He told him to take it.
"When Paul Taylor tells you to jump, you jump. When he tells you take over his company, you take over his company," Mr. Novak said. "It's taken a long time to process."
Mr. Novak, who's in his mid-30s, studied dance history at Columbia University and has long had an interest in arts administration.
"I worked many jobs in my life, from waiting on tables to being a personal assistant, and I always recognized that managing aesthetics was always important to me.
"It seems kind of ironic that Paul picked up on that."
He views Mr. Taylor's death as a chance to take stock of his rich body of work.
"I knew a lot of theaters around the world would be interested in being part of some kind of retrospective. I took it upon myself to curate programs of dances that I thought were either important to Paul, myself, the dancers or works that were loved by audiences," Mr. Novak said.
The program that was slated for the Byham Theater "has shifted," Mr Miller said. Originally, the mixed rep lineup included Mr. Taylor's "Diggity" - a 1978 piece known for its use of cutout dogs by artist Alex Katz - and "Continuum," a new piece by former company dancer Lila York.
Now it will include "Aureole" to Baroque music (1962), "Company B" danced to '40s tunes by the Andrews Sisters (1991), "Promethean Fire" with Bach (2002) and "3 Epitaphs" (1956) - Mr. Taylor's oldest surviving work set to "early New Orleans jazz."
"Paul wanted every audience member to feel like at the end of the evening they had seen three different choreographers, even though it was all Paul Taylor work," Mr. Novak said. "As I built this retrospective that was something I took into account."
In his later years, Mr. Taylor tried to sustain his legacy as well as the future of modern dance. That included preserving important historical works and nurturing up-and-coming contemporary choreographers. Mr. Novak hopes that touring these retrospective programs will show him how to help Paul Taylor Dance Company thrive for another 65 years and beyond.
"I'm listening to people's stories of their relationships with either Paul or his dances or modern dance in general," he said. "This is an opportunity for me to understand these different demographics and how they relate to modern dance and what is the best package to give them."

Texto completo: There are generally a few kinds of barbecue sauce in my refrigerator, leftovers from various experiments. That may be true for you as well? I bet there's a half-bottle of store-bought sauce, anyway, or a dusty unopened one in the pantry. Check: There probably is. Let's make dinner with it, and some salmon fillets. Put the barbecue sauce in a small pot on the stove over medium heat, then turn the oven to 400. Roughly chop a few jarred pickled hot peppers into the sauce, and add a couple of pats of butter to silkify the situation. Warm that through while the oven heats, then salt and pepper the salmon fillets and roast them skin-side down, on a lightly oiled sheet pan, for 10 or 12 minutes, or until they are just barely cooked through. Spoon the pepper-studded barbecue sauce over the top, and go to!
This is a good one to have in your back pocket when you're cooking burgers and dogs on the grill; it's a no-recipe version of a dish that I first learned of from the Brooklyn restaurateur Joe Carroll. Toss broccoli florets in equal parts soy sauce and balsamic vinegar, a generous dash of maple syrup and a splash of neutral oil, then grill (or broil) until they're soft and crunchy. Serve them under a scattering of red-pepper flakes and sesame seeds, or use furikake, a Japanese seasoning blend that contains, in addition to sesame, chopped seaweed, sugar, salt and, occasionally, monosodium glutamate. Never mind hot dogs or anything else, actually. I could go for that broccoli on white rice and call it dinner, full stop.
Set a pot of nicely salted water over high heat to boil. When it does, add the fettuccine, then get the rest of your dinner ready as it cooks to al dente. Chop up a fistful of mint and a small shallot if you have one (half a small onion if you don't), mixing them into a cup or two of fresh ricotta, then loosening the mixture with a healthy drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice. Add some salt and pepper to taste, perhaps a shake of red pepper. When the pasta's done, which'll be about the same time as you're done with the sauce, drain it in a colander and add it to a big warm bowl, then fold the cheese into it, mixing gently. Serve to adoration.
This one came to me from the great New York Times food reporter Julia Moskin. Scatter a bunch of sliced onions and shallots across the oiled bottom of a large pan, then put a bunch of chicken thighs on top, skin-side up. Season the thighs with salt and pepper, then slide the pan into a 425-degree oven to roast until the chicken is crisp on top and cooked through, about 35 minutes. Shake the pan every so often, and add wine or stock if the onions are browning too fast. Meanwhile, make some croutons from good, chewy olive-oil-tossed bread, toasting them until golden in a pan or in the oven alongside the chicken. They can be cut or torn up -- no matter. Put the croutons on a warm platter, dump the contents of the roasting pan over the top and arrange the chicken on top of that, mixed with bitter greens. Boy howdy.
Start with the onions, slicing two big sweet ones and setting them in a hot pan with a couple of gurgles of olive oil. Season with salt, black pepper and a shake of red-pepper flakes, then cook over medium heat, stirring and tossing occasionally so that they go golden and soft. This'll take a while. Add a couple of sliced bell peppers to the pan, and continue cooking, still stirring and tossing, until they begin to wilt. Set the vegetables aside. About halfway through, set some sweet Italian sausages in another hot, oil-slicked pan, and cook them through until crisp and brown on the exterior, turning often.
Split your sub rolls (I like the sesame-seeded variety here) and scrape out a little of the interior from each. Load one side of each roll with some of the onions and peppers, the other with a sausage. Top with mozzarella, put the open sandwiches on a sheet pan and slide them all into a hot oven for five minutes or so, until the cheese is melted and the bread is lightly toasted. Fold together and serve.
Sometimes I get it into my head to make a fancy grilled cheese sandwich. I don't have a recipe because you don't really need a recipe to make grilled cheese sandwiches. You just need desire, and a triangle in your head: salt; crunch; melting ooze. So I'll slice some mild Cheddar. Get some decent bread, a sliced jalapeño, the tail end of a beefsteak tomato. Then, sizzle-sizzle-flip-flip in some unsalted butter, and top with a sunny-side-up egg. It's the simplest kind of cooking, and on a weeknight that's exactly what most of us need. Make grilled cheese!
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Photograph A sheet pan is an invaluable no-recipe recipe tool. Cover it with foil, then lightly oil that, to make cleanup easier.; Salad on the side! Whisk olive oil into some lemon or lime juice until it's emulsified, hit it with salt and pepper, and then use it to lightly dress a pile of arugula or spring-style greens. (TP4); You should swap the broccoli for cauliflower sometime.; You can replace the balsamic vinegar with butter, if you're feeling plucky. (TP5); Always salt your water. It helps season the pasta you're cooking. You want it the flavor of not-totally-unpleasant brackish water: the taste of a summer swim in a coastal pond that gets breached by the sea.; Reserve a little bit of the pasta cooking water to help smooth out the sauce as it comes together. Do this every time you make pasta. (TP6); People who talk about cooking a lot always tell you to make croutons out of stale bread. I don't have stale bread, generally, because my children like French toast for breakfast. Toasting fresh bread in a pan is a good and delicious shortcut.; A fact you ought to know: Julia Moskin was named for the great American cookbook author and television personality Julia Child! (TP7); Of course, you can make these subs with hot sausages instead of sweet. I'm not a monster.; And, of course, you don't need to top them with mozzarella. But that's pretty good. (TP8); Spread a thin film of mayonnaise on the outsides of the sandwich before frying it to encourage beautiful brown crispiness.; Bacon? You could add bacon.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- Matt Kuchar had heard enough. Battered by criticism that he had essentially stiffed a caddie who helped him win a tournament last November in Mexico, he took action to make amends on Friday, issuing a statement in which he apologized for his initial actions and also said he had now paid the caddie a good deal more money.
In the 15-line statement, which was released while he was playing the rain-delayed first and second rounds of the Genesis Open in Los Angeles, Kuchar said he had now given the caddie, David Giral Ortiz, a much bigger sum than the $5,000 he originally paid him after capturing the first-place prize of $1.296 million at the Mayakoba Golf Classic.
In issuing the statement, Kuchar clearly hoped to put an end to the bad tidings that had sullied his image and cast him as a tone-deaf American with a let-them-eat-cake attitude.
"Golf is a game where we call penalties on ourselves," Kuchar said in the statement. "I should have done that long ago and not let this situation escalate."
The statement did not specify how much more Kuchar had sent Ortiz's way, but it appears an additional $45,000 was paid out.
Ortiz had been asking for a total of $50,000, according to Marc Graubart, a Houston businessman working on the caddie's behalf, and Kuchar, in his statement, said Ortiz had now been paid what he was seeking.
Kuchar's apology came at the end of a trying week for him, and after a challenging first round on Friday at the Riviera Country Club, where he heard the usual genial chants of "Kooooch" from some of his fans but also a number of barbs from others about his perceived parsimony.
Kuchar, 40, has earned more than $45 million as a professional golfer, but his problems began when he won a tournament in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, that he had basically entered on a whim.
In a typical PGA Tour arrangement, a caddie receives a flat rate of $1,500 for a tournament, which helps cover expenses, and a bonus worth 10 percent of the golfer's winnings. For Ortiz, a local caddie who is also known as El Tucan, that would have amounted to about $130,000.
Instead, Ortiz told Michael Bamberger of Golf.com, he and Kuchar had agreed on a $3,000 payment plus an unspecified amount of whatever money Kuchar won at the tournament.
Kuchar, meanwhile, said he had promised Ortiz $1,000 if he missed the cut, $2,000 if he made the cut, $3,000 for a top-20 finish and $4,000 for a top-10 finish, with no specifications for how much more he would pay Ortiz if he finished first.
Which Kuchar proceeded to do, ending a four-year winless drought. At that point, Kuchar gave Ortiz $5,000 -- the $4,000 he said they had agreed upon for the top-10 finish and a $1,000 bonus. Kuchar confirmed that total to Golf.com and added, "For a guy who makes $200 a day, a $5,000 week is a really big week."
But the tone and content of that comment were quickly pounced on, particularly by people from outside the insular world of golf. And some golf fans weren't too pleased by Kuchar's attitude, either. As Kuchar walked down the first fairway on Friday morning, one fan stopped walking and shouted in Kuchar's direction. "Frugal, just frugal," the fan yelled. "I pay my caddie more."
The fan, Brent Weiss, who described himself as a kindergarten teacher, said Kuchar had been his favorite player. But not anymore.
"How do you tip a caddie $1,000 when you've made $1.3 million?" Weiss said. "To me, I think that's called discrimination."
Weiss added, "I can't even look at the guy."
Not surprisingly, Kuchar also found himself the target of increasing indignation on social media.
In his statement on Friday, Kuchar, who is considered one of the more affable players on the tour, said he viewed his initial comments in defense of the $5,000 payment as "out of touch and insensitive."
"They made it seem like I was marginalizing David Ortiz and his financial situation, which was not my intention," the statement added. "I read them again and cringed. That is not who I am and not what I want to represent."
Kuchar declined to comment as he walked off the course on Friday. When play was halted for the day, he still had five holes to complete in the second round.
A nine-time Tour winner, Kuchar serves as a brand spokesman for several companies, including Skechers shoes, Bridgestone Golf and Royal Bank of Canada. Before turning professional in 2000, Kuchar, who had starred at Georgia Tech, worked for a year as an investment banker.
Ortiz, a father of two, lives in a rented house and takes the bus to his job at the golf course. And the fact that he was paid only $5,000 by Kuchar might not have become as widely known as it did were it not for the efforts of Graubart, who regularly employs Ortiz during golf vacations in Mexico.
In a telephone interview on Thursday, Graubart said he happened to be with Ortiz in Mexico last month when questions about how much Kuchar had paid him surfaced. They saw Kuchar on television during a tournament in Hawaii, telling reporters that he had paid Ortiz more than $3,000 for his services but less than 10 percent of his total earnings.
Graubart said he then quizzed Ortiz about the details of his unwritten agreement with Kuchar. At which point, Graubart said, he explained the typical pay scale to Ortiz, who seemed unaware that he could have earned more money.
Graubart said he and a friend helped Ortiz write emails to Kuchar's agent, Mark Steinberg, requesting more compensation. In a Jan. 23 email, which The New York Times obtained, Ortiz wrote that he had asked Kuchar for a percentage of his first-place check if he were to win. The existence of the emails was first reported by Golf.com.
"Matt said 'sure' with a smile," Ortiz wrote in the email, "not believing that he would actually win the tournament."
A few days later, Graubart said, Ortiz received an offer of $20,000 from a tournament director who appeared to be acting on behalf of Kuchar's agent. But Graubart said Ortiz had requested $50,000, and the caddie then wrote an email asking if he could deal directly with Steinberg, who replied: "I am out of the country. What Matt has offered is fair."
Some golf fans clearly disagreed. A GoFundMe account had been set up on Ortiz's behalf and late on Thursday night, the total had reached $2,226.
But Kuchar had a significant change of heart, and now Ortiz has a lot more than that in his bank account.

Texto completo: “People used to faint to see a tattooed person,” says Mr. G with a grin, gesturing at a pair of black-and-white photographs on the wall.
The photos show a female circus performer whose ink-covered body shocked audiences in the 1920s and ’30s. Today, her chest and back tattoos would hardly raise an eyebrow.
Mr. G and Madame Chinchilla, as they’re known professionally and personally, are tattoo artists and historians who have been collecting stories, photos, artifacts and original “flash” — hand-drawn tattoo designs — since 1986. The couple runs Triangle Tattoo & Museum in Fort Bragg, a working studio and museum that invites the curious to climb a cherry-red staircase and step back into tattoo history.
One of only a few tattoo museums in the world, it is recommended in guide books alongside attractions like Glass Beach and the Guest House Museum. In 2011, the museum was included in the New York Times’ “36 Hours on the Mendocino Coast.” The couple’s labor of love has earned a number of accolades over the years, including the National Tattoo Association’s “Nicest Studio Award.”
Madame Chinchilla and Mr. G compare their museum to a “bizarre reference library.” The collection is organized into exhibits, tracing tattoo culture through groups like the Maori, Native American tribes, sailors and the military, circus performers, motorcycle clubs and prisoners. The museum even has a section on forced tattoos, or those given without consent, with examples of tattooed prisoners, soldiers and slaves dating back to ancient Persia and the Roman Empire.
“We’re all about enriching people’s insight and sparking their curiosity,” said Madame Chinchilla, an artist and documentarian who has written seven books on tattooing.
Tracing their history
Both Mr. G and Madame Chinchilla said they have long been fascinated by the tattoo artists who trained them, and by the earlier artists who trained their teachers.
“I keep track of my lineage,” said Mr. G. “I know that my teacher learned from this teacher and he learned from this teacher, and so on.”
Madame Chinchilla first met Mr. G through mutual friends in 1986. Soon, the couple were inseparable, and Mr. G moved down from Seattle, where he worked as a carpenter. With a thick mustache and visible tattoos, Mr. G said he drew suspicion from local law enforcement.
“When we started out, everyone thought I was a criminal,” he said. “For the first year, I was pulled over like a thousand times. Every branch of the police would try to run me through the computer because I had all of these tattoos.”
Mr. G landed an apprenticeship with Bert Rodriguez, a Mexican-American tattoo artist who had started a Santa Rosa studio in 1978. While Mr. G was learning the ropes from Rodriguez, Madame Chinchilla was busy “documenting everything” with a VHS video camera. Soon after, she also began training to become a tattoo artist.
Holding a Chihuahua with pink-streaked fur, Madame Chinchilla flipped through several books she has produced with Mr. G, including a biography of their friend and mentor Capt. Don Leslie. A tattooed circus performer, sword swallower and talker, Leslie was a colorful character whose connection to tattoos started in 1955.
“He was a talker for the sideshow,” Mr. G said. “So when there was a delay or he needed to fill time, he would tell all kinds of stories about the tattoos on his body, just make things up. He was a good storyteller.”

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
On Tuesday, Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican drug kingpin known as El Chapo, was convicted on drug conspiracy charges in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. This followed an exhaustive three-month trial in which the prosecution dissected almost every detail of Mr. Guzmán's Sinaloa cartel.
After more than a week of deliberations, jurors found Mr. Guzmán guilty on all 10 charges. Here's what you need to know about the conviction and what lies ahead for El Chapo.
Why does this matter?
Mr. Guzmán is arguably the most important drug-related figure ever brought to trial in the United States. Prosecutors estimated that in his 30 years as a trafficker, Mr. Guzmán accumulated nearly $14 billion in earnings.
Prosecutors described his conviction as a watershed moment in America's war on drugs.
"This trial has pulled back the curtain on international drug dealing in a way that no other trial has," said Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York. "It revealed that Guzmán and his co-conspirators were responsible for smuggling hundreds of tons of cocaine, heroine, methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States. It also revealed that they were only able to operate on that scale because of endemic corruption. This is unacceptable and it will end. This is a day of reckoning. But there are more days of reckoning to come."
What exactly did El Chapo get convicted of?
Mr. Guzmán was convicted on 10 counts:
1. Engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise
2. International cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana manufacture and distribution conspiracy
3, 4. Cocaine importation conspiracy
5, 6, 7, 8. International distribution of cocaine
9. Use of firearms
10. Conspiracy to launder narcotics proceeds
For each count, jurors had to answer a series of questions with "guilty or not guilty," "proven or not proven," or simply "yes or no." Jurors checked "guilty," "proven" or "yes" in 51 of the 53 boxes.
The only counts the jury found Mr. Guzman not guilty of were two of the 27 violations contained in the top charge that accused him of running a continuing criminal enterprise for nearly 30 years. Those two violations alleged that he was involved in shipping 19 tons of cocaine on a tanker ship out of Panama that was seized by the United States Coast Guard in March 2007 and that he had also conspired to smuggle more than 400 kilos of marijuana on panga boats captured off the California coast in January 2012.
What will happen to El Chapo?
Mr. Guzmán will likely spend the rest of his life in prison. We won't know exactly where until he is sentenced on June 25.
During that time, Mr. Guzmán is likely to be held at Metropolitan Correctional Center, a jail that has been called tougher than Guantánamo Bay.
Where will El Chapo most likely go to jail?
We won't know until sentencing, but it's probable that Mr. Guzmán will be sent to the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colo., more commonly known as the ADX.
From a New York Times Magazine story from 2015 about the ADX:
The ADX can house up to 500 prisoners in its eight units. Inmates spend their days in 12-by-7-foot cells with thick concrete walls and double sets of sliding metal doors (with solid exteriors, so prisoners can't see one another). A single window, about three feet high but only four inches wide, offers a notched glimpse of sky and little else. Each cell has a sink-toilet combo and an automated shower, and prisoners sleep on concrete slabs topped with thin mattresses. Most cells also have televisions (with built-in radios), and inmates have access to books and periodicals, as well as certain arts-and-craft materials.
Why did it take so long?
Six days of deliberations is not a long time. But as a result of the extensive amount of evidence, many people thought a conviction would happen sooner. But it was a complicated case. Almost 11 weeks of testimony by 56 witnesses for the prosecution produced an exhaustive amount of evidence for jurors to process.
Also, the charges were complicated. For the first count, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, jurors had to determine 27 different violations within that count. For example: "Violation One (International Distribution of Cocaine -- 3,200 kilograms -- January 2005)."
As mentioned earlier, jurors had to work through an eight-page verdict sheet with 53 boxes.
Requests by jurors to see complete transcripts for several witnesses -- including major figures like Jorge and Alex Cifuentes-Villa, Vicente Zambada, Jesus Zambada García and Dámaso López Núñez -- indicated they were being thorough in filling out that sheet.
What will happen to some of the prosecution's cooperating witnesses from the case?
Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López, one of El Chapo's former mistresses who testified about how she once eluded authorities with the kingpin -- naked -- through a tunnel dug beneath a bathtub in his safe house, is awaiting sentencing stemming from her arrest while attempting to enter the United States at a border crossing in San Diego.
Prosecutors will eventually file papers with sentencing recommendations for other witnesses, including the cartel prince, Vicente Zambada Niebla; Vicente's uncle, Jesus Zambada García; and El Chapo's top aide, Dámaso López Núñez. But so far, their dockets don't indicate any (visible) schedules.
One major witness, the Colombian trafficker Alex Cifuentes, may end up testifying in a new cartel trial against Mykhaylo Koretskyy, a Ukranian-born alleged drug trafficker who was arrested in 2018 and then was indicted in federal court in New York on drug smuggling conspiracy charges.
The case, based in Manhattan, will touch on the Sinaloa cartel's Canadian operations. Mr. Cifuentes was instrumental in those.
As a side note, one of El Chapo's lawyers, Jeffrey Lichtman, is representing Mr. Koretskyy, who is still waiting to be extradited from Curacao.
What will happen to Emma Coronel Aispuro, El Chapo's wife?
Ms. Coronel became a favorite of the New York tabloids during the trial. But she will most likely go back to Mexico to take care of her 7-year-old twin daughters.
After the final closing arguments on Jan. 31, Ms. Coronel wrote in Spanish on Instagram: "I have many feelings I find difficult to express." She added: "They won't sell me another version of Joaquin and although much time has passed that we can't have contact, my husband knows how much I love him and always counted, counts and will be able to count on me."
Mr. Lichtman after the verdict said of Mr. Guzmán: "I don't think he'll ever see his wife again other than across the courtroom at the sentencing."
So does this mean the drug war is over?
Well, no. Actually, El Chapo's Sinaloa cartel is still active in Mexico and is one of the leading traffickers of the synthetic opiate fentanyl into the United States.
Also, other cartels, such as the Jalisco New Generation, have risen up to fill any gaps that were left by Mr. Guzmán's arrest.
In fact, Mexican heroin production increased by 37 percent and seizures of fentanyl in places like Nogales more than doubled in 2016 and 2017, the years when the crime lord was most recently arrested and sent to New York for prosecution.
But drug enforcement officials said they believe El Chapo's conviction is a major win in the drug war.
"It is our hope that this verdict will show the entire world no matter who you are or where you are located or how powerful you become, the Drug Enforcement Administration will never stop and you will answer for your crimes," said Uttam Dhillon, acting administrator for the D.E.A. "The D.E.A. will continue to pursue justice worldwide and protect all Americans from this scourge of illegal drugs."

Democrats should take lessons from 2016 GOP field

Texto completo: For the second presidential cycle in a row, a crowded field of candidates has emerged in the race to claim a major party's nomination. The sheer number of hats in the ring could produce a nominee outside the small coterie most pundits expect to win out.
Dubious? Just think about 2016.
In the last presidential election, most of the Republican candidates were seen as beacons of the "establishment." With Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Rick Perry, John Kasich and Chris Christie all competing to win the hearts and minds of more moderate GOP primary voters, Donald Trump won by collecting support from Republicans with an appetite for a different brand of candidate — and he succeeded. In other words, the crowded field opened the door for an outsider who was (and could still be) largely out of step with many others inside his own party.
This time, the situation is flipped. Democrats are the party with the crowded field. But maybe more important, many Democratic candidates are not focusing on winning over moderate voters. Quite the opposite; they're keyed on winning over the Democratic Party's base voters and others on the far left. If history repeats itself, these candidates will end up slicing that electorate into such small portions that they could open the door for a competitor with a different message and outlook.
No one knows who will emerge as the Democratic nominee, and the widely held presumption that the 2016 race would be yet another contest between someone named Bush and someone named Clinton should give prognosticators pause. But the crowded field among Democratic candidates signals that the unexpected today might seem inevitable tomorrow. Voters eager to see a candidate emerge with a promise of getting Democrats and Republicans to work collaboratively should stay engaged.
Nancy Jacobson is a founder of the nonprofit organization No Labels.
What others are saying Dean Obeidallah, CNN.com: "President Donald Trump is now confronted with a gang of women who are all gunning for him. And if he responds in usual Trump fashion, with his no-holds-barred attacks, he could drive away more female voters than he did in the 2018 midterms. That could potentially not only be devastating for Trump, but also for many Republicans on the 2020 ballot."
Tara McGowan, The Hill: "Trump's campaign has excelled at leveraging digital ad dollars to keep the controversies surrounding the Trump administration from reaching his supporter base online. ... Coupled with Trump's own tweets, thousands of Facebook ads placed by his re-election campaign and dozens of conservative 'media outlets' driving the same narrative, Trump's chosen message blanketed the feeds and phones of voters nationwide."
David Leonhardt, The New York Times: "If I were Trump, I would fear Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Either would be well-positioned to take back blue-collar states Trump needs like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and maybe even Ohio and Iowa. They could also play well in the Sunbelt suburbs of Arizona, Florida and North Carolina. And if I were the other 2020 Democrats, I'd be studying how Klobuchar and Brown have succeeded where so many other Democrats have been failing."

Texto completo: It begins with a glance...
Oliver Stilson made his way up the aisle, his phone number on a piece of paper tucked inside a small gift for Margaret McCoy. He then asked the much younger woman to have dinner with him. A few dates later and the two knew it was love.
"She's a good Christian lady," Stilson said, according to WKRC in Knoxville, Tennessee, "...and we just didn't want to part when it came time to go home."
They married last September — he's 95, she's 81.
Gym rats Gertrude Mokotoff and Alvin Mann were introduced while working out. The New York Times says, "In a heartbeat, they became an item." She's older and some called her a cougar, but Alvin says, "Age doesn't mean a d--n thing..."
They married a year and a half ago, just before her 99th birthday and boy-toy Alvin's 94th.
Jim and Janice Catlin, 88 and 86, met on the school bus when they were kids according to Inside Edition. After being separated a while — uh, like 70 years — they married last summer. Their first glance was in 1947.
Three unusual courtships, but nothing compares to the love story of a young princess and warrior who marry and then are separated by her father for at least a decade, perhaps two. It's during a bloody civil war, after the king's death, that this warrior husband says there will be no peace until he has her back.
It sounds like a fairy tale or Hollywood script, but no. The story is true, occurring 1,000 years before Christ — straight from the pages of the Bible. Here's what happens.
There's a great celebration when David kills Goliath. The young shepherd turned soldier is so beloved by the Hebrews that King Saul fears losing his kingdom to David. Originally, Saul had promised his daughter to whomever killed the giant, but that doesn't happen. Instead, Saul asks David for 100 Philistine foreskins as a bride-price for Michal, hoping David will be killed by the enemy. David takes his men and returns with 200 foreskins! 1Samuel 18:25-27
Michal and David then marry, but Saul is determined to kill David and tries again. Michal helps her husband escape, letting him down through a window, and then places his likeness in a bed to trick Saul's soldiers.
It's a dangerous business because Michal's father is losing his mind. King Saul tries to kill his son for taking David's side and is furious with Michal over her deceit. She isn't harmed — not physically — but perhaps pays a steeper price when Saul marries her to another man. 1Samuel 19:8-17, 20:30-33, 25:44
After Saul dies, civil war rages across Israel. David refuses to even consider a truce until Michal is returned to him. Here's an interesting detail. Michal's second husband, Paltiel, weeps as he follows along behind Michal when she's taken away from him, probably by Saul's general, Abner. If Michal cares or even says good-bye, it's not in Scripture.
"Return," Abner orders Paltiel as they reach the border, sending him home.
Would David have killed Paltiel for taking his bride? No one wants to find out, not on the eve of a truce. 2Samuel 2:8-3:16
The love between David and Michal is one of the Bible's great romantic stories. In fact, when Scripture says Michal loved David at 1Samuel 18:20, it's the only place in the Hebrew Bible where a named woman loves a man. That's according to Bible scholar Victor Hamilton.
Today is Valentine's Day. Celebrate. Hold your love close and know that you're blessed!
If you're like I am and sailing solo, Valentine's Day is still for you. Seriously. Hear me out.
Smart churches join together for one big community singles' event, as do other groups. Everyone will be available, so gather your courage and go. "The person who finds a spouse...finds favor from the Lord." Proverbs 18:22
But choose wisely. Don't ask, "Do you attend church?" — trust me, they'll all say yes. Instead, ask about last week's sermon and see what happens. The person who values the Lord worships Him.
Never give up hope. Love can bloom at any time — just ask the Stilsons, Manns, and Catlins.
Remember, it begins with a glance...

Democrats should take lessons from 2016 GOP field

Texto completo: For the second presidential cycle in a row, a crowded field of candidates has emerged in the race to claim a major party's nomination. The sheer number of hats in the ring could produce a nominee outside the small coterie most pundits expect to win out.
Dubious? Just think about 2016.
In the last presidential election, most of the Republican candidates were seen as beacons of the "establishment." With Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Rick Perry, John Kasich and Chris Christie all competing to win the hearts and minds of more moderate GOP primary voters, Donald Trump won by collecting support from Republicans with an appetite for a different brand of candidate — and he succeeded. In other words, the crowded field opened the door for an outsider who was (and could still be) largely out of step with many others inside his own party.
This time, the situation is flipped. Democrats are the party with the crowded field. But maybe more important, many Democratic candidates are not focusing on winning over moderate voters. Quite the opposite; they're keyed on winning over the Democratic Party's base voters and others on the far left. If history repeats itself, these candidates will end up slicing that electorate into such small portions that they could open the door for a competitor with a different message and outlook.
No one knows who will emerge as the Democratic nominee, and the widely held presumption that the 2016 race would be yet another contest between someone named Bush and someone named Clinton should give prognosticators pause. But the crowded field among Democratic candidates signals that the unexpected today might seem inevitable tomorrow. Voters eager to see a candidate emerge with a promise of getting Democrats and Republicans to work collaboratively should stay engaged.
Nancy Jacobson is a founder of the nonprofit organization No Labels.
What others are saying Dean Obeidallah, CNN.com: "President Donald Trump is now confronted with a gang of women who are all gunning for him. And if he responds in usual Trump fashion, with his no-holds-barred attacks, he could drive away more female voters than he did in the 2018 midterms. That could potentially not only be devastating for Trump, but also for many Republicans on the 2020 ballot."
Tara McGowan, The Hill: "Trump's campaign has excelled at leveraging digital ad dollars to keep the controversies surrounding the Trump administration from reaching his supporter base online. ... Coupled with Trump's own tweets, thousands of Facebook ads placed by his re-election campaign and dozens of conservative 'media outlets' driving the same narrative, Trump's chosen message blanketed the feeds and phones of voters nationwide."
David Leonhardt, The New York Times: "If I were Trump, I would fear Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Either would be well-positioned to take back blue-collar states Trump needs like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and maybe even Ohio and Iowa. They could also play well in the Sunbelt suburbs of Arizona, Florida and North Carolina. And if I were the other 2020 Democrats, I'd be studying how Klobuchar and Brown have succeeded where so many other Democrats have been failing."

Gadsden Arts Center shows off its 'Roots'

Texto completo: "Roots," a new exhibition of work from the Gadsden Arts Center & Museum Permanent Collection, brings to the public great works of art by artists from the Big Bend Region, many of which are on public view for the first time.
North Florida is home to a great many visual artists, and promoting their work is a founding principle of the Gadsden Arts. The museum's work to preserve their work through the permanent collection protects our region's cultural history for present and future generations.
"Roots" features work by many artists from the region, notably including Dean Mitchell, Beth Appleton, William Thursby, and Joe McFadden.
Mitchell's oil painting, "Laid Back" depicts a local man from Mitchell's home town of Quincy, Florida who worked at Willie Ward's Body Shop. The painting was featured in the "Black Romantic" exhibition at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 2002, from which New York Times art critic Michael Kimmelman dubbed Mitchell a "virtual modern-day Vermeer." The painting was then purchased by a private collector in Hilton Head, SC who in 2018 gave the painting to the Gadsden Arts Center & Museum.
Beth Appleton's "Back to the Garden" is a tribute to the special relationship Appleton has with Quincy and its residents, and was shown in the first exhibition in the Gadsden Arts Bell & Bates Building in 2000. A "Back to the Garden" Challenge was sent out to Gadsden Arts members asking them to contribute money to help buy the piece, a successful effort that made this the first piece acquired for the Permanent Collection.
"East Winds" is a meticulous drawing created by William "Bill" Thursby as a wedding gift. It was later donated to the Gadsden Art Center & Museum by the groom's parents. Thursby's art is closely associated with the early days of Gadsden Arts — his artwork was selected for the 1993 Art in Gadsden poster, and he was given a solo exhibition of his work at Gadsden Arts in its original location on Adams Street in 1997.
"Prospero" by Joe McFadden was commissioned by Janet Hinkle for the Tallahassee Shakespeare Festival in 2000, and depicts the main character from The Tempest delivering one of the most memorable speeches in Shakespearean literature. It was painted just before the festival closed its doors. After arriving in Tallahassee in the 1960s, McFadden went on to win more than 100 awards from his paintings and watercolors in juried exhibitions across the United States.
Roots opened Feb. 2, and will remain on view in the Bates Permanent Collection Gallery through the end of this year. Roots will give visitors to the museum a chance to view a diverse sampling of regional artists whose work is included in the Gadsden Arts Center & Museum Permanent Collection.
The Gadsden Arts Center & Museum is located at 13 N. Madison Street, Quincy, just 25 minutes from Tallahassee. Galleries and museum shop are open Tuesday–Saturday 10am to 5pm. The ArtZone is open for drop-in fun Fridays and Saturdays 10am-5pm, admission-free. Exhibition admission is $5-$10 for adult nonmembers, with a variety of special admission programs. Group visits and guided group tours are available by appointment, 850-627-5023. Information www.gadsdenarts.org.

GENDER POLITICS AND AMY KLOBUCHAR

Autor: Fanlund, Paul. 

Información de publicación: Madison Capital Times ; Madison, Wis. [Madison, Wis]. 13 Feb 2019: 4.

Texto completo: As I approached, Amy Klobuchar sat studying papers at an out-of-the-way table in the Gordon Dining and Event Center on a Saturday morning in fall 2017.
She had just spoken to a student group from the University of Wisconsin-Madison's La Follette School of Public Affairs. I introduced myself, thanked her for accepting our invitation to the Cap Times Idea Fest, and explained the logistics of her appearance before what would be a large and appreciative audience that day.
In that encounter and during her public remarks, she was self-deprecating, funny and the epitome of the "Minnesota nice" for which she is known. The first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from her state, she seemed to get along with the male aide who accompanied her. She was also gracious later as she slipped into a car waiting to take her to a Tammy Baldwin fundraiser.
Now, as she announces her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, I come to learn just what kind of monster she's allegedly been to work for, if you believe the anonymous sources.
That's the takeaway from the breathless, and, in my view, sexist reporting from HuffPost.
Klobuchar, a third-term senator who has won her state by wide margins, kicked off her campaign Sunday on a snowy day before a boisterous crowd on the banks of the Mississippi River.
The New York Times' characterization was typical of the media coverage, saying Klobuchar "entered the race ... hopeful that her moderate politics, Midwestern roots and carefully cultivated history of bipartisanship can appeal to a broad swath of voters in contentious times."
Later in the story, the Times, like others writing about her announcement, alluded to reports that Klobuchar has long been regarded as hard to work for.
The Times reported that "despite Ms. Klobuchar's friendly public persona, she's said to be a difficult boss. A survey of senators by the website LegiStorm (which measures staff turnover among other things) revealed that from 2001 to 2016 her office had the highest turnover in the Senate. 'I have high expectations,' " she told the Times by way of response last year.
This, of course, delights Republicans. "She has virtually no grass-roots backing and even her own staff is complaining that she's 'intolerably cruel,' " a spokesman for the Republican National Committee said in a statement reported in the Times.
Pause on that: the party of Donald Trump complaining that a Democratic politician manifests intolerable cruelty.
Back to HuffPost's journalism and what it describes as its "scoop."
Its initial story, timed days before her formal announcement, quoted anonymous sources and proclaimed in a headline that her "mistreatment of staff scared off candidates to manage her presidential bid."
The story did not appear to break much new ground. Politico had previously mentioned Klobuchar in a story about the "worst bosses" in Congress, citing the LegiStorm numbers. The Politico story added this: "But LegiStorm declined to guess whether the high turnover stems from a toxic work environment or employees simply advancing in their careers."
HuffPost followed with a story two days later based on "multiple unnamed sources" that was headlined: "Harry Reid Rebuked Amy Klobuchar for Mistreatment of Staff." Reid, the retired Senate Democratic leader, said in the story he did not recall such a conversation and called Klobuchar "one of the most brilliant, hardest-working members of the Senate."
By the day of her formal announcement, HuffPost was back with a self-congratulatory newsletter post sent to its "Must Reads" subscribers. It described the senator as "dogged" by the accusations against her.
In that newsletter, one of the reporters, Molly Redden, described a divided reaction to the HuffPost reporting: "There are tons of readers who think the coverage is sexist," she said. "They're asking us, 'How come these stories are never written about men?' "
She acknowledged that "everyone in the news chain ... is probably more accommodating of a bad boss who's a man," and says she already has a "list going" about bad male bosses.
Wonder if those stories about bad male bosses will be published at the precise moment those guys are announcing for president?
A woman quoted by the Times at Klobuchar's announcement got to the essence of it: "When a woman is demanding and wants something and wants people to perform, it's seen as difficult. I've had a lot of demanding bosses, male bosses, in my life, and nothing was said of them. They were told they were great leaders."
The sexist treatment, to me, recalls the false equivalencies of 2016 between Hillary Clinton and Trump, when Clinton's email problems and standoffish persona somehow equated to Trump's all-embracing awful character.
Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin aptly summarized Trump in a recent column: "President Donald Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women; was accused by numerous women of sexual harassment or assault; endorsed a candidate for Senate who was credibly accused of child molestation; praised an aide despite photographic evidence supporting accusations of spousal abuse; directed that hush money be paid to women in advance of the 2016 election (arguably in violation of federal campaign finance laws); and routinely smeared and insulted women.
"He refused to divest his business properties, leading to widespread conflicts of interest and receipt of potentially unconstitutional emoluments. He repeatedly interfered with an ongoing investigation and was forced to close his foundation after discovery of widespread financial impropriety."
And oh, by the way, Trump's willingness to humiliate staff - including former senior military officials - is legendary.
Thinking about Klobuchar, I was reading the latest edition of Bloomberg Businessweek magazine and its cleverly headlined cover story: "Did Foxconn Con Wisconsin?"
Deep in the story about how Terry Gou, the Foxconn chairman, had out-maneuvered Trump and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, is this reference to Gou's leadership style: "Gou, a demanding leader notorious for punishing underperforming managers by making them stand for long periods during meetings, is an aggressive negotiator who in an interview once described Genghis Khan as his personal hero."
Trump, in remarks at the Foxconn site last summer, said this of Gou, according to the transcript: "I want to be thanking Terry Gou, chairman of Foxconn and a friend of mine. One of the most successful businessmen in the world. Very few people even close. And I want to thank him for investing in Wisconsin and investing in the United States."
Nope, there's no sexist double standard for Klobuchar.

Texto completo: Even in the age of #MeToo, a woman who reports a high-profile man raped her, especially decades later, faces scrutiny and doubt. When she reports a second rape? That increased criticism is what Meredith Watson is facing this week.
Watson came forward on Friday to say that Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax raped her when they were students at Duke in 2000. She did so to support Vanessa Tyson, who previously said that Fairfax sexually assaulted her in 2004. Fairfax has denied assaulting both women.
After Watson’s lawyer released a statement about Fairfax, she released another one stating Fairfax “revealed that Ms. Watson was the victim of a prior rape. ” The attorney confirmed that, adding that Watson reported to a dean at Duke, who discouraged her from pursuing it further.
A friend of Watson’s, attorney R. Stanton Jones, confirmed to USA TODAY that Watson told him Corey Maggette raped her. Maggette played one season at Duke in 1999 before going on to a 14-year NBA career. In a statement to the New York Times, Maggette denied sexually assaulting Watson.
Doubly disbelieved?
If Watson faced the usual skepticism that greets women when they accuse a powerful man of rape when she spoke out about Fairfax, that seemed to be compounded when news of the second assault hit social media.
But that’s not consistent with the research on the prevalence of revictimization, experts said.
“Many people don’t realize the prevalence of sexual assault and how many people are actually survivors of sexual assault,” said Kathy Hodges, deputy director of the Durham (North Carolina) Crisis Response Center.
Hodges started work as a rape crisis counselor in 1982 and said while her center doesn’t measure repeat victimization, she said she sees it in “many” cases.
“It’s not like lightning striking twice. It’s more like getting knocked down by a wave twice,” she said. “It happens to a lot of people, and it’s not uncommon for it to happen a second time, at all. People are in denial about how frequently sexual assault happens. ”
Revictimization isn't rare
Research shows that not only is sexual assault common, but so is revictimization.
A 2017 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined nonfatal violent victimizations from 2005-2014, finding that 31% of rape or sexual assault victims experienced repeated victimization. That represented a great percentage than repeat victimization for victims of robbery, simple assault and aggravated assault.
The report also found nearly 16 percent of rape or sexual assault victims experienced two or more rape or sexual assault victimizations within a year, roughly double the repeat victimization for victims of robbery or aggravated assault.
A 2017 study published in Violence Against Women tracked 1,012 women in Chicago over a three-year period, finding 49% of the survivors “experienced some form of revictimization” in the last two years of the study. Most commonly, that was unwanted sexual contact, followed by coercion, attempted or completed forcible sexual assault and attempted or completed substance-involved assault.
“One of the best predictors of future victimization is past victimization. That’s something that we see across multiple forms of crime,” said Laura Palumbo, communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. “The unfortunate way that victims are responded to is often that they’re less believed and they are taken to be less credible. ”
Several studies have established a relationship between sexual abuse or assault in childhood and sexual victimization in adulthood. A National Institute of Justice report from 2000 found women who said they were raped before they turned 18 “were twice as likely to report being raped as an adult. ”
Target on your back?
Less clear than the prevalence of revictimization is the explanation as to why it happens. Experts who spoke with USA TODAY cautioned against blaming victims, saying the perpetrators are responsible for their actions.
Kristina Rose, executive director of End Violence Against Women International, said multiple factors can contribute to someone being sexually assaulted a second time, including “situational variables, such as socioeconomic status; the vulnerability of the particular person; psychological factors, whether they’re severely depressed, sometimes as a result of an earlier trauma. ”
“These traumatic events kind of build on each other,” Rose said.
Common results of assault, such as anxiety or depression, substance use or abuse or self-doubt may be exploited by perpetrators, resulting in revictimization, Palumbo said.
“It’s about the perpetrator trying to choose someone that they think is going to be easy and is not going to report and that they can get away with it,” Hodges said. “Knowing that someone hasn’t reported before or reported and had a bad experience, certainly would make them more attractive if you were someone who might be interested in perpetrating. ”
Mark Relyea, who co-authored the Chicago study with Sarah Ullman at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said a hostile environment toward survivors was one of the “most consistent predictors of revictimization. ”
“What we don’t necessarily know why this is true,” said Relyea, who is now an associate research scientist at Yale School of Medicine. “We know that when people tend to blame survivors, that increases the risk of survivors having more post-traumatic stress symptoms and engaging in more maladaptive coping skills … and those things might increase risk of revictimization. "
The opposite, "socially supporting women survivors and providing tangible and emotional support" may decrease revictimization, he said.
What statistics say about false reporting
Those reasons for not reporting can be all too familiar to someone who has been revictimized.
“They may have concrete examples of the types of consequences victims face when they come forward,” said Palumbo. “They may have experienced harassment after coming forward, threats. They may have had people in their life that turned against them or faced social isolation or lost relationships. They may have faced a lot of emotional turmoil in coming forward and not being believed and not being supported. They’re needing to force themselves to relive all of that, in addition to all that uncertainty and whether or not they will be believed, as well as those tangible experiences of trauma that survivors relive when they tell their stories. ”
Underlying some of those fears is a cultural misconception about the instances of false reporting, experts said. According to multiple studies, estimates put false reports to law enforcement at 2% to 8%.
“False reports of rape are rare,” Rose said.
Sexual assault victims face myriad barriers in reporting, including fear of being disbelieved or blamed, repercussions on relationships, shame or embarrassment.
MORE: Why didn't you report? Shame, shame, shame
The barriers to reporting can be exacerbated when the alleged perpetrator is well known or a public figure, experts said.
Sexual assault remains one of the most underreported crimes nationally. A 2016 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics found 23% of rapes or sexual assaults were reported to police. The bureau's 2017 report showed that 40% of those crimes were reported.
“People are becoming so much better educated, but it’s shocking how little the general public really knows about sexual assault," Rose said. "And how quick they are to judge these women that come forward. ”

Texto completo: "Should I go into more debt to start my business?"
The woman was soft-spoken, polite, patient. She had waited until the end of an Inc. conference session I was moderating, about how small-business owners could get loans and other financing, to approach me with her story. She was trying to pay off a sizable amount of credit card debt, and she wanted my advice: Could she make money more quickly by starting her own business? Would that be worth going deeper into the hole?
Launching a startup might seem like a good way to get rich quick – or at least get out of debt – at a time when companies like Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb have raised billions of dollars apiece. But such high-profile success stories are the exceptions to the brutal rule for entrepreneurs: About half of all startups fail within five years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and two-thirds fail within 10 years.
"That means you have a high probability of losing any and all money you put into your business," I write in my book "Startup Money Made Easy: The Inc. Guide to Every Financial Question About Starting, Running, and Growing Your Business" (HarperCollins Leadership, 240 pp.).
It's an important warning, but not a blanket one. Starting a business can be exhilarating, life-changing and financially rewarding – as Daymond John, Sallie Krawcheck, Jack Ma, Bobbi Brown, and many other successful startup founders describe in the book. You just have to know what you're getting into, and how to take the right risks. For example:
Can you afford to live without a salary for a year or more? The most successful startup CEOs often wait months before they start paying themselves, Inc. data show. Only 28 percent of respondents to the 2018 Inc. 5000 CEO survey, which polls the heads of the fastest-growing private companies in America, started taking a salary immediately after starting their business. When they did start paying themselves, 45 percent of these CEOs paid themselves less than $50,000 annually. That's not exactly Jeff Bezos money.
Have you written out a business plan, complete with a financial section? Yes, most business plans rarely anticipate all the realities of running a business. But spending time predicting your expenses, cash flow and break-even point will force you to think through the risks you're about to take. It also will get you ready to raise money and apply for loans, since outside investors and banks will expect to see a business plan.
Do you know how much money you need to start your business? Finally, some good news: It's easier and cheaper than ever to start a company these days. Think less than $5,000; that's what 42 percent of 2018 Inc. 5000 CEO survey respondents said they used to start their first business. You might need more than that, or less; it depends on factors including where you live, the type of company you want to start, and how many employees you need. But if you've saved up a few thousand dollars to invest in your dream company, and you can afford to risk it all, you may be in good shape to take the startup risk.
Which is why I begged that woman at the conference to avoid that risk right now. I recommended that she get in touch with the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, a nonprofit adviser for people struggling with debt, and focus on trying to get her financial health back, first. I hope that she'll soon be in a place where she can start her business – and where she, and everyone else who wants to start a business, can afford to take the right entrepreneurial risks.

Texto completo: DEARBORN, Mich. — Former colleagues including Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia; Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan; and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, paid tribute to John Dingell at 30,000 feet on Tuesday as their flight to Michigan for the lawmaker's funeral was turned back due to wintry weather.
The funeral for Dingell, the longest-serving member of Congress in US history, went ahead with former vice president Joe Biden eulogizing the Michigan Democrat.
"Dignity was how John walked. Dignity was how John talked. Dignity was how John carried himself. And more than that, it was how he treated everyone — and I mean everyone," Biden said.
Dingell died Feb. 7 at the age of 92. He had complications from prostate cancer.
According to two Democratic aides, the two military transport planes taking lawmakers to the funeral were unable to land in Detroit due to bad weather and were forced to return to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.
Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, tweeted that lawmakers held an "impromptu service at 30,000 feet" for Dingell, led by Lewis, Upton, and Pelosi.
Several other lawmakers, including Michigan's Democratic Senator Gary Peters and Representatives Daniel Kildee and Haley Stevens, tweeted that they were disappointed their plane was turned around and that they were unable to make it to the funeral.
"We shared a prayer for him in the sky, and felt a bit closer to the Dean in heaven," Stevens said in a tweet, referring to Dingell's title as the longest-serving House member.
Dingell served in Congress from 1955 until retiring in 2015.

Trump critics to help House panel with inquiries
WASHINGTON — Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said Tuesday that they have retained two elite white collar litigators and prominent legal critics of President Trump to help begin inquiries into some of the most sensitive allegations involving the president, including ethics violations, corruption, and possible obstruction of justice.
The committee's chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, has not committed to opening a formal impeachment inquiry, but the addition of the two lawyers, Norman L. Eisen and Barry H. Berke, indicates that the Democrats do not intend to wait for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to finish his work to begin weighing issues that could ultimately be wrapped up in such a proceeding.
“The president of the United States faces numerous allegations of corruption and obstruction," Nadler said in a statement announcing the decision. “His conduct and crude statements threaten the basic legal, ethical, and constitutional norms that maintain our democratic institutions. Congress has a constitutional duty to be a check and balance against abuses of power when necessary."
Eisen, 58, served as the top White House ethics lawyer under President Barack Obama and later as his ambassador to the Czech Republic. A former white collar litigator and investigator, he has emerged since Trump's election as one of the president's most recognizable legal critics, using his perch as chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington to write voluminously about what he has argued are ethical lapses and instances of outright corruption in his administration.
Eisen also serves as a cocounsel in a lawsuit accusing Trump of violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution by refusing to divorce himself from his businesses.
Berke, a partner at the New York firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, has written extensively with Eisen about obstruction of justice and the president's other legal vulnerabilities. He has long experience with complicated financial and tax crimes cases.

Cameraman attacked at president's rally
A belligerent man at President Trump's campaign rally on the Texas border apparently attacked news crews, shoving and swearing at a photojournalist from the BBC, according to reports and a spokeswoman for the network.
The BBC said cameraman Ron Skeans was "violently pushed and shoved by a member of the crowd" while covering the rally Monday night in El Paso, about a mile from the US-Mexico border. BBC spokeswoman Charlotte Morgan said in a statement Tuesday to The Washington Post: "The man was removed by security, and Ron is fine. The president could see the incident and checked with us that all was OK."
"It is clearly unacceptable for any of our staff to be attacked for doing their job," she added.
It is unclear whether the man, who has not been publicly identified, will be charged.
When asked about the incident during Monday night's rally, Michael Glassner, who leads the Trump campaign, said in a statement to the Post that "An individual involved in a physical altercation with a news cameraman was removed from last night's rally."
"We appreciate the swift action from venue security and law enforcement officers," he added.
Skeans, the cameraman, told BBC News that he did not see the man in the crowd coming at him, but he felt a "very hard shove" that almost knocked him down.
"I didn't know what was going on," he said.
Video that appeared to be from Skeans's camera showed it falling toward the ground. Seconds later, when the picture was restored, a man in a red Make America Great Again hat could be seen being restrained as he shouted, "[Expletive] the media!"
Trump has repeatedly attacked the US news media, labeling journalists the "enemy of the American people" and calling much of their coverage of him "fake news."
Describing the Monday altercation, a reporter for the Washington Examiner wrote on Twitter that leading up to the encounter, Trump had "railed against all the media."
After the incident, however, Trump pointed toward the crowd and asked: "You all right? Everything OK?"
Then he flashed a thumbs up.

Calhoun in D-III: 'I can make a mark'; COLLEGE BASKETBALL

Texto completo: WEST HARTFORD - The afternoon high was 12 degrees, and as soon as the sun set, the temperatures dropped quickly into single digits. The middle of winter in New England: A perfect time for a 76-year-old man who loves to play golf to be somewhere in the South, enjoying warmth and the fruits of a Hall of a Fame career as a basketball coach.
Instead, Jim Calhoun sat in a tiny locker room inside the O'Connell Center at the University of St. Joseph, a school of a little more than 1,000 undergraduates that began admitting men in the fall.
"It's all the same," he said, twisting his hands nervously in front of him. "And it's not the same."
"Five minutes, Coach," called Ben Wallek, his team manager.
There would be about 500 people in the building, almost a sellout, for a recent game between St. Joseph and Johnson & Wales. This is Calhoun's team now - his life, one he eagerly chose - more than six years after retiring from UConn, nearly eight years since coaching it to the national title in front of 75,421 in Houston's Reliant Stadium and almost 14 years after his induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
In 26 seasons at UConn, Calhoun built from next to nothing a program that won three national championships and produced NBA players by the bushel. "Nineteen lottery picks," Calhoun likes to point out. Which is why it made sense for him to quietly move full time to his home on Hilton Head after he stepped down in 2012. He'd had myriad health problems, including three bouts with cancer and two serious bicycle accidents.
"I was beat up when I stopped," he admitted, sitting in the tiny office he occupies in O'Connell Center. "I was hobbling badly because of the bike accident I'd had, and I was tired. I was 70. It was the right time."
Calhoun's last couple of years at UConn were the best of times and the worst of times. There was the out-of-nowhere national title in 2011, when UConn went into the Big East tournament as the No. 9 seed and then won 11 consecutive postseason games to claim Calhoun's third national championship.
But there was also an embarrassing NCAA investigation involving a former manager offering illegal inducements to a recruit, and academic issues during Calhoun's final years that landed the school on probation during Kevin Ollie's first season as Calhoun's successor.
Even with his iconic status in Connecticut sealed, Calhoun was restless. He worked about 30 games a year for ESPN, keeping his hand in the game, but it wasn't the same.
"I missed the highs, and I missed the lows," he said. "More than anything, I missed having something at stake."
He flirted with Boston College in 2014 but ultimately decided it was too soon to come back, especially to an ACC program that would need a deep-dive effort to rebuild.
Then came a call from Bill Cardarelli, an old friend who had been the longtime athletic director at St. Joseph. The school, founded in 1932, was planning to admit men for the first time beginning in the fall of 2018. Cardarelli wanted to know if Calhoun would help him put together a men's basketball team.
"I have no idea how many games we'll win or how long I'll stay," he said. "But I feel like I can make a mark here - on the school, on the kids. That means something to me."
It wasn't until this past September that the school formally announced that Calhoun would coach. By then, he had spent months scouting players and recruiting a team. ESPN had a camera crew begin following him in April. The New York Times did a long story on Calhoun's return. WTIC, the 50,000 watt Hartford radio station, signed on to broadcast home games. Joe D'Ambrosio, the play-by-play man throughout Calhoun's UConn tenure, does the play-by-play.
"If nothing else, St. Joseph has to be the only D-III team in history with its games on a 50,000-watt radio station," D'Ambrosio said, laughing.
When word got out that Calhoun would coach the basketball team, applications jumped at St. Joseph. "They told me it was 115 percent higher," Calhoun said. "They call it the Calhoun Effect."
There was just one roadblock in the way of his return: another bout with cancer. This time it was stomach cancer, unrelated to the previous bouts with prostate cancer and skin cancer. Calhoun had been undergoing chemotherapy until this past fall when his doctors told him surgery was the best option. And so, on Oct. 8 - a week before the start of practice - Calhoun had about 60 percent of his stomach removed.
Nine days later, he was on the sideline for practice, watching Glenn Miller, the former Brown and Penn head coach and Calhoun's longtime assistant at UConn, run the workouts with a roster of 18 freshmen and one sophomore - a Division I transfer. Since there are no scholarships in Division III, Calhoun could bring in as many players as he wanted.
When the season opened on Nov. 6, Calhoun was 100 percent Calhoun, pushing everyone in his orbit to the limit.
"I always believed in creating a certain amount of chaos when I coached," he said. "Some years, I pushed the chaos too far. But the players have to know that I need them to care as much as I care."
In the season opener, a victory over William Paterson, it took Calhoun less than 16 minutes to draw his first technical foul. Six weeks later, he got tossed out of a loss to LaGrange. The next night, he calmed down and only drew one technical during a win over Rockford.
Since then, he hasn't been teed up, but that doesn't mean he isn't all over the officials. His Blue Jays are 13-10 overall and at 4-5, in the lower half of the pack in the Great Northeast Athletic Conference. St. Joe's has two regular-season games remaining and is tied for the eighth and final spot in the postseason tournament.
Following a recent overtime loss to Johnson & Wales, winning coach Jamie Benton talked about going up against the Hall of Famer.
"It was intense to say the least," he said. "Now, I'm coaching against him and when I shake hands with him before the game I think, 'Wow, there's the legend.' Then the game starts and I see the same young coach I remember at Northeastern."
He shook his head. "He's coaching basically an all-freshman team. You look at them and know they're going to get a lot better with him coaching in a hurry."

Texto completo: “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” President Trump declared in his State of the Union address. It was a line that could have been delivered by President Barack Obama, who in 2015 memorably said, “I do not support the idea of endless war.”
Just a few days before Trump’s address, his own party delivered the president a stinging rebuke when Senate Republicans passed a resolution opposing his Syrian and Afghan withdrawals by an overwhelming bipartisan 68-to-23 vote. Trump’s defenders say: That’s just the foreign policy establishment advocating “forever war.” When, they ask, will these wars end? When will we be able to declare victory and go home?
These are fair questions, and they deserve serious answers.
In traditional wars, defining victory is easy. Victory comes when the enemy surrenders and lays down its arms. But this is not traditional war. We are not fighting nation-states with defined borders and armies, navies and air forces. We are fighting radical Islamist terrorists who are engaged in what Osama bin Laden called “a war of destiny between infidelity and Islam.” There will be no signing ceremony on the deck of the U.S.S. Missouri. They will never lay down their arms. In this war, victory for the United States is every day that passes without a terrorist attack on American soil. And that daily victory is made possible because the men and women of the U.S. military are hunting the enemy in faraway lands.
America’s enemies have a very clear definition of victory. For them, victory comes when we give up the fight before they do. We know this because they have told us so. The 9/​11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told his CIA interrogator “Americans don’t realize we do not need to defeat you militarily; we only need to fight long enough for you to defeat yourself by quitting.” That is how the terrorists see Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 and Trump’s planned withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan: America defeating itself by quitting.
It is understandable that, after 18 years, Americans want the war to end. But what we want is irrelevant. We don’t get to decide unilaterally that the war is over. The enemy gets a vote. Just because we have tired of fighting doesn’t mean that they have.
Here is the hard truth: We don’t get to choose when the war ends, but we do get to choose where it is fought. It can either be fought over there, in the deserts of Syria and the mountains of Afghanistan, or it can be fought over here -- on American streets and in American cities, as it was on Sept. 11, 2001. It’s up to us.
Trump deserves enormous credit for taking the gloves off in the fight against the terrorists. He was absolutely correct when he declared in the State of the Union address, “When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters.” But the Islamic State is not defeated. It still has tens of thousands of fighters under arms and, according to one estimate by the Institute for the Study of War, as much as $400 million it smuggled out of Iraq, money that can be used to sustain its movement and plan attacks across the world.
In Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence estimates there are about 20 terrorist groups - including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State affiliate known as Islamic State Khorasan, or IS-K - who would immediately gain an uncontested sanctuary from which to plan new attacks if America withdraws. On Jan. 28, the New York Times reported that a 2017 intelligence assessment, renewed last year, “says a complete withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan would lead to an attack on the United States within two years.”
Right now, the U.S. military has its boot on the terrorists’ necks. They are focused on survival, not on launching faraway attacks. Take that boot away, though, and the terrorists will get up, dust themselves off, regroup, rebuild and go back to trying to kill Americans in the United States.
In his address, Trump praised the heroism of the men who stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. “They did not know if they would survive the hour,” he said. “They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail.”
The same is true today. Great nations do not quit before they prevail.

Texto completo: For the third year running, Pittsburgh Opera's new season includes contemporary work with a militant flair. In 2018, Jeremy Howard Beck's "The Long Walk" centered on a soldier's reintegration into civilian life. This year's "Glory Denied" by Tom Cipullo is about Vietnam War veteran Col. Floyd "Jim" Thompson, the longest held prisoner of war in American history.
The 2019-20 season, the company's 81st, also includes Peter Hilliard's "The Last American Hammer," a satirical treatment of a one-man militia raging against the tyranny of the federal government.
"It's just a delicious idea," said Christopher Hahn, Pittsburgh Opera's general director. "It's deeply timely and quite wacky."
Mr. Hahn, who regularly travels to hear stagings of new works, said that younger composers have lately been especially focused on war. "There's just inherent conflict to war and the military that makes it ripe for operatic treatment."
"The Last American Hammer" (Feb. 22-March 1, 2020) will be performed at the opera's headquarters in the Strip District. The four main stage productions will be at the Benedum Center, Downtown, as usual. Next year's season includes such staples as Bizet's "Carmen" and Mozart's "Don Giovanni" as well as Bellini's "Norma" and Mexican composer Daniel Catan's "Florencia en el Amazonas," which will be sung in Spanish.
The season also includes a baroque offering, Handel's "Alcina" at Pittsburgh CAPA School Theater, Downtown, as well as numerous free performances and recitals, educational talks and artist meet-and-greets, and fundraising events.
"Florencia en el Amazonas" has taken the place of what was supposed to be a world-premiere production of Mohammed Fairouz's "Bhutto," which will no longer debut next season.
Pittsburgh Opera 2019-20 season
"Don Giovanni" (Oct. 12-20): Mozart's take on the famous womanizer Don Juan has been given a Hollywood-slick, film noir gloss in this season-opening production. Former Pittsburgh Opera resident artist Craig Verm returns to star as the dreaded Don Giovanni. Corrie Stallings and South African bass-baritone Musa Ngqungwana return as Donna Elvira and Leporello, respectively.
"Florencia en el Amazonas" (Nov. 9-17): Based on the famous novel "Love in the Time of Cholera" by Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, this opera explores the tale of singer Florencia Grimaldi as she performs in Brazil in the early 1900s and searches for her lost love, a butterfly hunter. Soprano Alexandra Loutsion stars as Florencia, with Nathan Gunn and Sandra Piques Eddy.
"Alcina" (Jan. 25-Feb. 2, 2020): Pittsburgh Opera's resident artists take center stage for Handel's "Alcina," the tale of an evil sorceress living on an enchanted island with her sister, Morgana, bewitching men and turning them into inanimate objects. Soprano Caitlin Gotimer sings as Alcina, and Pittsburgh's early music ensemble Chatham Baroque collaborates on this production.
"The Last American Hammer" (Feb. 22-March 1, 2020): A one-man militia and conspiracy theorist faces off against a rookie FBI field specialist in a Toby jug museum while a curatrix serves tea and cookies. "The Last American Hammer" premiered in 2018; this production will feature Caitlin Gotimer and Antonia Botti-Lodovico with a not-yet-announced male voice leading as militia man Milcolm Negley.
"Carmen" (March 28-April 5, 2020): Latvian mezzo Zanda Svede makes her Pittsburgh Opera debut as "Carmen" alongside Michael Todd Simpson as Escamillo.
"Norma" (April 25-May 3, 2020): The role of Norma - a jealous, jilted Druid priestess - has been termed "The Everest of opera" by The New York Times due to its technical demands. Soprano Leah Crocetto returns to Pittsburgh to shoulder the role in the company's season finale.

Rabbi worked to build Israeli-evangelical ties

Texto completo: "No Jew since Jesus has commanded this kind of gentile following," journalist Zev Chafets once wrote of Yechiel Eckstein, an Israeli American rabbi who - with extravagant success, and more than modest controversy over three decades - rallied moral and financial support for Israel among American evangelicals.
Mr. Eckstein, 67, who died Feb. 6 after a heart attack at his home in Jerusalem, founded the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews in 1983. Established in Chicago, the organization is today building a new headquarters in Jerusalem. The group reports that, since its creation, it has raised more than $1.6 billion to support impoverished Israelis, Holocaust survivors and Jews across the diaspora; to bring Jews to Israel; and to serve ethnic minorities including Arabs in the Jewish state.
Much of that money came in small donations from evangelicals in the United States, a population that few Jewish leaders before Mr. Eckstein had attempted to reach. He sought to overcome the distrust that had long colored the relationship between the two faiths, harking back to a passage in Genesis: "I will bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel."
He appeared in commercials or infomercials that aired on outlets including the Fox News Channel and Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, campaigns that met with enormous success.
"I have people sending me 10 percent of their Social Security checks," he once told the Jerusalem Report, "car washers in Florida writing to me to help the elderly Jews in Kiev buy fuel; a 53-year-old man so touched by my newsletter that he sent me his entire life savings - $11,000 - which we returned."
As his profile grew, Mr. Eckstein became a force on both sides of the theological divide. In Israel, the Fellowship became one of the country's largest charitable organizations. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin lauded Mr. Eckstein as "a great man, a great Jew and a great Zionist."
In the United States, Mr. Eckstein formed close relationships with evangelical leaders including Robertson, Jerry Falwell and Ralph Reed. He met with leaders including Condoleezza Rice, then serving as President George W. Bush's national security adviser, and in 2018 held a Fellowship gala at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida.
But along with influence came criticism. Some Jews opposed his association with the religious right, whom they viewed as proselytizers motivated by a biblical prophecy linking the return of Jews to Israel with the Second Coming of Christ.
"Eckstein is selling the dignity of the Jewish people and the state of Israel by pandering to Christians for money," Abraham Foxman, the longtime national director of the Anti-Defamation League, once told the Jerusalem Report.
Further complicating the interfaith relationship were political differences, with many American Jews traditionally leaning left and evangelical Christians leaning right. Mr. Eckstein conceded that when, as an Orthodox rabbi, he first brought Falwell into a synagogue, he was met with astonishment. In an interview with CBS News, he recalled the reaction: "Has Yechiel Eckstein gone off the deep end or what?"
To his supporters, his success spoke for itself. Among Mr. Eckstein's largest-scale initiatives was the "On Wings of Eagles" campaign to bring Jews from the former Soviet Union to Israel. Other beneficiaries of Fellowship funds included Ethiopian Jews newly arrived in Israel; Israelis who could not afford shelter, heat, cooking appliances or other essentials; students in need of school supplies; and hospitals lacking basic medical equipment. So extensive was his work that he became known as "the Jewish state's unofficial welfare minister."
Yechiel Zvi Eckstein was born July 11, 1951, in Winthrop, Mass., and grew up in Ottawa, where his father was chief rabbi of Canada. His mother, too, was a rabbi.
He received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in Jewish philosophy from Yeshiva University in New York, where he also received his Orthodox rabbinical ordination in 1975, and a master's degree in philosophy from Columbia University.
Early in his career, he worked for the ADL. In 1977, the organization sent him to Skokie, Ill., where neo-Nazis were organizing a demonstration in the community that was home to many Holocaust survivors. Mr. Eckstein found - and sought to cultivate - support among evangelicals moved by a literal interpretation of the Bible holding that Jews were God's chosen people.
Finding little backing for his efforts within the ADL, he left the organization and founded his fellowship. He received no income and reportedly supported his young family by working as a part-time rabbi and as a wedding singer. In 2014, according to the Wall Street Journal, he received a salary of $512,000, as well as a $544,000 contribution to his retirement fund.
Mr. Eckstein moved to Israel in 2001 and became an Israeli citizen the following year. His death was confirmed by George Mamo, the global chief operating officer at the Fellowship.
Mr. Eckstein was the author of books including "How Firm a Foundation: A Gift of Jewish Wisdom for Christians and Jews" and "What You Should Know About Jews and Judaism." He was the subject of an authorized biography, "The Bridge Builder," by Chafets.
Mr. Eckstein's marriage to Bonnie Siegman ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of 12 years, the former Joelle Medina of Jerusalem; three daughters from his first marriage, Yael Eckstein-Farkas of Pardes Chana, Israel, Talia Eckstein-Harrow of Miami and Tamar Pugliese of Teaneck, N.J.; his mother, Belle Eckstein of Jerusalem; two sisters; a brother; and eight grandchildren.
Speaking to Chafets, who profiled Mr. Eckstein in the New York Times, the rabbi described himself as a "nonevangelical defender of evangelicals."
"Jews have such a cynical, negative view of these people," he said. "They're not religious fanatics, and they don't have ulterior motives. These are good, religious people who love Israel and want to help. What's the matter with that?''

Texto completo: Another week, another apology from Sen. Elizabeth Warren for her phony claims of Native American heritage. But the latest evidence against her should spell the end of her presidential ambitions.
The Massachusetts Democrat's discredited story of Indian ancestry has made her an object of ridicule coming from President Donald Trump, who dubbed her "Pocahontas," and conservatives who prefer the more pointed "Fauxcahontas." Liberals have mostly been willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, seemingly accepting each new explanation for her shifting story of how and why she was mistaken for a member of the Cherokee Nation.
Her 1986 registration card for the State Bar of Texas could put an end to all that. The Washington Post obtained a copy of the signed document in which Warren wrote that her race was "American Indian."
This supports two critical charges against her: that she knowingly and personally claimed Native American heritage, and that she did so for the purpose of career advancement.
Warren has consistently dissembled about how and why she came to be thought of as Native American. When the Boston Herald broke the story during her 2012 Senate campaign, she said that she had no idea Harvard listed her as a minority hire, and that she couldn't "recall" having listed herself as such on any job or "other applications."
The Texas Bar registration shows this isn't true. Also, the document coincides with the year Warren began self-reporting as a "minority professor" in the Association of American Law Schools staff directory. It was also two years after she contributed recipes to the "Pow Wow Chow" Native American cookbook, some of which appear to have been plagiarized from a French chef in The New York Times.
Why would Warren pretend to be an American Indian in the 1980s if later she downplayed the matter as a misunderstanding based on family lore?
Despite the leftist mania to call out supposed "white privilege," the fact is that even in the 1980s minority status could confer distinct advantages in hiring and promotion in career fields dominated by liberals for whom affirmative action is an article of faith. As the 1983 guidance from the American Association of University Professors noted, when it comes to filling academic positions, "in the interests of diversity, affirmative action considerations might control the final selection."
A 2018 investigation by The Boston Globe found little to support the idea that hiring committees, at various law schools where Warren taught, openly discussed her alleged Native American heritage as a factor in bringing her on board. Yet, Harvard was quick to tout her as the law school's first "woman of color," of which Warren said she was unaware. She was identified as a minority winner of a teaching award at the University of Pennsylvania, apparently also without her knowledge. Maybe these schools did not discuss her supposed ethnicity, but they recognized and exploited it.
The Texas Bar registration comes on the heels of Warren's apology for releasing a DNA test finding "strong evidence" that she had a Native American ancestor six to 10 generations ago.
DNA evidence is not accepted by the Cherokee Nation anyway, so the whole fiasco shows a terrible sense of judgment — and perhaps panic — on Warren's part.
It is fair to speculate that Warren's presidential campaign will soon be over. If Democrats want to nominate a progressive/socialist who will also be a standard-bearer for identity politics, they have other, more authentic choices available. As a nominee, Warren would have to spend the entire campaign explaining to people of color why her candidacy is not a standing indictment of the cynical abuse of affirmative action programs for personal gain. This would be in addition to having to demonstrate why her outdated economic policies would not turn the United States into the next Venezuela.
President Trump said he would love to run against Warren, and she keeps showing why.

Texto completo: It is a term that goes back more than 100 years.
The first reference in the The New York Times to "disabled list" in a baseball context dates to 1887, when Dick Buckley of the Syracuse Stars was said to be on such a list.
By 1915 it had become more codified, and The Times reported: "Here-after the league will keep a 'disabled' list, which provides that an injured player can be kept out of the game at least ten days, and an extra player substituted for him."
Now Major League Baseball will no longer use the phrase "disabled list" for the roster of injured players. In the future, it will be known as the "injured list."
The change, first reported by ESPN, came after a push by advocates for disabled people, who objected to the term.
"The disability community identifies with the term 'disabled,"' said Jay Ruderman, president of the Ruderman Family Foundation, which encourages greater inclusion of people with disabilities in society. "When it's used incorrectly, when someone is injured, not disabled, that's offensive."
"People with disabilities do not consider themselves injured," he added, noting that disabled people like the former Yankee Jim Abbott, a pitcher with one hand, had played baseball successfully. "Someone who tears an A.C.L. is not permanently disabled."
Link20, a group of young activists sponsored by the Ruderman foundation, sent a letter to M.L.B. in November raising the issue. "Using the term 'disabled list' for players who are injured reinforces the belief that people with disabilities are injured and therefore are not able to participate or compete in any sports," it said.
Ruderman said there had been little opposition from M.L.B. "They said, 'Hey, you're right, this needs to be changed."'
"Baseball is hugely influential on American culture," he said. "This is really refreshing that a major sport really got the issue very quickly. It's a huge win for the disability community. Things like this really help break down stigma."
The key connection for the group was Billy Bean, a vice president at Major League Baseball who works on issues of inclusion. Bean said in a statement that the change was "an example of our determination to get better off the field in the same way we try to improve on the field."
"He has some power in the organization," Ruderman said. "Usually the person dealing with inclusion is powerless in the organization."
Some fans on Twitter lamented the change, complaining that they could no longer use the well-known abbreviation "D.L." But a good number welcomed the switch.
The list will continue to work as it has in the past. Just not as the disabled list, or "the D.L." -- at least until people in baseball stop saying it.

McCabe: Sleep-deprived Rosenstein fretted about trust crisis after Trump used his memo to justify firing Comey

Texto completo: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein spiraled into rage and paranoia after President Trump ordered him to write the memo he cited as justification to fire FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, according to a new book.

In a private meeting at the Justice Department days after Comey was fired on May 12, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe writes in his upcoming memoir Rosenstein was "glassy-eyed" and said he was sleep deprived after he came to the conclusion that the White House had used him.

“He said it wasn’t his idea. The president had ordered him to write the memo justifying the firing,” McCabe writes. Rosenstein also said, “There’s no one here that I can trust."

A DOJ spokesperson declined to comment to the Washington Examiner on McCabe's claims about the deputy attorney general.

Less than a week later, Rosenstein appointed special counsel Robert Mueller to take over the investigation looking into Russian election interference and possible collusion between with Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Mueller is reportedly investigating whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice by firing Comey.

Although Trump initially said Comey was fired per the suggestion of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Rosenstein, he said shortly thereafter the “Russia thing” was a factor.

The account in McCabe's book, first reported by the Guardian, echoes reporting by the New York Times that focused on the struggle Rosenstein went through in the days after Comey was fired. Although Rosenstein told Congress that same month he “stand[s] by” the controversial memo he wrote, he privately lamented how the ordeal tarnished his reputation. Rosenstein was “shaken,” “unsteady,” and “overwhelmed,” one person who spoke with Rosenstein told the outlet. Another source said he was "frantic, nervous, upset and emotionally dis-regulated."

A Justice Department spokesperson offered a different explanation for why Rosenstein was upset, pinning the blame on McCabe for not informing him of memos Comey wrote outlining conversations he had with Trump.

“To be clear, he was upset not because knowledge of the existence of the memos would have changed the [Deputy Attorney General's] decision regarding Mr. Comey, but that Mr. McCabe chose not to tell him about their existence until only hours before someone shared them with The New York Times,” DOJ's Sarah Isgur Flores told the Times.

Rosenstein is now expected to depart the Justice Department, following the likely Senate confirmation of attorney general nominee William Barr next week. He has long been the subject of criticism of Trump-allied Republican lawmakers who have accused the Justice Department of being biased at the top levels due to document request disputes and reports in September that said he discussed wearing a “wire” to record conversations with Trump and that he was recruiting Cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office.

Rosenstein denied the reporting, while sources told NBC News that he was only joking about secretly recording the president.

McCabe, a 21-year veteran of the FBI, was fired March 16, 2018, two days before he planned to retire on his 50th birthday and collect a full pension, after the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General determined that he misled investigators about the role he had in leaking information to the Wall Street Journal in October 2016 about the investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

He “lacked candor” on four occasions when interviewing with internal investigators, the IG report said.

In April, it was revealed that the Justice Department IG had referred its findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges. Federal prosecutors have since been using a grand jury to investigate McCabe.

McCabe's book, titled "The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump," is highly critical of the president's "bullying" tactics and will hit book shelves later this month.

Texto completo: A few days before Christmas, a group of 20 or so people crowded into the Mexican novelist Valeria Luiselli's living room. Luiselli dipped in and out among her guests, serving mulled wine as school-aged children from Still Waters in a Storm, an educational center in Brooklyn focused on reading and writing, prepared to perform an original musical adapted from Cervantes' "Don Quixote." The children had worked with the center's founder, Stephen Haff, to translate the book from the Spanish and write songs reinterpreting the story with a chorus of migrant children. By the time Haff told the children to find their spots on the small makeshift stage, the seats had filled up, so Luiselli sat on the floor next to her 9-year-old daughter, Maia. It wasn't the first time Luiselli had seen the show, but she still cried, as did her daughter, when the children sang songs with lyrics like, "Innocence needs a home."
The experiences of asylum-seeking children from Latin America have preoccupied Luiselli for several years now and serve as a central theme in her latest book about a family road trip across the United States. "Lost Children Archive," which will be published by Knopf next week, is Luiselli's fifth book, and the first of her novels to be written in English.
When Luiselli, 35, started writing "Lost Children Archive" in the summer of 2014, she struggled with using it "as a loudspeaker for all of my political rage." She had volunteered as a court translator for child refugees from Latin America and was therefore familiar with the migration crisis. She set aside the novel and wrote "Tell Me How it Ends: An Essay in 40 Questions," a meditation on the children's stories and the circumstances that brought them to the United States. It was formatted after the questionnaire the court had her use to interview the children and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in Criticism in 2017. Afterward, Luiselli said, she was able to return to her novel and offer "more open questions and open ends instead of political stances that are too loud and obvious by themselves."
The formal inventiveness of "Tell Me How It Ends" is characteristic of all of Luiselli's former work. Diego Rabasa, who has edited Luiselli's books with Sexto Piso, an independent press in Mexico City, said her first book, "Papeles Falsos" (translated as "Sidewalks" in English), contained elements of literary, personal and travel essays. "There has always been a distinct aura of brilliance and intelligence surrounding her," said Rabasa. "What dazzled us was the audacity of a young writer who was starting on such an original path."
Luiselli characterized her first book, which was rejected by several publishing houses before it was acquired by Sexto Piso, as an attempt to "write myself into my mother tongue" after a lifetime living away from Mexico. She had always studied in English, so when it came to Spanish, "I never had the inflections of the people my age. It didn't get renewed with slang and street talk."
Luiselli first left Mexico at the age of 2, when her father moved the family to Madison, Wis., to complete his doctorate. From there, her father's work as a diplomat took them to Costa Rica, South Korea and South Africa, where they arrived in 1994, shortly after Mandela's historic election. By then, her mother had left the family to join the Zapatista movement in Mexico. "I come from a matriarchal line of women who have always been very involved politically and socially," she said, referring also to her grandmother, who worked with indigenous communities in Puebla, Mexico. After attending boarding school in India, she decided, as she puts it, "I need to go back to Mexico and become Mexican," Luiselli recalled. She was 19 when she enrolled at the National Autonomous University of Mexico to major in philosophy and began writing there.
Luiselli followed "Papeles Falsos" in 2011 with a novel, "Los Ingrávidos" ("Faces in the Crowd"). It has been translated into 20 languages. Rabasa noted that the book remains one of Sexto Piso's most popular and is reprinted every year. "The Story of my Teeth," Luiselli's second novel, was the product of a collaboration with Jumex factory workers in Mexico, in which she sent them chapters, and they helped her shape the plot. Her books always reflect a deep plunge into her sensibilities -- books and cultural references, and even real people and places where she's been. In "Lost Children Archive," for instance, Still Waters in a Storm is mentioned, as are Haff, obscure Italian writers and Ezra Pound.
"I have never written a novel that just sort of springs from the head of Zeus, from an absolute space of fiction," Luiselli said. "I always begin my work documenting my everyday."
"She's really wrestling with a certain strand of Latino and Latin American identity in the U.S. in this political moment," said the novelist Daniel Alarcón, who has sat on panels with Luiselli. In "Tell Me How It Ends," in particular, he said, "she confronts directly questions of privilege and gaze, at the same time wrestling with a political moment that affects not just all Latinos but all Americans."
"Without knowing it or planning to, she has opened doors," said her friend, the writer Laia Jufresa, who told me she never imagined a Mexican writer could plausibly achieve the number of translations, awards or critical acclaim Luiselli has in her early career.
Both the novelist Francisco Goldman and Rabasa mentioned the -- "insufferable," in Goldman's words -- macho culture of Mexican literature. Goldman rattled off a list of woman writers, besides Luiselli, who have been causing a seismic shift in the country's literary world over the last decade: Gabriela Jauregui, Guadalupe Nettel, Verónica Gerber Bicecci, Jufresa and Fernanda Melchor.
The Argentine novelist Samanta Schweblin, whose second book, "Mouthful of Birds," was published in January, said Luiselli's vision is a cross between the Latin American and the North American views of the world. "Both visions are so nostalgic, critical, loving and painful at the same time. Valeria belongs to both territories and therefore understands their signals, but at the same time she seems to always understand herself as a foreigner," wrote Schweblin in a recent email. Perhaps, she said, having one foot in each world is why Luiselli's literature is charged with the lucidness of estrangement.
Luiselli is currently exploring different art forms altogether. She recently received an Art for Justice fellowship to research and write about mass incarceration in the United States, with an emphasis on detention centers. "The same companies own immigration jails and normal jails," she said, and many don't understand that "immigration detention and mass incarceration are exactly the same thing."
She started a literary program to teach creative writing to girls in a detention center in upstate New York. She is also working on a performance piece related to mass incarceration and violence against women with the poet Natalie Diaz. In the fall, she will begin a two-year residency at Bard College.
Luiselli lives in the Bronx and jokes that she is raising her daughter, whose father is the Mexican novelist Álvaro Enrigue, in a household full of women (her niece lives with her and her mother visits often). "I feel my female bonds stronger than ever in my life, the way that women can group and discuss and think politically, and also just how friends can get together and be a network of support," Luiselli said.
"Lost Children Archive" was in large part a response to seeing her daughter try to interpret the current migration crisis. "Children can add a tinge of bizarreness to what is possibly accepted as normal but actually is not," said Luiselli. Her approach is to discuss issues with her daughter "in a way that she is not scared -- that she finds the right balance between a certain rage or outrage and clarity to imagine possible change."

Texto completo: Remember the polar vortex and those subzero temperatures that plagued vast swaths of the United States last week? While much of the country was hibernating with hot cocoa, 146 athletes were competing in a 135-mile race in northern Minnesota.
The temperature at the start line, in International Falls, Minn., was minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit with wind chills reaching 55 below.
The athletes, who could run, bike or ski the Arrowhead 135, wouldn't have it any other way.
"People want a hard race," Ken Krueger, the Arrowhead 135 race director, said. "If we have an easy year, they feel cheated. They want to come here for the bragging rights. But I don't honestly know if this was our coldest Arrowhead race. I think temperatures were colder in 2007."
The finish rate has been as low as 20 percent and as high as 82 percent, he said. This year, 36 percent of the starters, or 52 people, finished the race by the 60-hour cutoff time.
Athletes must apply to compete in the grueling race, which proudly calls itself one of the 50 toughest races in the world. They also must carry all of their own gear from a list of required items, including a stove and a tent.
Selected athletes travel from all parts of the world to compete, including a group of Brazilians who said they trained for the Minnesota conditions in commercial freezers.
The New York Times spoke with John Storkamp, who finished fourth this year after winning last year's race. Why him? In a word -- experience. It was his 14th Arrowhead 135.
Let's start with the obvious: Why?
A good friend of mine created the race in 2005 and convinced me to do it in 2006. It's a winter tradition to keep me running through the winter so I'm in shape to go out and do something like this. But you are surrounded by people that understand it, so you spend very little time making the case why you would do it. Maybe that's kind of the beauty of it. It becomes a new norm and it becomes relatively normal for people to show up year in and year out to do this. I guess the easiest explanation is everyone has their kind of mountain to climb.
Did this year's polar vortex change your outlook or strategy in the race?
Looking at the forecast doesn't change much in terms of whether I'm going to do the race. But the more challenging the conditions, the more I focus on taking the best care of myself as possible. I won the race last year, but just threw the competitive element out the window this year and focused on doing things early in the race to set myself up for success to finish safely.
No matter what the conditions, there are always times during an event like this where you think that you would like to be inside and warm and done and no longer doing this, and that's just one of the challenges.
What does an "unsupported" race mean in these conditions?
The fact that it's self-supported is a big ethos of the race. There are snowmobilers checking in with people giving them the opportunity to bail out of the race. But the goal is getting yourself to help if you need it. You have to have all the supplies with you, so that if you are no longer mobile, if you are too tired or dehydrated, you can take reprieve from the elements.
How much, and how often, are you eating?
You can't stop moving in these temperatures, so the most important thing is to really focus on your nutrition. You are eating and drinking pretty much continuously through the event. If 15 minutes go by and you haven't eaten, it's probably time to start eating again. You are trying to eat 6,000 to 7,000 calories every 24 hours, the most calorie dense food with lowest water content with high fat content. The best foods are candy, chocolate, things with peanut butter, coconut -- really anything that is really high in calories and fat that doesn't freeze.
What kinds of athletes attempt this race?
In the first couple of years, very few people had the interest or the ability to do it. It takes years of experience to approach something like this. It's what you would call a graduate level ultrarace. People who apply to run the race would ideally have a lot of experience, including some ultradistance races of 100 miles, under their belt. Experience with winter camping and mountaineering is just as important, if not more important. Over time and as the event has gone on, I think people have picked up tricks and trips for how they could prepare for doing something like this. Now people will make plans three, four, five years out to acquire the necessary gear and requisite training.
What's the first thing you did after you finished?
I ate a lot of soup and I had a hot shower and got into bed. Finally getting to sleep is great.

Texto completo: Of all the millions of people who have spit into a plastic vial and sent their DNA off to have it analyzed, writer Dani Shapiro might be the most prepared for what happened next.
The core of Shapiro’s work — this bestselling author has written 10 books — has always concerned family issues, those tangled emotional webs we weave around each other and the secrets we keep.
“It has been a huge part of what formed me as a writer — I had an obsession with searching and digging, trying to understand,” Shapiro says, noting that half of her books are memoirs about deep, personal exploration. “I idly wondered why (I kept writing memoirs) but those were the books that continued to present themselves to me as necessary. And that comes very much out of not knowing something and writing in order to try to know.”
Part of what she didn’t know was why, with her fair hair and blue eyes, she barely resembled her parents, both Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe — an otherness remarked upon by people throughout her life.
All is revealed when the results of an Ancestry.com test that she took “on a whim” come back: She is not her beloved father’s biological daughter after all, but the product of artificial insemination her parents turned to when they could not conceive. Why that happened and what meaning Shapiro makes of it is the subject of her riveting new memoir, “Inheritance: A Memoir of Genealogy, Paternity, and Love.”
“This discovery poured gasoline over everything I thought I knew and threw a match on it,” she says. “Now I see the whole picture.”
Since its release in January, the book has quickly risen to the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction and has already been optioned by Hollywood, a clear indication that both her writing and the topic of family secrets is speaking to the hearts of millions.
“I certainly wanted it to resonate with people who had been through similar experiences or discovered there were family secrets —everybody seems to have them,” said Shapiro in a phone interview while she was on the road for her national book tour that lands in Southern California for several appearances this week.
“Adoptees, people who discover they were donor conceived, or have half siblings — there are so many of those kinds of secrets tumbling out of the closet right now,” she observes.
More like an avalanche.
She notes that in 2018 alone 7 million Ancestry.com kits were purchased — and that doesn’t take into account what might be sold for other commercial DNA services like 23andMe. (DNA kits were the No. 1 holiday gift last year, too.) Shapiro discovered while researching “Inheritance” that out of the 7 million kits, 14 percent revealed what’s known in that industry as ”NPE,” Not Parent Expected: “That’s a huge number of people. Many of them, like me, were just recreational DNA testing.”
The ease and accessibility of these DNA tests herald a historical shift, she believes. “I think this is a moment in our culture when secrets and the impossibility of secrets is reaching a deafening roar,” Shapiro observes. “Paternity, ethnicity — these were secrets people could keep since the beginning of time, and did. And now that is over. I think in a few decades the idea that there ever were these secrets is going to seem like the most ridiculous thing you’d ever heard.”
Yet the exploration she undertakes in this book is even more universal: At the center is the question: How do heredity and history combine to make us who we are?
Says Shapiro: “I was also very aware that I did not only want people that could directly relate to the material to be readers of this book, because I felt I had learned so much in this really sort of harsh and complicated, and ultimately liberating, journey. I learned so much about identity, and family, and what makes a father a father, and about nature and nurture.”
Anyone who knows Shapiro’s work understands that she was close to her father, who died in an accident when she was 23, and distant from her abusive mother. These are themes that have run throughout her work. Reconciling her experience with her biological makeup was the “emotionally challenging” part of her journey to write this book.
“One of the things I had to contend with was the deep suspicion that I was part of my father’s sadness. The man that I tried so hard to make happy. But I don’t think that diminished in any way the love he had for me,” she says. “The irony is my biological parent is the one I felt a deep disconnection from, while my father, who was not my biological parent, was the one to whom I was connected. I think that my mother looked at me for all of our shared life together and found it very challenging because I was her secret. I was a reminder of their infertility; I was not my father’s child and on some very deep animal level, she knew it.”
There’s a moment in “Inheritance” where a friend tells her, “Everyone feels other,” and that she had been the explorer to come back to teach us all something about what that means. “I very much took that to heart,” she says.

Texto completo: A police sergeant in Virginia was suspended Wednesday after he was identified as someone who is associated with white supremacy groups.

Virginia authorities were made aware of the allegations Wednesday morning after a group that describes itself as seeking “to fight fascists” in Richmond, Va., pointed out that Sergeant Robert Stamm, 36, has an “affinity with white nationalist groups."

The group Antifascist of the Seven Hills published a blog post that included several pictures they said were pulled from Stamm’s social media accounts of tattoos, flags, and banners that it said showed symbols and images associated with Nazis and white supremacists.

The group said his Facebook page, and other social media accounts, appear to have been deleted.

Stamm was assigned at least two times in recent days to monitor protests related to Gov. Ralph Northam, who is facing calls to step down after a medical school yearbook photograph was discovered on his page that included a man in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan robe.

“[Stamm] has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the results of a review,” Col. Antony Pike, the chief of the Virginia Division of Capitol Police, said in a statement, according to the New York Times. “There is a review policy in place, and we will follow that policy.”

The anti-fascist group said in its blog post that Stamm came to its attention during the protests on Virginia Capitol grounds because he had a large Band-Aid covering his neck during one of the protests.

Abuses of clergy abuse report

Texto completo: Back in August, I wrote a column on the Pennsylvania grand jury report on clergy abuse. I expressed outrage at the abusive priests, whose actions I described as twisted, perverse, psychologically warped, diabolical -- right out of the pit of hell. I also, however, expressed displeasure at the very damaging, hyperbolic language used in that report -- the broad brushing, the unwarranted, unsubstantiated accusations levied by the anonymous authors.
I objected most vigorously to the report's explosive summary statement, which instantly became the most-quoted passage by the media: "Priests were raping little boys and girls, and the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing; they hid it all."
That line outraged me. It isn't what I saw in the report; it's categorically untrue. The very report itself contradicted that smoking charge. That was a smear that impugned the character and integrity of the numerous good priests and bishops who not only did something, and didn't seek to hide anything, but blew the whistle and tried to stop abusers. That kind of hyperbole is outrageous.
That brings me to a remarkable article published in the current issue of Commonweal, a veteran (and left-leaning) Catholic publication. The article is by Peter Steinfels, former editor of Commonweal and longtime religion reporter for The New York Times. It's a remarkable piece of thoughtful, thorough reporting that ought to be read in every course on journalism and media ethics -- and by any Pennsylvanian with an opinion on clergy abuse.
Steinfels' nearly 12,000-word piece, titled "Vehemently Misleading: The PA Grand-Jury Report: Not What It Seems -- It's Inaccurate, Unfair and Misleading," documents my worst suspicions.
Steinfels begins by laying out the enormous influence of the Pennsylvania report, which made headlines nationwide and even worldwide, and which has prompted numerous additional states to follow suit with their own investigations. He then zeroes in on the most misleading passage of the report, the one with the greatest reverberations: the "men of God" who "did nothing" and "hid it all."
Asking "Is that true?," Steinfels proceeds to show, exhaustively, that it is patently false. In a particularly jaw-dropping analysis, Steinfels estimates that "perhaps 90 percent or more of offenders the report lists were identified not by the police but by those 'deficient' diocesan investigations."
Whoa! What's that?
Yes, 90 percent. That stands in rather marked contrast to the 0 percent that the report effectively claimed by asserting (contrary to the material laid out in the report itself) that "all" cases were hidden.
Shame on the authors -- and the reviewers -- of the report. It makes one wonder about the role and objective of Attorney General Josh Shapiro and Gov. Tom Wolf. Did they actually read the report? They have some explaining to do. The attorney general's report on abuse contains some abuses itself.
Do I want to see predatory priests held accountable? Oh, you bet. I can't even verbalize how badly. Surely a special circle in Dante's inferno awaits these monsters.
But I also want to see Pennsylvania officials held accountable. They used a very broad brush that is causing significant damage in its own way, especially if (as Steinfels) suggests, this report opens the floodgate for a litigation bonanza that will bankrupt parishes that are completely innocent.
Shapiro and Wolf need to take steps to rectify abuses in this report.

Texto completo: WILKES-BARRE - Wilkes University will present a benefit production of the award-winning play “The Vagina Monologues” on Feb. 22 and 23.
Performances are at 7 p.m. Feb. 22 and 2 p.m. Feb. 23.
The play will be in the ballroom of the Henry Student Center, 84 W. South St., Wilkes-Barre.
Wilkes’ is the only production of the landmark play in Northeast Pennsylvania.
Playwright Eve Ensler created the “The Vagina Monologues” based on interviews with more than 200 women.
The play is a celebration of feminine strength and sexuality. The New York Times has called it “Probably the most important piece of political theatre of the last decade.”
Proceeds from Wilkes University’s performance benefit the V-Day organization, Victims Resource Center, the Domestic Violence Service Center and Caring Communities.
Admission is free for Wilkes students with valid ID, $5 for non-Wilkes students with valid ID and $10 for the public.
“The Vagina Monologues” gave birth to V-Day, a global activist movement to end all violence against women and girls, including cisgender, transgender, and those who hold fluid identities subject to gender-based violence. It is observed annually on Feb. 14.
With creativity and determination, V-activists around the world work tirelessly to end harassment, rape, battery, incest, female genital mutilation and sex slavery. Each year, V-Day also focuses on a particular issue or the experiences of a particular group of women.
In 2019, V-Day’s global spotlight campaign focuses on women in prisons and jails, detention centers, and formerly incarcerated women.
Eve Ensler, Tony Award winning playwright, performer, and activist, is the author of “The Vagina Monologues,” translated into over 48 languages, performed in over 140 countries, including sold-out runs at both Off-Broadway’s Westside Theater and on London’s West End.
The play ran for over 10 years in the U.K., Mexico and France.

Withering Gesture Adds to a Rancorous Rivalry

Texto completo: The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, stands behind President Trump at his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, she a vision in suffragist white, head tilted just so, lips pursed in a smirk and arms outreached.
Her hands come together in what one Twitter user called a "walrus clap," but it resonated around the world.
In the image, captured by Doug Mills of The New York Times, and in other pool video footage, the internet saw acres of shade dispensed by a skilled politician firmly in control, and social media users immediately turned Ms. Pelosi's wordless gesture into a viral meme.
Cross-party applause for the president on such a night is normally a pro forma affair, overlooked in the sea of stirring words penned by a speechwriter and recited from a teleprompter.
This time, the House speaker's clapping almost stole the spotlight on an important night for a president seeking to deliver to millions of viewers his delayed speech -- a speech she previously blocked.
Ms. Pelosi -- Democrat of California, self-described "mother of five, grandmother of nine" and the first woman to take up the speaker's gavel -- was applauding a political sparring partner whom analysts have concluded she had roundly outfoxed twice before.
Many called her gesture a "clap jeer." Some called it a literal clap back. One Twitter user said it was the "read your tweets" clap, in reference to Mr. Trump's penchant for weaponizing his Twitter feed. The comedian Patton Oswalt congratulated Ms. Pelosi for "inventing" an obscenity without using a certain finger.
Another went so far as to call it "the photo of the century."
To find a similarly fraught gender-tinged meme in Washington, one may have to go back to 2017, when "nevertheless, she persisted" became a rallying cry after the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, tried to muzzle Senator Elizabeth Warren.
Some took offense at the clap, with one person tweeting: "Nancy Pelosi's sarcastic clap is a consummate example of the biggest breakdown in American society: lack of respect. We don't have to agree, but we should #respect each other." And another noted that if her gesture is now the official political clapback, "We Republicans can use it too."
Observers accused Mr. Trump of rushing into his speech on Tuesday and not waiting for the speaker to introduce him, as if out of fear he would not get to talk at all. But Ms. Pelosi later said that he did not break protocol.
During his speech, Mr. Trump said, "Together we can break decades of political stalemate." But many pundits wondered how long the comity would last.
To understand the rapturous response by the liberal wing of the Twittersphere to the speaker's moves, it may help to recap how we got here.
Mr. Trump, 72, and Ms. Pelosi, 78, had fierce, public clashes since the 17-term representative returned as speaker in January, after the Democrats wrested back the House in bruising midterm elections last year.
The brewing rancor kicked off again on Jan. 23, when in the middle of the partial government shutdown, Ms. Pelosi sent a letter to the president suggesting that he delay his State of the Union address, set for Jan. 29, until after the government reopened.
The extraordinary request escalated the partisan battle over Mr. Trump's demand for more than $5 billion to build a wall at the border with Mexico.
He retaliated by grounding a military plane that had been scheduled to take Ms. Pelosi and other lawmakers on a fact-finding trip to Afghanistan. When Mr. Trump pressed ahead, insisting he wanted to give the speech, Ms. Pelosi promptly disinvited him. That sent late-night comedians into a tizzy.
The talk show host Samantha Bee crowed: "Dude, I know it's driving you crazy that a woman turned you down, but this is the point in your life where you're actually going to have to learn that no means no. There will be no grabbing this podium until Nancy is good and ready."
As the shutdown dragged on to become the longest on record, 35 days, the consensus was that Mr. Trump had met his match in Ms. Pelosi, so much so that a man known for giving foes insulting nicknames like "Cryin' Chuck" and for labeling women "horseface," "ugly" and "dog" could come up with only one term to refer to Ms. Pelosi: Nancy.
But Ms. Pelosi's playbook for handling the president was evident back in December, when she and Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, attended a televised Oval Office meeting with the president that went haywire.
In the verbal barrage that followed, the Democrats got Mr. Trump to take ownership of any shutdown that would follow, and Ms. Pelosi snapped: "Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats."
That round, too, went to Ms. Pelosi, according to political analysts.
Soon afterward, word leaked that in a closed-door meeting with her Democratic colleagues, she had called the wall debate "a manhood thing" for Mr. Trump, likening the meeting to "a tinkle contest with a skunk" and adding, "I was trying to be the mom."
On Tuesday night, some Twitter users saw echoes of a stern matriarch in Ms. Pelosi's countenance. She stared at notes in front of her and appeared to roll her eyes and shake her head at some points.
But it was the speaker's fleeting "bless your heart" expression as Mr. Trump looks back at her -- as if for approval -- with the clap that had the internet buzzing.
As one Twitter user wrote: "Holy hell that look. When your Mom looks at you like that, don't walk. Run."
Christine Pelosi, a political strategist and a daughter of the speaker, weighed in on the chatter in a post on Twitter: "Oh yes that clap took me back to the teen years. She knows. And she knows that you know. And frankly she's disappointed that you thought this would work."
Photograph It was described variously as a "walrus clap," a "clap jeer" and a clap back. With it, Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, stole some of the spotlight from the president. (PHOTOGRAPH BY DOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMWA)

Texto completo: In a sense it's not surprising that a renewed debate about abortion would begin in New York state, which passed a law last week - since imitated, to more controversy, by Virginia Democrats - ratifying the right to kill human beings in utero in the third trimester.
Almost 50 years ago, in 1970, New York passed the nation's most liberal abortion law, a template for the Roe v. Wade decision two years later. And the state has a justifiable reputation as (to quote a 2005 New York magazine story) "the abortion capital of America" - with a strong pro-abortion-rights consensus and high abortion rates.
But there is a forgotten chapter to this story. In 1972, New York's Assembly and Senate both voted narrowly to repeal the 2-year-old abortion law. The only thing preventing repeal was the veto of the Republican governor, Nelson Rockefeller - and, of course, the intervention of the Supreme Court the following January.
This almost-successful repeal was not an isolated case. As Russell Hittinger pointed out in a 2010 essay for First Things, prior to Roe v. Wade the anti-abortion side was regularly winning political victories in places that we think of as liberal bastions today. The division on abortion that runs between red and blue states today ran through both political parties and every U.S. state two generations ago - the "abortion capital" very much included.
This changed because of polarization and political tribalism, because currents in elite opinion reshaped liberal politics and backlash reshaped the GOP. But if you delve into coverage of those long-gone abortion debates, you'll be reminded that it also changed because the Catholic Church - in New York, especially - used to be an effective pro-life political force straddling partisan divides, instead of an institution devastated by attrition, internal division and the sex abuse disaster.
That declining influence is neatly distilled in the story of Mario and Andrew Cuomo. The father felt constrained by his Catholicism to at least agonize publicly over abortion, to insist that he could be pro-choice and "personally opposed." His son, a Catholic politician with a "First Girlfriend" who lit the Freedom Tower pink to celebrate late-term abortion, plainly fears neither God nor Cardinal Timothy Dolan.
In the case of Dolan, Cuomo's right to be blasé. New York state still has millions of baptized Catholics, but the faithful are divided and adrift and accustomed to tuning out messages from their bishops that don't fit their partisan preconceptions. (This goes for messages that criticize Donald Trump as well.) Dolan has tried to answer secularization with gregarious good cheer, but a bingo-hall winsomeness would be no match for cold indifference even without the church's scandals.
And yet it remains the case that deep inside the ransacked, decaying basilica that is American Catholicism, you can find the only vision that might transform the abortion debate, so that we don't end up with a permanent red-blue divide, in which the Supreme Court allows conservative states to pass restrictions but liberal states are radicalized toward eugenics and infanticide.
That vision isn't the "seamless garment of life" beloved of certain liberal Catholics, which effectively makes every issue a "life" issue, downgrading abortion to salve uneasy consciences. Rather, it's a more tailored seamless garment, one that would put the goal of outlawing abortion at the center of a web of pro-family policies - adoption support, child allowances, wage subsidies for breadwinners. The goal would be to make the end of abortion seem less utopian by making the burdens of motherhood less daunting, and to link the pro-life cause to a larger revolt against sterility.
Maybe someday this vision will be embraced by one of our political parties - after the GOP nominates Tucker Carlson for president in 2024, perhaps. But for the time being, the leaders of the Catholic Church should act as if this vision, their vision, is more than a wouldn't-it-be-nice synthesis in bureaucratic documents, a generic humanitarianism that informs the smorgasbord of charitable programs mentioned in annual appeals.
Suppose that tomorrow Dolan made two conjoined announcements. First, that Andrew Cuomo is excommunicated. Second, that a specific collection would henceforth be taken up at every Catholic Mass, every day, all year, to fund an annual family allowance administered by the Sisters of Life, available to any parent in the state who asked the church for help bearing and raising their child.
I have no idea how much money this would raise, no confidence in how effective it would be. But the church needs leaders who act as if they have confidence, not only in the church's teachings, but in its capacity to vindicate those teachings on its own, rather than through supplication to indifferent or hostile politicians.
Confidence alone cannot arrest decline. But it is a precondition for rebirth. And the church's vision will not matter in American politics until Catholicism becomes a power unto itself again - one that does not need the favor of an Andrew Cuomo to promote the common good.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Challenge to President and His View of News" (news article, Feb. 2):
At the White House, President Trump submits to questioning by The New York Times about his threats to the news media. His answers are for the most part a litany of vague personal grievances. The same day, across town, in the United States District Court in Washington, Judge Amy Berman Jackson speaks to an altogether different order of values.
Her award of $302.5 million against President Bashar al-Assad for Syria's targeted assassination of the war reporter Marie Colvin (news article, Feb. 1) is nothing less than a resounding exposition of the necessity of a free press and the courage of individual journalists who embody it.
The next time that President Trump is asked to account for his reckless incitements against "enemies of the people," he should be pressed to have the United States at last join the 174 countries that have ratified Article 79 of the Geneva Conventions for the protection of journalists and the additional Protocol 1.
And that's only a start in following Judge Jackson's lead. Nine out of every 10 of the killers of journalists have never been investigated.

Literacy key to educating New Mexico's youth

Texto completo: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is correct in making public education, and especially early education, a top priority for the state. However, it is clear from the article in the Santa Fe New Mexican that many people find the way forward perplexing ("Lawmakers pressed to devise plan on public education," Jan. 20). Everyone shares a sense of urgency and seeks results as quickly as possible, but successful outcomes must also be sustainable.
Literacy skills represent the foundation for academic success. Specifically, the third grade is known to be the pivotal year when children transition from learning to read to reading to learn. Data show that students who are not proficient readers in third grade are four times less likely to finish high school. Those who also live in poverty are six times less likely to graduate. The necessity of grade-level reading proficiency by third grade for mastering academic subjects through high school is well documented. Unfortunately, New Mexico ranks last among states in reading proficiency among third-graders.
If the critical factors for academic success are literacy skills, and the foundation for acquiring those skills occurs by third grade, then a primary piece of New Mexico's response for improving public education overall must target literacy proficiency during that formative period.
While most New Mexico public schools are designated grade D or F schools, some do excel and are rated as grade A or B schools. One leading school district is in Texico. Everything about the Texico schools' people and facilities is laser focused on a culture of high expectations and an intense, daily collaboration among students, teachers and administrators. The result of their consistent, nurturing environment is that Texico students clearly love their school and are excited about learning (see Texico Report at www.MentoringKidsWorks
NM.org).
The type of school environment in Texico is what David Brooks describes in his op-ed in the New York Times ("Students learn from people they love," Jan. 17). His point is that effective learning depends upon the emotional relationships students form with people who share their learning experience. That connection for effective learning is supported by neuroscience research. More detail can be found in the Aspen Institute's report entitled "From a Nation at Risk to a Nation at Hope."
Teachers and administrators work hard to provide a nurturing experience, but each teacher is working with many students. One way to advance learning is by adding one-on-one assistance. Mentoring third-graders in literacy skills, for example, offers personalized learning via a nurturing relationship that strengthens each student's intellectual and emotional investment. For New Mexico, providing bilingual mentors is also important.
Three powerful outcomes can be realized from the mentoring example above. First, learning is accelerated by reinforcing what is happening in the classroom. Second, because literacy proficiency is achieved by the third grade, students are prepared to master math and other academic subjects thereafter (early success is multiplied). And third, the positive emotional relationships students develop toward learning and helping others contribute to their success in life as well as academics.
For sustainable success in public education, I urge the Legislature to establish a state-funded initiative during the current session that supports literacy attainment across all New Mexico, especially for third-graders (e.g. a comprehensive literacy consortium). Practices working well for students anywhere in the state should be shared in the most efficient ways across the rest of the state. It is a matter of New Mexicans helping New Mexicans as we educate our youth and improve our state's future standard of living for all.

Relaxed abortion rules portend the dehumanization of us all

Texto completo: C.S. Lewis was only partly right when he wrote: The greatest evil ... is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice.
Lewis, perhaps, couldn’t have envisioned the day when a law allowing abortion up to the moment of birth would receive a standing ovation, as occurred last month with New York’s passage of the absurdly named "Reproductive Health Act."
Upon signing the bill, which also permits some health care professionals who are not doctors to perform the abortions, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered that One World Trade Center be illuminated in pink, hijacking the color associated with saving breast-cancer victims — and the birth of a baby girl.
What a weird, wicked world we live in.
Last Monday in Virginia, Del. Kathy Tran testified on behalf of a bill that would have simplified the process for having a late-term abortion. Currently, Virginia law requires three doctors’ approval for such a procedure. The bill, which was subsequently tabled, would’ve required only one’s.
This was hardly the stuff of "infanticide," a word that began tumbling from the lips of certain critics, but Gov. Ralph Northam wasn’t helpful. Two days before his yearbook scandal broke, he talked during a radio interview about making distressed newborns "comfortable" while the family decides whether to resuscitate.
Just maybe we’re not very good at talking about the unspeakable.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont and other blue states are busy hammering out their own legal concoctions, likely concerned that Roe v. Wade will be overturned by the now-predominantly conservative Supreme Court. I leave others to argue the validity of those concerns, but my sources in the pro-life movement, including several legal scholars, think upending the decision is unlikely given that, in 1992, the court not only reinforced Roe but actually made the ruling stronger.
Regardless, the pro-choice movement has been preparing for such a frontal assault on the few abortion restrictions left to states. In 1973, when Roe was issued, a baby’s viability was set at 24-28 weeks. Today, thanks to technology and our finer understanding of human development, viability occurs around 22 weeks.
In New York City, where about two in five pregnancies are terminated, there will no longer be any presumption of humanity for the baby at any stage of pregnancy, which goes far beyond abortion jurisprudence. Most Americans are fully against such extreme approaches to abortion. One survey puts the share who support abortion during the third trimester at just 13 percent.
Like many if not most Americans, I have been reasonably at ease with President Clinton’s 1996 call for making abortion "safe, legal and rare," but had hoped we’d seriously pursue that goal through better information and limit abortion to the first trimester. But the pro-choice side has resisted many attempts to educate. Activists have opposed laws requiring that pregnant women have the option of viewing a sonogram before their abortion. They’ve also thwarted attempts to make adoption resources available at abortion clinics.
What are they afraid of? That someone may change her mind?
While there are only four doctors in the U.S. that perform third-trimester abortions and, obviously, "no one gets an abortion on the delivery table," as New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg put it, the codification of late-term abortion should be discomfiting.
It is obvious, meanwhile, that these pro-abortion legislators’ new efforts are aimed at undoing, one by one, the state-level "victories" of their pro-life counterparts — even, apparently, if it means putting women’s lives at greater risk by allowing non-doctors to perform abortions.
But more concerning than a possible increase in late-term abortions (now at fewer than 2 percent of all pregnancy terminations) is the clinical way we’ve come to view and discuss human life. When we use language to disguise reality — whether the developing human baby is a "clump of cells," a "fetus," or, even, a "product of termination" — we move ever-closer to the dehumanization of us all.

Texto completo: In 1957, The New York Times published a profile of President Dwight Eisenhower's first assistant for national security affairs, a position that would eventually become known as national security adviser. "No man in the Government, with the possible exception of the President, knows so many of the nation's strategic secrets," the Times declared of Robert "Bobby" Cutler. The paper then employed a mess of contradictions to describe this Massachusetts Republican. "A proper Bostonian" who is also a "Rabelaisian with a salty vocabulary," "an earnest Episcopalian" and "a man who can move so quickly from ribaldry to piety and back to ribaldry again," "a 'slave driver' who can force his staff to work as hard as he works himself" but also "a charming and generous friend," Cutler was "a bachelor's bachelor ... who has had a lifelong love affair" not with any person but with his hometown, Boston.
To add another paradox, barely hinted at by the Times: Cutler was a gay man who sat atop the national security bureaucracy at a time when people like him were being purged from government service.
This we know thanks to a new biography, "Ike's Mystery Man: The Secret Lives of Robert Cutler." Written by Cutler's great-nephew, Peter Shinkle, it is based largely upon a set of secret diaries that Cutler wrote during his time in the Eisenhower administration and that he never intended anyone, except the (human) object of his affection, to see. While the interests of America's historical record - long bereft of gay history, which is often elusive by nature - may be served by revealing the intimate details of Cutler's interior life, whether he merits a full-length biography is another matter.
Born into a Boston Brahmin family, Cutler was a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School. After working as a lawyer, banker and political fixer, he got to know Eisenhower personally as an aide on his 1952 national whistle-stop campaign train tour. As much as Cutler's bloodline made him a natural fit for the WASP aristocracy leading the new Eisenhower administration, his sexual orientation threatened his privileged position.
Shortly after swearing the oath of office, Eisenhower began weeding "subversives" out of the federal government. Elected amid the Red Scare, Ike had won the presidency partly because of a sense that the long-reigning Democrats were soft on communism, which in the public mind had become linked with homosexuality. A whisper campaign, abetted by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, tarred the recently divorced Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson, as a homosexual; Sen. Everett Dirksen, R-Ill., associated Stevenson with "the lavender lads of the State Department." Ike's campaign slogan, "Let's Clean House," alluded not only to corruption but sedition and sexual impropriety.
On Inauguration Day, Attorney General Herbert Brownell submitted a draft executive order to the new president mandating security background checks for all new federal employees. The following day, Cutler suggested a more sweeping policy, one that had been proposed by a government commission during the previous Truman administration but never implemented. Under the proposed regulations, sexual perversion" should be a factor in determining whether an employee posed a security risk, alongside the more conventional menace of communist sympathies. While "sexual perversion" was undefined, its intended target was obvious: homosexuals.
As a result of Executive Order 10450, signed by the president on April 27, 1953, thousands of patriotic gay men and women lost their jobs in what later became known as the "Lavender Scare," far more than would ever fall victim to the Red Scare. Shinkle's contribution to history is his revelation that a gay man played an important bureaucratic role in this tragedy by advocating a policy that lowered the threshold for dismissal from disloyalty to homosexuality.
There are not many more such previously undisclosed moments in this book, however, much of which treads familiar Cold War history. Cutler emerges as a bystander to far more significant figures like Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, CIA Director Allen Dulles and Hoover.
Following a leave of absence Cutler took during the "politically sensitive" period around the 1956 re-election campaign, which may have been prompted by rumormongering about his sexuality, Hoover wrote the returning administration official a letter. "Dear Bobbie," the FBI director - himself a bachelor dogged by gay rumors - began, conspicuously using the feminine form. Cutler, no less catty in his reply, used letterhead from the bank at which he was working, embellished with the image of a Puritan and the motto, "Worthy of Your Trust."
"Ike's Mystery Man" becomes a genuinely engrossing read in its final third, when Cutler develops a romantic interest in a National Security Council staffer half his age. Thus begins, by his own description, "the greatest adventure of my life," an adventure that is by turns pathetic and illuminating. Pathetic, as the romance is unrequited yet strung along by the younger man, who at most admits to platonic love for Cutler. Illuminating, because it resembles the experiences of countless men and women who, forced for so long to mask their true selves, appeared to the world as mysteries.
James Kirchick, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the author of "The End of Europe: Dictators, Demagogues and the Coming Dark Age." He is writing a history of gay Washington.

Former Toledo TV producer learns lesson

Texto completo: I asked the most famous Super Bowl week troll in America to jog our memory.

What years again did you work in Toledo?

One second, said Michael Telek, a former morning producer at WNWO-TV, Channel 24, and until last week a news producer at the CBS affiliate in Pittsburgh. I've got my resume right here. It would have been 2015 and 2016.

He had the dates handy, because, well, you might have heard.

The 27-year-old Telek is the guy who was fired for calling Tom Brady a known cheater in a newscast graphic last week.

We caught up with him before the big game as he made his way to a Pittsburgh casino. Got to make up for lost earnings, you know.

There's a job fair there, he said.

Fine, and he swung by the sports book, laying down a few bucks on the Patriots and - no hard feelings - Brady taking home Super Bowl MVP honors.

Telek took us through his 15 minutes of unwitting celebrity.

It began with the 4 p.m. news broadcast Jan. 28, when Telek tried to have fun with a fluffy here-comes-the-big-game package.

After the anchor noted the Patriots could match the Steelers' record six Super Bowl rings with a victory, Brady appeared on screen, accompanied by a caption that read: Tom Brady: Known Cheater.

It was what Telek called a wink at fans in Pittsburgh, where Brady is chiseled in to the Mount Rushmore of sports villains. Not to mention ... not wrong, if you ask the NFL. (See: Deflategate.)

I thought for a split second, 'Could I get in trouble for this?' he said. No, it's a sports story!

But Telek knew he might have a problem when a screenshot of the graphic went viral on social media. Where most in Pittsburgh and beyond smiled at the tongue-in-cheek rivalry jab, the bosses at KDKA did not.

They told me, 'We're going to write you up for a reprimand,' he said. Everything was normal the next day. Then they pulled me in, said, 'We investigated it, and because you did it intentionally, we have to let you go.'

We're not going to pretend to know the entire story here, and we can debate if a newscast is the right place for fan snark. I get why a network would not want to be known for its stunts.

While fans are entitled to have personal opinions, we have a journalistic responsibility to provide unbiased reporting, KDKA said in a statement. The graphic that appeared Monday violated our news standards.

Fair enough. Let us just say we're told Telek is a good guy who was a good employee in Toledo, where he worked overnight but also contributed on-camera reports at Friday night high school games. This feels like making Everest out of a teachable moment.

Now, moving on ...

Telek called the past week surreal. He appeared on CNN and has been featured everywhere from the pages of the New York Times, Washington Post, and Daily Mail in London to the airwaves of his favorite politics podcast on NPR. Lest we give the impression he is resentfully milking the moment, know that he has been a gracious sport.

He has kind words for KDKA and, yes, Brady. The Pittsburgh native called him the GOAT, no question.

Telek said he's received mostly support, including from fans in Boston. He appreciates his friends too, who knowing he just bought a home started a GoFundMe account that has raised almost $3,000.

But Telek isn't having it. He intends to donate the money to charity in Brady's name.

I learned a valuable lesson, Telek said. I understand why CBS let me go, but ... this could be the best thing that has ever happened to me.

Here's wishing him luck.

Julian Edelman got Super Bowl MVP. But some are saying his PED suspension taints that

Texto completo: Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman was named Super Bowl MVP Sunday night after he had 10 receptions for 141 yards in New England's 13-3 victory over the Rams.
"I'm pretty ecstatic," Edelman said afterwards.
However, some industry insiders were questioning Edelman's award — and that he even got to play in the Super Bowl at all — considering he served a four-game suspension at the beginning of the season after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs, or PEDs.
At the time, Edelman posted an apology but said, “I don't know what happened." The substance that he tested positive for is still unknown. Edelman appealed the suspension, but it was upheld.
In July, Edelman said he was “definitely accountable" for the positive drug test, saying: “I've got to follow the protocols a little better and make sure this never happens again."
Here's a look at what some commentators were saying about Edelman Sunday night and Monday morning.
Nick Wright of Fox Sports
Nick Wright, the co-host of Fox Sports' “First Things First," poked at Edelman's MVP status in a tweet Sunday night.
Adam Kilgore of The Washington Post
Adam Kilgore, a national sports reporter for The Washington Post, focused largely on the lack of conversation surrounding Edelman's early-season suspension in a story published online Monday morning titled, “Julian Edelman began the season with a PED suspension and ended it as Super Bowl MVP."
In his story, Kilgore noted that simply changing the sport from football to baseball would frame the Edelman discussion differently: “Try to imagine the difference in tone if theoretically a World Series MVP had been popped for PEDs and missed 40 games. It's not even possible — MLB players busted during the season can't play in the postseason."
He continued: “Baseball record books are viewed as a sacred part of the game, while football record books are less relevant than who's on your fantasy team. The Steroid Era in baseball is associated with artificially rearranging those records, while in football, nobody much cares about what goes in the record books."
Read the full Washington Post story.
Tyler Kepner of The New York Times
Tyler Kepner, a national baseball reporter for The New York Times, also noted, in a tweet, that had this been baseball, Edelman wouldn't have even had a chance to play.
Jon Heyman of MLB Network
Jon Heyman, an insider at MLB Network, said on Twitter that football players who tested positive for PEDs shouldn't even allowed to be playing for the Lombardi trophy.
Nancy Armour of USA Today
In what appears to be the strongest opinion yet, USA Today columnist Nancy Armour wrote a full column on why “Super Bowl MVP Julian Edelman shouldn't even have been playing in the game."
In her column, Armour referenced Colin Kaepernick: “Call attention to racism and discrimination, and your career is effectively over. Test positive for performance-enhancing drugs, and you can be the Super Bowl MVP."
Armour also noted that in the MLB, Edelman wouldn't have been able to play in the postseason: “In other words, you cheat, you pay the price. An actual one with ramifications for you and your teammates, not some slap on the wrist that everyone forgets as soon as it happens."
She also claimed that the NFL “doesn't care" about PEDs, calling it the “dirty secret of the NFL."
“If this was any other sport, we'd be howling about the sanctity of the game and how someone who cheats should be branded with a scarlet PED for the rest of his life," she wrote. “But we don't even bat an eye at NFL players who dope."
Read the full USA Today column.
What Edelman himself had to say about his suspension on Monday morning
After pulling an all-nighter, Edelman made video appearances on several TV shows Monday morning, including CNN's “New Day."
On the show, anchor John Berman asked Edelman what he learned from his four-game suspension.
After a pause, Edelman replied, “Learned a lot from that. You learn a lot. You learn you have to have a short memory. You can dig into a deep hole, if you go the other way with it. I learned that you just gotta move on, and you gotta keep on working and you've gotta work your way out of it. And that's what I tried to do."

Texto completo: An official statement from the White House on President Trump’s complexion is that his skin color is the result of “good genes,” a senior administration official told The New York Times.
Despite his orange glow and white around his eyes, the White House insisted he did not go under the lamp.
An aide did at least admit to the Times that Trump uses a translucent powder -- but not a bronzer -- before he goes on TV, but insisted that was all the help he gets.
James Comey, the former FBI chief, speculated in his book that Trump was a fan of tanning beds. The president’s “face appeared slightly orange,” Comey wrote at one point in his memoir, “with bright white half-moons under his eyes where I assumed he placed small tanning goggles.”
Experts say the orange hue of the president’s skin could be a sign that this is how he chooses to maintain his skin color. “He looks more orangy than he does tan,” Dr. Tina Alster, a dermatologist, told Slate.

Trump a GOP obstacle in border talks

Autor: Wasson, Erik; Litvan, Laura. 

Información de publicación: Marin Independent Journal ; Novato, Calif. [Novato, Calif]. 03 Feb 2019: A.1.

Resumen: Congress last week voted to reopen the government temporarily after a partial shutdown lasted five weeks to give lawmakers on a House-Senate conference committee time to negotiate a border security plan. "On Feb. 15th, the committee will come back and if they don't have a wall, I don't even want to waste my time reading what they have because it's a waste of time," Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. "Because the only thing that works for security and safety for our country is a wall." The Democrats' offer includes $98 million for 1,000 new customs officers, $675 million for more imaging technology at land ports of entry, $400 million for other border technology procurement and $502 million for humanitarian aid for migrants.

Texto completo: Republican lawmakers negotiating a border security deal to avoid another partial government shutdown are running into an increasingly familiar obstacle: President Donald Trump.
With two weeks left to pass funding bills that keep federal agencies open, Trump is making comments that appear to foreclose possible compromises by saying anything short of a wall is a waste of time even as Democrats suggest they're open to spending billions more on border security and new fencing.
"It obviously makes it more challenging," said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, an adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "We keep talking and try to understand where he is and try to work it out."
At stake is the possibility of another government shutdown, and Trump's campaign promise
to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Congress last week voted to reopen the government temporarily after a partial shutdown lasted five weeks to give lawmakers on a House-Senate conference committee time to negotiate a border security plan.
Two years into his term, Trump has built a track record of killing congressional deals.
Last year, he blew up a bipartisan agreement to provide deportation protections for young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents in exchange for $25 billion in wall funding, demanding that controversial cuts to legal immigration be added. In December, he precipitated the shutdown by withdrawing support for a two-month stopgap spending bill that had already passed the Senate unanimously.
At times, Trump has appeared willing to accept some new fencing as a resolution to his demand for $5.7 billion for the wall. At other times, however, he says he will only accept a wall. Making matters more complicated, the president has described existing fence and levee projects on the border as a wall.
Top Republican negotiator Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama said the involvement of Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. complicates negotiations.
"If left alone, we could probably work this out before the end of the week but that's not the case right now because the speaker is involved and the president is involved, he said.
Trump has also floated the idea of declaring a national emergency and bypass Congress to get funds for the wall.
"On Feb. 15th, the committee will come back and if they don't have a wall, I don't even want to waste my time reading what they have because it's a waste of time," Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. "Because the only thing that works for security and safety for our country is a wall."
In an interview with the New York Times, published Thursday night, the president said the talks would likely be fruitless and that he may pursue a solution on his own.
Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted that Republicans on the committee are "wasting their time. Democrats, despite all of the evidence, proof and Caravans coming, are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL."
That was a shift from earlier in the week when Trump called for either a wall or a "physical barrier" as part of the deal.
Pelosi reiterated on Thursday that she won't fund a "wall," but she signaled flexibility on fencing.
"There's not going to be any wall money in the legislation," she told reporters.
However, there already are vehicle barricades known as Normandy fencing along the border, and, Pelosi said, "if the president wants to call that a wall, he can call it a wall."
"Is there a place where enhanced Normandy fencing would work?" she asked, adding that members of the bipartisan conference committee should "have that discussion."
Similar hints of compromise came from top Democratic negotiator Nita Lowey of New York, chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee. She didn't rule out new fencing money. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, said some new fencing could be possible if local authorities can control where it goes.
House Democrats on Thursday provided a detailed offer that would provide no funds for border barriers, though it shows the party is willing to provide billions in new money for technology and personnel.
The Democrats' offer includes $98 million for 1,000 new customs officers, $675 million for more imaging technology at land ports of entry, $400 million for other border technology procurement and $502 million for humanitarian aid for migrants.
The president hasn't made clear to Republicans the details of his position, complicating negotiations. Asked if she understands Trump's stance clearly enough to make a deal, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said, "We're trying to get there."
"We're going to move forward, and I think that we should," she said. "I think we should reach resolution. I think we can still get there. It might be barriers or fencing or levees and things of this nature."
John Thune of South Dakota, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, dismissed Trump's tweet suggesting the talks are a waste of time.
"The substance of his tweet is wrong," Thune said. "These are serious negotiations and our members who are at the table are intent on getting a result."
Some Democrats said Trump will be responsible for a second shutdown if he won't go along with a bipartisan deal.
"He's not supreme dictator," said Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who is on the conference committee. "I know we're probably an annoyance to him, but too bad. That's how democracy works."
The next meeting of the main negotiators is expected early next week while staff members plan to trade offers over the weekend. Lawmakers are trying to arrange border-security specialists to talk to the conference committee. Pelosi said the panel needs to complete an agreement by Feb. 8 to get it through Congress by Feb. 15.
Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said a deal will come together if Pelosi agrees to some type of barrier.
"It might be a wall,' it might be infrastructure,' it might be a barrier,' it might be a wangdoodle' for all I know," he said. "She can call it what she wants."
Senate Republicans said they are eager to move beyond the threat of another shutdown and are hoping Trump will seal a deal.
"I don't think another government shutdown is going to help anybody," said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc. "It's a lose-lose-lose situation."

Texto completo: I went into journalism to cover politics, but now I find myself in national marriage therapy. Covering American life is like covering one of those traumatizing Eugene O'Neill plays about a family where everyone screams at each other all night and then when dawn breaks you get to leave the theater.
But don't despair, I'm here to help. I've been searching for practical tips on how we can be less beastly to one another, especially when we're negotiating disagreements. I've found some excellent guides - like "Negotiating the Nonnegotiable" by Daniel Shapiro, "The Rough Patch" by Daphne de Marneffe and "The Art of Gathering" by Priya Parker - and I've compiled some, I hope, not entirely useless tips.
The rule of how many. When hosting a meeting, invite six people to your gathering if you want intimate conversation. Invite 12 if you want diversity of viewpoints. Invite 120 if you want to create a larger organism that can move as one.
Scramble the chairs. If you invite disagreeable people over for a conversation, clear the meeting room, except jumble the chairs in a big pile in the middle. This will force everybody to do a cooperative physical activity, untangling the chairs, before anything else. Plus, you'll scramble the power dynamics depending on where people choose to place their chairs.
The best icebreaker. To start such a gathering, have all participants go around the room and describe how they got their names. That gets them talking about their family, puts them in a long-term frame of mind and illustrates that most people share the same essential values.
Tough conversations are usually about tribal identity. Most disagreements are not about the subject purportedly at hand. They are over issues that make people feel their sense of self is disrespected and under threat. So when you're debating some random topic, you are mostly either inflaming or pacifying the other person's feeling of tribal identity.
You rigidify tribal identity every time you make a request that contains a hint of blame. You make that identity less inflamed every time you lead with weakness: "I know I'm a piece of work, but I'm trying to do better, and I hope you can help me out." When tribal differences are intractable, the best solution is to create a third tribe that encompasses both of the warring two.
The all-purpose question. "Tell me about the challenges you are facing?" Use it when there seems to be nothing else to say.
Never have a meeting around a problem. If you have a problem conversation you are looking backward and assigning blame. If you are having a problem conversation you're saying that one episode - the moment the government shut down - was the key to this situation, rather than all of the causes that actually led up to the episode. Instead, have a possibility conversation. Discuss how you can use the assets you have together to create something good.
Your narrative will never win. In many intractable conflicts, like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, each side wants the other to adopt its narrative and admit it was wrong the whole time. This will never happen. Get over it. Find a new narrative.
Never threaten autonomy. People like to feel that their options are open. If you give them an order - "Calm down" or "Be reasonable" - all that they will hear is that you're threatening their freedom of maneuver, and they will shut down. Nobody ever grew up because an angry spouse screamed, "Grow up!"
Attune to the process. When you're in the middle of an emotional disagreement, shift attention to the process of how you are having the conversation. In a neutral voice name the emotions people are feeling and the dynamic that is in play. Treat the hot emotions as cool, objective facts we all have to deal with. People can't trust you if you don't show them you're aware of how you are contributing to the problem.
Agree on something. If you're in the middle of an intractable disagreement, find some preliminary thing you can agree on so you can at least take a step into a world of shared reality.
Gratitude. People who are good at relationships are always scanning the scene for things they can thank somebody for.
Never sulk or withdraw. If somebody doesn't understand you, not communicating with her won't help her understand you better.
Reject either/or. The human mind has a tendency to reduce problems to either we do this or we do that. This is narrowcasting. There are usually many more options neither side has imagined yet.
Presume the good. Any disagreement will go better if you assume the other person has good intentions and if you demonstrate how much you overall admire him or her. Fake this, in all but extreme cases.
As you were reading this list, you might have thought the real problem was other people's obnoxiousness, not your own. But take an honest look at yourself. You just read all the way to the end of a piece of emotional advice written by a newspaper columnist.
Sad.

Mama Was a Betting Woman

Texto completo: Every night in my childhood home, the ritual was the same. We would wait, nervously, for the phone to ring. My mother would pick it up and hear the news: that day's combination of winning three-digit numbers, which told her whether any of her customers had been lucky. And if any of them had, she would have to pay out their winnings -- at a rate of 500 to 1.
This was Detroit in the 1960s and '70s and my mother, Fannie Davis, was a high-ranking numbers runner -- a bookie and a "banker" who collected bets and paid off wins for the underground lottery business that everyone I knew called "the numbers."
The game was simple: People called a bookie, put a bet on one or more three-digit numbers, and each day except Sunday "the house" -- major numbers bosses -- announced the winners, which were based on racetrack results. Individual bankers like my mother had to pay out to anyone who "hit," or won. In all the years that I watched my mother play and run the numbers, I was never tempted to bet. But I did learn how to gamble.
Her vocation was illegal, so we had to keep it hush-hush. I was not allowed to invite friends over after school because afternoon was prime time for Mama to take customers' bets. Her customers came to place their bets but also to visit for a while and discuss the latest news. My favorite was when a visitor would recount a dream and my mother would look up what it played for in her dream book, the numbers player's bible. These encyclopedic reference guides assigned three-digit numbers to all manner of images and experiences, and they helped customers decide which numbers to play.
Whenever anyone other than a customer showed up at our home unannounced, my job was to shove the numbers paraphernalia (notebooks, adding machines, payout sheets) into drawers; when people asked me what my mother did for a living, I said she was "in real estate." That lie was hard for me to tell because I was so proud of my mother. What I really wanted to do was brag about her distinction as one of the few female bankers in Detroit.
I understood from a young age that the threat of exposure was real. Seizures of gambling operations took place often. But so was the threat of Mama "getting hit hard" -- having to make a large payout. Both could lead to the loss of our middle-class status, what I've come to understand as our blue-collar black-bourgeois lives.
My mother's work provided us with a spacious Colonial brick home in a lovely West Side neighborhood, beautiful clothes and a quality education. I could not imagine life without those privileges, and while my older siblings could imagine it -- they remembered what it was like before our mother's success -- they didn't want to.
My mother often told me, "I'm doing this so you don't have to." My only job was to take advantage of every opportunity she and her numbers running made possible.
She distinguished between what she called "foolish, throw your life away" gambling and the smart kind. She taught me that a gamble ought not be reckless. It ought to be calculated, but not avoided altogether. The bigger the risk, the bigger your purpose needs to be.
My mother grew up in Nashville and migrated to Michigan in 1955 with my father and my three oldest siblings. In 1958, she found herself plunged into poverty, with four young children and an ailing husband. So she started her own numbers business. She knew that a lot of people around her liked to play this lottery and that she had a facility with figures and a reliable nature.
The chance to support her family, to be self-reliant, was absolutely worth the gamble. And it paid off. For 34 years, until her death, my mother ran her lottery business well, transforming a way to support her family into a thing of joy and possibility.
Shame was not part of the equation. My mother understood well the difference between a legitimate endeavor and an illegal one. She came of age amid all kinds of laws designed to deny both her humanity and her constitutional rights. When she started her numbers business, it was legal in parts of the country, and the practice in many others, to deny blacks home loans, to deter African-Americans from voting, and to deny black men like my father jobs because of the color of their skin.
While racetrack gambling and Catholic church bingo nights were legal, informal lottery betting -- a practice created by and largely practiced by African-Americans -- was illegal. None of this hypocrisy was lost on my mother. "We already know that when white folks want to do something bad enough," she said, "they can just create a law to get away with it."
Conversely, my mother knew that being a "law-abiding citizen" as a black American was no guarantee of your safety, that all you could depend on in this society was your own moral compass. This was what enabled her to be in an unregulated gambling business and hold onto her integrity. She was a woman of her word. She was loyal to her customers. She paid on time. As she would say, "You don't need a law to tell you right from wrong."
When customers came to the house to pick up their winnings, I'd often overhear them talk about what they planned to do with the extra money: "I tell you, Fannie, this came right on time. I'm going to get my mink coat out of the layaway!" Or "Now I can take that road trip down south and go to my family reunion in style!" Or "Honey, I can send my youngest girl a little piece of change to help her out at school."
And even when a customer hit big, my mother paid up. It often meant she'd have to build up her cash reserve again after the payout, but she understood how a windfall could change the trajectory of a life because it had happened to her. When I was 7 months old, she played three digits of her home address, 7-8-8, and hit big, using her winnings to put a down payment on our family home.
Today, I gamble regularly -- I buy lottery tickets. Depending on my inspiration, I play different three-digit combinations. But I always make sure I play my home address: 675. And in the "Red Devil Dream Book" under "Ladies' Names," "Fannie" is listed as playing for 6-7-5.
I often think about what my mother would say if she could see me buying my daily lottery tickets. Or what she would say about the other ways I gamble every day, pursuing big dreams and betting against odds. I want to believe she'd approve, because she taught me that there is no alternative. Life is risk.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
In 1855, Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote to his publisher, "America is now wholly given over to a damned mob of scribbling women." Although he was referring specifically to sentimental novelists, his letter expressed the larger belief that women's writing was not worth reading or publishing, that their words and ideas didn't matter, and that their work was, to use the language of Hawthorne, "trash."
As a historian, I see this playing out not only in the antebellum period, but also in the postwar era when I read letters to the editor. As I scan through various national newspapers, day after day, year after year, I find myself hoping that someday, eventually, women will be represented proportionally. I am always disappointed; they always skew male.
Perhaps Hawthorne's disdain for scribbling women is not such distant history.
This problem is especially concerning because unlike an Op-Ed -- where the writer presumably has some expertise in the subject matter -- anybody can submit a letter to the editor. It is, I'd argue, the most democratic section of the paper because children and adults, billionaire philanthropists and minimum-wage workers, and people of all genders can contribute. Each has an equal opportunity to express her or his thoughts and participate in a robust debate in the public sphere. Therefore, I'm troubled that in 2019, The New York Times struggles to find women's letters that are worthy of publication.
When I first inquired as to why so few women were writing, I was told that there aren't formal statistics on the number of women submitting letters, but that a large majority come from men. Gail Collins provided a similar explanation when she became the first woman editor of the editorial page at The Times in 2001 and started looking into this problem. She found that in letters to the editor and Op-Ed submissions, "the preponderance of men was off the charts."
But still, causality remains murky. Are women not writing because they don't see themselves represented? What role does implicit bias play? In the absence of formal research, it's hard to know.
The Times could put in place a quota for women's letters, ensuring that the number of women published each week is roughly proportional to the number of women in the population. But given the overwhelming backlash against affirmative action, I am not optimistic that this is a realistic possibility.
So while I would like to see more institutional changes, in the short term I want to encourage women to write more letters to the editor. The poet Audre Lorde described writing as a political act, the way "we predicate our hopes and dreams toward survival and change."
Similarly, submitting a letter to the editor says that in a society that refuses to acknowledge your full humanity, you insist on it. It is asserting that your ideas and words deserve an audience in a world that has historically devalued them. It is accepting that you most likely will never receive external validation for your efforts save for an automated email thanking you for your letter.
You will never know if your letter wasn't published because you were Kimberly and not Karl, or if your letter was boring, or if it had absolutely nothing to do with the merits of what you wrote. As Ta-Nehisi Coates reflected in "We Were Eight Years in Power": "My reasons for writing had to be my own, divorced from expectation. There would be no reward."
I used to think the reward would be the individual accomplishment of an editor selecting my letter as worthy of publication. But now I know the reward would be for tomorrow and the next day and the next, to open up The New York Times -- in fact, letters pages in any national newspaper -- and to see nasty, scribbling women from all over the country sharing their ideas and having their thoughts equally represented.
KIMBERLY PROBOLUS
Washington
The writer is a Ph.D. candidate in American studies at George Washington University.
The Editors Respond: We Hear You
Ms. Probolus is right. Even before we received her note, we'd wrestled with the fact that women have long been underrepresented on the letters page. By our rough estimate, women account for a quarter to a third of submissions -- although women do tend to write in greater numbers about issues like education, health, gender and children.
This gender disparity problem is not unique to the letters page. Online comments on our articles and the unsolicited Op-Ed submissions we receive skew heavily male. Nor is this issue unique to The Times.
The lack of women's voices is an industrywide phenomenon, as documented in a 2011 article in Poynter.org ("Why women don't contribute to opinion pages as often as men & what we can do about it"). It is reflected in efforts such as the Op-Ed Project, founded in 2008 "to increase the number of women thought leaders in key commentary forums to a tipping point."
As for our letters page, we make our selections regardless of gender. But we are sensitive to gender imbalance, and as editors of a space dedicated to readers' voices, we are determined to have it reflect more closely society as a whole. Going forward, we're committing ourselves to work toward a goal of parity on a weekly basis. We'll report back on our progress in February 2020.
But we need your help. So we want to urge women -- and anyone else who feels underrepresented -- to write in (here is a guide).
Traditionally we have chosen letters that were sent by email (letters@nytimes.com) or postal mail. From now on, in addition to those sources, we'll seek a new pool of writers by reaching out in newsletters, the Reader Center, Facebook groups and other social media.
Just as we were thrilled to hear from Kimberly Probolus, we'd love to hear from you.
THOMAS FEYER, Letters Editor
SUSAN MERMELSTEIN, Staff Editor
Please Write to Us
We'd like to hear your thoughts about why more women don't write letters and comments, and how to remedy this. Let us know in the comments section of this article.
Or send an email to letters@nytimes.com. Please keep your letters to 200 words or less. Include your name, city/state and contact information, and put "women" in the subject line.

Texto completo: In 1989, Euzhan Palcy became the first black female filmmaker to direct a studio movie with the South Africa-set apartheid thriller "A Dry White Season," starring Donald Sutherland, Susan Sarandon and Marlon Brando.
"Dry White Season" was initially at Warner Bros., but the studio ditched it, fearing that Universal had already cornered the market on apartheid movies by releasing "Cry Freedom" a few years before. So Palcy pitched the project to MGM's Alan Ladd Jr.
"And they gave me everything I asked for," she says about MGM. "I will never forget that."

Nearly 30 years later, "A Dry White Season" has been digitally restored and released as a Criterion Blu-ray. Palcy, who lives in Paris, spoke by phone about the story behind a Hollywood milestone.
Palcy grew up on the island of Martinique where, as far as she knew, there were no filmmakers. But she used to regularly attend a village theater that showed Hollywood movies.
"I used to go to the movies as often as I could, and black faces, black characters, were totally absent," Palcy says. "And very rarely, when we had a black character, a black actor, it would always be in a very degrading part. That would make me very sad."
When she was 13, her mother gave her the novel "Sugar Cane Alley," a semi-autobiographical work by Martinican author Joseph Zobel that would later become Palcy's celebrated first film. "I had a culture shock, because at school we never talked about our culture," she recalls.
"My desire for becoming a filmmaker came out of my love for film, and anger [about] what I would see. I couldn't accept that that art that I loved so much would hurt me so much -- by my people being totally absent."
Though becoming a film director didn't seem realistic, it became Palcy's obsession. "I prayed to God every night, I'm not kidding. After the family prayers, before going to bed, I would stay a little bit longer on my knees, and I would make a little secret prayer to God to make me grow up fast, just to be able to make a film."
She left Martinique for Paris, where she studied literature and film and worked on the script for "Sugar Cane Alley." Through a friend, she made a connection with Francois Truffaut and the legendary French New Wave auteur became a mentor as she completed her film debut. The film ended up winning the Silver Lion at the 1983 Venice Film Festival, and the French Cesar Award for first feature film, and earned rave reviews from Roger Ebert and the New York Times.
The success of "Sugar Cane Alley" meant that studios took an interest in bankrolling Palcy's follow-up project. She wanted to adapt Alice Walker's "The Color Purple," but after hearing that Steven Spielberg already owned the rights, she decided to focus on South Africa. Her original intent was to explore apartheid entirely from the point of view of black characters, but quickly realized that financing such a project wasn't an option in Hollywood.
So Palcy opted for the next best thing. "When I came across the book 'A Dry White Season' [by Andre Brink], I saw immediately what I could do," Palcy says, "because [it's] about the awakening of a white man, an Afrikaner. He saw the light, and decided to fight his own brothers in the name of justice. I decided to make the adaptation a story of two families -- one black and one white." Though the film was shot in Zimbabwe, Palcy traveled undercover to Soweto to research the details.
The lead Afrikaner roles in "A Dry White Season" were played by Hollywood stars: Sutherland, Sarandon and, coming out of retirement after a decade-long hiatus, Brando. But Palcy stipulated that the black characters had to be portrayed by black South Africans rather than African Americans. "We had to give those people a voice. Remember, when I'm making that movie, Nelson Mandela is still in jail, and the Special Branch was killing people like flies. I was ready to make that movie at any cost, but if I do that, I want to make a real movie about the situation."
Still, the existence of respected South African performers like Winston Ntshona and Zakes Mokae did not prevent the studio from marketing it as another "white savior" story. The original American poster featured only Sutherland, Sarandon and Brando.
Despite its packaging, "A Dry White Season" is an unusually powerful rendering of the costs of principled dissent -- as well as a crackerjack thriller. In Palcy's hands, the film is especially attuned to racism as an institutional force rather than the product of individual racists. (Sutherland's hero is a history teacher who passes down apartheid mythology to a new generation.)
Brando plays a human rights attorney working to expose police brutality; his big moment arrives in a climactic courtroom scene, but tellingly, the scene arrives in the middle of the film rather than toward the end, as if to emphasize that in such a corrupted society, courts cannot provide a path to justice. No matter how eloquently he argues, the advocate can't win.
The film's success included strong reviews and an Oscar nomination for Brando, but in the years that followed, Palcy was unable to get another Hollywood project off the ground.
Palcy says many studios wanted to meet with her and acknowledges that she turned down more than 200 scripts. "But they would not touch my [own] stories because they were about black people. They kept saying to me -- to my face, but very nicely, not to insult me -- that 'black is not bankable.' "
"I decided, OK, I cannot accept to direct the movies that Hollywood will ask me to direct. I kept struggling and pushing my own projects because I knew that they were good."
Of one such passion project, focused on black female aviation pioneer Bessie Coleman, a studio executive friend urged Palcy: "Don't waste your time. Please move on, and put it in the drawer until the time is right. Those guys are not ready for that -- nobody will do it, Euzhan."
Instead, she moved into television, where she says she was given creative freedom to direct meaningful stories about black life. "Ruby Bridges," about the first African American child to desegregate an all-white school in the South, was made for Disney, and "The Killing Yard," about the 1971 Attica prison uprising, was a Showtime original.
Over the past three decades, this pioneering director has seen Hollywood open the doors -- at least slightly -- to new forms of representation.
"It's been very slow. The change was just on the surface, for many years. But it's becoming better now, with all the platforms, the Netflix and the Amazon," she says. Two filmmakers who have released films via Netflix, Ava DuVernay and Dee Rees, have both spoken reverently of Palcy's work, and recognized her as a trailblazer. Palcy says she has four TV projects in development, two of which are comedies.
Inevitably, Palcy returns to her memories of being a young filmgoer in Martinique, seeing only one kind of face on the screen. "There is a demand for these movies, to see different people's faces on the screen. And it is fair."

TRUMP CAN CALL DEMOCRATS' BLUFF ON BORDER SECURITY

Texto completo: Having lost the government shutdown standoff, President Donald Trump has also lost his leverage. But there is one way he can get it back.
Democrats are standing firm in opposition to a border wall, but they have also been at pains to argue that they are not weak on border security. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., say Democrats support "smart, effective border security solutions -just not the president's wasteful and ineffective wall."
Mr. Trump should call their bluff. He should go back to the experts at the Department of Homeland Security and ask them: If Democrats refuse to give you the additional physical barriers you have said are essential to secure the border, what other funding would you need to make up for it? How many extra border agents would you need in the absence of a wall? How many more canine units? How much more for improved coordination with state and local law enforcement in our border communities? How many more Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents for interior enforcement? How much for underground sensors, radar, unmanned drones and fixed towers with infrared cameras? How much more advanced detection technology at our ports of entry? How many more portable scanners to detect smuggled narcotics, weapons and other dangerous materials? How much for construction of new ports of entry? How many more immigration judges? How much for employment eligibility verification? How much more in humanitarian assistance and medical support for those detained at the border? How many more detention beds and temporary housing units for migrant families? How much more for DNA testing to establish family relationships? How much to set up a new system that will allow Central American minors to apply for asylum in their home countries?
The total, he should tell the border professionals, can be far more than $5.7 billion. Just tell me what you need -the sky's the limit.
Then, the president should then use his State of the Union address to demand that congressional Democrats fund every single penny. He should announce that if Democrats won't pay for a wall, this is what border agents and homeland security professionals say they need immediately to secure the border without one. Unfortunately, it is more expensive to secure the border with people and technology than it is with steel slats.
Mr. Trump should make clear these demands are nonnegotiable. He will not make any concessions for them. No protections for "Dreamers" or extension of the Temporary Protected Status program. Those things are still on the table, but only in exchange for a physical barrier.
If Democrats refuse, Mr. Trump will have regained the moral high ground. He can tell the American people: First, the border professionals told us they needed an additional 230 miles of physical barriers, and Democrats refused. Now, they have told us what they need to secure the border without those physical barriers -and Democrats still refuse. The Democrats are not against a wall; they are against border security, period.
But Democrats will not refuse, because they have no grounds to do so. They have repeatedly claimed over the past few weeks to support such measures. Well, now it is time to start funding them.
Such a massive border security request would divide the Democratic caucus. While Democratic leaders claim they want to secure the border, their rank-and-file members do not. Those members want to abolish ICE, not give it more resources. If Mr. Trump wants to pit the likes of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and her neo-socialist followers against Ms. Pelosi, this will do it.
If Democrats agree, then Mr. Trump can legitimately claim to have done more than any president in history to secure the southern border. He will have essentially built a virtual wall. And he can do all this without giving up on a physical barrier. Mr. Trump can make clear that he will make wall funding a condition of every policy initiative that Democrats put forward in the coming two years. He can declare that he is more than willing to cut a bipartisan deal to reform our broken immigration system -as long as that deal includes a wall.
Right now, Democrats have a winning hand when it comes to a border wall. But when it comes to border security, Mr. Trump essentially has carte blanche. Democrats have little choice but to give him pretty much anything he wants to secure the border short of a physical barrier. If he recognizes this reality and uses it to his advantage, he can still win.

Venezuela plan needs skepticism

Texto completo: There's no doubt Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is a terrible leader. Following in the steps of his predecessor Hugo Chavez, he is further destroying what's left of a once-prosperous oil state. His human rights record is a disaster.
But the Trump administration's effort to oust Maduro - it recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as legitimate president last week - revives memories of past unhappy U.S. efforts at regime change. Think Libya, failed efforts in Syria, and Iraq, for starters.
In true Trumpian fashion there appears to be no Plan B should Maduro hang on, nor any strategy for coping with a failed state if he is deposed. Yet so far Trump's Venezuela venture has received bipartisan support in Congress. It should be getting much more skeptical scrutiny than it has received until now.
First, there is the matter of why we are involved in Venezuela regime change at this moment.
The rhetoric about human rights from the president and Vice President Pence clearly doesn't cut it; this is not a White House that cares about humanitarian causes. Maduro may be the first despot for whom Trump has expressed dislike.
When the Venezuela story broke last week, it looked like a move to distract from the government shutdown. I thought it might be a test run for the bigger Trump aim of squeezing Iran into regime change via sanctions.
Yet, as the New York Times has detailed, the effort to dislodge Maduro is mainly the result of a long-running push by Cuban-American Sen. Marco Rubio, R. Fla., to engage Trump on the issue. The underlying reason appears to be Cuba: Maduro, like Chavez, is closely aligned with Havana, which long profited from cheap Venezuelan oil. Ousting Maduro would hurt the Cuban regime.
It looks like Rubio, along with another Cuban-American - the National Security Council's senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs, Mauricio Claver-Carone - persuaded Trump this issue was a winner.
Perhaps this appeared to be the opportune moment: the situation was at boil, with huge anti-Maduro demonstrations on the streets of Caracas. The optics were good. "This is a civic revolution against a kleptocratic tyranny," says the University of Maryland's Vladimir Tismaneanu, an expert on popular revolts against dictators. The young, handsome Guaido - directly encouraged by Pence - declared himself the legitimate president.
As leader of Venezuela's National Assembly, Guaido had a plausible legal basis to take charge, since the last presidential elections were blatantly rigged. Moreover, Washington got many Latin countries to recognize Guaido, with EU nations poised to join if Maduro didn't schedule new elections.
Yet, good optics and good causes can't overcome the caveats that make U.S. intervention a huge gamble. So far the Venezuelan military is backing Maduro, and it, plus tens of thousands of armed militiamen, has all the guns. U.S. sanctions may deter Maduro from selling oil to the United States, but his strong backers China and Russia can take up the slack, while other countries will also buy more discounted oil.
Will the United States intervene militarily if Maduro hangs on? It looks unlikely (despite National Security Adviser John Bolton's efforts to hint that this option is open). At a time when Trump wants to pull all U.S. troops out of Syria, Afghanistan, and maybe even South Korea - damn the consequences - it's hard to imagine him invading another country.
That's a good thing, because, if the military sticks by Maduro, U.S. intervention would be a very bad idea.
So why are we getting into the regime change game again in Venezuela? That is the question that Americans should be asking right now.

Texto completo: A feel-good movie about guide dogs in training hits Hulu. And the second season of a Finnish crime drama debuts on Netflix.
What's Streaming
PICK OF THE LITTER (2018) stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. This uplifting documentary carries the suspense and drama of reality-TV competitions, but it also offers a healthy dose of squeal-worthy shots. The contestants in question are five puppies training to become guide dogs for the blind over the course of 20 months. With lives at stake, the matter is not taken lightly: Many pups don't make the cut, and rivalries flare up among the human "puppy raisers." Whether or not the dogs pass the tests, the tenacity of all involved is simply admirable. "It's startling, even inspiring, to see how many humans it takes to condition a fully successful dog," the film critic Ben Kenigsberg wrote in The New York Times. "Every single canine on screen deserves plenty of head-pats and naps in the shade."
BORDERTOWN on Netflix. Tired of the grueling detective work at the National Bureau of Investigation in Finland, Kari Sorjonen (Ville Virtanen) takes a new job as head of a crime unit in a seemingly peaceful town near the Russia border. He expects a quaint life with his family, but is soon pulled into several murder cases. The second season of this Nordic noir television series, which, unlike the first, is dubbed in English, concerns five new crimes and a twist that makes Kari's life at home just as troubling as his time on the job.
[Video: Rize - Trailer Watch on YouTube.]
RIZE (2005) stream on Mubi; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. The photographer and director David LaChapelle spotlights the electric dance form known as clowning and its successor, krumping, which originated in greater Los Angeles in the early 1990s. (Krumping has since been seen in music videos and in an episode of "Community.") Early on, the documentary notes that none of the footage has been sped up -- the dancers really do pump their chests and flail their arms at frenetic paces. By the end, it captures a momentous battle and conveys that the dances were born despite, or because of, surrounding poverty and gang violence.
What's on TV
DEATH OF A CHEERLEADER (2019) 8 p.m. on Lifetime. In 1994, a Rolling Stone article about the murder of a high school student in Northern California inspired the TV movie, "Death of a Cheerleader," also known as "A Friend to Die For." This remake stars Aubrey Peeples as Bridget, a reserved outcast who wants nothing more than to be friends with Kelly (Sarah Dugdale), a pretty, rich and popular classmate who rejects her. The blow drives a vengeful Bridget over the edge, but no one in her neighborhood suspects she is behind Kelly's demise. Kellie Martin, who starred in the original alongside Tori Spelling, returns in the role of an F.B.I. agent. The 1994 movie is available to rent or stream on Amazon.

Texto completo: President Trump believes a case making its way through the courts to throw out Obamacare is likely to succeed, which will give his administration another shot at replacing the law.

"I believe it’s going to be terminated, whether it be through the Texas case, which is going through the court system as a victory right now, because of, you know, the various elements of that case, you would think it would have to be terminated," he said in an interview with the New York Times published Friday.

The Trump administration joined 20 Republican state officials in asking the courts to undo Obamacare after Congress zeroed out the fine against uninsured people as part of the GOP tax law. State officials said the entire law should be struck down because the Obama administration once argued the fine was central to making the healthcare law work.

The Trump administration sided with GOP officials in the case, known as Texas v. U.S ., but asked the courts only to strike down parts of the law prohibiting health insurers from turning away sick people or charging them more.

A federal judge sided with the officials in a December ruling, but the law is still in place while it is being appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans by Democratic state attorneys general.

Trump has previously pledged that a Republican replacement plan to Obamacare would protect people with pre-existing illnesses, and Republicans in Congress have said they expect lawmakers would come together to pass a bill to reinstate the protections.

Democrats have not committed to taking action should that occur, and have said GOP replacement plans carry weaker protections for the sick. Democrats have focused their healthcare efforts on defending the law and hammering Republicans over their efforts to undo the law.

Deliberations over Texas are expected to continue in the coming months or years, putting healthcare in the spotlight leading up to the 2020 elections, as it was during the midterm elections. The White House has said it expects the case to make its way to the Supreme Court.

But experts of both political persuasions have predicted the lawsuit won't succeed.

In his New York Times interview, Trump blamed the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for being the deciding vote against a plan that would have narrowly repealed Obamacare, noting that he had not followed through on his years-long promises to undo the law. He alluded to the possibility of reviving a replacement plan if the law is struck down in court.

"But a deal will be made for good healthcare in this country," Trump said. "That’s one of the things I’ll be doing."

Texto completo: DENVER • Michael Malone, the point guard, was scrappy, relentless, smart, the ol’ ball coach says. Good passer. Preferred ‘D’ to ‘O.’ Related as well with the big-bucks star as he did with the kid swimming in khakis, mopping up sweat.
When they were on the Knicks staff together, the coach says, Michael Malone would snag a ball and scrimmage with the players. (“That stuff matters,” Steph Curry said during a recent visit to Pepsi Center.) A longtime team photographer once told the coach that Michael Malone competed like Dick McGuire, a Knicks great and Hall of Famer.
“Now when I watch Michael coach,” he says, “I get so nervous watching our games.”
The ol’ ball coach is Brendan Malone, the father of Nuggets coach Michael Malone. Fifty years he spent in basketball, 30 as an NBA assistant. He won a pair of championship rings with the Pistons. He’s now 76 and forever Astoria, Queens, through and through. “They say I’m old-school,” Brendan Malone says, enough so that he reads the print edition of the New York Times every morning.
Brendan Malone lives in Westchester County, New York, and rarely misses a Nuggets game on NBA League Pass. Dad’s pretty proud of his son, the Nuggets coach, you might say. He hollered at the TV like the rest of us during a 25-point comeback at Memphis on Tuesday (“Herculean,” Malone said Thursday, “But why wait until the second half?”) and has witnessed most of Denver’s 35-15 start, a franchise record through 50 games and the dawn of a new era.
“We’re surprising everybody,” Brendan Malone said. “Everybody’s waiting for us to fall. So now we’re disappointing everybody.”
Just as president of basketball operations Tim Connelly should be the front-runner for NBA Executive of the Year, Michael Malone should be the top candidate for Coach of the Year. His resume shows not only the No. 2 spot in the West, but a seemingly impossible road to get there, with the league’s third-youngest roster burdened with the third-most man-games lost due to injury, according to mangameslost.com.
But dad’s not going to disagree with his son’s candidacy, so that’s not why we spoke Thursday. We spoke because the Nuggets on Friday host James Harden and the Rockets, one of the few puzzles they haven’t yet figured out.
“Nobody has figured him out,” as Brendan Malone said.
And it was Brendan Malone, then a Detroit assistant, who designed the “Jordan rules” defense employed by the Pistons in their timeless battle against Michael and the Bulls in the ‘80s and ‘90s. That seems helpful. While this is not to say Harden equals Jordan, principles of slowing a one-man wrecking crew still hold true.
Here, let’s all geek out while the coach charged with stopping the G.O.A.T. breaks it down: “With Jordan he was playing all over the place — on the wing, up on top, in the post. The ‘Jordan Rules’ we came up with, when he was on the wing, we would push him to the elbow and double team at the elbow. We did not want him to drive baseline. When he posted up, we doubled from the top. Joe Dumars did a good job. He was strong enough. We didn’t stop him, but we contained him. When we kept him under 30 points that was an accomplishment. You don’t want Harden scoring 60 like he did against the Knicks. Then you don’t have a chance.”
And on Harden, who enraged opposing fans, emboldened referees and averaged 43 points in the month of January: “With Harden it’s all pick-and-roll. (Mike) D’Antoni has a high pick-and-roll and spreads out his 3-point shooters. I thought the best job was the last game against the Pelicans (when Harden had 37 points on 11-for-32 shooting). They did a good job giving him different looks. It’s exactly how I would attack him. You gotta to give him different looks.
“Pick him up above the 3-point line, play him off his left shoulder, force him to drive the ball. The back line of defense has to protect the basket. Sometimes you double-team him, sometimes you play him straight up. That’s what the Pelicans did. And you absolutely cannot bring your hands down. Soon as you bring your hands down, he’s shooting free throws.”
Sounds easy enough, right? The worst-case playoffs scenario has the Nuggets facing Harden’s Rockets in an early series. The best-case scenario has the Nuggets continuing to assume the personality of Michael Malone, their coach — scrappy, relentless, smart.
As the Nuggets prepare to integrate point guard Isaiah Thomas into a backcourt that seems to grow another Monte Morris or Malik Beasley with every game, Malone’s greatest strength as a coach comes into focus: player psychology.
It’s not every day DeMarcus Cousins delays the team bus because he wants to pick the opposing coach’s brain after a game, or Thomas signs with Denver due to his relationship with the coach. Theirs are strong personalities who, for unique reasons, bond with Michael Malone’s.
“I was just talking to my wife about Latrell Sprewell. It was a little like Cousins when I was there,” Brendan Malone says. “You have to talk to them with respect. They’re adults, fathers, husbands. Some coaches come into the league and try to coach them like high school players. But players have to feel that you have their back (and) you’re going to stick up for them.”
Michael Malone is not bashful in appraising the potential of these Nuggets. He’s told The Gazette this is the core, paced by first-time All-Star Nikola Jokic, capable of one day carrying the first NBA title to Colorado. On that note, his father is quick to remind the Pistons’ parades weren’t planned overnight.
“Let me tell you about the Pistons,” Brendan Malone said. “They drafted Isiah Thomas No. 2 in the draft. They got Adrian Dantley. Then they got Dumars, John Salley and Dennis Rodman in the draft. Then they pulled a trade for (Bill) Laimbeer and James Edwards.
“It was a process. It took from 1980 to 1989. You had to go through Atlanta, Boston and the Lakers before we could win a championship. It’s a process. People, they get impatient with the process. They want it now . This young Nuggets team, they’re maturing, they’re going to make mistakes. Stick with ‘em. He loves them. Loves his players, loves the city. He just loves it.”
One basketball lifer lived a golden era as an NBA coach, one is beginning his own. Like father, like son.

Howard Schultz and the Frappuccino Syndrome

Texto completo: Holy Chestnut Praline Latte! There was Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks CEO, making a case Wednesday for why Americans would flock to him if he decides to run for president as an independent. "They’re not going to vote for a left-wing Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris candidate," he explained.
The crashing you heard just then was the sound of thousands of Caramel Macchiatos hurled at televisions broadcasting "Morning Joe," where the coffee king appeared.
Was I alone in wondering why the man who thinks he will save our nation yoked together two very different female candidates as the collective image of all he sees wrong with the Democratic Party? Was it really just about their views on health care or taxes?
First, let’s put the most sympathetic spin on Schultz’s exertions: He’s hawking books. I’ll even help him here: His memoir is called "From the Ground Up."
His toying with the presidency might thus be another illustration of the marketing genius that persuaded so many to believe (wrongly, in my view) that Starbucks is better than Dunkin’. We’re all talking about him! Promote, Howard, promote!
But if Schultz is serious about throwing some small share of his billions into a presidential campaign, the backlash against him is appropriate -- and the rebukes aren’t just a response to the arrogance of thinking that selling us on drinks like "Cold Foam Cascara Nitro" or on the idea of saying "venti" rather than "large" qualifies him to be president of the United States.
The primal response to Schultz among so many Americans who believe that defeating Donald Trump should now be the country’s main priority reflects a considered and intelligent judgment: Things are way too serious to go soft on a vanity candidate.
The case that Schultz would help Trump by splitting the opposition vote has already been made well by many, including Eugene Robinson in The Washington Post, Michelle Goldberg in The New York Times, and William Galston (who, by the way, leans to the center) in The Wall Street Journal. Schultz should read them all.
But the reaction against Schultz is also a pushback against the deep misunderstandings about our politics that animate his candidacy. What the heck: Let’s call it the Frappuccino Syndrome, after my own favorite Starbucks concoction.
First, this syndrome pretends that because calling yourself "independent" is more popular now than in bygone years, these voters must constitute a large, coherent group looking for a "centrist" alternative to the two parties. Indeed, there was Schultz Wednesday morning touting the "42 percent" who are independents as his potential base.
This is nonsense. I asked Scott Clement, the Post’s polling director, to run the numbers. More than 6,000 interviews in Post/ABC News polls between January 2018 and January 2019 found the country split 36 percent Independent, 32 percent Democratic, and 25 percent Republican.
The independent share seems impressive until you consider the follow-up question, which found that 46 percent of Independents lean toward the Democrats, and 33 percent lean Republican. So: (1) Independents are divided like the rest of us, and (2) The remaining "pure" independents who decline to lean either way account for only 8 percent of adults, and many of them rarely vote.
Second, enabling the syndrome depends on the claim that the two major parties are equally "extreme." It’s a word Schultz loves. But this, too, is false. Polarization, as my political scientist friends (and, recently, co-authors) Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein have been arguing for years, is "asymmetric." The Republicans have, objectively, become significantly more extreme than the Democrats.
Exhibit No. 1 for GOP extremism is the man in the White House. And just compare the House intakes from the Republican landslide in 2010 and the Democratic landslide last fall. The 2010 Republicans were swept in by the tea party. The Democrats’ Class of 2018 is chock-full of very moderate progressives elected from very moderate districts. And if the Democrats are equally "extreme," why are moderate Republican state legislators switching to the Democrats in states as different as California, Kansas, Hawaii and New Jersey?
I get why billionaires don’t like progressive taxes. But high marginal tax rates were the law under Dwight Eisenhower -- nobody’s idea of a socialist. Also: notice that Schultz is directing most of his fire against Democrats. That’s strange behavior from someone who claims that beating Trump is a priority.
But, hey, maybe you have to understand the appeal of a Cinnamon Shortbread Latte to grasp Schultz’s political genius. We Dunkin’ folks like our coffee simple.

Border Security Talks Have Just Begun, and Already We're at the Ultimatum Stage

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump proclaimed on Thursday that without funding for his wall at the southwestern border, the panel of lawmakers negotiating a broad compromise on border security would be "wasting their time," issuing what appeared to be an ultimatum even as lawmakers pleaded for a chance to reach a deal that would head off another shutdown.
"Without a wall, it doesn't work," Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. "I'm not saying this as a Republican, I'm not saying it as anything other than a fact stater."
"If you don't have a wall," he added, "they're all just wasting their time."
And in an interview with The New York Times on Thursday, the president indicated that he was prepared to move forward without lawmakers, saying that he had "set the stage for doing what I'm going to do." He declined to directly say whether he planned to declare a national emergency to build a wall.
[Read the New York Times interview with President Trump.]
The comments came as 17 House and Senate lawmakers from both parties struggled to reach a bipartisan border deal before Feb. 15, when much of the government again runs out of money. Republican leaders, especially in the Senate, have made it clear that they do not want to suffer through another debilitating shutdown, and senators asked the president to give them room to work.
"I think it would be more worthwhile and effective if the president would allow some space for these negotiations to occur and not be doing commentary at this point," said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.
Democrats offered their own opinions on Thursday: In her weekly news conference, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters that "there's not going to be any wall money" in a final bill. Four House Democrats, all freshmen, circulated a letter lobbying for cuts to the Department of Homeland Security's budget, urging colleagues to "not compromise our values at the negotiating table."
But it was the president's commentary throughout the day on Thursday, on Twitter and in the Oval Office, that prompted several lawmakers to plead for him to tone down his messaging.
Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a member of the negotiating group, known as a conference committee, asserted that without outside reaction -- not just from the president, but other "outside forces" -- a solution could be reached within days.
"If the speaker, the president and everybody, the leaders of our parties in the Senate, would let us, the appropriators, do our job, we could do this," Mr. Shelby said.
Democrats released formal details on Thursday of their opening bid in negotiations, outlining nearly $56 billion in spending for the Department of Homeland Security without any mention of walls or fencing. The proposal also blocks the construction of physical barriers on wildlife refuges on the border, the only mention of such barriers.
Ms. Pelosi signaled that she would be open to allocating money for roads, ports of entry and infrastructure and technology at the southwestern border -- all things that she said were "part of the negotiation."
"They have to choose the best way to use the money," she said of the committee, adding that a bipartisan consensus could hopefully be reached without outside interference.
But the president, who has vacillated between hard-edge demands for border wall funding and a softer tone on alternatives to a wall, returned to his hard-line posture that a wall had to be included in a final bill. He repeated his false claim that construction of new expanses of border wall had already begun.
The tone of Mr. Trump's remarks, coupled with a string of morning tweets, prompted a mixture of bewilderment and concern among lawmakers trying to reach a deal but unsure of what the president will sign.
"I do think the president's tweet underscores the single most important question as to whether this negotiation can be successful: how free the Republicans are to negotiating in good faith and to what extent they can proceed to do that," said Representative David E. Price, Democrat of North Carolina and a member of the negotiating committee.
A path to a final compromise on border security and funding the Department of Homeland Security "still appears uncertain because of what he said and because of how he operates," Mr. Price said in an interview.
For some lawmakers, the president's assessment about the success of the negotiations was simply realistic.
"I think the president is saying something that a lot of people are already thinking," said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. "This may well be a waste of time, and I think the president may turn out to be right."
"We also could surprise ourselves around here and do something intelligent," he added. "You just never know."
But some lawmakers remained optimistic that a deal could be reached before Feb. 15, with the president's approval. The scope of the bill is likely to be narrow to maintain consensus, without the addition of immigration law changes or the inclusion of a measure to raise the government's statutory borrowing limit.
"We don't want to go there. We want to keep it simple," said Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana and a member of the committee. "I think we have to keep it simple and clean."
Other members of the committee, including Mr. Shelby, have also raised the possibility of bringing in experts to outline what exactly is needed at the border.
"I think we can still get there," said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia who sits on the conference committee. "Maybe it won't be the terminologies -- it might be barriers or fencing or levies or things of this nature -- but I think we need to listen to the professionals, and the professionals are telling us we need more barrier."

Throughout the month, Shreve Memorial Library branches will celebrate African-American authors and their works while giving the public an opportunity to join read-in activities. The public can participate in an open mic event by reading passages or reciting poetry. Open mic events will be held at the Atkins, David Raines, Hollywood/Union Avenue, North Shreveport, Wallette, and West Shreveport Branches. Book discussions will also be held at Broadmoor, Hosston, Main, North Shreveport and Rodessa Branches.
In addition to these great programs, Shreve Memorial Library will have programs planned to celebrate local African-American history, traditions and genealogy throughout Black History Month. Be sure to check the website for a list of program dates and times. Below are book recommendations.
African American Read-In Book Recommendations
An American Marriage by Tayari Jones (fiction)
Newlyweds Celestial and Roy are the embodiment of both the American Dream and the New South. He is a young executive, and she is an artist on the brink of an exciting career. But as they settle into the routine of their life together, they are ripped apart by circumstances neither could have imagined. Roy is arrested and sentenced to 12 years for a crime Celestial knows he didn't commit. Though fiercely independent, Celestial finds herself bereft and unmoored, taking comfort in Andre, her childhood friend, and best man at their wedding. As Roy's time in prison passes, she is unable to hold on to the love that has been her center. After five years, Roy's conviction is suddenly overturned, and he returns to Atlanta to resume their life together. This stirring love story is a profoundly insightful look into the hearts and minds of three people who are at once bound and separated by forces beyond their control. "An American Marriage" is a masterpiece of storytelling, an intimate look deep into the souls of people who must reckon with the past while moving forward – with hope and pain – into the future.
Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi (fiction)
With five starred reviews, Tomi Adeyemi's West African-inspired fantasy debut, and instant #1 New York Times Bestseller, conjures a world of magic and danger, perfect for fans of Leigh Bardugo and Sabaa Tahir. Zelie Adebola remembers when the soil of Orisha hummed with magic. Burners ignited flames, Tiders beckoned waves, and Zelie's Reaper mother summoned forth souls. But everything changed the night the magic disappeared. Under the orders of a ruthless king, magi were killed, leaving Zelie without a mother and her people without hope. Now Zeile has one chance to bring back magic and strike against the monarchy. With the help of a rogue princess, Zelie must outwit and outrun the crown prince, who is hell-bent on eradicating magic for good.
Pride by Ibi Zoboi (fiction)
"Pride and Prejudice" gets remixed in this smart, funny, gorgeous retelling of the classic, starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. In a timely update of Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice," critically acclaimed author Ibi Zoboi skillfully balances cultural identity, class, and gentrification against the heady magic of first love in her vibrant reimagining of this classic.

Texto completo: In 1997, on the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's Brooklyn Dodgers debut, Major League Baseball announced that his No. 42 was being retired. Only players already wearing that number could continue to do so.
Ten years later, various players took the tribute a significant step further. In what amounted to a grass-roots movement initiated by Ken Griffey Jr. of the Cincinnati Reds, various members of various teams received the go-ahead from baseball to wear No. 42 on what would now be the 60th anniversary of Robinson's first major league game.
In all, more than 200 players, managers and coaches took part in the tribute, and on half a dozen teams, including the Los Angeles Dodgers, everyone wore No. 42.
One of those who was duly impressed at the time was Willie Randolph. In 2005, he had become the first African-American manager of a New York major league team. Now, two years later, he was watching as current players much younger than him went out of their way to acknowledge their debt to Robinson.
"You hear these jokes that the modern player doesn't know anything about baseball history," Randolph said. "But it's pretty clear that most of them do appreciate what Jackie Robinson did for them -- for all of them."
Two years later, in 2009, baseball resolved that everyone should wear No. 42 on April 15. That day, the New York Times columnist George Vecsey went to Citi Field to watch the Mets play the San Diego Padres and, with everyone wearing the same number, noted "the odd effect of never quite knowing who was at bat, or running the bases."
Still, he wrote, that didn't matter at all. It was the tribute that did, a coast-to-coast gesture to a player "who produced a Hall of Fame career under extreme pressure."
The last active player to wear Robinson's number was the Yankees' Mariano Rivera. By 2007, he was the sole No. 42 still on a roster and it stayed that way until he retired in 2013.
In an interview with The Times in 2007, Rivera said that he felt "blessed" to be the last player wearing No. 42. And this July, he will also join Robinson in Cooperstown, as a new inductee in the Hall of Fame. One No. 42 will join another.

Texto completo: When Chris Whitaker sets out to open a restaurant, he looks for a concept that's unique. His most recent venture — LYNQ, which opened off Summerlin Road in south Fort Myers in April 2017 — is no exception.
"LYNQ comes from an idea I had about linking different cultures, cuisines, people and music," Whitaker said.
"We have some Asian things, we have Italian, contemporary American, French, tacos. It's a diverse menu, but it's not too cluttered."
The menu generally features four types of ramen noodles, four different tacos, four salads and eight entrees.
"No matter who shows up at the door, we'll have something for just about everybody," Whitaker said.
The restaurant is situated in the space once occupied by Yabo. When he took over the lease, Whitaker transformed the unit into something that reflected his unique vision.
"It's a real fun space inside," he said. "We linked different metals and woods and fabric, like a potpourri of design."
People often ask Whitaker who he used as his interior designer, but he just laughs and tells them, "We did it ourselves."
Together with business partner Jean-Claude Roge, Whitaker designed the interior of the restaurant and its patio area. Some of LYNQ's notable features include a large video wall that plays music videos from a playlist of 20,000-plus songs, and an element called the "fire wall" that incorporates pieces of metal and wood.
This emphasis on unique design is a trademark of Whitaker's other restaurants. He helped launch the original Blu Sushi in 2003. In May 2016 he and Roge opened Blanc, a narrow and much smaller space, but one that's just as stunning as LYNQ.
Why is design so essential?
"Basically, we're in the entertainment business," Whitaker said. "People come to our doors to be entertained, to have fun and to have a great experience. If you walk into a space and you feel good, that's all part of the experience."
It'd be easy to assume Whitaker has been in the food business his whole life. But his background is in manufacturing, and for 15 years he ran his own storm shutter company. He started Blu, his original restaurant project, as a side business.
"I was a maitre d' in college out in Colorado, and I've always liked the restaurant business," he said.
"I had an idea for Blu with a friend in 2002. We were in a sushi restaurant and nobody spoke English. We couldn't get a cocktail, and all they had was beer and wine and old sake. We said to ourselves, 'Wouldn't it be cool to have American-style sushi with some fun martinis?' So we opened Blu on McGregor as kind of a hobby, and it took off."
LYNQ started serving lunch last week. Its daytime menu includes sushi, poke bowls and ramen noodles, among other dishes.
"We won't be fast-casual," Whitaker said, meaning the restaurant will still feature traditional sit-down service at lunchtime. "But it's going to be very quick."
When he talks about the success of his restaurants, Whitaker credits the food and the design, but he says his staff is what makes the experiences especially unique.
"I have a great team of wonderful people," he said. "I try to hire people that have empathy and that really care about the customer."

Ugly trend of demonizing white men

Texto completo: Rush Limbaugh’s December 2018 Limbaugh Letter has an article titled "Demonizing White Men." It highlights — with actual quotations from people in the media, academia and the political and entertainment arenas — the attack on white men as a class. You can decide whether these statements are decent, moral or even sensible. Should we support their visions?
Don Lemon, a CNN anchorman, said, "We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right, and we have to start doing something about them." Steven Clifford, former King Broadcasting CEO, said, "I will be leading a great movement to prohibit straight white males, who I believe supported Donald Trump by about 85 percent, from exercising the franchise (to vote), and I think that will save our democracy." Teen Vogue, a magazine targeting teenage girls, wrote, "Not only is white male terrorism as dangerous as Islamic extremism, but our collective safety rests in rooting out the source of their radicalization." Economist Paul Krugman, a New York Times columnist, wrote a column titled "The Angry White Male Caucus," in which he explained, "Trumpism is all about the fear of losing traditional privilege."
There have been similar despicable statements made by academics. James Livingston, a Rutgers history professor: "OK, officially, I now hate white people. ... I hereby resign from my race." Stacey Patton, a Morgan State University professor: "There is nothing more dangerous in the United States than a white man who has expected to succeed and finds himself falling behind." Stony Brook University sociology professor Michael Kimmel explained, "White men’s anger comes from the potent fusion of two sentiments: entitlement and a sense of victimization."
Not to be outdone, entertainers have hopped on the demonizing-white-men bandwagon. Joy Behar, talking on ABC’s "The View" about senators supporting Kavanaugh, said: "These white men — old, by the way — are not protecting women. They’re protecting a man who is probably guilty." Actress Gabourey Sidibe, also on "The View," said: "Older white men are a problem, y’all, for everyone. We’re all at risk." Moira Donegan wrote an article for The Guardian titled "Half of white women continue to vote Republican. What’s wrong with them?"
That is just a partial list of statements that would be viewed and condemned as racist simply by replacing "white men" with "black men," "Mexican men" or "Asian men." You can bet the rent money that university presidents and media executives would sanction any of their employees for making similar broad, sweeping statements about nonwhite men. Suppose a white anchorman said, "Black people are the greatest murder threat in this country." I guarantee you that he’d be shown the door.
There are only two ways to explain the silence by people who should know better. Either they agree with the sentiments expressed or they are out-and-out cowards. Decent American people ought to soundly reject and condemn this brazen attack on white men. I think that the attack is on masculinity itself and that white men are a convenient scapegoat — for now.

Texto completo: "What the Trump organization has done is not unique in this country, but what is unique is we have the head of that organization be the president."
D. Taylor, President of UNITE Here
An attorney who represents undocumented immigrants who have worked at President Donald Trump's golf courses in New Jersey and New York said Tuesday that he is seeking deportation protection for his clients so they can share allegations of harassment, abuse and immigration fraud that they said they witnessed and experienced at work.
Anibal Romero, who has a law practice in Newark and represents 20 undocumented immigrants who say they have worked at the Trump National Golf Clubs in Bedminster, New Jersey, and Briarcliff Manor, New York, said the Trump Organization is a "criminal enterprise" that has hired undocumented immigrants for years. Some of these workers, he said, have been physically abused and threatened with deportation.
"All of them are material witnesses to a federal crime, and any attempt to try and remove them from the United States could possibly be obstruction of justice," he said in a conference call with reporters, saying that he has received calls from other workers of the Trump Organization who live in other parts of the country.
The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Eric Trump, the son of the president and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told The Washington Post on Tuesday that it will begin to institute E-Verify, a federal program that allows employers to check whether new hires are legally eligible to work in the United States, in every one of its golf clubs, hotels and resorts.
Romero was joined on the conference call by D. Taylor, president of UNITE Here, the hotel and restaurant workers union; and David Leopold, a partner with Ulmer & Berne LLP and a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Romero said he has met this week with several lawmakers, including New Jersey's Democratic senators, Bob Menendez and Cory Booker, seeking their support for "deferred action."
Menendez met Tuesday morning in Washington with several undocumented immigrants who worked at Trump properties, according to Steven Sandberg, a spokesman, who added that Menendez supports "congressional oversight" in the matter.
A call to Booker's office was not immediately returned Tuesday.
About a dozen workers at Trump National in Westchester County, including landscapers and housekeepers, were fired this month because they were in the country illegally, according to a report by The Washington Post.
The firings came about a month after The New York Times reported that undocumented immigrants had submitted fraudulent documentation when they were hired to work as housekeepers at Trump National in Bedminster, and that they were kept on the payroll for years even though they said management was aware of their legal status.
Romero, who is calling for congressional, federal and state investigations into the matter, said he has received calls from both the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, which he said asked him for documentation, and the New York Attorney General's Office. He said he is scheduling a meeting with officials in the New York office.
Leland Moore, a spokesman for the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, declined to comment, saying that the office does not confirm or deny investigations.
The undocumented immigrants were working at Trump businesses as Trump campaigned on curbing illegal immigration, and more recently as he has pushed for funding for a border wall, setting up a fight with Democrats in Congress that resulted in the longest partial government shutdown in the country's history.
"We have a situation whereby we have a president who has criminalized, demonized, dehumanized and blamed immigrant workers, both as he was running for president and as president," said Taylor, whose union represents more than 275,000 hotel and restaurant workers, a majority of whom are immigrants, people of color and women. "And at the same time, we have the exact same organization hiring, abusing workers, who he says are responsible for crime in this country, and in fact all they are doing is working hard providing for themselves and their families and trying to have a better life."
Romero and Taylor said the undocumented workers were not given health insurance or retirement benefits, and that they were paid less than their counterparts who had legal status. Romero said there was no "upward mobility," meaning access to promotions, for his clients. One woman he represents was demoted from her role as a supervisor when they found out she was undocumented, he said.
"I think it's up to lawmakers now to investigate this as a criminal activity, but also both Republicans and Democrats have to step up and really deal with the immigration issue in a comprehensive way," Taylor said. "What the Trump organization has done is not unique in this country, but what is unique is we have the head of that organization be the president."
One of the women profiled in the Times story, Victorina Morales, spoke Tuesday during the conference call. A native of Guatemala, Morales said she arrived in the United States in 1999 and that she worked for Trump National in Bedminster for five years and had access to his living quarters while he was running for president. When Trump was elected, she said, she was told she would no longer be allowed to work in his residence.
She was later told that she had to resubmit her documentation, including her residency and Social Security cards. When she first was hired, she had submitted fraudulent documentation. She said a supervisor helped her get new fraudulent paperwork for $165, and that they took pictures for the green card at the golf course. Morales previously told the Times that she ended up borrowing $165 from a manager at the resort to pay someone in Plainfield for a new bogus Social Security number and phony green card to replace the ones she had initially submitted for the position.
She said she has been subjected to verbal abuse several times, and that one supervisor pushed her against the wall three times.
"That's when I thought that the reason she is acting this way is because of the way the president speaks on TV," Morales said in Spanish, with Romero translating. "There are a lot of people who want to speak, but I'm sure they are afraid because there were a lot of threats.
"If someone filed a lawsuit, they would call immigration," she added.
Leopold said the allegations emphasize the need for comprehensive immigration reform.
"This case underscores not only the criminal activity of the president of the United States and his businesses and his family, but underscores a problem in this country that in a way we are all complicit in," he said, "and that is allowing a permanent underclass of worker to go on, and that needs to stop."

THE ABYSS OF HATE VS. HATE LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES ARE UNDERMINING DEMOCRACY BY FOLLOWING THEIR MOST TRIBAL INSTINCTS

Texto completo: Across most of the national media, led by The New York Times and The Washington Post, the narrative had been set. "I'm willing to bet that 50 years from now, a defining image of this political era will be that smug white MAGA teen disrespecting a Native elder and veteran. It just captures so much," Jessica Valenti tweeted. "And let's please not forget that this group of teens . were there for the March for Life: There is an inextricable link between control over women's bodies, white supremacy & young white male entitlement." This is the orthodoxy of elite media, and it is increasingly the job of journalists to fit the facts to the narrative and to avoid any facts that undermine it.
There's a reason why, in the crucial battle for the legitimacy of a free press, President Donald Trump is still on the offensive. Our mainstream press has been poisoned by tribalism. My own trust in it is eroding.
The other night I was having a drink with a friend who said he believed that the Trump threat was essentially over, as the shutdown took its toll. He noted what might become an inflection point in the polling. He was heartened by the midterms. He might be right.
But I think that misses the core point about this presidency. From my perspective, the Trump threat to liberal democracy is deepening, largely because its racial animus and rank tribalism are evoking a response that is increasingly imbued with racial animus and rank tribalism, in an ever-tightening spiral of mutual hostility.
"The red MAGA hat is the new white hood," tweeted Alyssa Milano. In his debut Times column, Jamelle Bouie describes a border wall thus: "You can almost think of the wall as a modern-day Confederate monument, akin to those erected during a similar but far more virulent period of racist aggression in the first decades of the 20th century." Charles Blow insists that "we have to stop thinking of the symbology of Trump's presidency - the MAGA hats, the wall, etc. - as merely physical objects. They have long since lost their original meaning and purpose. They are now emblems. They are now the new iconography of white supremacy .In much the same way that the Confederate flag became a white supremacy signalling device, the MAGA hat now serves the same purpose. It is tangentially connected to Mr. Trump, but is transcends him also. It's a way of cloaking racial hostility in the presentable form of politics."
A campaign slogan for a candidate who won the votes of 46 percent of the country in 2016 is to be seen as indistinguishable from the Confederate flag. This is not the language of politics. It is a language of civil war.
I can understand this impulse emotionally as a response to Mr. Trump's hatefulness. But I fear it morally or politically. It's a vortex that can lead to nothing but the raw imposition of power by one tribe over another. There can be no dialogue here, no debate, not even a State of the Union in which both tribes will participate. And none of us is immune.
What was so depressing to me about the confrontation on the Lincoln Memorial steps between Native American leader Nathan Phillips and Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann was how so many liberals felt comfortable taking a random teenager and, purely because of his race and gender, projected onto him all their resentments and hatred of "white men" in general.
Here is Kara Swisher, a sane and kind person, reacting to the first video: "To all you aggrieved folks who thought this Gillette ad was too much bad-men-shaming, after we just saw it come to life with those awful kids and their fetid smirking harassing that elderly man on the Mall: Go f--- yourselves."
Judging - indeed demonizing - an individual on the basis of the racial or gender group he belongs to is the core element of racism, and yet it is now routine on the left as well as the right. To her great credit, Ms. Swisher apologized profusely for the outburst. The point here is that tribal hatred can consume even the best of us.
And this is what will inevitably happen once you've redefined racism or sexism to mean prejudice plus power.
It's reasonable to note the social context of bigotry and see shades of gray, in which the powerful should indeed be more aware of how their racial or gender prejudice can hurt others, and the powerless given some slack. But if that leads you to ignore or downplay the nastiest adult bigotry imaginable and to focus on a teen boy's silent face as the real manifestation of evil, you are well on your way to creating a new racism that mirrors aspects of the old.
This is the abyss of hate vs. hate, tribe vs. tribe. This is a moment when we can look at ourselves in the mirror of social media and see what we have become. Liberal democracy is being dismantled before our eyes - by all of us.
This process is greater than one president. It is bottom-up as well as top-down. Tyranny, as Damon Linker reminded us this week, is not just political but psychological, and the tyrannical impulse, ratcheted up by social media, is in all of us. It infects the soul of the entire body politic. It destroys good people. It slowly strangles liberal democracy. This is the ongoing extinction level event.
Andrew Sullivan wrote this for New York magazine. This is an excerpt of his original article.

Judge: Release suit vs. Purdue

Texto completo: A Massachusetts judge ruled Monday that the state's lawsuit against Purdue Pharma for allegedly helping spawn the opioid crisis should be released in full to the public.
Previous versions of the suit, which have provided new details about how the company marketed its blockbuster OxyContin painkiller, contained portions that were redacted.
The complete document could shed light on decisions made by Purdue's board and how much money company executives made.
The decision from Judge Janet Sanders in Suffolk County Superior Court came in response to a motion filed by media organizations, including STAT and The Boston Globe, to release the full lawsuit, filed by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey in June.
Sanders ordered that Massachusetts' complaint be made public by noon on Friday. (There was one exception: She said one paragraph that mentioned private medical information of a Purdue official could remain redacted.)
Purdue said in a statement that it planned to ask an appellate court to stay Sanders' decision.
Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and WBUR joined STAT and the Globe in seeking release of the full document.
The state's lawsuit also names current and former Purdue executives and members of the Sackler family, who control the privately held company, as defendants.
At a court hearing Friday, Purdue's attorney had tried to argue that releasing the full complaint would interfere with the collection of company documents in a separate legal case in federal court in Ohio. There, lawsuits from hundreds of tribes, cities, counties, and other states against Purdue and other opioid makers have been bundled together.
Purdue said the Massachusetts court should wait to decide what it would make public until authorities in the federal court had determined what company documents they would release and what they would determine was confidential.
“The disclosure of the information — while it may prove embarrassing for some of the defendants — is not intensely personal or private," Sanders wrote in her opinion. “In essence, the information describes the inner workings of a company and discussions about company business among its directors, officers, and employees. Any interest in keeping this information secret is hardly compelling and certainly not enough to overcome the presumption of public access."

Texto completo: Forget about the wall and worry about the back door.
That's my takeaway from Sunday's eye-opening — and somewhat scary — front-page story in The New York Times about the US government's efforts to persuade allies and other countries to shun next-generation mobile phone networks made by Huawei Technologies and other Chinese companies.
Unlike President Trump's phony immigration crisis, China's potential ability to infiltrate so-called 5G networks is a real security threat. This time, the president has it right.
“Nervousness about Chinese technology has long existed in the United States, fueled by the fear that the Chinese could insert a 'back door' into telecom and computing networks that would allow Chinese security services to intercept military, government and corporate communications," according to the Times story by David E. Sanger, Julian E. Barnes, Raymond Zhong, and Marc Santora. “But the concern has taken on more urgency as countries around the world begin deciding which equipment providers will build their 5G networks."
What is 5G? It's the fifth generation of mobile technology that AT&T, Verizon, and other phone companies around the globe are beginning to roll out. But more than just providing faster downloads of YouTube videos, 5G networks are, as the Times explains, the first “built to serve the sensors, robots, autonomous vehicles and other devices that will continuously feed each other vast amounts of data, allowing factories, construction sites and even whole cities to be run with less moment-to-moment human intervention."
In other words, if there is ever a real Matrix, it will run on 5G.
Huawei (pronounced “hwa-way") is China's largest supplier of telecom gear. The United States fears that the company and other Chinese suppliers are willing or unwilling participants in Beijing's corporate and military espionage efforts.
Installing their equipment, the argument goes, would give China's leaders the ability to monitor communications, hack into computer systems, and steal military and trade secrets.
Huawei denies that it is controlled by or works for the Chinese government, and the United States has offered no hard evidence to back up its concerns, even as it has blocked Huawei from the US 5G market and pushes countries including Poland to do the same.
Australia has banned Huawei's 5G equipment and gear made by ZTE, another Chinese supplier, and carriers in Britain are weighing their options.
Huawei's image has been hurt by the December arrest in Canada — at the behest of US officials — of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive and daughter of the company's founder, on charges that she defrauded banks to help Huawei evade sanctions against Iran. Earlier this month a Huawei employee was arrested in Poland on charges of spying.
On Monday, the feds turned up the heat. The Justice Department unsealed criminal sanctions charges against Huawei, two of its subsidiaries, and Meng.
The company was ­also charged in a separate case with stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile, according to federal prosecutors.
The US-China tariff spat is just a sideshow for this bigger fight over how to protect the security of 5G networks. And it's a hard fight to win. The Internet is global, and there will always be places where China — and let's not forget the Russians and North Koreans — could slip through a back door.
The US government does its fair share of spying on enemies and friends alike. So it's hard to blame the Chinese for trying to keep up.
We can only hope that the both countries eventually find it in their best interests to be competitors, but not enemies.
But until that day arrives, the Trump administration — for all its lying, mistakes, and cynical policies — is right to sound the alarm about China and 5G. The balance of economic and military power may hinge on that back door.

Texto completo: Whether you're an avid cable news watcher or an unwitting fish, you're liable to get hooked by Rachel Maddow .
The MSNBC host took time away from the hustle and bustle of New York City for some ice fishing near her home in West Cummington, Mass., over the weekend.
“Icefishing at the Ashfield LakeHouse in Western Mass, the greatest place on earth," Maddow wrote on Twitter, posting a photo of herself out on the ice with a red folding chair and a Vexilar ice fishing rig.
Maddow has sung the praises of ice fishing and Ashfield Lake House before, citing the bar and grill's Sloppy Joes as perfect ice fishing fuel in a January 2018 tweet.
According to a 2005 Globe article, Maddow's now-partner Suzy Mikula bought their West Cummington home in December 1998 and met Maddow four months later, when she was searching for someone to help her manage upkeep of the creaky 1865 home and the land surrounding it.
In a 2014 New York Times interview, Maddow said she typically arrived at the house at 2 a.m. on Saturday during a weekend away from New York. She said the place has no television, but it does have a fishing pole.
“A very old friend of mine gave me a fishing pole," Maddow told the Times. “I'd done a little fishing as a kid. Now, I have started fishing in the rivers around my house. I have my Massachusetts fishing license in my wallet and my pole in the shed."

Incoming conductor brings out the best in PSO

Texto completo: When Eckart Preu last conducted the Portland Symphony Orchestra, nearly a year ago as a candidate for its music directorship, he played a risky hand by making Alexander Zemlinsky's grandly scaled but rarely performed "The Mermaid" the centerpiece of his program. The gamble paid off: Preu drew a superb performance from the orchestra and won over the audience, so although the competition was tough, Preu's adventurous programming choice - and the faith it showed in the orchestra's musicians - helped him win the post.
He returned to Merrill Auditorium on Sunday afternoon to take a victory lap, now as music director-designate; when he appears next, in September, the "designate" will be dropped. It was a chance for listeners who missed his audition concert to catch up, and for those of us who heard it to see whether our strong first impressions held up.
The good news: That first impression was not a fluke. With three lavishly orchestrated works - Tchaikovsky's "Romeo and Juliet" Overture Fantasy, the world premiere of "The Telling Room" by the Hawaiian composer Michael-Thomas Foumai, and Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheherazade" - Preu led finely nuanced, thoughtfully paced interpretations, and drew from his players the kind of focus and energy that this orchestra can produce when it's at its best. Coming midway through a season of performances that for the most part have been puzzlingly listless, it was heartening to see that the Preu-PSO chemistry works so well.
The drawing card this time was the Rimsky-Korsakov, a work from the heart of the canon - but one that demanded many of the same interpretive skills as last year's Zemlinsky performance. Both, after all, are narrative pieces that use the nonverbal language of music - with rhythm, harmony, melody and orchestral color all pressed into service - to tell a specific, detailed and emotionally weighty story.
"Scheherazade," actually, paints the details of several "Arabian Nights" tales, within the larger story of Scheherazade's bid to stay alive by keeping her husband, the Sultan Schahriar, so fascinated with her nightly cliffhangers that he sets aside his habit of beheading his wives after their wedding night. The sultan and Scheherazade herself are represented by themes within the work, which change as the tales progress, as if Scheherazade is portraying the sultan and herself as the protagonists or participants in some of the stories. The tales themselves are built on vivid effects - particularly the concluding episode, "The Ship Goes to Pieces on a Rock."
Preu took some unusual tempos at times, but they never seemed wrong, within the larger context. Often, it was a matter of lingering over details that typically sweep past, and in almost every case, his decision to do so magnified significant details.
There were a couple of ensemble slips that, if they weren't in particularly exposed spots (tentative attacks on the work's very first and last wind chords) might have gone unnoticed. But more broadly, the orchestra seemed to revel in both the sound Rimsky-Korsakov demanded, and the shapeliness that Preu brought to it.
Charles Dimmick, the concertmaster, contributed significantly, bringing a rich, sweet tone and a powerful emotional underpinning to the solo violin passages that represent Scheherazade. There were also briefer solo turns for oboe, trombone, trumpet, flute, English horn, French horn and clarinet, all executed with finesse.
Preu opened the concert with a passionate rendering of Tchaikovsky's "Romeo and Juliet," which benefited from a lush string tone and finely unified wind and brass choirs, as well as a healthy measure of dynamic flexibility.
Between those Russian classics, Preu led the premiere of Foumai's "The Telling Rooms," a work commissioned by the orchestra. Foumai was inspired by the work of three young Maine poets - Aubrey Duplissie, Husna Quinn and Eliza Rudalevige - who were among the winners of the Telling Room's annual statewide poetry competition.
Foumai's work is purely orchestral; the poems, which are about color, are not heard as such, although they are printed in the program book. But the piece - a series of three fantasies, in effect - reflects the impressions the poetry left on Foumai, whose style is conservatively neo-Romantic and tuneful, with both dark (lightly dissonant) and playful episodes.
Foumai is a deft orchestrator, who likes to keep his colors and textures changing constantly, even when repeating riffs run through them. There was nothing technically or conceptually challenging in the music, and sometimes the rhythms of his themes were relentlessly squarish. But new works don't always have to be revolutionary. This one was appealingly varied, with an enjoyably sparkling finale.

Trump again vows to build wall

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A day after President Donald Trump surrendered in his standoff with congressional Democrats and agreed to reopen the federal government, he continued to push back against the notion - including criticism from political allies - that the episode represented a major defeat.
Trump had insisted for more than a month that he would not let the government shutdown end without securing money for his promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. But on Friday, he reversed course in the face of mounting public pressure, declining poll numbers, escalating air travel delays and anger from the FBI director he selected. The deal struck with congressional leaders reopens the government through Feb. 15, while creating a committee meant to negotiate a border-security agreement.
On Saturday morning, the president took to Twitter, saying that "21 days goes very quickly and once again vowing that the promised wall would be constructed.
"Will not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in, he wrote. "The case for National Security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the Border & through dialogue. We will build the Wall!
He also had tweeted Friday night that the deal "was in no way a concession.
Trump's efforts to spin the episode as a victory - or at least a momentary pause on the way to a victory - came amid an immediate backlash from conservatives allies, criticisms the image-conscious president had no doubt seen.
While some of his backers rallied around the president, stalwart Trump allies joined in the criticism. Lou Dobbs, the Fox Business Network host, sharply criticized Trump's move and said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., "just whipped the president of the United States. On Saturday, Dobbs predicted that the president's approval ratings would drop even more. Ann Coulter, the conservative commentator, suggested Trump was "the biggest wimp to hold the office. Far-right websites described Trump as caving.
The White House on Saturday tried to counter that image.
Asked during an appearance on Fox News whether the president had caved on the shutdown fight, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said, "100 percent no. He stood up for the American people. He reopened the government.
Gidley said that Trump had repeatedly asked for the sort of border funding that U.S. security officials said they needed, only to encounter intransigent Democrats in Congress.
"Democrats would not negotiate. They would not come to the table, Gidley said. He predicted that some Democrats would be willing to cut a border-security deal in coming weeks that includes money for a wall, even as party leaders have said they have no intention of funding Trump's border wall.
"The lesson I hope that the Democrats learn here is that they can't just not negotiate. They can't offer nothing and expect something to get done, Gidley said, adding: "They weren't doing anything on behalf of the American people. They used federal workers as pawns. Regardless of what they try and say and the tears that stream down their cheeks, they did nothing to protect the American people.
Despite that argument, the shutdown's end was widely seen in the capital and beyond as the president giving in, which played out in media coverage: The Washington Post described Trump's "capitulation to Democrats as "a humiliating low point in a polarizing presidency. The New York Times depicted Trump as "backing down, while the Wall Street Journal called Trump's move "a retreat.
Trump had fretted about the shutdown's impact on the economy and his personal popularity. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Friday found that public disapproval of Trump had increased to 58 percent as most Americans held him and congressional Republicans responsible for the shutdown.
In recent days, Trump had sought to point fingers, blaming fellow Republicans and even his own staff for failing to help him achieve his campaign promise to fund a border wall.
The man who had campaigned as a business savant and master dealmaker emerged from the unprecedented shutdown looking, above all, ineffective. It was that image that he and the White House seemed to be trying to avoid Saturday, insisting instead that the wall would still be built and that the president deserved praise for reopening the same government he had brazenly closed more than a month earlier.
For the 800,000 employees who have not been paid during the 35 day shutdown, that pain will not end immediately. It will likely take until late next week before they receive their payments, delays that will cause continued hardship for all the employees already struggling to pay bills during the longest shutdown in history.

POETRY HAS BECOME A 'GROWTH INDUSTRY'

Texto completo: People are clicking on poetry on Twitter. They're listening to poems on podcasts. They're buying poetry collections on Amazon.
But on a recent Monday night in St. Paul, they were hearing poetry in person. A diverse, mostly 20-something crowd snapped and purred as friends and strangers read their verses from Park Square Theatre's lower stage during Button Poetry's monthly slam poetry competition.
Many were drawn here by You-Tube. (Button's YouTube channel boasts more than a million followers.) By Instagram. By the changing world of poetry.
"We're seeing astronomical growth," said Sam Van Cook, who founded Button, a Minneapolis- based company that straddles poetry's in-person and online worlds. "Friends who work in book sales we joke that for the first time in any of our lives, poetry is a growth industry."
More people especially young people are reading and buying poetry. About 12 percent of adults read poetry in the past year, a bump of 5 percentage points over 2012 and a 15-year high, according to a new survey by the National Endowment for the Arts. Sales of poetry books have swelled over that time, according to NPD BookScan, which tracks book sales in the U.S., "making it one of the fastest growing categories in publishing."
Social media are driving the trend. Among the top 20 best-selling poetry authors in 2017 were a dozen so-called "Instapoets," who attract readers by sharing short, photogenic verse on Instagram and Twitter. Their queen is Rupi Kaur, an Indian- born Canadian poet who boasts 3.4 million Instagram followers, sells out theaters and claps back at her detractors.
But poets published by traditional presses and praised by critics use those platforms, too, sharing one another's work and changing the notion of a poet as an old white dude. Minnesotans Danez Smith and Hieu Minh Nguyen are among those sharing new and "b-side" poems on Twitter, letting their thousands of followers in on whom they're crushing on, poetry-wise and otherwise.
"There's a myth around who a poet can be or who can be a poet," Nguyen said by phone. "People are seeing that those archetypes, those barriers, aren't true."
?Poetry tells the truth'
As the slate of bards becomes more diverse, so do their audiences. Some of the biggest gains in that NEA Survey of Public Participation in the Arts, released last year, came from people of color. About 15 percent of African- Americans reported reading poetry, up from 7 percent in 2012. Some 13 percent of Asian-Americans had read poetry in the past year, compared with 5 percent in 2012.
Minnesota-based Vietnamese- American poet Bao Phi compared it to the shift in Hollywood, where "we've seen that representation can actually pay out huge dividends."
For decades, many marginalized people have hustled to diversify the slate of poets performing and publishing, especially by connecting with students and young people, said Phi, who crafted his reputation as a spoken word artist in the 1990s. Performance-based poetry finally shed some of the scene's chauvinism. Spoken word artists broke through the glass ceiling of publishing. (Phi didn't publish his first poetry collection, "Sông I Sing," until 2011.) "This didn't happen overnight," Phi said. "All that work adds up to what we're seeing now."
In these poets' hands, the form is well suited to take on big, knotty topics and complex, collective grief, editors argue.
Erika Stevens, poetry editor at large for the Minneapolis-based nonprofit Coffee House Press, pointed to "Indecency," by Justin Phillip Reed, which tackles white supremacy with intimate, sometimes confrontational poems. Last year, that collection, published by Coffee House, won the National Book Award in poetry, showing "how far the institutions have come in terms of what they recognize as innovative and groundbreaking and worthy of award attention," Stevens said.
U.S. poet laureate Tracy K. Smith recently wrote in the New York Times about why "political poetry is hot again," arguing that poetry "has become a means of owning up to the complexity of our problems."
Stevens said, "I don't know if you can divorce the current movement in poetry from the current politics in our country. Poetry tells the truth in very specific and unflinching ways.
"And now more than ever, we have a need for the truth."
?A little less magnificent'
As a theater kid at Central High School in St. Paul, Nguyen fell in love with poetry as he was performing it. He and his friends did spoken word at slams starting his freshman year. "It wasn't like I was the weird kid reading poetry books alone at lunch," Nguyen said by phone recently. "Poetry has never been this lone venture. I wasn't strange or different for reading or liking poetry."
(Novels came later, he said. "I was able to scam my way through grade school without reading a single book. Poetry taught me how to read.") So he appreciates that the literature industry, which "treats poetry as if nobody reads it," is now acknowledging its popularity. The internet and social media allow would-be fans to explore poetry beyond what they were taught in high school, he said, to encounter storytelling "they actually resonate with."
Poets and readers have debated the success of Kaur, who turned a viral Instagram post into best-selling books, a tour and, now, printed canvases. A recent poem, paired with a pen drawing, nabbed more than 200,000 likes: "i am water/ soft enough/to offer life/tough enough/ to drown it away."
Whether Kaur's hugely popular poetry is "for me or not is not the question," said Van Cook, of Button Poetry. "But I can tell you, if I talk to people about poetry at a wedding or a coffee shop, people especially young women, women of color she's one of the first names on their lips." Those young women recognize themselves in her work and find solace in her books, he said.
Van Cook founded Button because he believes poetry is "most vibrant read aloud, and read by someone who loves it." Its You-Tube videos of readings by well-and lesser known poets often amass tens of thousands of views.
Composers talk about how film took classical music, which was being relegated to the sidelines, and gave it a new, more prominent home, he said. "People are going to look back and talk about social media that way for poetry," Van Cook predicted. "What poetry needed was to be a little less magnificent."
At "Button Poetry Live" on a Monday night, a few newbies and some spoken word veterans took the stage, reading from iPhones and journals and memory. Many of their poems grappled with tough topics: micro-aggressions, breakups, coming out. Then, the special guest took the stage: poet, performer and podcast host Franny Choi. For one poem, titled @fannychoir for her Twitter handle, she took racist, misogynistic tweets and Google-translated them into other languages and then back again, to English.
In short, she garbled their words and made them hers.
"Mrs. Great Anime Pornography, the fruit of the field," she began with a smirk.
Outside the theater, three friends in their 20s perused Choi's chapbooks, selling for $12 and $15. They started attending Button's live events after hearing about them from a friend, finding them to be an inexpensive, fulfilling way to spend a night together.
"It's thought-provoking," said Katie Snell, 26, of Minneapolis. "I cried." Snell owns "Milk and Honey," a book of Kaur's poetry, she said. But that wasn't her introduction to the form.
Years back, she said, she came across a book of sonnets at a used book store and brought it home.

Texto completo: On paper, the six-day strike teachers strike that disrupted learning at 900 public schools across Los Angeles was a fight about orthodox demands like lower class sizes, higher pay and more support staff from nurses to librarians and counselors.
But a core issue and perhaps the most divisive barely touched the bargaining table: the future of the city’s 224 charter schools.
Education policy experts contend that although United Teachers Los Angeles – the union that represents the teachers in L.A. Unified – wins regarding charter schools at the strike’s conclusion may be largely symbolic, the strike has sparked a broader conversation happening across Southern California on charters that will likely make its way to Sacramento and stands to impact the direction of public school districts across the state.
Public education is essentially a two-sector system codified into state law in 1992 – the traditional, centrally managed school district and charter schools independent from a central school board.
As enrollment in the Los Angeles school district declined for 15 years, charter schools grew into a full-fledged industry educating more than 112,000 students and posing tough competition for traditional public schools.
Angeleno enrollment in charters, which are publicly funded but privately managed, reportedly drains $600 million a year from the Los Angeles Unified School District, which is tasked with serving around half a million students. While the schools do undergo a rigorous approval process complimented by hundreds of pages of paperwork, they operate free from many regulations and all but a few are nonunion.
To clear up any confusion about district-affiliated versus independent charters, a district-affiliated charter is a hybrid. The word “charter” in its name reflects a status the school adopted to secure more outside sources of revenue but it operates within the confines of the district.
During the strike
In the months leading up to and during the six-day walkout, UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl frequently decried “the unregulated growth of charter schools” to the press and his own membership.
“That doesn’t mean all charter schools are bad,” he repeated in his characteristic baritone, rather what began as a well-intentioned experiment now undermines traditional public schooling as more charter schools backed by billionaires and neglect the neediest students.
Charter school advocates call the union’s messaging on charters during the strike a blatant mischaracterization.
“I’d really like Alex Caputo-Pearl to come to the schools I run,” said Gloria Romero, the executive director of Scholarship Prep Charter School in Santa Ana and a former California state senator who while representing the San Gabriel Valley and East Los Angeles served as chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee.
“We’re closing the achievement gap for children who are English language learners and special education, if anything. There are some great schools in L.A. Unified but there are too many pockets where schools are chronically underperforming.”
John Rogers, director of the UCLA’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, warned of sometimes superficial narratives surrounding charter schools.
“I think there are a number of somewhat simplistic analyses that don’t capture the full picture,” he said. “Many charter schools enroll large numbers of low-income students and students of color and we shouldn’t forget that fact.”
That said, charter advocates have in recent years poured millions into political campaigns, including in Los Angeles, where billionaire and charter supporter Eli Broad spent almost $10 million in 2017 along with allies in an effort that won a majority on the LAUSD Board of Education.
The charter sector, according to Rogers, is “a mix of some amazing educators who have worked within district bureaucracies and got frustrated and wanted in their words more freedom, some wealthy people who wanted to do good and felt like their money wasn’t going to be spent well in the district, and then some with ties to right wing think tanks and organizations who are deeply committed to undercutting the power of unions as kind of a bulwark of the democratic party.”
He added that it is rare for charters to admit students with the most substantial special needs, but that’s mostly backed up only by anecdotal evidence.
In the agreement
The main appearance of charter schools in the 40-page agreement reached between UTLA and LAUSD this Tuesday is a provision calling for more community input in cases of potential co-location, when a charter school moves into either occupied or un-occupied space on the campus of a traditional public school.
The still-temporary deal must be ratified by the School Board in a meeting slated for Jan. 29.
“The district has to inform us in December about any schools that are targeted for co-location,” said Caputo-Pearl on KPCC’s AirTalk Wednesday. “That gives time for respectful notice to parents … and certainly parents can ask questions and teachers can push back.”
As a side-bargain, UTLA also said the school board agreed to vote this month on a resolution that calls for Gov. Newsom to enact a cap on new charter schools at LAUSD while the state further studies the issue. If approved, the resolution would be a call for more state action on public charter schools.
Yet “it remains to be seen” whether the measures become more than a symbolic win for the union, said author of a book on California politics and New York Times opinion writer Miriam Pawel.
One out of every three independent charter schools in Los Angeles is co-located. While the arrangements are mutually beneficial, many complain of discord as entirely separate schools attempt to share everything from libraries to cafeterias and playgrounds.
“Co-location seemed to be a significant step for the union potentially. But the district doesn’t have has much leeway, so I think those are issues that will have to be addressed at the state level, and there’s definitely some interest in addressing it in Sacramento.”
Looking ahead
What all parties appear to agree on is that the teachers strike drew attention from the Inland Empire to L.A. to the befallen state of traditional public education in the second-largest school system in the nation, but that the future of charters can only be determined in halls of the state capital.
“The strike opened the conversation about how the broader public can begin to develop rules and regulations through the legislative process,” said Rogers, “purposeful planning of how we bring on new charter schools, how we reauthorize charter schools, how we think about the location of charter schools.”
And charter leaders like Gloria Romero are prepared to make a case.
“I look forward to sitting at that table testifying before former colleagues and new folks to say hey forget about the campaign contributions that you got from CTA (California Teachers Association) and let’s think about what this means in terms of student achievement,” she said.
“The fact that charters are thought to be so dangerous, that’s a product of their success and that’s what I hope a fair hearing in Sacramento would find.”

Texto completo: "This is going to be a tough week," Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, wrote in an email to his staff on Wednesday. On Friday, the newsroom learned just how tough, when the company laid off 43 of the roughly 250 journalists who worked in that division, according to a BuzzFeed spokesman.
The cut was the start of a planned 15 percent reduction of the overall work force at BuzzFeed, a company perhaps best known for producing content meant to be shared on social media. The layoffs, which the staff learned about from an email sent by the BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti, are expected to continue into next week and affect around 200 employees.
The staff reduction at BuzzFeed News included the seven members of the national desk, the six-person national security team and the two journalists covering health, according to the spokesman. All but two members of the entertainment team were laid off and all but one on the L.B.G.T. desk. There were no cuts to the technology, politics or investigations teams.
"The national desk at @BuzzFeedNews was killed off today," Tina Susman, the national editor, wrote on Twitter. "This was my first full-time editing gig, and I nearly didn't take the job, but despite tday's gloominess i'm glad I did. It's been great, and I'm proud to ride out the front door with my team."
Jessica Testa, a national reporter who was laid off after about seven years at BuzzFeed News, said she felt blindsided. "Our work has always, always been celebrated, internally and by readers," Ms. Testa said in an email interview. "We've changed laws, we've won awards, we have great traffic."
The cuts are meant to lower costs and maintain growth as the company aims to hit profitability this year. BuzzFeed, which employs more than 1,300 people, generated more than $300 million in revenue in 2018, a 15 percent increase from the previous year.
In 2017, the company fell short of its revenue goal of $350 million, with sales coming in at $260 million, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the company's finances. One hundred people were laid off, and considerations for a public offering were shelved.
In a November interview with The New York Times, Mr. Peretti proffered an audacious solution to deal with the volatile landscape for online content: a series of mergers with five or six top internet publishers, including Vice, Vox Media, Group Nine Media and Refinery 29.
[Read our interview with Mr. Peretti about his plan to make BuzzFeed profitable.]
BuzzFeed had spoken to at least one of these companies, people familiar with the matter said at the time. The staff cuts will help accelerate any plans to merge with another business.
In particular, BuzzFeed has deep ties to Group Nine Media, the digital media company behind Thrillist, Seeker, The Dodo and NowThis. Its chief executive, Benjamin Lerer, has long been friends with Mr. Peretti, and his father, the venture capitalist Kenneth Lerer, is the chairman of BuzzFeed. (The younger Mr. Lerer has stressed that any business deal between the two would not include his father, to avoid conflicts of interest.)
On Thursday, BuzzFeed News employees in New York were told to be in the office on East 18th Street no later than 10 a.m. the next day. Some reporters not in New York learned their fates over the phone. Many of those who were dismissed announced their departures on social media.
"I've been on vacation for two weeks, and received the news over the phone an hr ago while I stood on a street in Delhi," Talal Ansari, a reporter, wrote on Twitter. "Now, I write this as I wait to go through airport security. Being laid off from 8k mi away doesn't make this any easier."
Marisa Carroll, the deputy national editor, who edited a notable series of articles on accusations of sexual misconduct against the R&B artist R. Kelly, was also laid off. So were John Stanton, who led the Washington bureau for many years before moving to New Orleans to be a national reporter; Cates Holderness, who ignited an internet phenomenon in 2015 with a post that triggered a debate about whether a dress was blue and black or gold and white; and Tyler Kingkade, a national reporter who covered sexual assault and Title IX issues.
"It's a rough business," Mr. Kingkade wrote on Twitter.
Some employees took advantage of an internal Slack messaging channel called AJA, for "Ask Jonah Anything," to make their displeasure known. In messages reviewed by The Times, one staff member asked if employees could bring dogs to work on Monday, to alleviate stress. After Mr. Peretti chimed in, saying it was a "good idea," another staff member wrote, "Dogs won't save us from this hell."
The international bureaus will also be affected by the cutback. The Spain office has been shut down. Last week, Janine Gibson, a longtime editor at The Guardian who was the editor in chief of BuzzFeed UK, left the publication.
In the days leading up to the layoffs, BuzzFeed News came under scrutiny after publishing an article reporting that President Trump had instructed his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen to lie in his testimony to Congress. In a rare public statement, the special counsel's office denied the report. Mr. Smith has said he stands by the article.
The layoffs at BuzzFeed capped off a gutting week for news operations. On Thursday, HuffPost's parent company, Verizon Media Group, announced a 7 percent cut in its media divisions, which equals about 800 positions. Gannett cut jobs at papers across the country, including The Indianapolis Star, The Tennessean in Nashville and The Record in North Jersey.
By midafternoon on Friday, Mr. Smith had told the staff in an email that managers had spoken with all employees in the United States news division whom the company had decided to let go.
"We can talk Tuesday about what's next, and how to emerge from this a strong, focused newsroom," he continued. "I'm confident that we'll continue to do distinctive work on the biggest stories, and punch above our weight."
He added, "I know it's been a hard day."

If she weren't left-wing, lawmaker would be in the hot seat

Texto completo: If Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., were a conservative, all anyone would be talking about is how uninformed she is. She'd be facing trick questions from reporters designed to expose her lack of knowledge and brutal sketches on "Saturday Night Live" mocking her fitness for office. Instead, SNL fawns over her, while CBS' "Late Show" host Stephen Colbert - far from making jokes at her expense - eats ice cream with her and asks how little she cares about her critics.
Boy, it's good to be a socialist.
It's not that there is a lack of material. This week, for example, Ocasio-Cortez declared that "the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change." She's said that $21 trillion in "Pentagon accounting errors" could pay for most of her massive $32 trillion Medicare-for-all plan - as if there were $21 trillion in unspent tax dollars in a Pentagon vault. She opined that "just last year we gave the military a $700 billion budget increase, which they didn't even ask for" - unaware, apparently, that the entire Pentagon budget is $716 billion. She wrongly claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement "is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009" - when ICE is required only to have that number of beds available and that number has stayed flat. She has declared that "unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs" - which is flat untrue. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 6 million to 7 million Americans have two jobs and 148 million have just one.
Those are examples of ignorance. But apparently she is also dishonest. This week, she told Colbert that she has not been able to open a district office yet to handle constituent casework because of the federal government shutdown. "There's a lot of things we can't do as freshman members," she said. "We can't properly set up our district offices. We can't get laptops delivered. ... It takes the green stuff. And those workers are furloughed."
That's wrong. Last September, Congress passed a bill to fund congressional salaries and offices for the coming year. Ocasio-Cortez knows this because, unlike furloughed workers, she is getting paid. The New York Times reports that the three other first-term members from New York have opened district offices. A more likely explanation is that Ocasio-Cortez is spending her time building her national media profile instead of taking care of the constituents who sent her to Washington in the first place.
So where are the articles bemoaning "The incredible, thuggish stupidity of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"? Where are the journalists trying to trip her up with questions like "Do you agree with the Bush Doctrine?" to see if she knows what it is? Nowhere to be found.
To their credit, the fact-checkers have been on the case. PolitiFact gave her unemployment claim a "Pants on Fire" rating, and she is rapidly accumulating a large cache of Washington Post Pinocchios. She told CBS' "60 Minutes" that "being morally right" is more important than "being precisely, factually ... correct." Apparently, facts matter less as long as you support Big Government.
But facts are crucial, especially when you are proposing the largest increase in government spending in human history. Vox recently added up the cost of all her proposals - from Medicare-for-all, to free college, guaranteed jobs and the "Green New Deal." The cost was $42.5 trillion over the next decade - more than twice the current national debt. Sorry, you can't pay for that through Pentagon accounting errors.
It is a testament to America that someone who was working as a bartender a year ago can unseat a 10-term member of Congress and be elected to the House of Representatives. It's what makes this such an exceptional nation. And it is obvious that she has political talent. But that doesn't excuse her from the responsibilities as a legislator to learn the facts and serve her constituents. Even supporter Whoopi Goldberg warned her on "The View": "I would encourage you to sit still for a minute and learn the job."
That's good advice. Once people decide you are ignorant, it's hard to recover - just ask Sarah Palin or Dan Quayle. Of course, they were conservatives, so the standards are different.

Texto completo: Judging from his rhetoric as a candidate and his announced priorities as the new governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker is so enthusiastic about legalizing marijuana that he would happily hand out samples in schoolyards and urge recipients to share them with their parents.
"As governor, I am ready to stand with leaders, communities and families across our state to legalize marijuana and move our state forward," he said in a campaign statement outlining his "vision" for Illinois.
Now that he's in office, Pritzker is prepared to move rapidly on legalizing marijuana for recreational use, using the examples of states where marijuana is legal -- including Colorado and Washington -- to determine how best to proceed.
"The good news about being eighth or ninth to get this done is we can look at what works and put it in place in Illinois," he said last week.
Make no mistake about it -- driven by the prospects of a new source of tax revenue, Gov. Pritzker and state legislators will act relatively soon to add this state to the list of those that have taken decriminalization of marijuana off the table and replaced it with legalization.
The use of medical marijuana already is legal in Illinois.
Success in politics is a matter of timing, and the timing for legal marijuana has never been better.
These days, it's widely perceived as, at worst, benign or, at best, a cure for what ails a body.
So it's probably way too late to generate the kind of political pushback necessary to slow down the marijuana train.
Nonetheless, opponents are speaking out against a drug they say poses a serious threat to public health and boosts crime rates.
Representatives of the Chicago Crime Commission this week held a news conference to warn against a rush to judgment on legalization.
Jeffrey Johnson, a commission board member, said threats poses by marijuana "need to be fully discussed and considered before Illinois moves forward in this endeavor."
He attributed a series of negative consequences in Colorado and Washington to legalized marijuana. They include increased illegal sales of marijuana, increased traffic fatalities due to greater numbers of impaired drivers, increased marijuana consumption in the schools and increased cognitive impairment and mental health problems, especially among young users.
"Short term and prolonged marijuana use also impacts academic success by impairing learning, memory, abstract thinking and problem solving. Additionally, more youths are entering addiction treatment centers for marijuana addiction than any other substance. Also, marijuana use by children can lead to long-term mental health consequences including psychosis," said Dr. Andrea Barthwell, director of the Two Dreams Addiction Treatment Center.
Dr. Lawrence Jeckel, a Champaign psychiatrist, embraced Dr. Barthwell's analysis.
He said, "There are many people  who have used cannabis without untoward effects," but it poses a threat to "vulnerable" people.
"It is a risk factor for psychosis. If someone has a family history of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, cannabis use is not recommended," he said.
Dr. Jeckel said he has examined criminal defendants charged with violent crimes whose psychosis was "triggered by cannabis." Citing the case of a young man accused of stabbing his father to death, Dr. Jeckel said "the final assault was triggered, the court decided, by cannabis."
Among the biggest threats, he said, is the threat marijuana poses to "the maturing brains of adolescents."
"It causes a chemical complacency that is generally nonspecific, but it can relieve anxiety and psychological pain in PTSD patients, among others. This same complacency causes the ïslacker' syndrome we see in chronic users," he said.
Finally, "Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence," a new book by former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, has raised concerns about legalization.
Berenson's book has received considerable attention, including favorable articles in New York and Mother Jones magazines.
The Mother Jones article "Tell Your Children," which examines scientific studies of marijuana's impact on mental health, said the book "take(s) a sledgehammer to the promised benefits of marijuana legalization, and cannabis enthusiasts are not going to like it one bit."
That prediction is most certainly true.
Berenson has been accused by critics of "moralizing," "cherry-picking statistics" and embracing the anti-marijuana hysteria on display in old movies like "Reefer Madness."
Even further complicating the issue is that increased THC levels make today's marijuana far more potent that was the cases years ago. Further complicating the impact on the user is how it is consumed -- smoked, vaped or eaten.
New York writer Malcolm Gladwell, who reviewed Berenson's book, concluded that scientific studies indicate that researchers don't know far more than they do know about marijuana's impact on the brain.
Despite these warnings, our legislators in Springfield -- revenue-hungry and homework-averse boneheads that they are -- can be expected to move full speed ahead on Gov. Pritzker's top priority.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump agreed late Wednesday to postpone his State of the Union address after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told him he would not be invited to give the speech to a joint session of Congress in the House of Representatives' chamber until the partial government shutdown is resolved.
Although the president considered delivering the address somewhere else, Trump said he decided to wait because there is "no venue that can compete with the history, tradition and importance of the House Chamber. "
Trump's decision was a reversal from his position earlier Wednesday when he insisted in a letter that he would deliver the speech in the House despite Pelosi's security concerns.
"It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!" he wrote in the letter.
Trump: I will wait until 'Shutdown is over' to give State of the Union in the House
Opinion: Shutdown is no time for celebratory State of the Union. No time is. Let's scrap it.
In response to Pelosi's move, many politicians and political pundits mourned the death of yet another political norm.
While this appears to be the first time a House speaker has declined to allow the president to deliver his remarks, it is far from the first time that a State of the Union address was not delivered "on schedule" and "on location. " According to the House Office of the Historian and the Clerk of the House's Office of Art and Archives, in the 230 years since George Washington's first term began, 95 State of the Union addresses were delivered in person from the floor of the House of Representatives; 83 of those were delivered once Woodrow Wilson restarted the custom in 1913.
Here is a look at the speech's fluid history:
It was postponed once before
President Ronald Reagan's 1986 State of the Union address was originally scheduled to take place on Jan. 28, but that morning the Challenger space shuttle broke apart after takeoff, killing all seven people on board.
In response to the tragedy, Reagan delayed his speech until Feb. 4. The New York Times reported at the time that it was the first time the State of the Union had been rescheduled.
The first 12 were not delivered before the House
America's first two presidents, George Washington and John Adams, delivered their messages in the Senate, not the House, chamber. And because all but one of those addresses predated the move of the capital city to Washington, they were given in New York and Philadelphia.
The U. S. Capitol was open in time for Adams' 1800 address, but that was given in the old Senate chamber.
It was delivered in writing for more than 100 years
For more than a century, the State of the Union was submitted to Congress in writing and there was no speech given by the president.
President Thomas Jefferson, elected in 1800, ended the practice of delivering the address in person before a joint session of Congress. The submission of a written message remained the norm until 1913, when Woodrow Wilson became the first president to deliver the address from the House floor.
This did not end the practice of submitting the address in writing. Wilson himself did so in 1919 and 1920. President Calvin Coolidge gave his in writing from 1924 to 1928. President Herbert Hoover did the same from 1929 to 1932, as did Franklin Roosevelt in 1944 and 1945, Harry Truman in 1946 and 1953, Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 and 1961, Richard Nixon in 1973, and Jimmy Carter in 1981.
For most of U. S. history, it wasn't even called the State of the Union
The address was formally called the Annual Message from 1790 to 1946. It was not until 1947 that it officially became the State of the Union Address.
It used to be in December
Although the State of the Union is now delivered at the end of January, or sometimes in early February, it was traditionally given in December (or sometimes November, and on one occasion in October). That changed with the ratification of the 20th amendment in 1933, which moved the opening of Congress from March to January.

Collins supports barring president from NATO withdrawal

Texto completo: Sen. Susan Collins has declared her support for a measure that passed in the House that would make it difficult for a president to pull the country out of NATO.
The Maine Republican is part of a bipartisan group that introduced a resolution this month to prohibit a president from withdrawing from NATO without first securing approval from the Senate.
"Over the past seven decades, NATO has proven to be the world's most successful military alliance and a major force for peace, stability, and prosperity. It is critical that we reaffirm the United States' commitment to this vital pillar of our national security," Collins said in a statement Wednesday.
Collins told her colleagues that supporting the measure "would be a strong statement of support for this important alliance that serves the strategic interests of the United States."
Both of Maine's U.S. House members - Democrats Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden - were among the 357 lawmakers who supported a proposal Tuesday to bar the use of federal funds by a president to withdraw from the treaty that has locked the U.S. to Canada and European allies in common defense since 1949.
The Senate resolution requires the president to win two-thirds support from the Senate to suspend, terminate or withdraw from NATO. It also prohibits funding any effort to do so and grants congressional counsel permission to challenge a president in court if he tries to sidestep the provision.
Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said in a prepared statement that Trump's "repeated threats to withdraw from NATO are dangerous."
"Our NATO allies have fought alongside our troops since World War II, yet President Trump disparages these nations and cozies up to our adversaries," he said. "At a time of increased Russian aggression and global threats, our alliance with NATO is more important than ever to ensure the safety of the American people."
Collins and Kaine were joined by Republicans Cory Gardner of Colorado, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida, and Democrats Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Chris Coons of Delaware and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.
The New York Times reported recently that senior administration officials said that several times over the course of 2018, Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from NATO.
In public, the president has griped on a number of occasions that European nations are failing to spend what he considers their fair share of the cost of the mutual defense required by the NATO treaty.
A bill with the same provisions was introduced after a summit in July and was championed by Kaine and the late Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican.

Ice disk stopped cold, but thanks to warm air, it may just be chillin'

Texto completo: Westbrook's world-famous ice disk has been frozen in place since Tuesday, when air temperatures sank to single digits.
But the huge circle is still clearly visible on the surface of the Presumpscot River even as it is encased in the surrounding ice sheet. And it could spin again if the milder temperatures from Wednesday night and arriving Thursday break it free.
Or it could just melt away.
The forecast calls for temperatures to rise to 40 degrees by Thursday morning, and as high as 50 degrees during the day Thursday. In addition, rain was expected Wednesday evening into Thursday.
The disk first appeared on Jan. 14, and it slowly rotated in place for the following week, although it required a little human intervention at one point last week when a man on a paddleboard used an ice pick to break it free from the frozen riverbank.
Similar spinning circles of ice have been documented across North America and Europe, always on rivers when water temperatures and other conditions are just right.
The phenomenon is believed to result from a combination of current and a vortex beneath the ice, the result of a column of cold water sinking to the bottom of the river at the center of the circle. As the ice sheets spin, they are shaped by the surrounding ice into perfectly symmetrical circles.
However, such disks usually aren't spinning in high-profile locations like downtown Westbrook, and they usually aren't so large.
The Presumpscot River ice disk was about 100 yards across for most of the past week, but it grew even larger over the weekend and early this week until it eventually got iced in.
The disk has attracted crowds of curious locals as well as worldwide media attention with reports by the BBC, U.S. television networks, The Boston Globe, The Washington Post and The New York Times, among others.
A webcam mounted on a nearby building at the request of Brown University and other researchers continues to document the ice disk in its dormant state. Among other things, the researchers want to record what happens when it warms up.
The action on the live stream has been a little slow since the sun went down Monday. But the saga is sure to take a twist soon, one way or the other.

Biden’s pricey $200,000 speeches, politics questioned

Texto completo: Vice President Joe Biden, on a pace to collect millions in speeches since he left the White House, is under scrutiny for the high price he charges — and who he addresses.

America Rising, a group that opposes Democrats, for example, has sought and received a contract for Biden’s recent $200,000 speech to an economic group at Lake Michigan College.

And following a New York Times report that focused on Biden’s speeches, the group said Wednesday, “America Rising PAC is calling on Biden to disclose his compensation and release details from each of these paid speeches.”

The Times suggested that the 2020 Democratic front-runner has done well on the speaking circuit.

Citing the $200,000 October speech, the Times said, “If Mr. Biden were to have charged a similar range of fees for all his comparable speeches since leaving office, he would most likely have collected between $4 million and $5 million through speeches over the last two years.”

That speech was controversial because he talked up Republican Rep. Fred Upton, who won re-election. It disturbed local Democrats who were trying to defeat Upton and saw Biden’s positive statements in TV ads at the end of the 2018 campaign.

The contract, provided to Secrets, showed that Biden was alerted that the Economic Club of Southwest Michigan crowd would be mostly "older, conservative" Republicans.

America Rising said the Times highlighted “one of the many issues Joe Biden will have squaring his actions with an increasingly progressive Democratic primary should he enter the race for president: paid speeches."

Texto completo: Wright State graduate and Centerville-raised Hannah Beachler is the first African-American female up for an Oscar for production design for her work on Marvel blockbuster film “Black Panther.”
The New York Times caught up with Beachler about her nomination .
Beachler told the newspaper she found out about the nomination while working on set in Cincinnati on a Todd Haynes film.
"I had to run to the back of the warehouse where the catering was so I could yell," she told the New York Times in an interview. "And then I cried."

Texto completo: This morning, Kumail Nanjiani and Tracee Ellis Ross announced the nominees for the 91st Academy Awards, many of which are already streaming online. Need to get caught up? Some of the biggest contenders are still in theaters, but many are already streaming. Here's a rundown of where to find those nominees that are streaming in the biggest categories, with links to our original reviews.
BEST PICTURE NOMINEES
'BlacKkKlansman'
Nominated for: best picture, supporting actor, director, adapted screenplay, editing, original score
How to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
In telling the fact-based story of a black Colorado Springs cop named Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) who infiltrated a Ku Klux Klan chapter in the early 1970s, the director Spike Lee takes a tonally audacious approach -- part stranger-than-fiction irreverence, part political statement about the legacy of white supremacy. The balance pays off in surprisingly accessible entertainment that bridges the horrors of past and present.

'Black Panther'
Nominated for: best picture, costume design, original score, original song, production design, sound editing, sound mixing
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix; rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
The first superhero movie to be nominated for best picture -- for all its acclaim, even "The Dark Knight" missed the list -- "Black Panther" goes further than any previous Marvel production in bringing thematic weight to escapist spectacle. Michael B. Jordan makes a particularly vivid contribution as Killmonger, a villain whose threat to T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the newly crowned king of the techno-utopian nation of Wakanda, is rooted in competing notions of black identity.

'Bohemian Rhapsody'
Nominated for: best picture, actor, editing, sound editing, sound mixing
How to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu and Google Play.
As music history, "Bohemian Rhapsody" takes a "print the legend" approach to Queen and its electrifying frontman, Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek). The film plays fast-and-loose with the facts, adhering to the formula of traditional biopics like "Walk the Line" and "Ray," but it was a box-office sensation for a reason, tapping into the creative breakthroughs that led to hits like the title track and into the passion that infused the band's career-capping Live Aid performance.

'Roma'
Nominated for: best picture, director, actress, supporting actress, original screenplay, foreign language film, cinematography, production design, sound editing, sound mixing
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
Returning to the Mexico City of his youth, the director Alfonso Cuarón vividly imagines his upper-middle-class upbringing through the experiences of a live-in housekeeper (Yalitza Aparicio) whose hardships may not have been clear to him at the time. In the neighborhood of Colonia Roma in 1970, the maid tends to the needs of a bustling family during a turbulent period -- for them, for her and for a country roiled by political unrest.

'A Star Is Born'
Nominated for: best picture, actor, actress, supporting actor, adapted screenplay, cinematography, original song, sound mixing
How to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
For this fourth iteration of "A Star Is Born," the actor-director Bradley Cooper, making his debut behind the camera, works to deconstruct the glam-pop image of his lead actress, Lady Gaga, and discover the more unvarnished and accessible version underneath. Resembling a countrified Eddie Vedder or Kurt Cobain type, Cooper stars as a stadium rock star who gives Gaga's drag-bar singer a career boost before drowning himself in the bottle.

How a dish that 'didn't make sense' inspired kitchen creativity

Texto completo: One in an occasional series about the early memories, sparked by a particular dish, of notable people in the food world. "It doesn't taste like I remember it."
Anita Lo stood in the tiny kitchen of her Greenwich Village apartment, exasperated, seeming to strain to hear a whisper. Finally, she sighed. "Memory's a weird thing, especially at this age," she said.
Lo is only 53, but it has been at least 30 years since she last ate this crazy combination of ingredients, what she calls "an iconic dish of my childhood." When she was trying to remember how to make it, she emailed her siblings: "Does anyone remember anything about that salad Mommy used to make? I think it was just blanched asparagus, cut up with a sauce of crunchy peanut butter and Tabasco? Was it based on some other dish or did Mommy make it up? It seems vaguely Southeast Asian, but sticks out as something weird in her repertoire."
The dish did taste odd, as if the asparagus signed up for a blind date gone wrong. "My sister googled it and said the recipe came from the side of a Jif jar," Lo noted. "But we were a Skippy house."
She shook her head, her sense of order and knack for detail disturbed. "Even as a kid, I knew this recipe didn't make sense," she continued. "But the dish represents many themes important to my career. It was probably one of my earliest experiences seeing something creative in the kitchen. It was something different, an example of what immigrants do with flavors they grew up with and how food evolves, how it doesn't have borders, per se. It is also Midwestern and of that era of the 1960s when quick recipes were taken off the sides of convenience foods like peanut butter."
Lo was born in Detroit and raised in Birmingham, Mich., the daughter of Chinese immigrants. How she became one the most prominent chefs in New York with her restaurant Annisa, which held a Michelin star for nine consecutive years, is a great story. (Not to mention defeating Mario Batali in the first season of "Iron Chef America" and being the first female guest chef to cook a state dinner at the White House, for Chinese President Xi Jinping.)
I was surprised, though, to discover that Lo is a reticent storyteller when the story is herself, because as a writer, she is forthright, funny and sly. Her newest book, which Eater named its 2018 Cookbook of the Year, is "Solo: A Modern Cookbook for a Party of One" (Knopf, $29). It begins this way: "I put the 'Lo' in 'solo.' The A Lo in 'alone.' I've been dumped almost as many times as I've been in relationships - and I can count those on less than two hands. Spread over my fifty-year life span, that's a lot of solo meals." In her recipe for Valentine's Day, "A Single, Broken Egg on a Bed of Torn, Wilted, Bitter Greens with Blue Cheese," the last ingredient is "A healthy dose of self-pity." "I always include something for the lonely person," she writes.
Lo's loneliness began early. When she was 3, her father, Lien-Fu Lo, died in an electrical accident when their home flooded; her sister was 5 and her brother was 8. Lien-Fu had been a pathologist, as was Lo's mother, Molly Hayden. She continued working at a hospital outside Detroit, where Lo noted, "she made one-quarter of what my father made for the same job."
Her mother remarried the next year, and by the time Lo was a sophomore in high school, she found herself boarding at Concord Academy in Massachusetts. "I kind of got kicked out of my house," she said with a shrug. "I didn't get along with my stepfather. My mother did well at providing for us, she pushed us in the right direction morally. But she was emotionally unavailable. Her one true love died and left her with three little kids, and all three of us were watching. It was a hard time. She shut down after that."
Sitting at her small kitchen table, Lo spoke quietly, positioning herself behind her laptop screen as if for protection. As both writer and chef, she channels her passions offstage, and this kind of personal revelation seemed difficult, and different, for her.
After high school, Lo followed her siblings to Columbia. Before earning her degree in French literature, she spent the summer after her junior year in Paris. "At the time, I thought I would end up translating English to French at the U.N.," she recalled. Then she spent a month at the legendary cooking school La Varenne. "I was learning to cook and loving it," she said. "I went back the next year to earn a Grand Diplome at L'Ecole Ritz-Escoffier. It wasn't necessary, but it was fun and for me, a breeze. I think cooking chooses you. You either have it or you don't. And because French was translated to English there, I heard all the instructions twice." She worked as an intern for both Guy Savoy and Michel Rostang before returning to New York, where she worked for David Bouley, then David Waltuck at Chanterelle.
In 2000, she opened Annisa with Jennifer Scism, her girlfriend at the time. Lo made food that was rooted in French technique while incorporating other cultures. Her seared foie gras with soup dumplings and jicama became a classic, alongside her pan-roasted chicken with sherry, white truffles and pig feet. In 2009, the restaurant was destroyed in a fire and reopened the following year. It closed for good in 2017 once costs got too high. Also, Lo's years on the line took their toll, and she had a knee replaced.
"I don't want to own another restaurant," she said, as her cat, Mika, strode across the table, neatly avoiding the laptop. "I'd love some long-term consulting. It would be great to open a restaurant and create a menu, then step away and check in every once in a while."
Lo will stay in New York, though. "It's home for me," she said, "one of the easier places to be who I am. In the monochromatic culture of Michigan I was one of two Asian kids in a very large school, along with one African American. I grew up trying to distance myself from my Asian upbringing and Chinese culture. I came back to it through food, learning to enhance that part of me through cooking."
She got up and stood before her patch of counter, tasting the asparagus she'd made. Again. "It was a dish we all remember yet such a sore thumb," she mused. She added some soy sauce: "I don't like the Tabasco in there, honestly. But it was hard getting Asian ingredients in Birmingham, Michigan, in the 1970s. I can buy gochujang at my supermarket now."
She blanched a second bunch of asparagus and improvised a new sauce, keeping the peanut butter while adding tahini, soy sauce, sesame oil, mirin and a Japanese spice mix. She hunted through her packed utility drawers, searching for measuring spoons. "Mary, Mary," she muttered, before finally locating them. (Mary Attea was chef de cuisine at Annisa when it closed; she and Lo have been in a relationship for the past six years.)
She dipped her pinkie in the bowl. "I'm not quite sure I'm liking this, either," she said. "Peanut butter and asparagus. You have the Midwest to thank for that. Though it does feel like a cousin to gardo gardo, which is basically an Indonesian salad where you dip vegetables in sesame sauce." I tasted the new version. It had crunch and a kick and a bit of sweetness. When I took it home, I ate it with a buffalo burger and finished it all.
Would she ever make this for herself? "Probably not," she said. "I mean, I don't mind it. I could make a more Chinese version with hoisin and peanut butter, more like a sesame noodle sauce." She tasted it again. "Maybe it's not the right recipe. My sister remembered a hot sauce bottle with an oval white label, and that's not Tabasco, but that's the one sauce I remember having."
Well, some childhood memories just can't be conjured. Lo seemed philosophical about letting this one go. After all, she learned early to be her own best company. "Although I have a soft spot for the depressed, jilted single," she writes, " 'Solo' is also for those who are happiest on their own, or those who are part of a fractured family, in whatever form. . . . This book is also for those who have different tastes from their family or partner - why shouldn't they eat what they crave?"
Indeed.

Chief Justice John Roberts right to push back against Trump, defend judiciary

Texto completo: In November, a federal judge in San Francisco struck down President Trump’s attempt to limit asylum-seekers to legal points of entry. Trump complained about the action of “an Obama Judge.”
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts criticized Trump, saying America does not have “Obama judges or Trump judges . . . What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”
In December, a federal judge in Texas struck down the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”). The judge had been appointed by President George W. Bush. Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Connecticut, said that “Republicans just blew up our health care system.” Press comments have portrayed the judge’s ruling as political and characterized the Fifth Circuit (comprised of Southern states), which will hear any appeal, that way as well.
Will Chief Justice Roberts be even-handed now and criticize those calling the federal court decision in Texas the act of Republicans? Perhaps he regrets having entered this forum in the first place. Roberts has challenged Trump in a sport at which Trump excels. When federal District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii ruled against the Trump travel ban (called the “Muslim ban” by its detractors), Trump was fulsome in criticizing the judge as political because President Obama had appointed him. Trump called the San Diego judge hearing the case against Trump University biased because the Indiana-born Judge’s parents were from Mexico — making at least two offensive leaps that a judge who was the son of Mexican immigrants would be prejudiced against Trump due to Trump’s comments on Mexicans, and that the prejudice would be so great it would affect the judge’s impartiality in a matter totally unrelated to Mexico or immigration.
Federal judges are called to make decisions based on the law, not their own policy preferences. President Trump and Senator Murphy have done much harm in blurring that distinction.
This is not to say federal judges are identical. Litigants choose courts to file suits where they have the best chance of winning. Trump noted the “Obama Judge” was in San Francisco, within the liberal-leaning 9th Circuit that often rules against him. After the Obamacare ruling, the New York Times observed that “conservative lawyers are known to choose [the federal court in Texas] to file cases.” Neither practice is improper, so long as the court decision itself is based on nonpolitical grounds.
When Trump opponents win at the trial court level, they then try to get the court to apply its ruling to the entire country. That’s what the federal judge in San Francisco did, blocking Trump’s asylum policy nationwide. The federal judge in Texas has not yet given national application to his order striking down Obamacare. If he does, expect Democratic politicians who praised the San Francisco judge’s nationwide order to be outraged by the Texas judge doing the same thing, and expect Trump to praise the judge’s wisdom.
The judiciary interprets laws; it has no power to make laws. Judges are fairly criticized when their legal interpretation seems to create new law that Congress or state legislatures never intended. But Murphy and Trump labeling judges based on which president appointed them goes far beyond fair criticism. This kind of attack, if repeated often enough, will eventually impede the vital function courts perform in our constitutional scheme. A calumny often repeated sometimes sticks. When the law compels a politically unpopular outcome in a case, Americans should hope the judge ignores the political and does what’s right. That’s especially important to those who care deeply about civil liberties. I doubt the Bill of Rights’ protections for criminals would be approved in a popular referendum today. Segregated schools were the result of popular majority votes. America loses something precious if the third branch, fearful of being labeled political, begins to act in a political way.
Tom Campbell is a professor of law and professor of economics at Chapman University. He served five terms in Congress, including on the Judiciary Committee and the Joint Economic Committee. He was also California Director of Finance. In 2016, he left the Republican Party and is now an independent.

Texto completo: It was just about a year ago that Celeste Ng 's 2014 debut novel, “Everything I Never Told You," got optioned. Now it looks as if the movie is moving forward -- with Hollywood royalty attached.
When Twitter account Read It Forward tweeted Monday that the thriller should be adapted for Netflix, Ng responded that it's being made into a movie, with Oscar winner Julia Roberts on board to play Marilyn, a mother rocked by the drowning death of her daughter, Lydia.
The book, which was on the New York Times bestseller list for 47 weeks, according to Deadline, was just the first big hit for Ng. The Cambridge author followed up with 2017's “Little Fires Everywhere," which was snapped up by Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington , who will co-star and executive produce. That project, a limited series, will be on Hulu.

Texto completo: A little over three months ago The New York Times published an exposé on what was said to be tax evasion by President Donald Trump. The story never got any traction. The authors seemed surprised by that.
I was not surprised. The issues were fairly complicated, and it's hard for a general audience to discern whether the actions described were legitimate tax planning ideas used by wealthy people or, as presented in the article, tax evasion.
I have a few thoughts on the story. They are the thoughts of a tax person and independent of the political aspects of the story. In fact, my interest is more what the story says about certain professional tax advisers than it says about the Trump family.
First, some background on the offenses described in the article. They are based on thousands of documents involving the business of Fred Trump, the president's father. The story is legitimate.
The story is about abuses of the transfer tax system the taxation of gifts and transfers through an estate. There are income tax issues, but the reporters lacked access to Donald Trump's returns or details of deductions that may have been claimed by Fred Trump, so there is no evidence of income tax fraud.
Second, the offenses. Beginning when Donald Trump was 3 years old, the story describes large payments Fred Trump made for “services” performed by his children, “loans” that were never repaid, and marked-up goods sold by the Trump children to Fred Trump's companies.
The latter transactions, run through an entity called All County Building Supply and Maintenance, may have also led to defrauding tenants of rent-controlled buildings.
When Fred Trump died, the values assigned to assets in his estate were well below actual market values. Before his death, many of those assets had been transferred to the children through a legitimate strategy called a GRAT.
What was not legitimate were the values claimed for the assets transferred to the GRAT. The result was a significant underreporting of gifts.
So, excessive payments to the kids for goods or services, loans that were never repaid, underreporting the value of transferred properties, all resulted in fraud on the gift tax and estate tax systems.
Based on the documentation presented in the article (actual transaction documents and actual gift and estate tax filings), the conclusion that fraud occurred should not be a debatable point to a well-trained tax adviser.
We have no knowledge of how excessive rent and service payments were reported by Donald Trump. The fraud was related to Fred's burden for gift and estate taxes. The link to Donald, based solely on the evidence presented, was his signature on an estate tax return as a co-executor of his father's estate.
What occurred is not normal, nor is it in any way appropriate. Donald Trump's attorney responded to the revelations by saying “all estate matters were handled by licensed attorneys, licensed CPAs, and licensed real estate appraisers who followed all laws and rules strictly (my italic emphasis).”
I want to focus on the italicized print above. I have no doubt that each of those licensed parties provided advice consistent with what was done by the Trump family. This is, to me, the sad part of the story. They did not follow laws or rules in any way, strictly or otherwise.
I have taught seminars for four of the six largest CPA firms in the world. Partners from two of those firms were convicted of criminal tax fraud for advice given in the same time period as the Trump story. I knew and taught with two of those partners.
These partners were very smart and very well-paid. They knew the law, and they knew what they were advising was wrong. They said so at their sentencing. But they did it anyway.
The failure of some very well-known advisers to follow basic professional standards led the government to raise the standards bar for all of us. It's sad some professional tax advisers cannot rely on their own values to follow laws that they understand.
I suspect the Trumps knew exactly what they were doing. I suspect that their licensed advisers also knew. And that's unfortunate.

Texto completo: We know you're busy, and we want to provide you with a news and opinion filled way to start your week — our fresh takes. We'll publish them every Monday morning.
Harris just announced her presidential run, and it's already in question
It's not solely her track record as California's attorney general that calls Sen. Kamala Harris' bid for the presidency into question, according to columnist Briahna Gray of "The Intercept," it's the fact that she was a prosecutor at all. The nature of the profession often involves pushing a tough-on-community (especially communities of color), pro-policing approach that pits them against activists like Black Lives Matter (and anyone else battling for a more progressive justice system).
In her Jan. 20 column, Gray questions whether, in an age of BLM protest, a prosecutor has a good shot at the presidency. Not that Harris' record as a prosecutor should be overlooked. Some of her decisions made it possible to place more children of color in the system.
In a "New York Times" column, law professor Lara Bazelon shot down the idea that Harris was a progressive prosecutor, something the candidate called herself in her recently released memoir "The Truths We Hold. " Bazelon pointed to cases involving prosecutorial misconduct that Harris fought to uphold.
In the same column, Gray gives voice to Harris' supporters, at least one of whom states that as a black woman, prosecutors like Harris had a further burden — to prove that they were tough.

Police officer investigated in fatal shooting of boy, 14
The child was armed with an airsoft gun, but was fleeing the scene when an Arizona police officer fatally shot the boy in an alley, according to body camera footage recently released by a police department in Tempe.
Officer Joseph Jaen shot at Antonio Arce's back twice, hitting him once near the shoulder blades. Arce was allegedly breaking into a vehicle.
Jaen is on leave pending an investigation.
BLM monitored by police, called 'idiots'
The New York Police Department — tasked with protecting the rights of protesters who hit the streets after the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown at the hands of cops — were surveilling members of Black Lives Matter, according to a CNN report.
The surveillance included going undercover among groups of protesters, taking photographs of march leaders and passing information along to high-ranking police officers including the head of the department's intelligence unit, according to police department emails.
Emails also revealed that police officers referred to protesters as "idiots. "

Are we missing a bet on older workers?

Texto completo: Are we missing a bet on older workers?
The headline on a Jan. 8 New York Times story blared "I Am (an Older) Woman. Hear me Roar."
The subhead listed 78-year old Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; actress Glenn Close, 71; and Susan Zirinsky, who will be 66 when she becomes head of CBS News in March, as "powerful women over 60."
Regardless of gender, 60 may or may not be the age when senior status begins. And while this column is not about gender. it is about age. The Times story raises — or should raise — an entrepreneurial thought or two: Are we business owners overlooking older potential employees — perhaps inadvertently, perhaps folly especially in a time when employment markets are tight?
Maybe. Maybe we ought to rethink our hiring parameters.
If, for example, you’re looking to fill a hole in your employee ranks or searching for a worker who will fit your business’ expansion plans, Michelle Mobley suggests older jobseekers. Many of them, she says, "wear many hats," indicating a breadth of experience "that can be especially important to smaller businesses."
Mobley is CEO of noquo LLC, a Downers Grove recruiting firm.
If there is a problem unearthing potential employees whose age falls somewhere in the broad senior category, it may be that older workers "need to know how to sell themselves," says Bob Podgorski, a longtime jobs-and-people advisor whose RPP Enterprises LLC is a Hoffman Estates-based consulting firm.
"Seniors can’t live on past laurels," Podgorski says. "They need to show energy and passion. And they need computer awareness."
Sometimes a frank conversation with Podgorski, or perhaps someone like Mobley, helps. "I ask candidates what they would look for in a candidate," Podgorski says. "Then I ask ‘Where are those (skills and characteristics) on your resume?’ "That’s the dilemma. When they hire, companies need productivity now."
Smaller businesses in particular have little time to train a new employee. "They’re looking for someone who can help put out the fire," Podgorski says.
There is a basic question in the hiring process that has a somewhat elusive answer: Where does a business owner seeking to hire find applicants?
Podgorski manages job programs at both Schaumburg and Elk Grove Village townships. His St. Hubert’s Job & Networking Ministry, which has a flock of participating church hosts, celebrates its 16th anniversary in March.
He also suggests posting any opening on your business’ website, and Podgorski notes there is opportunity for some creative hiring, if necessary. One option, depending very much on the job, might be to turn that one full-time job into two part-time positions, with one employee working mornings and the other afternoons.
Mobley similarly suggests the Mom Project, a digital marketplace at www.themomproject.com; the Community Career Center, in Naperville; and the Executive Network Group, which meets monthly in Arlington Heights.
You’ll need to do some exploring, but you may find a gem of an experienced candidate or two.

Texto completo: I am embarrassed to say I live in Steve King's district. I have voted against him in every election.
The Democrats in this district have worked hard to unseat him. We switched parties for the primary to vote for his opponent. Then, we switched back to vote for the Democrat in the general election.
We wrote editorials pleading for Republicans to do the right thing and not support him.
We spent hours going door to door to convince others not to vote for him and we even held fundraisers to support his opponent.
We chose a great candidate to run against him and this year, J.D. Scholten came close to beating him. When we lost, I felt that we had let Iowa and America down.
So when people say the 4th District deserves what we got, remember many of us did not support King and abhor what he represents.
— Sue Richardson, Jefferson
Waukee School Board members should resign When the public elects individuals to serve on boards, these individuals must be trusted to make the correct decisions.
This did not happen in the Waukee School District. Taxpayers' money was foolishly spent and when three employees tried to expose the problem, they lost their jobs and the individual responsible received two raises.
I still believe the public will never know the full story as to what occurred over the past four years pertaining to employee problems and improper spending because there will never be a complete investigation.
— Roger Hammelman, Urbandale
Trump should be vilified like King has been It is encouraging that Republicans have finally found their voice in condemning Rep. Steve King, but as columnist Rekha Basu summarizes [King's fall from grace too long in coming], Republicans have ignored King's history of denigrating immigrants, promoting white nationalist leaders and Nazi admirers for a long time.
Now that Republicans have finally awakened to King's offensive statements, they must apply the same standards of decency to President Donald Trump. Trump has vigorously embraced King and the congressman takes credit for setting the Trump anti-immigrant agenda.
In a New York Times interview, King even said to Trump, "I market-tested your immigration policy for 14 years, and that ought to be worth something."
When will Republicans be willing to condemn Trump for actions and language that closely mirrors that of King?
— Rick Smith, Urbandale

Castro's a 'nice guy,' so is he doomed to finish last?

Texto completo: It's possible that the worst legacy of the last three presidential elections is that we now expect our candidates to be Washington outsiders and "rock stars."
Like overstimulated children who have been battling aliens on the Xbox all day and are resistant to a peaceful bedtime story, we seem to now be programmed to look for celebrity, novelty or an indescribable pizzazz when deciding who should be our next president.
A year ago, the nation was enthralled with a possible Oprah Winfrey candidacy after the former daytime talk-show host made an inspirational speech at the Golden Globes ceremony.
As the idea churned out of control on social media, cooler heads urged restraint.
Ben Smith, editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News, railed against the idea, suggesting that Democrats should not be looking for a future candidate who can outshine Donald Trump, but someone who is the opposite of our reality-star president - "And that's where governors and senators with deep experience, proven political chops, and an unglamorous sense of normalcy come in."
But traditional, steady candidates don't drive web traffic.
Which is why most of the nation would be forgiven for saying "Who?!" if they were asked about Democrat Julian Castro, the former secretary of housing and urban development who launched his presidential bid on a recent sunny Saturday in his hometown of San Antonio, Texas.
"This morning, I rode the number 68 bus with my brother down Guadalupe Street as we did so many times as kids ... the same bus route that we used to take with my mother to get to school or to her work during the summer," Castro said, after opening his speech with a thank you for his mom, his wife and kids. He even thanked the press covering the event, adding that "they are the friend of the truth in this country."
That's nice.
But, isn't "nice" faint praise?
Perhaps not fainter than this gem from a 2010 New York Times Magazine profile about Castro titled "The Post-Hispanic Hispanic Politician": "He is cerebral, serious, self-contained and highly efficient. If he were an energy source, he'd be zero-emission."
That sounds about right.
I was out running my Saturday morning errands when a friend messaged me, asking if I was watching Castro's announcement.
I texted back: "No, I feel like he's the nice, clean guy your mom met and wanted you to date. He seems perfectly fine, but terribly boring. That's not fair, of course, but I'm just not interested, and I don't think his candidacy is going anywhere."
Ouch. That wasn't very nice of me. I've considered my words and have to wonder if I've fallen prey to expecting bells, whistles and entertainment from a candidate when what we need is a steady pair of hands.
Does the nation really want another Big Mac-eating, sunglasses-wearing, saxophone-playing dude on late-night TV, another savior figure who will accept a Nobel Peace Prize two minutes after moving into the White House, or another camera-ready egomaniac?
Only time will tell.
The only thing many of us political centrists are fairly sure of is that a magnificent orator, someone who is supposedly independent because of their self-funding candidacy, or an individual who can check a new demographic box for the history of the presidency isn't required.
Sure, it's ... nice ... that Castro could be the ethnic president who is palatable to a wide swath of the non-Hispanic electorate specifically because he's so all-American. But, realistically, the mood among many of the liberals I come across is one of wide-eyed terror that the Democratic Party is staring down the barrel of another four years of a Trump presidency because no one with the juice to defeat him has, so far, emerged.
Though relevant experience, political savvy and an even keel sounds like the balm America needs in order to heal our deep partisan wounds, the Democratic presidential nominee will almost certainly be someone who can inspire breathless adoration.
And it's easy to imagine a thoughtful, nice candidate getting ignored by a manic, social-media frenzied society that seems to valorize passion above all other qualities.
Ultimately, Julian Castro may only succeed in becoming another footnote in history - added to the short list of Hispanic men who have strived for the highest office in the land - but perhaps his overwhelming decency can help elevate the tone of our political discourse, at least for a little while.
And who knows? Maybe this time the nice guy won't finish last. Stranger things have happened.

Estella McCully Gilbert, widow of A.N. Gilbert, was off on a transcontinental adventure with her daughter Agnes Schucking. The pair had planned a scenic road trip across the United States; the second trip for Mrs. Gilbert, 74, whose family traveled west by ox and wagon in 1852. Only 3 years old at the time, she nonetheless had vivid memories, particularly of the hardships experienced on the trail.
The mother-daughter duo would travel via the southern route marking the halfway point of their trip in New York City with a visit to Mrs. Schucking's sister-in-law. Prior to the interstate highway system roads could be rough and often unmarked outside of major cities. Speed was limited by a car's performance ability and terrain; tire punctures and blowouts frequent.
Only seldom, Agnes wrote in her diary, did they speed up to as high as fifty miles per hour and that was on the long roads through the deserts of the southwest.
The pair made no attempt to follow a regular schedule, often spending nights sleeping in their car after driving to some out of the way place off the highway, where, as Agnes put it, "more intimate knowledge of the country and the inhabitants could be obtained."
Thankfully the car easily converted into sleeping quarters by dropping the back of the front seat and unfolding a mattress. At the end of most days, Agnes would faithfully record the daily events in her diary. The women traveled without escort, Agnes doing all of the driving.
Their first adventure came at the California state line where border inspectors opened every piece of luggage despite the women's protests. In an effort to curb an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in the southwest, many states had set up quarantine inspection points.
Agnes later described to a New York Times reporter the site of "vast congregations of travelers held up by the officials and forced to give up food and live animals, and babies deprived of their bottled milk." At each station were piles of abandoned food. The two women encountered quarantine points in each of the southwestern states they passed through.
From California, they cut east through Nevada. Then it was on to Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico with side trips to Indian reservations. Arizona was next with a trip to the Grand Canyon and then on to Texas where they found the countryside "abloom in a veritable carpet of flowers, the short-stemmed variety and brilliant colors", Agnes noted.
It was here that Agnes mended a leaking feed pipe with tape. Then on to New Orleans and Mobile Alabama. In the gulf port, the women's Salem license plate brought joy to a home-sick Oregonian when he spotted it parked at a curb. Agnes does not give his name in her account but shares the story that he "flung open the (car) door and wrung both her hands explaining that he once lived in Salem and that she was the first person from that place he had seen since he left home."
In his effusive affection, he also proposed marriage to Agnes, in the event her husband was not living. She protested that her husband was very much alive. But the admirer countered, "He may be dead before you reach home." And with that rather unsettling comment, he waved them off to continue their trip.
In Tallahassee, Florida a local doctor volunteered to change a flat tire for the women. He spied the Salem license plate and asked if they were acquainted with a Dr. Carlton Smith of Salem. Mrs. Schucking and Mrs. Gilbert replied that they knew him very well indeed. Such a small world.
The mother-daughter pair arrived in New York City six weeks and 8,000 miles later. To their surprise when their car reached the home of Mrs. Schucking's sister-in-law they were greeted by scores of reporters and photographers.
As the duo had traveled cross-country word had spread with the unusual story of the 74-year-old pioneer, Mrs. Gilbert making the return trip across the United States, this time by automobile.
After a few days spent visiting family and having their car inspected and serviced they continued their journey. The return trip took them along a northern route through Rochester and Buffalo, New York then briefly across the border to Canada. On to Lansing, Michigan for a visit to the REO Motor Car Company for a factory tour and publicity photos.
Then a side trip to the state of Iowa for a visit to Mrs. Gilbert's birthplace, New London where they found to their sadness that only a foundation and cellar remained to mark the spot of the log cabin of her birth.
For the rest of their journey home they retraced the immigrant trail taken by the McCully family in 1852. The mother-daughter road trip ended with a total of 16,000 miles logged, in mid-July when they arrived home safely to Salem.
Thanks to Agnes' faithful habit of journal-keeping, letter-writing, and cross-country newspaper coverage we can experience vicariously their 1924 mother-daughter road trip and marvel at the differences between modern travel, the women's experience in their REO sedan, and Mrs. Gilbert's original trip by ox and wagon.

Texto completo: The "special relationship" was not supposed to look like this.
On both sides of the pond, governments are wracked by chaos and paralysis. In Washington, a bid by President Trump to get funding for a border wall has triggered the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history. In London, Prime Minister Theresa May clings to power, even after seeing her Brexit deal suffer a historic defeat in Parliament this week that would have felled earlier governments.
The sense of crisis mounts. Security officers patrolling American waters and safeguarding U.S. ports of entry are now working without paychecks (and are furious about it). In anticipation of a catastrophic "no-deal" Brexit in 10 weeks, May's government said it would mobilize army reservists to help deal with the untold headaches that crashing out of the European Union would bring.
The workings of democracy are under pressure. The speaker of the House sought to postpone Trump's annual State of the Union address; the president retaliated by scrapping her congressional trip to Afghanistan, where she and a bipartisan delegation were due to visit U.S. troops. Democrats and Republicans have dug in their heels as distrust between the parties deepens.
In Britain, all paths forward threaten further uncertainty and rancor. The imperative to abide by the narrow results of the 2016 Brexit referendum has pushed a slow-moving constitutional crisis into its third year and could still lead to the implosion of May's Conservative Party.
Majorities in both countries have clear feelings: Most Americans oppose the government shutdown; most Britons do not want to leave the European Union without a deal in place. But the hard-bitten nationalism of some voters has driven both countries to a cliff's edge. Trump's decision to pander to his hard-line base has led him to embrace political brinkmanship. Neither May nor her chief opponent, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, is calling for the option many think would make the most sense - a second referendum - out of fear of the furious reaction from Brexiteers.
"Rarely have British and American politics seemed quite so synchronized as they do in the chilly dawn of 2019, three years after the victories of Brexit and Donald J. Trump upended the two nations' political establishments," Ellen Barry and Mark Landler of the New York Times wrote last week. "The countries seem subject to a single ideological weather system - one that pits pro-globalization elites against a left-behind hinterland."
They pointed to the now-familiar story: The effects of the 2008 global financial crisis accentuated the divides between people in metropolitan centers and those in depressed postindustrial towns. Anger among the latter fueled Trump and Brexit.
"The people in those areas just said: 'O.K., we're not giving them any more time, the people in London and D.C., your time is up. We're not going to wait a few more years for a recovery,' " Michael Lind, the author of "Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States," told the Times. "They decided: 'There's a limited pie. This pie is not growing.' "
But it's become painfully clear that neither Brexit nor Trump will redress these economic anxieties. Trump's trade wars and tax cuts have, in many instances, hurt those whom he promised to lift. He instead wages a culture war, conjuring a crisis on the border that's largely unsupported by fact.
Brexit, too, was provoked by the illusory visions of politicians. The years since the referendum have proved that there can be no easy divorce with the European Union - and that life outside the continental bloc may be far more bleak and lonely than imagined.
At a town hall this week on the other side of the English Channel, French President Emmanuel Macron flatly declared that "the British people were sold a lie."
Others see an even darker plot: the shadow of the Kremlin. The paralysis in both countries "adds up to a strategic bonanza for Vladimir Putin and his vision of a revanchist Russia," wrote The Washington Post's James Hohmann in the Daily 202. "We don't know exactly how much Moscow spent supporting influence operations to impact the U.K. and U.S. elections in 2016, but it seems hard to overstate how good the Kremlin's return has been on what Western intelligence agencies believe was a relatively modest investment."
For Britain, there's a sense of historical comeuppance. The Brexiteers campaigned on the fumes of imperial delusion, promising a future in which Britain reclaimed its global preeminence once free of its ties to Brussels. Instead, that very colonial legacy now haunts its political present.
"Partition - the British Empire's ruinous exit strategy - has come home," Indian leftist writer Pankaj Mishra wrote in a New York Times op-ed. "In a grotesque irony, borders imposed in 1921 on Ireland, England's first colony, have proved to be the biggest stumbling block for the English Brexiteers chasing imperial virility. Moreover, Britain itself faces the prospect of partition if Brexit, a primarily English demand, is achieved and Scottish nationalists renew their call for independence."
In the United States, other chickens are coming home to roost. The American public largely faults Trump for the current crisis and sees through his efforts to blame Democrats. That's partially because previous shutdowns have also been a Republican legacy.
"The GOP's proclivity for using government shutdowns to force through its agenda is another example of its drunken frat-boy antics," wrote Post columnist Max Boot. "The three longest government shutdowns in U.S. history were all caused by Republican temper tantrums."
Gary Cohn, Trump's former top economic adviser, told the Boston Globe that the shutdown was "completely wrong," adding that he was "confused" about the White House strategy.
"I don't understand what the outcome is here," he said, "and I don't understand where we're going with it."
It's a feeling of uncertainty that stretches across the Atlantic.

Texto completo: One scene in the new Transformers movie "Bumblebee" finds the title character alone in a house. His teen caregiver (Hailee Steinfeld) has been hiding him in the garage, but he finds his way out, touching everything he shouldn't and, because he's giant and metal, causing a lot of inadvertent destruction. This bumbling, charming moment plays out as it might in a classic animated comedy, not in a high-stakes action movie.
A major departure from the Michael Bay-directed "Transformer" movies, this prequel has a lot of moments with an animated feel and a central character that has a different, more sensitive expressiveness than he's shown before. That was the aim of the film's director, Travis Knight, who has built his career on animation as the chief executive of the Oregon stop-motion studio Laika and the director of its lyrical film "Kubo and the Two Strings."
"I'm a child of the '80s," Knight said in a phone interview, "and I wanted to try to rekindle that childhood sense of intrigue, wonder and discovery I felt when I found Transformers for the first time."
Yes, there are still robot fights on the planet Cybertron, along with climactic action sequences with the fate of the world on the line. But in "Bumblebee," Knight, with the screenwriter Christina Hodson, is aiming to tell a more personal, character-driven story of the sort that distinguishes his work at Laika. The film's positive reviews have celebrated that shift. In The New York Times, Glenn Kenny wrote that it is "cleverly plotted, neatly allusive and has dialogue you can envision real people and, um, real Transformers speaking."
The emotional center is the relationship between Steinfeld's character, Charlie, and Bumblebee, whom she discovers after acquiring him, in Volkswagen Beetle form, from her uncle's scrapyard.
Knight had a template of Bumblebee from the previous movies but was set on going a different way with him here. Since this was a prequel, he wanted to hark back to the '80s design of the original Transformers cartoon. So he opted for a simpler look, one that focused more on the character's emotional core than on his mechanical bells and whistles.
"When I first started talking to my designers about how I wanted Bumblebee to be very expressive, they started adding more and more detail to the face," he said. "And when I saw the first pass of that, I was like, no, you guys are going in the wrong direction. It's not about adding more detail, it's about stripping detail away and making the detail that remains meaningful."
Because Bumblebee isn't able to speak (his voice box was removed by a Decepticon), Knight saw the eyes as the place where the character could be the most revealing. So they are larger and brighter and tell more of a story on their own than in the Michael Bay films. (Think Brad Bird's animated fable "The Iron Giant" with a little "E.T." mixed in.)
The mechanics of the character were streamlined as well, rounding his edges more and reducing the parts to fewer, but still transformable, segments.
"Instead of the upper arm being made out of 50 small pieces, it might be made out of three large panels supported by small parts," said the visual effects supervisor, Jason Smith, of Industrial Light and Magic. He has worked on four "Transformers" films, beginning with the 2007 installment.
Did this simplification of the design make it easier for the artists? Not exactly.
"It's not much of a savings in terms of effort," Smith said. "Because when you replace these multiple pieces with a large panel, you have to make that panel really read as something physical and real." So more effort is put into how the paint and the metal look and what it takes to make Bumblebee feel like he's moving in more emotional ways.
In working through how he would shoot the film, particularly those tender moments between Charlie and Bumblebee, Knight felt that the best way to explain his vision to the crew was through storyboards. Rather than using designers who storyboard live-action films, he called on artists from Laika to help with his visualizations. "They know my approach and philosophy," he said, mentioning that the storyboards he wanted didn't show only camera placement but also aspects of the emotional performance.
To storyboard the moment in the garage when Charlie discovers her car is actually Bumblebee, Knight used the artist Emanuela Cozzi. "The scene is more or less the heart and soul of the movie," he said. "And it's mostly done through facial expressions, gestures and body language."
For lighter moments that involve sight gags and a more comedic performance from Bumblebee, Knight employed Julián Nariño, who drew storyboards for the coming stop-motion Laika comedy "Missing Link." One of those moments is a beach scene in which Charlie teaches Bumblebee, with mixed results, how to hide from people who may do him harm.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
And to help create a greater connection on the set between Charlie and Bumblebee, the props and special effects teams built part of a practical Bumblebee: head, chest and upper arms. "The paint was detailed, the eyes would light up," Smith said. "It was a really faithful copy of Bumblebee at full size." He said it was useful for all departments, but particularly for visual effects, because it could show computer animators how much light should be reflecting off the chrome, the shade of yellow the robot should be in a particular room, and so on.
All of these details were in an effort to create a Transformer that felt fresh onscreen. "I know I have exacting standards," Knight said. "But we all had to work together to make this robot as expressive as it could be."

Texto completo: A Dover, N.H., high school teacher who drew widespread condemnation after allowing students to sing Ku Klux Klan-themed lyrics to the tune of “Jingle Bells" will return as a teacher and coach in the fall, the school district announced Friday.
The teacher, John Carver, has been on paid administrative leave since early December and is undertaking an “intensive course of study on issues pertaining to race, bias and privilege," said Dover School District Superintendent William R. Harbron in a statement. Carver, an instructor with 25 years of experience, will not return this academic year.
“Following much thought and deliberation, the District decided to do a restorative approach," Harbron said in an e-mail. “This approach was selected because the District believes that people can change, and the District is willing to invest in that change."
The district also concluded an investigation into the incident, though it declined to release the results, citing state and federal confidentiality laws, he said.
The song, with the refrain “KKK, KKK, Let's kill all the blacks," drew a swift backlash when another student posted a cellphone video of the performance in Carver's 11th-grade history class in late November. The song was part of a class assignment to create a jingle about an aspect of the Reconstruction-era of United States history, Harbron told the Associated Press.
New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, a Republican, slammed the video at the time, saying, “This situation is totally unacceptable."
In a statement, Harbron said the district already had ongoing training for teachers on racial issues and was coordinating with the Anti-Defamation League and NAACP.
“We are committed to preventing an incident like this from ever occurring again at our schools," Harbron said. “The district deeply regrets that this incident occurred, and we acknowledge the harm that words, symbols and actions can cause, especially when offered without the proper educational framework and context.

Texto completo: More than 30,000 Los Angeles public schoolteachers went on strike on Monday after months of unfruitful negotiations with the Los Angeles Unified School District. The teachers are asking for higher wages, smaller class sizes and more support staff in schools, including nurses, librarians and guidance counselors. Here are three books on teachers' historical battle for improved working conditions and one mother's year navigating the public school system in Los Angeles.

By Dana Goldstein
349 pp. Doubleday. (2014)
Goldstein begins her "lively account of the history of teaching" (our reviewer's words) in the 1820s, when early iterations of public schooling -- "common schools" -- were beginning to take form. She writes about how the field became dominated by women who received lower pay and explains that many of the solutions that have been put in place over the years, such as evaluating teachers based on student test scores or programs like Teach For America, have historical precedents.
TOUGH LIBERAL
Albert Shanker and the Battles Over Schools, Unions, Race and Democracy
By Richard D. Kahlenberg
552 pp. Columbia University Press. (2007)
This book highlights Albert Shanker, a union president who led teachers' strikes in late 1960s New York City after 18 unionized white educators were fired as part of an initiative to create a black local school district in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville sector of Brooklyn. Though Shanker agreed that the teaching force needed to be diversified, he took a different approach, working to unionize teacher aides, who tended to be people of color, and negotiating a stipend for them to get their college degrees and become teachers. Shanker has since been viewed as a pioneer in teachers' unions and educational reform.
MOTHER ON FIRE
By Sandra Tsing Loh
298 pp. Crown Publishers. (2008)
After Loh lost her job at a local NPR station, she realized she can no longer afford to send her daughter to private school. In this memoir, she recounts the year of motherhood in which she navigated public school bureaucracy in Los Angeles. Our reviewer wrote that Loh's ability to upgrade such a book into a "galvanizing treatise on somber topics like public school education, class and midlife consumerism, all the while eliciting at least one snort of laughter per page, is no less than a feat of genius."

Texto completo: Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, is using the backlash from his comments about white nationalism to raise money for his next campaign.

"The unhinged left has teamed up with Republican 'NeverTrumpers' and is pulling out all the stops to destroy me," King wrote in a campaign email to his supporters, according to the Des Moines Register.

King came under fire for comments he made in a New York Times interview, which were perceived as racist. He was quoted as saying, “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?”

But King says he was misquoted, and that he was only referring to Western civilization when he asked how that language became offensive. There is no audio of the interview.

In his email, King said the “rabid leftist media” are attacking him because he supports President Trump and his hard-line stances on immigration.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., announced this week that King would be stripped of his committee assignments in the 116th Congress. The House also voted to pass a resolution of disapproval Tuesday that called out King for his comments.

The resolution, instead of directly targeting King, rejected all forms of hateful expression. Only one congressman voted “no” on the resolution, and Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., said he voted that way because the resolution doesn’t go far enough.

Texto completo: Photographer on paddle board frees attraction for time lapse image
Westbrook's world-famous ice disk is spinning again, thanks to the efforts of a Freeport photographer, who used a paddleboard, an ice pick and an adventurous spirit Thursday afternoon to free the giant chunk of circular ice that was frozen on the banks of the Presumpscot River.
Andrew Sims said he felt compelled to free the disk because it had become stuck Wednesday, disappointing dozens of onlookers who had come to the city's River Walk to view the spectacle. He also saw an opportunity to do some time-lapse photography.
The disk had been surrounded by open water and was spinning slowly in a counterclockwise rotation until Wednesday, when it got stuck on and attached to stationary ice near the riverbank.
Sims returned to Westbrook on Thursday, and around 2:30 p.m. he launched his paddleboard into the river. While kneeling on the board, he began cutting an opening around the circle of ice, using his own weight and an ice pick to break the ice.
By 4:30 p.m., the disk was floating freely again and spinning counter-clockwise, the same direction as when it was first noticed Monday.
Sims, who was interviewed Thursday night while standing on the top level of a rooftop parking garage that overlooks the Presumpscot, said a crowd of onlookers started applauding when they realized his efforts to set the disc free had succeeded.
"It's awesome," Sims said. "I was pretty excited."
Watching the liberation mission unfold was Doug Bertlesman, who had a view from his riverfront office window at Ethos Marketing. Coworkers crowded around the window to watch. Some thought it was a fool's errand.
"We were like, 'This is insane. There was no way he's going to be able to do this.' He came at it from two sides and cut it loose. And then he pushed it, he pushed it across the river back to where it was. We're just laughing. There is no way. What an idiot. And sure enough."
As the temperature is expected remain well below freezing, Bertlesman suggested the city hire someone to "keep things moving."
"You can imagine the posting," said Bertlesman, who is also the lead singer in a band, Sons of Quint. "Must be good in a kayak and be able to withstand cold temperatures."
Sims' mission Thursday to free the disk followed a less successful apparent attempt Wednesday.
Westbrook police dissuaded a man on Wednesday afternoon from trying to climb onto the famous slab of frozen river water. Police went to the end of Ash Street in response to a report that a man had tethered himself to a tree with a rope and ventured onto the ice near the bank of the Presumpscot River in an apparent attempt to reach the disk.
The attempted boarding of the disk was captured partially on video from a nearby office building. The video shows five people standing on the shore as a sixth person walks toward the edge of the ice disk while trailing a rope and poking at the sheet of ice below him with a stick or cane.
The video ends before the man reaches the disk, and before police arrived to end the expedition.
"This is something that happens," police Capt. Steven Goldberg said. "We don't always have an ice disk on the river, but we always get ice and people try to get out onto the ice, and it's never safe. The ice on the Presumpscot River in Westbrook is never thick enough to go on."
Police did not have any reason to compel the man to give his name, and he did not tell police who he was.
"People are strange sometimes with their motivation," Goldberg said. "He left the scene. He was safe. It could have been a lot worse, and luckily it wasn't."
Westbrook's ice disk has drawn international media attention to Maine while fueling jokes about a supernatural omen or alien invasion.
The disk has been covered by the BBC, ABC's "Good Morning America" and The New York Times, among other outlets.
Adding to the mystery, two more ice disks were reported Wednesday in Maine. One was in Baxter State Park on Nesowadnehunk Stream, and the other was nearby on the West Branch of the Penobscot River, near the Abol Bridge.
But the ice disk in Westbrook is much larger. Seen from above, it is a perfectly symmetrical circle of ice about 300 feet across that vaguely resembles a moon.
Dozens of people lined the river bank late Thursday afternoon. Most were content to take photographs of the ice disk with their cellphones or to stand back and admire nature's work. Nearby restaurants and bars were packed with customers.
"It looks like the moon," said Hunter McGuire, who drove more than an hour from her home in Readfield, with her mother, Heather McGuire, and their dog Jade -- a black poodle -- just to see the disk. The McGuires, who moved to Maine recently from Florida, had never visited Westbrook before.
"We had to see this phenomenon, because we'll never see anything like it again," Heather McGuire said.
Betty and Terry Phillips live in Bridgton. They had an appointment Thursday morning in Augusta before deciding to drive to Westbrook to see the ice disk, which they had heard about on television. The couple said the long drive was worth the trip.
"I am so pleased," Betty Phillips said. "It's fascinating and it is awesome."
Legends Restaurant and Taproom, which is located a few feet from the river path, was doing a booming business Thursday evening.
Bartender Chyle Cameron said the establishment saw an opportunity to capitalize on the ice disk craze, so earlier this week it started serving up Ice Disk Cosmo, a mix of raspberry vodka; Chamboard, which is a raspberry liqueur; and lime.
"It has been flying today," Cameron said, referring to the drink's popularity.
Ice disks are natural phenomena that form in rivers and streams and range greatly in size. They are believed to be almost perfectly round because the shoreline or other ice formations grind down the edges of a mass after it begins to rotate in an eddy current.
One study that explored why the disks spin theorized that a vortex of cooling water under the ice helps propel the motion, but that experiment used tiny, 4-inch disks in artificially heated water baths as hot as 140 degrees.

And, Yeah, She's Descended From a Witch

Texto completo: PASADENA, Calif. -- On the patio of the Langham Huntington hotel here, on a sunny afternoon tinged with smoke from the recent wildfires in the area, Deborah Harkness swirled a glass of Jules Taylor sauvignon blanc, sniffed and sipped, then pronounced the wine "zingy. Really zingy. 2017, if I had to guess." Not an unusual appraisal from an oenophile who once wrote a blog called "Good Wine Under $20." But then came a less expected disquisition on the quasi-scientific history of winemaking: "There's all kinds of lore about alchemists fortifying wines and liquors, boiling them down, evaporating, ending up with something they called the spirit of wine."
Harkness's wine blog may have won awards from Food & Wine and Saveur, but she is better known as a historian of science and medicine at the University of Southern California -- and far better known as the author of a series of novels brimming with alchemy and magic, witches and vampires. All three of the books in her All Souls trilogy -- "'Twilight' for the intellectually restless," as NPR described one of the volumes -- as well as her most recent novel, "Time's Convert," have landed at the top or second spot on The New York Times Best Sellers list.
The trilogy -- "A Discovery of Witches," "Shadow of Night" and "The Book of Life" -- has also spawned a fan wiki, an annual convention attended by hundreds of adults who self-identify as supernatural, and a merchandise line that extends to duvet covers. "The series has great brand recognition and some of the most loyal fans on earth," said Laura Tisdel, Harkness's editor at Viking. "The books feel like guilty pleasures, but there's nothing to feel guilty about, because with Deb you're in the hands of a real honest to god historian."
Until recently the All Souls brand lacked one critical asset -- the splashy television adaptation. But on Jan. 17, Sundance Now and Shudder air the United States premiere of an eight-part series based on "A Discovery of Witches." (Two more seasons, corresponding to the other books, have been greenlighted.) The show, produced by Bad Wolf and Sky Productions, stars Teresa Palmer as Diana Bishop, the Yale scholar and "reluctant witch" whose discovery of an enchanted manuscript attracts the attention of an assortment of magical beings, including Matthew Clairmont -- a smoldering-eyed vampire scientist with designs on Diana -- played by the suitably hunky Matthew Goode.

"It's a very character-driven story, which is why I'm glad it ended up with Sundance," Harkness said. "It means we don't have to blow up so much stuff and have so much fake blood." As executive producer of the show, Harkness had a hand in everything from the casting to the edits. She has been busy promoting both the show and "Time's Convert." Harkness gives a lot of interviews in hotel rooms -- which may be why her publicist stipulated that this one take place at the Langham Huntington, even though the author lives less than two miles away. In any case, Harkness, who arrived in jeans and well-worn cowboy boots, her blonde hair staticky from the Santa Ana winds, fairly radiated spontaneity and sincerity. Maybe it was the wine.
She was, for example, expansive on the subject of new projects, a topic many writers would rather submit to a tax return than discuss. All Souls groupies will be happy to hear she is now 200 pages into a book about Matthew grappling with the forces of religious radicalism in 16th-century Europe. She recently returned from a three-week cruise around New Zealand to research another book about Matthew's nephew, the beloved soldier and mercenary Gallowglass. A deep dive into the history of witchcraft is also in the works.
Harkness is descended from a witch -- or at least a woman hanged in Salem for allegedly practicing witchcraft. The supernatural seized her imagination at a young age. "I can still see 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' on the shelves of the Horsham library," she said. Horsham, a suburb of Philadelphia, is not a bad place to grow up if you're interested in history, another early passion of hers. There were family picnics at battlefields, tours of historic houses. When she was 8, her father, the manager of a paint store, and her mother, who worked as a secretary, took Harkness and her younger brother on a trip to England -- sparking a lifelong interest in Elizabethan history.
She went to college at Mount Holyoke, where she designed her own major, in Renaissance Studies. A class called "Magic, Knowledge and the Pursuit of Power in the Renaissance" was transformative: "It was like somebody had taken a can opener to my brain and peeled off the lid. The teacher opened up the class by asking, 'How do you know what you think you know?' I've never stopped asking that question."
Harkness studied the history of magic and science in early modern Europe at Northwestern University, where she received a master's degree. Her adviser, convinced she was a natural storyteller on the strength of a one-page writing exercise, suggested she try her hand at fiction. Instead she went on to get her doctorate at the University of California, Davis, spending a year at Oxford on a Fulbright scholarship and writing her dissertation on John Dee, the alchemist and mathematician who served as the astrologer to Queen Elizabeth I.
At Northwestern she also met Karen Halttunen, a professor of American history who has been her partner since 1995: "Nothing happened for seven years, but when I started my first teaching job she was like a mentor to me and within a year it was clear to me, at least, that I was head over heels," Harkness said. In 2004 the couple moved from Davis to Los Angeles to take jobs at U.S.C., where Halttunen is the head of the history department.
One of the things about natural storytellers is that they can tell a tale over and over and it never gets old. Like this one: In the fall of 2008 Harkness took a vacation in Puerto Vallarta, where, at the airport bookstore, she was surprised to discover racks of books featuring supernatural characters (the Twilight craze was at its peak). "I bought a notebook and began sketching out ideas," she recalled. "I think I thought I was writing an op-ed piece about why are we today as fascinated by these creatures of myth and legend as my research subjects were in 1550." Five or six weeks later she had 180 pages -- and they contained dialogue.
The three-part narrative she had begun started with a romantic tale that became "A Discovery of Witches," published in 2011. It was followed by "Shadow of Night" in 2012 (Diana and Matthew time travel to Elizabethan England to unlock the secrets of the ancient manuscript), and "The Book of Life" in 2014 (the quest concludes at Matthew's ancestral home in Auvergne).
Harkness calls "Time's Convert," which came out in September, a "prequelly sequelly book," spanning the life of Matthew's son Marcus, from his days on the battlefields of the Revolutionary War to his contemporary romance with Phoebe, a warmblood turned vampire. (Vampires, remember, live forever.)
The author said that her books do not cleave to the conventions of genre fiction. Rather, she sees her writing in the vein of J.K. Rowling's: "What is the book you pick up when you're done with Harry Potter? I'd like to think you'd pick up a big set of chunky books like All Souls, which similarly talks about real issues, but issues facing adults, not teenagers."
The popular novelist Jodi Picoult -- herself no stranger to best-seller lists -- admires the intellectual heft of Harkness's books. "Her storytelling may hook you first," she wrote in an email, "but you'll learn history, literature and science in the course of reading one of her novels."
You will also encounter weighty themes. Differentness -- the differentness of a daemon with a drug problem, say -- is a dominant motif. "That's sort of what the whole series is about," Harkness said, washing down some wasabi peas with the last of her wine. "That eternal conflict between on the one hand knowing that difference and diversity is what makes us stronger and on the other being terrified of it."
She is not a fussy writer. Her primary work space is her home office overlooking the swimming pool in the backyard of the English cottage-like house she shares with Halttunen. But she also writes in hotels and on planes. Playlists are essential -- "a lot of period music, but not exclusively, so it'll be like a loop of 16th century and then Mumford & Sons." She relies on "a great team of beta readers" to review early drafts.
To clear her head Harkness rides her quarter horse, Blue. A year and a half ago she bought a getaway home, set amid the conifers on Whidbey Island in Puget Sound, Wash. But she hasn't been able to spend as much time there as she would like. In addition to her teaching and writing schedules, there are the demands of running a literary franchise -- the TV series, the book tours, the social media.
From the FAQs page on her website: Q: Do you believe in magic? A: Absolutely. When asked about that claim, Harkness dialed it back just a bit. "I believe there's more in the world that's happening than we're able to explain," she said. "Do I believe that you could do something on the terrace of the Langham and it would have an effect on that tree over there? I'm not sure I do, but I could see why you might believe that."
Maybe it was the wine again, but a skeptical reporter found himself focusing on the tree in question, a tall, skinny fan palm, and concentrating on movement: swaying trunk, fluttering fronds. The tree didn't move -- but that's beside the point.

Texto completo: Headnote FILM
OVER LUNCH, Enoch Jemmott's frustration mounts as his mother reveals she doesn't have her 1099 in her files.
Jemmott is one of the subjects of the film Personal Statement, which documents some of the challenges facing students from low-income backgrounds. Jemmott needed the form for college, but over and over again, obstacles blocked his path to obtaining it.
It's the scene, Director Juliane Dressner said, that has most shocked audiences. The documentary follows three students - Jemmott, Christine Rodriguez and Karoline Jimenez - as they navigate the college application process with little guidance. To fill the guidance gap, the three serve as peer college counselors to their fellow students.
At 3 p.m. on Jan. 21, Personal Statement will screen at the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts.
The event will include a panel discussion with School District of Philadelphia student organizers and counselors, as well as City Councilwoman At-Large Helen Gym. Dan UrevickAckelsberg of The Public Interest Law Center will moderate the discussion. Dressner, who is Jewish, and Rodriguez will be in attendance.
The event is free but RSVPs are required. Attendees can reserve tickets through Eventbrite.
"Often, we go to events and the quote-unquote experts are up there talking to the audience about the situation," said Heather Marcus, a school counselor at Julia R. Masterman Laboratory and Demonstration School who organized the event.
"Based on the film, where the students are just telling their own stories, I wanted the panel to represent students and counselors telling our stories in Philadelphia, so the audience could really hear what it was like from the students who are seniors and juniors in our schools in Philadelphia who don't have enough resources."

The American School Counselor Association recommends a ratio of one school counselor for every 250 students.
But nationwide, there is just one school counselor for every 464 students, according to the American School Counselor Association's data from the 20152016 school year. In Pennsylvania that same year, the ratio was one counselor to 396 students.
While more than 90 percent of high school students want to go to college, many don't achieve higher education. The National Center for Education Statistics found that only 14 percent of students of low socioeconomic status obtain their bachelor's degree within eight years of graduating high school.
"What we find is the college counseling gap is a major cause of this achievement gap, and yet, many people are unaware of it," Dressner said. "When they're made aware of it, from seeing the film and then hearing about these statistics and the situation, they're outraged, and they want to do something about it."
About five years ago, Dressner learned of College Access: Research & Action (CARA), the organization that trained the three students to be peer college counselors, and was struck by its potential to tell a story about education equity through film.
CARA was receptive to the idea.
On the first day of training, Dressner was in a room with 70 students who were there to learn about becoming peer college counselors. Dressner let them know she wanted to make a film and that anyone interested in collaborating should come and talk to her.
She ended up selecting Jemmott, Rodriguez and Jimenez as her subjects.
"When people hear about the fact that young people are working as peer college counselors, it's hard to imagine just hearing about it, that they're actually doing the work of college counseling," Dressner said. "You don't really understand how powerful the work is unless you can see it in action."
Personal Statement is not Dressner's first documentary, although it is her first feature-length one. She previously created the short films The Scars ofStop-and-Frisk, published as an op-doc by The New York Times, and An Education, published by The New York Times Magazine.
Filmmaking is a second career for Dressner. She previously worked in the nonprofit sector, where she documented best practices in social programs, including youth organizing. She wanted to make documentaries to share the work these young people were doing.
Dressner said her Jewish identity is part of what motivates her to pursue social justice through film.
Though Personal Statement came out last year, Dressner has continued work around the documentary through an outreach, engagement and impact campaign. Dressner has worked with Jemmott, Rodriguez and Jimenez to attend screenings and raise awareness about the need for more school counselors.
They have put on screening to inspire students from disadvantaged backgrounds to persist with their own college aspirations.
"Our goal is to use the film to really put this issue on the table, to focus more light on it," Dressner said. "When people learn about it, they can't believe it." *

Texto completo: In an effort to prevent immigrant students from being detained and deported on questionable evidence of gang involvement, a Long Island school district is taking the lead in negotiating an agreement to limit the role of school-based police officers.
At a packed, often emotional meeting last week, the Huntington, New York, school board said it has authorized its superintendent to hammer out a deal between the approximately 50 Suffolk County school districts that allow police in schools and the county Police Department. Board president Jennifer Hebert said that without a formal agreement, she would oppose the continued use of police known as resource officers in Huntington's schools.
"We need clarity and guidelines, and if we can't get those, I'm not comfortable having officers in our building going forward And many of these trustees feel similarly," she said
Another board member, Xavier Palacios, called for expunging school suspensions from the disciplinary records of students whom school resource officers reported to ICE. "We must make a wrong right. If our district needs to create a new policy to prevent this from happening again, then we must do so," he said.
The board members were responding to a story published last month by ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine about a student named Alex who attended Huntington High School while seeking asylum in the U.S. After he drew the telephone country code of his native Honduras as well as a devil with horns, which is a symbol of the violent street gang MS-13 but also Huntington High's mascot, the school suspended him for gang activity.
Alex was then detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which under President Donald Trump is increasingly using school records to arrest immigrant students who haven't been charged with any crime but are suspected of gang membership. Alex was one of about a dozen immigrant Huntington High students detained for allegedly associating with MS-13, which has been particularly active on Long Island. In several of these cases, ICE cited classroom doodles and other school incidents that were reported by Huntington High school resource officer Andrew Fio-rillo. Alex was deported to Honduras in July 2018.
The day after the story ran, the Huntington school district posted a letter promising to ask for a contract with Suffolk County police to clarify the duties of school resource officers. The Police Department said it is reviewing the district's request, and the police commissioner is expected to meet with county superintendents soon. At a community meeting Tuesday, Inspector Bill Scrima said that Fiorillo, who has worked at Huntington High for 14 years, has been pulled out of the high school. "We're not sure whether the school wants him back," Scrima told Newsday.
Neither the school nor the Police Department responded to Pro-Publica's questions about when Fiorillo is expected to return. Fiorillo did not respond to messages.
A spokesman for the Suffolk County School Superintendents Association said it supports Huntington's proposal for a formal agreement with police. "This episode is upsetting on so many levels," Huntington Superintendent James Polansky said. "What I ask for is that we come together as we take a lead role in changing the story, not just for us, but for districts around the area."
Protecting Our Classmates, a group of Huntington High alumni that formed in response to the article and includes the school's three most recent valedictorians, said that an agreement should mandate cultural competency training for police. The group has set up a GoFundMe site for Alex.
School privacy experts said districts that allow student information to be handed over to ICE may be violating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the landmark 1974 law that protects the confidentiality of school records. "This is a massive violation of the spirit of our federal student privacy law. These practices are unconstitutional and must stop immediately," said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law Center.
Some 500 people packed into an assembly hall for the school board meeting. So many people wanted to speak that the board held two comment sessions. Recent graduate Landary Rivas stood at the speaker's podium next to Alex's younger brother, who transferred from Huntington High to a neighboring school district after Alex was deported.
"It's very hard to be Latino here," Landary said, speaking through tears. "Something has to change. I'm sorry' is not going to cut it. This stuff has to stop."
Alex, who is following the developments from Honduras, said he is grateful for the support and hopes that telling his story will help other immigrants. "I want this to never happen to another student," he said.
Sidebar We need clarity and guidelines, and if we can't get those, I'm not comfortable having officers in our building going forward. And many of these trustees feel similarly."

No, the government shutdown isn’t a ‘crisis’

Texto completo: This government shutdown is now longer than any in history. The media keep using the word “crisis.”
“Shutdown sows chaos, confusion and anxiety!” says The Washington Post. “Pain spreads widely.”
The New York Times headlined, it’s all “just too much!”
But wait. Looking around America, I see people going about their business — families eating in restaurants, employees going to work, children playing in playgrounds, etc. I have to ask: Where’s the crisis?
Pundits talk as if government is the most important part of America, but it isn’t.
We need some government, limited government. But most of life, the best of life, goes on without government, many of the best parts in spite of government.
Of course, the shutdown is a big deal to the 800,000 people who aren’t being paid. But they will get paid. Government workers always do — after shutdowns.
Columnist Paul Krugman calls this shutdown, “Trump’s big libertarian experiment.” But it’s not libertarian. Government’s excessive rules are still in effect, and eventually government workers will be paid for not working. That makes this a most un-libertarian experiment.
But there are lessons to be learned.
During a shutdown when Barack Obama was president, government officials were so eager to make a point by inconveniencing people that they even stopped visitors from entering public parks.
Trump’s administration isn’t doing that, so PBS found a new crisis: “Trash cans spilling… (P)ark services can’t clean up the mess until Congress and the president reach a spending deal,” reported “NewsHour.”
But volunteers appeared to pick up some of the trash.
Given a chance, private citizens often step in to do things government says only government can do.
The Washington Post ran a front-page headline about farmers “reeling… because they aren’t receiving government support checks.”
But why do farmers even get “support checks”?
One justification is “saving family farms.” But the money goes to big farms.
Government doesn’t need to “guarantee the food supply,” another justification for subsidies. Most fruit and vegetable farmers get no subsidies, yet there are no shortages of peaches, plums, green beans, etc.
Subsidies are a scam created by politicians who get money from wheat, cotton, corn and soybean agribusinesses. Those farmers should suck it up and live without subsidies, too.
During shutdowns, government tells “nonessential workers” not to come to work. But if they’re nonessential, then why do we pay 400,000 of them?
Why do we still pay 100,000 American soldiers in Germany, Japan, Italy and England? Didn’t we win those wars?
We could take a chainsaw to so much of government.
The New York Times shrieks, “Shutdown Curtails FDA Food Inspections!”
Only if you read on do you learn that meat and poultry inspection is done by the Department of Agriculture. They’re still working. And the FDA is restarting some inspections as well.
More important, meat is usually safe not because of government — but because of competition.
Food sellers worry about their reputations. They know they’ll get bad publicity if they poison people (think Chipotle), so they take many more safety measures than government requires.
One meat producer told me that they employ 2,000 more safety inspectors than the law demands.
Lazy reporters cover politicians. Interviewees are usually in one place — often Washington, D.C. Interviewing politicians is easier than covering people pursuing their own interests all over America. But those are the people who make America work.
While pundits and politicians act as if everything needs government intervention, the opposite is true.
Even security work is done better by the private sector. At San Francisco’s airport, security lines move faster. Passengers told me, “The screeners are nicer!” The TSA even acknowledged that those screeners are better at finding contraband. That’s because San Francisco (Kansas City, Seattle and a dozen smaller airports) privatized the screening process. Private companies are responsible for security.
Private contractors are better because they must compete. Perform badly, and they get fired.
But government never fires itself.
Government workers shout, “We are essential!” But I say: “Give me a break. Most of you are not.”

Lawmakers here today, gone to Maui

Texto completo: As November and its slight autumnal chill — along with whipping Santa Ana winds, and huge wildfires in the north and the south — descends upon California every year, a state legislator’s mind turns to … well, naturally, to the Hawaiian island of Maui.
That’s where 10 members of the California Assembly and two state senators gathered this past November along with some of the state’s top power company officials at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort. It was four days of mai tais, long walks on the beach and casual conversation about just how much responsibility the utilities deserve for the destruction wrought by the fires that look to have been sparked in several cases by their company equipment.
Dan Howle, executive director and chairman of the California Independent Voter Project, said that no lobbying was permitted and that no specific legislation had been discussed, according to a report in The New York Times.
Uh huh. Perhaps by some formal definition, such as the names of specific numbered bills not being spoken out loud, there might have been no “lobbying” underneath the palm trees. But of course the utilities are trying to influence the politicians. Consumer Watchdog reports that the annual event’s sponsors included Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric, utilities that contributed to the campaigns of between 80 percent and 90 percent of state legislators over the last two years.
Yes, this luau goes on every year and yes, we have criticized its untoward appearance in the past. We understand that the parties that attend the, well, party, who fork out $8,000 apiece to attend, “pay their own way” to do so. For the politicians, that means wealthy campaign donors foot the bill. Donors such as Edison and PG&E.
But as the latter goes into bankruptcy and all of the investor-owned utilities hit the panic button over their current and future wildfire-stoked liabilities, this looks worse than ever. Californians were running for their lives in Malibu and Paradise, and a dozen of their representatives in Sacramento were schmoozing with utility execs, buffeted by gentle trade winds.
The attendees were Assembly members Frank Bigelow, Bill Brough, Ian Calderon, Jim Cooper, Tom Daly, Heath Flora, Jim Frazier, Reggie Jones-Sawyer, Freddie Rodriguez and Blanca Rubio, along with state Sens. Ben Hueso and Cathleen Galgiani.
Defenders of the yearly bash say that, yes, it’s in a nice corner of the world, but that it’s important for lawmakers to be able to visit with utility execs about the issues that concern the hard-pressed industry.
Here’s what Jack Pitney, the former Republican National Committee staffer and current Claremont McKenna College political science professor says: “Going to Maui for a public-policy conference is perfectly appropriate if, say, you work for the Maui County Department of Environmental Management. It does not make sense if your portfolio is in California. . . . There are plenty of conference centers throughout the state. If you wanted to get actual work done, you’d meet in Glendale, where there aren’t many distractions.”
And it’s not just the optics that concern us. The situation could not be more fraught with danger for California taxpayers as the utilities scramble for their financial lives. After the 2017 Maui confab, legislators put forward and approved a bill that allowed PG&E to issue billions of dollars in bonds that would help pay for wildfire damages earlier that year. Former Gov. Jerry Brown signed that bill and then allowed the company to pass those costs on to its ratepayers.
Who knows what utility-backed legislation will blow in from the tropics this legislative session?

Texto completo: Border, not Russia, is real threat
Saturday's State Journal story "Report: FBI probed Trump link with Russia" reprinted a rumor of an anonymous leak to the New York Times wishing somebody would find something on President Donald Trump.
Guess what. For the millions of dollars that have been spent, all the ink, bytes and hours wasted, no collusion has been found between President Trump and the Russians. This manufactured quest is a wish sandwich, all bread and no meat.
A real story is at our southern border. Friday the president met with local, federal and state officials at the border and was told, again, about many illegal immigrants coming across each day. Some are from Mexico and Central America, others are from other parts of the world.
Our southern border is one of the most porous in the world, and it threatens the sovereignty of the United States. How many citizens need to be harmed by illegal immigrants before the newspaper reports the facts?
What is the tipping point? This paper writes about the opioid epidemic, so help stop the flow.
It is time to forget the Trump/ Russia non-event and focus on some of the real problems that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and their followers refuse to face. Step one build the wall.
Richard Wood, Cottage Grove
Russian allegation should trouble all
At a time when yet another distracting, shiny object (the wall) is dangled before Americans, we now learn that the FBI has credible evidence and reason to investigate whether or not Donald Trump is a Russian agent. Just think about that for a moment. A serious question has been raised as to whether the president is working with a foreign adversary against America's interests.
This should be a red flag to all patriotic Americans one with a huge hammer and sickle on it.
If President Trump is not a Russian agent with his continuing denial of (the proven) Russian election meddling, his actions to weaken or destroy NATO, and his support of all things Putin how would we know the difference? It is time to wake up, America, and see what is plainly in front of us.
It is fine to have an open mind, but not so open that one's brains fall out.

Use fund to invest in golf courses
I agree that the Medical Society property on Lake Monona in Madison is a "once-in-a-generation or forever opportunity" for the city to purchase.
But I find it interesting that the Madison Parks Division and city administration don't look at potential golf course closings as a "forever" decision, which it will be if it happens.
Though the Medical Society land will not generate the income to maintain it, yes, it is a good investment in the community instead of letting it get into the hands of condo developers.
So Madison, buy that property.
Then take the rest of this Parkland Impact Fund and revitalize and promote the other gems the Madison golf courses.
These are parks that at least generate a good amount of income and, oh, while you're at it, hire back the golf pros to bring the city golf courses back to their former glory again.
Tom Klement, McFarland
Neighbors need Dominican values
From New Morning Nursery School to graduating from Edgewood High School in 2016, I have always felt part of the Monroe Street community.
The most important lesson Edgewood taught me was to lead a life of learning, service and personal responsibility by adhering to the five Dominican values of truth, compassion, justice, partnership and community.
Edgewood students support the local community with over 15,000 service hours annually. Edgewood hosts a free farmers' market to support healthy lifestyles.
When neighbors grew concerned over the use of the surrounding streets to park, Edgewood consistently communicated to the students the need to be respectful of neighbors.
Edgewood listened to the community by expanding parking to accommodate drivers so no students would park on neighborhood streets. Edgewood compassionately acts with the local community in mind.
Edgewood also works to be a partner in the community. In its latest compromise, Edgewood has offered to place a limit on late night games and to erect a sound barrier to further limit noise concern. Isn't this enough?
I wish the neighbors could keep the Dominican values in mind when making decisions that impact more than just their lives just like Edgewood has done since 1881.

Cartoons add levity to nasty politics
A few letters to the editor have reacted recently to Phil Hands' political cartoons some of them not all that complimentary. For one thing, some think he is too biased. I am not sure about that. It seems all he is trying to do is add a little levity to today's political climate and, believe me, we need something to smile about.
Politicians on both the right and left need a poke once in a while, and they probably deserve it.
But in Hands' defense, the GOP gives him much more material for his cartoons, with their voices, actions and insensitivity. So keep it up, Hands, keep jabbing them and keep "rattling their chains."

Resumen: A Military Times poll from October shows his approval rating among active-duty military personal had slipped since 2016, when he enjoyed a nine-point margin of support. Last year, Trump's deployment of U.S. soldiers to the border as an election-year gimmick, and his continued exploitation of our military for political purposes, had Pentagon officials privately deriding "the deployment as an expensive waste of time and resources, and a morale killer to boot," according to a New York Times report. In addition to freezing Coast Guard pay, the government shutdown has had a slew of ugly consequences for the military, ranging from the alarming - canceling U.S. military reservist training - to the indefensible - freezing the $100,000 death benefit to families of troops killed in action and military-funded travel for funeral services.

Texto completo: The letter began somberly:
To the Men and Women of the United States Coast Guard,
Today you will not be receiving your regularly scheduled mid-month paycheck.
But Admiral Karl Schultz, the 26th Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, was delivering more than just bad news. He was delivering a message. He posted the letter to his command on social media, writing,
"To the best of my knowledge, this marks the first time in our Nation's history that servicemembers in a US Armed Force have not been paid during a lapse in government appropriations."
He thanked Americans for their support, thanked these dedicated men and women for serving in some of the harshest of environments, and offered some encouragement: "Stay the course, stand the watch, and serve with pride. You are not, and will not, be forgotten."
He also noted that the Coast Guard had received a generous $15 million donation from USAA to supplement support during this furlough. That's right - our military, the greatest on the planet, is now taking donations to help pay our troops. What an utter disgrace.
Whether this final insult on the list of many will be enough to finally end this embarrassing government shutdown - the result of a hissy fit by our President for failing to do his job properly - remains to be seen. But the verdict from an important constituency is already in. And it isn't pretty.
Once a reliable voting bloc not only for Republicans but for Trump, too - a man who famously dodged the Vietnam draft claiming bone spurs - might be turning on the guy who loved to boast about his generals. A Military Times poll from October shows his approval rating among active-duty military personal had slipped since 2016, when he enjoyed a nine-point margin of support. Then, 46% of troops approved of his presidency and 37% disapproved. That gap disappeared, with 43.8% approving and 43.1% disapproving in the most recent survey.
And that was before the shutdown. Though the military is loath to wade into politics, this President has time and again thrust it into the realm of the overtly political, often to service his own ego or as a prop for his crass theatrics. And it was bound to take its toll.
There were the many slights against leadership, early on knocking the late Sen. John McCain's heroic service to slamming Gens. H.R. McMaster, John Kelly and Jim Mattis on their way out.
There were the slights against veterans, skipping out on Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans' Day and a ceremony in France honoring thousands of U.S. troops.
During the midterm elections, he shrugged off votes from active-duty troops, suggesting two Florida races be called for Republicans before military ballots had been counted.
Constant surprises, from announcing troops withdrawals in Syria to pledging an end to military exercises in South Korea, mean he often conducts foreign policy without informing those who would carry it out.
The border catastrophe is just the latest, but perhaps the most egregious.
Last year, Trump's deployment of U.S. soldiers to the border as an election-year gimmick, and his continued exploitation of our military for political purposes, had Pentagon officials privately deriding "the deployment as an expensive waste of time and resources, and a morale killer to boot," according to a New York Times report.
In addition to freezing Coast Guard pay, the government shutdown has had a slew of ugly consequences for the military, ranging from the alarming - canceling U.S. military reservist training - to the indefensible - freezing the $100,000 death benefit to families of troops killed in action and military-funded travel for funeral services.
Of course, our troops are not complaining. They will do what they do best - serve in sacrifice. But Trump's continued disregard for our men and women in uniform could have a great cost, both to him and to our country.

Texto completo: Even some Republicans are protesting snipes at her clothing, intellect
The tweet landed Sunday evening and instantly triggered an online melee over age, class and politics.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez "was so fiscally irresponsible that she hadn't saved up enough money to rent an apartment in the Washington D.C. area," wrote conservative commentator Candace Owens, adding the hashtag #SocialismSucks, as she blasted the New York freshman for complaining that some members of Congress have trouble paying for two residences. "But sure, let's trust her with the future fiscal-planning of America."
Ever since she burst onto the national political scene as a young socialist Democrat with a knack for making headlines, the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez has been an obsession for many on the political right.
As a young woman of Puerto Rican descent, a lawmaker from an ethnically diverse urban district and an outspoken liberal on issues of race, gender and class, she has in effect emerged as a living counterpoint to today's heavily white, male and rural Republican Party - and has drawn ire from seemingly all corners of the conservative movement.
Commentators and politicians have criticized her intelligence, her clothing, even her claims of working-class roots. There are new examples all the time.
Republicans Ed Rollins and Rush Limbaugh recently dismissed Ocasio-Cortez as a "little girl" and "some young uppity." The Washington Examiner's Eddie Scarry tweeted a photo of her in November and wrote that she doesn't "look like a girl who struggles." The Daily Caller promoted what it described as a possible "nude selfie" of her last week before walking back its headline.
The trend has been so relentless that even some Republicans are starting to come to her defense.
"Why do people persist in these shallow attacks on @AOC?" Republican Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) tweeted early Monday, referring to Owens's comment. "Let's discuss philosophical and policy differences (and areas of agreement), not her rent."
Ocasio-Cortez, who has amassed more than 2 million Twitter followers and has emerged as one of her party's most prominent national figures, seems to relish beatingback the attacks.
"It's encouraging because this is my sixth day in Congress and they're out of all their artillery," she said in a recent interview. "The nude is supposed to be like the bazooka. You know, like, 'We're going to take her down.' Dude, you're all out of bullets, you're all out of bombs, you're all out of all this stuff. What have you got left?"
Conservatives say they target Ocasio-Cortez because she is a rising star who promotes socialist views, occasionally botches facts and attracts widespread attention on social media.
In interviews, they defended their approach as fair game.
"This is called scrutiny for public figures," said Scarry, rejecting the idea that conservatives are fixated on Ocasio-Cortez. "This is just part of the bag. . . . She's 29. She's a woman. She can take care of herself. She can answer for herself."
The youngest-ever female member of the House, Ocasio-Cortez arrived in Washington in an unusual position: without hard power but at the center of the political zeitgeist. Since her election, in which she defeated a high-ranking incumbent in a primary, she has been parodied on "Saturday Night Live" and defended by Paul Krugman in the New York Times. Sunday political panels discuss her views. Fact-checkers point out her errors and misstatements.
She sat for an interview on CBS's premier news program, "60 Minutes," that aired days after her swearing-in, generating buzz with her call for raising taxes on the super-rich. And when she cast her vote for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Republican lawmakers were heard in the chamber groaning with disapproval.
When Trump was asked recently about Ocasio-Cortez calling him a racist, he said, "Who cares?" and made a dismissive gesture. She tweeted in response: "We got under his skin."
Social media has become her preferred platform for calling out political opponents, knocking competing ideas and highlighting comments she sees as unfair or biased.Ocasio-Cortez called the right's coverage of her "completely disgusting" on Twitter last week after the Daily Caller promoted the story about a fake "nude selfie" of her in a way that suggested the image might be authentic, making it go viral online.
Geoffrey Ingersoll, editor in chief of the Daily Caller, said he changed the story's headline to ensure it was not misleading but defended his writer's choice of topic.
"The article itself was abundantly clear about it being a vile hoax perpetrated by anonymous trolls," he wrote in a private Twitter message to The Washington Post while comparing Ocasio-Cortez's skill on social media to Trump's.
"The difference is Trump was forced to adapt to changing media, and Ocasio-Cortez grew up with it. Trump is just snorkling [sic], while Ocasio-Cortez has gills," he wrote.
Figures on the right said her style invites attack.
"If you put yourself out there and throw stones, you're going to get stones thrown back at you," said Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.), who has sought to engage with Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter about tax policy. "She operates in the same style that, say, President Trump does. Throw stones, stones get thrown right back."
Other Republicans said they engage her because it is necessary to challenge her views.
"It's important anytime that a sitting member of Congress promotes socialist ideas to at least expose what it would do to destroy the ability for people to move into the middle class," said House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), who recently tweeted his opposition to the idea of a 70 percent marginal tax rate.
Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, a Republican who was defeated in November, on Tuesday mocked Ocasio-Cortez for her tax proposal and suggested it was an elementary-school understanding of the issue. "Even 5th graders get it," he tweeted.
Ocasio-Cortez replied that her position was about taxing "the billionaire in town because he's making tons of money underpaying the townspeople."
Often, the right's response to Ocasio-Cortez goes beyond normal political posturing.
The congresswoman has faced conspiracy theories since she entered the political spotlight in June. Critics have argued that her story of working-class roots is fake, picking apart her clothes, education and even an apparent former nickname for evidence. An anonymous Twitter account affiliated with the far right sought to shame her this month by tweeting a video of her dancing "Breakfast Club"-style during college.
Ocasio-Cortez said nothing about her style or views merits crude personal attacks.
"Of course the right would say I'm asking for it, right?" she said. "That doesn't surprise me that that's the tack that they're going with. It's pretty transparent and very much shows the constructs of where they come from."
But Crenshaw also said Ocasio-Cortez overstates Republicans' negative feelings toward her. He referred to her tweet - "I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous" - after the anonymous account circulated the video.
"We don't care, and stop accusing us of caring," he said.

Senate Intel chair: Trump should claim executive privilege 'in anything that had to do with him'

Texto completo: Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., said Wednesday he will not seek out notes written by an American interpreter at a meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“If I were the president, I would try to claim executive privilege in anything that had to do with him," Burr was quoted as saying by CNN.

He was then asked if he would try to get the notes from the 2017 meeting in Hamburg, which then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also attended. "No," was Burr's reply.

The Washington Post reported over the weekend that the president took steps to try to protect his conversations with Putin, including taking his interpreter's notes from the Hamburg meeting and pressuring the interpreter to withhold information from administration officials. That followed a New York Times report that said the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump the day after he fired FBI Director James Comey in the spring of 2017.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has called the Times report "absurd," and when he was asked about whether he has ever worked for the Russians during an interview with Fox News' Jeanine Pirro late Saturday, Trump said it was "the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked."

The counterintelligence inquiry reported by the Times was later wrapped into special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The Senate Intelligence Committee, led by Burr and ranking members Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., is still conducting its own Russian interference inquiry.

Texto completo: In "A Dog's Way Home," Bryce Dallas Howard provides the voice of Bella, a brown-and-tan mixed breed who becomes separated from her human family.
In a promo for the film, Shelby -- the dog's real name -- can be seen snuggling happily with Howard. "She was found in a junkyard and hadn't encountered people, as far as anyone could tell," said Howard. "She was just a total sweetheart and was brought to a shelter," where she was ultimately selected by a trainer for the film.
Having worked on movies like "Jurassic World," where much of the challenge is acting opposite something that's not really there, Howard said doing voiceover was easy by comparison. "The film was already shot and edited and I recorded the voiceover afterwards, which was so fun because I got to see the movie and experience what the audience is going to see, and then I got to add a layer to it. Typically you're so inside of it, you don't get a sense of the big picture until you're at the premiere."
When asked about a worst moment in her career, she recalled a story from early in her career. "There was one super-defining moment for me and it was when I had left NYU," she said. "I hadn't graduated but I had started doing theater."
My worst moment ... "I did a couple shows at Manhattan Theatre Club and then I did something off-Broadway. And then I was doing Shakespeare's 'As You Like It' at the Public Theater and I was playing Rosalind. This was in 2003 and it was a production that had been put on before at another theater, so the entire cast had been brought back -- except for Rosalind. The woman who had previously played the role booked a TV pilot very suddenly and had to leave.
"So I was hired a week-and-a-half before previews started. There are usually three weeks of rehearsals at least, I think. So I had half that.
"Now, Rosalind has more lines than any other female character in Shakespeare. And I'm this 20- or 21-year-old girl who has a week-and-a-half to get off-book and be able to really inhabit the role. So it was certainly a challenge. I had an amazing director and an awesome cast, but I didn't feel like I was living up to the standards they were used to. It wasn't even insecurity. It was just a fact that every day I was like: Oh my gosh, I'm just not there yet.
"So we finally get to opening night and that's when all the reviewers were coming. We do the performance and you kind of know when you're not awesome yet (laughs), you can just tell. I was giving it my best, but it wasn't good enough. I have a good sense of when I'm (garbage), you know? (Laughs.)
"So the next morning I woke up and I opened The New York Times and I proceeded to read the review and it basically said this production is wonderful, beautifully directed, masterfully acted -- but it's a shame about the Rosalind. (Laughs.) And this was literally the first thing where I was carrying a show and having my performance assessed. And it was an accurate assessment! Not trying to be cruel at all. Like, really a legit critique.
(The review noted that while Howard was a "fetching temptress" in the role, she had a "tendency to overact. All too often you are conscious that she is making a face, as if the lines and gesture were memorized together.")
"I remember reading this, and you start to sweat, you start to panic, you're like, 'Oh, (shoot).' But then I remember being like: 'Huh. I'm OK.' Because I instantly recognized that it was true. I was like, 'I'm going to walk this off,' and I started to walk to the theater and by the time I got there, I literally had a pep in my step.
"And I just started to feel this freedom after that. Things started clicking and it started working. And a week after that review, M. Night Shyamalan came to see the show and afterwards he and his family waited for me. He was like, 'We loved the show, I just wanted to introduce myself.'
"A few weeks later, after the show had closed, I got a call from my agent, who said: 'M. Night Shyamalan wants to sit down and talk with you about a role in one of his movies.' So I went to lunch with Night and he was like, 'I don't know how to say this' -- and then he pulled out a manila envelope with a script and he pushed it over to me -- 'but I want you to be the lead in my next movie.' And he said, 'Just take the script, read it and give me a call.' And I went and I read it, and it was 'The Village' (from 2004) and that was my first movie. It was obviously a game-changing opportunity for me.
"And what followed that movie was a Lars von Trier movie called 'Manderlay' (2005) and I got that job because one of the other actors, who was very close with the producer of that film, had seen me in 'As You Like It' a week after opening and recommended me.
"My third job was doing Kenneth Branagh's 'As You Like It' (2006) as Rosalind. Why? Someone had seen me do it on (laughs) on stage a week after opening and recommended me! So I got to play Rosalind, again, in a movie with Ken Branagh directing me. And when that came out, I got nominated for a Golden Globe.
"Is there anything more encouraging than the fact that my first three major film jobs came directly from a performance that was given a week after being absolutely panned by The New York Times accurately? It was just this incredible payoff from this one experience. Work the problem, you're going to have a (junk) sandwich at the start, but that doesn't mean anything unless you give up."
Did being the daughter of a well-known director (Ron Howard) raise the stakes in terms of expectations? "I really, really, really need to get over this but I'm almost 38 and I don't think I will: I just really want to make my parents proud. And they are super proud, so it's a ridiculous thing, it's like chasing my own tail, you know? But I also feel this thing of: I just want to do well.
"My biggest thing was, I knew that I was in a privileged situation. Being the daughter of someone who has had success in my chosen industry, has celebrity, has a good reputation -- it was something that I knew was rare and I didn't want to fumble-bumble that. Sometimes people ask if I think it was an advantage or disadvantage and I'm always like, oh my gosh, are you kidding me? It was a total advantage. It's about getting in the door and so few people get a chance to walk through that door. I just didn't want to mess that up."
The takeaway ... "As a young actor, getting a bad review in The New York Times, that's one of your nightmares, and in this case it was like being found out. You've been caught and you just have to surrender to the situation that you're in and take responsibility. But it was super freeing because the worst-case scenario happened and I got through it.
"When I look back and remember the distress I felt of not being at the level that's being asked of you, that was very painful. But seeing that I could be reviewed (badly) and that I could turn it around so quickly was was so comforting. I wasn't living in that fear anymore.
"All of this stuff initially had to do with wanting to 'make it.' Being like, oh gosh, what's the consequence of this kind of public feedback? But when you're thinking about mastery rather than a career -- because a career has to do with money and how you support yourself -- but this was about my artistic development, looking at that and being like, yeah of course I'm not there yet. So what am I going to do to get there? You take the feedback and you keep practicing.
"It was definitely intensely embarrassing, but ultimately encouraging and kind of like divine intervention. It took some time and a big old paradigm-shifting event to get me to that next level. This was also not just about getting out of my own way, it was about practice and the expertise of those around me and the honesty of my friends and the candor. And specificity of that review, because there was actual feedback and concrete insights I could apply."

Texto completo: The letter began somberly:
Today you will not be receiving your regularly scheduled mid-month paycheck.
But Adm. Karl Schultz, the 26th commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, was delivering more than just bad news. He was delivering a message. He posted the letter to his command on social media, writing:
"To the best of my knowledge, this marks the first time in our Nation's history that servicemembers in a US Armed Force have not been paid during a lapse in government appropriations."
He thanked Americans for their support, thanked these dedicated men and women for serving in some of the harshest of environments, and offered some encouragement: "Stay the course, stand the watch and serve with pride. You are not, and will not, be forgotten."
He also noted that the Coast Guard had received a generous $15 million donation from USAA to supplement support during this furlough. That's right — our military, the greatest on the planet, is now taking donations to help pay our troops. What an utter disgrace.
Whether this final insult on the list of many will be enough to finally end this embarrassing government shutdown — the result of a hissy fit by our president for failing to do his job properly — remains to be seen. But the verdict from an important constituency is already in. And it isn't pretty.
Once a reliable voting bloc not only for Republicans but for Trump, too — a man who famously dodged the Vietnam draft claiming bone spurs — might be turning on the guy who loved to boast about his generals.
A Military Times poll from October shows his approval rating among active-duty military personal had slipped since 2016, when he enjoyed a nine-point margin of support. Then, 46 percent of troops approved of his presidency and 37 percent disapproved. That gap disappeared, with 43.8 percent approving and 43.1 percent disapproving in the most recent survey.
And that was before the shutdown. Though the military is loath to wade into politics, this president has time and again thrust it into the realm of the overtly political, often to service his own ego or as a prop for his crass theatrics. And it was bound to take its toll.
There have been many slights; early on he knocked Sen. John McCain's heroic service and slammed Gens. H.R. McMaster, John Kelly and James Mattis on their way out.
There were the slights against veterans, skipping out on Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day and a ceremony in France honoring thousands of U.S. troops.
During the midterm elections, he shrugged off votes from active-duty troops, suggesting two Florida races be called for Republicans before military ballots had been counted.
Constant surprises — from announcing troop withdrawals in Syria to pledging an end to military exercises in South Korea — mean he often conducts foreign policy without informing those who would carry it out.
The border catastrophe is just the latest, but perhaps the most egregious.
Last year, Trump's deployment of U.S. soldiers to the border as an election-year gimmick, and his continued exploitation of our military for political purposes had Pentagon officials privately deriding "the deployment as an expensive waste of time and resources, and a morale killer to boot," according to a New York Times report.
In addition to freezing Coast Guard pay, the government shutdown has had a slew of ugly consequences for the military, ranging from the alarming — canceling U.S. military reservist training — to the indefensible — freezing the $100,000 death benefit to families of troops killed in action and military-funded travel for funeral services.
Of course, our troops are not complaining. They will do what they do best — serve in sacrifice. But Trump's continued disregard for our men and women in uniform could have a great cost, both to him and to our country.

Now GOP condemns racism?; Our view: Censuring King is one thing, standing up to President Trump is another

Texto completo: Republicans have come down hard and swift on Rep. Steve King for remarks he made to The New York Times questioning why white supremacists and white nationalists are considered offensive. Party leaders stripped his committee memberships, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has suggested the Iowa Congressman "find another line of work."
How rich is that?
Where were Republicans all the other times Mr. King has spewed similar rhetoric? The list is long. Most recently he refused to remove a retweet of a post by author Mark Collett, who has called himself a Nazi sympathizer. Mr. King apologized for his comments as the House voted on a resolution to condemn his language. He also said he would vote on the resolution. Funny, he wasn't apologetic a few days ago.
Where were Republicans' cries of outrage as candidates across the country ran under the party banner on campaigns that openly espoused racist, anti-Semitic and anti-immigration views? Remember in the fall when Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi said about a supporter: "If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row." Silence from Republicans. (She won her election too.)
And in the most glaring show of hypocrisy by the GOP, party members have stood by and said nothing as President Donald Trump has shown time and time again his penchant for racially inflammatory comments. Just this week he insulted Native Americans with a insensitive tweet aimed at Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has started an exploratory committee for a presidential run in 2020. "If Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash," he said, trivializing a massacre of innocent Native American women and children and using a flippant and offensive nickname for Ms. Warren.
Mr. Trump has made racism acceptable and emboldened those who want to express it. The Republican Party has been complicit by allowing it to happen.
The number of hate crimes spiked 17 percent in 2017, the FBI has reported. And the agency's statistics, though the most comprehensive, don't capture all of the crimes and likely underestimate the incidents. The problem could actually be much worse than we think it is. This is an era where klansmen like David Duke have come back into play and groups like the "proud boys" feel free to attack people of color in the streets. Former Hampden resident James Jackson told police he randomly stabbed a black man in New York in 2017 because he wanted to target black men in interracial relationships.
We don't know why the GOP is suddenly going after Mr. King with such gusto. Maybe he is an easy target because his racist record is so long. Or perhaps they realize appealing to a base that so overtly embraces these views isn't a good long-term political strategy in a country that's increasingly becoming more diverse. Maybe it's a distraction from the federal government shutdown.
Whatever the reason, Mr. King needs to go. There is no place in Congress for his views. But even if he does develop a conscience and resign, his party is far from being off the hook. Until they stand up to the elephant in the room - Mr. Trump - their words mean nothing and their actions against Mr. King are just a show.

L PLANS QUESTIONED AT MTA MEETING

Texto completo: The MTA's board is seeking independent oversight of the L train's Canarsie tunnel reconstruction as critical questions linger around Gov. Andrew Cuomo's surprise announcement earlier this month to cancel the L train shutdown.
Concerned about the quality of the new rehabilitation proposal, and the level of poisonous dust that would emanate from the work, several board members during a special meeting on Tuesday called for an independent review of the new proposal - with those reviewers reporting directly to the board - before any new plan is put into effect.
"To me, before I would be able to ever make a positive vote on something like this, I would like to see [a] qualified, independent - and I mean independent - engineering consulting firm take a look at this thing and advise the board directly as to how they see the pluses and minuses," said board member Andrew Saul, calling in to the meeting as he recovered from back surgery.
Instead of carrying out the full shutdown of L service through Manhattan beginning this April, Cuomo assembled a team of engineering academics from Cornell and Columbia universities at the eleventh hour. The team devised a new proposal that would repair the tunnel with a smaller disruption: Work would take place on nights and weekends with a significant reduction, but not elimination, of service.
The new proposal abandons the original plan to reconstruct the tunnel's concrete bench walls, which encase the line's power and communications cables. Instead, those cables would be hung high on the tunnel's walls, with sections of the Sandy-damaged bench walls either being removed or fortified with a fiberglass-reinforced polymer.
That new method would fortify the century-old tunnel for another 40 to 50 years, whereas the original approach was expected to make the tunnel safe for another century - albeit via a more disruptive reconstruction.
"It certainly would have been advantageous for long-term service life to completely tear out the duct banks and completely replace them," said Mike Abrahams, an engineer at WSP, the consulting firm that pitched the original plan and is now overseeing the new strategy. "There are certainly surface-life advantages to doing that."
But the MTA believes the new proposal is worth pursuing for the decades of resiliency, and the important fact that there will no longer be a full shutdown, which would displace 225,000 daily riders who use the L train to get between Manhattan and Brooklyn.
Acting Chairman Freddy Ferrer said the MTA plans to find an independent reviewer for the board. In the meantime, the authority has shuffled its own leadership on the project while working to nail down specific questions it's hoping to answer on the new project, including how much concrete would have to be removed, how much silica dust would enter the air, and how the contractors, Judlau and TC Electric, would mitigate that hazardous silica dust.
"To me the biggest factor I think going forward in terms of this working or not working is the silica factor," said MTA board member Scott Rechler. "If we can do this without in any way putting health risks to our customers, this is something that we should be pursuing."
All of the questions, and the need of a third-party review, leave an unclear picture as to when this work could begin.
"I think of a lot of good questions were raised today. I actually thought it was a really good discussion," said board member and city Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg after the meeting. "Obviously a lot of things still need to be answered."
The silica dust concerns came after it was reported in The New York Times that the MTA and its consultants advised against a similar rehab strategy years ago due to a concern over lingering dust stemming from the demolition of concrete in the tunnel. Jerry Jannetti, the senior vice president at WSP, said that instead of completely removing and replacing the bench wall, only 40 percent will be removed, significantly reducing the amount of silica dust that would enter the tunnel.
"The project will comply and meet all environmental standards - including those for silica mitigation." Jannetti said.
NYC Transit President Andy Byford was quiet for most of the meeting. The transit chief initially said he would take charge over evaluating the new proposal, to decide whether it was feasible, and go before the board with his findings. But Byford's oversight role had been marginalized.
The MTA announced Tuesday that the project would be passed from Byford's branch to Capital Construction, which is headed by Chief Development Officer Janno Leiber, with Managing Director Ronique Hakim supervising other elements of the project.
"Andy is responsible, for among other things, running the biggest rail system in North America," Ferrer said. "Second, on the L train, he's responsible for service, communications with customers, and all the other things ... that are involved in the L train renewal."
Several board members were confused as to what the body's ultimate role would be in deciding the fate of the project. Board member Neal Zuckerman pointed out that the MTA's own website announces "L shutdown averted."
Ferrer reiterated that material changes in the contracts or any agreements with vendors or consultants would have to come before the board. As to when that would be, and whether the work could start as originally planned, on April 27, he didn't have a definitive answer.
"We're not there yet on when the contracts will be coming before the board," he said, "because we haven't concluded renegotiations on a rescoping or anything else."

House condemns white nationalism, supremacy

Texto completo: The House voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to condemn white nationalism and white supremacy, a measure prompted by the comments of Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who openly questioned why those terms had become offensive.
Having been stripped of his committee assignments Monday and facing further reproach, King went to the House floor Tuesday to say that he would support the resolution while continuing to protest that he had been misquoted in The New York Times article.
"There is no tape for this interview I did. There's no way to go back and listen," he said, conceding that he might have said the quoted words but challenging how they have been interpreted. "That ideology never showed up in my head. I don't know how it would have come out of my mouth."
The resolution, introduced by House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., mentions King's remarks in its preamble, but the measure does not directly rebuke King himself. It passed 424-1, with Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., voting no because he favors a censure of King.
Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American congressional leader, called white nationalism and white supremacy "clear and present dangers to our great Republic," in floor remarks Tuesday.
"When elected representatives give cover and comfort to those who spread racial divisiveness, we embolden those on the fringes on our society, and we have seen some of the results," he said citing the hate-motivated murders of black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., and synagogue attendees in Pittsburgh.
King sat apart from his colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle as Clyburn spoke. Moments later, King rose, made the sign of the cross, and descended into the well of the House to give his remarks.
King said he came from a family of abolitionists, before ultimately calling on his colleagues to support a measure that is intended to serve as a serious admonition against him.
"All men and all women are created equal," he said. "It is in my heart, it is in my soul, and it is in my works."
But those words came too late for his own Republican colleagues, not to mention scores of Democrats who are ready to pursue more serious actions against King, including censure -- the most serious House sanction short of expulsion.
Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, called Tuesday for King to "find another line of work," a day after GOP leaders moved to punish King by stripping him of his committee assignments and King earned a rebuke from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., condemned King's comments but stopped short of calling for his resignation.
"I think that's up to Steve King," he said.
Some Democrats are pressing for further punishment. Two Democrats have filed censure resolutions that are set to see floor action by Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters Tuesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., praised Republican leaders for their action but left open the possibility that he would vote for a censure resolution.
Hoyer exploded when asked how King's behavior compared to the last House member to be censured, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
King's conduct, he said, "far exceeds" Rangel's actions, which included improperly using his office to solicit funds and failing to pay taxes on a vacation home. Hoyer served as majority leader during Rangel's 2010 ethics proceedings and pushed to reprimand Rangel, a lesser punishment than censure.
"What King is doing and what others have done is to encourage the undermining of the basic principles of our country," he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The House voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to condemn white nationalism and white supremacy, a measure prompted by the comments of Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who openly questioned why those terms had become offensive.
Having been stripped of his committee assignments Monday and facing further reproach, King went to the House floor Tuesday to say that he would support the resolution while continuing to protest that he had been misquoted in The New York Times article.
"There is no tape for this interview I did. There's no way to go back and listen," he said, conceding that he might have said the quoted words but challenging how they have been interpreted. "That ideology never showed up in my head. I don't know how it would have come out of my mouth."
The resolution, introduced by House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., mentions King's remarks in its preamble, but the measure does not directly rebuke King himself. It passed 424-1, with Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ga., voting no because he favors a censure of King.
Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American congressional leader, called white nationalism and white supremacy "clear and present dangers to our great Republic," in floor remarks Tuesday.
"When elected representatives give cover and comfort to those who spread racial divisiveness, we embolden those on the fringes on our society, and we have seen some of the results," he said citing the hate-motivated murders of black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., and synagogue attendees in Pittsburgh.
King sat apart from his colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle as Clyburn spoke. Moments later, King rose, made the sign of the cross, and descended into the well of the House to give his remarks.
King said he came from a family of abolitionists, before ultimately calling on his colleagues to support a measure that is intended to serve as a serious admonition against him.
"All men and all women are created equal," he said. "It is in my heart, it is in my soul, and it is in my works."
But those words came too late for his own Republican colleagues, not to mention scores of Democrats who are ready to pursue more serious actions against King, including censure - the most serious House sanction short of expulsion.
Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, called Tuesday for King to "find another line of work," a day after GOP leaders moved to punish King by stripping him of his committee assignments and King earned a rebuke from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., condemned King's comments.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Monday denied he ever worked for Russia against U.S. interests, addressing an extraordinary question that has haunted his presidency and shows no sign of going away.
Speaking from the South Lawn, Trump issued a flat denial: "I never worked for Russia." He blasted former FBI and Justice Department officials and repeated his claim that the investigation into his ties to Moscow is a hoax.
Trump raised eyebrows over the weekend when he didn't directly answer the Russia question in an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, a personal friend.
He was asked about a New York Times report that law enforcement officials began investigating in 2017 whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against U.S. interests.
Trump said the question was "insulting," but did not directly deny it.
Monday's clear denial demonstrated the unprecedented pressure Trump faces as the special counsel's Russia investigation shows possible signs of wrapping up. After two years in office, the president is still being questioned about whether he was compromised by Russian intelligence agencies and he is still struggling to answer clearly.
White House aides expressed regret over the weekend that the president did not more clearly and forcefully deny being a Russian agent on Saturday when asked by the usually friendly Fox News host, according to three White House aides and Republicans close to the White House. The three spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.
When Pirro asked if he had ever worked for Russia, Trump said it was "the most insulting thing I've ever been asked."
"I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing," he said.
Trump went on to assert that no president has taken a harder stance against Russia than he has.
"If you ask the folks in Russia, I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else, any other ... probably any other president, period, but certainly the last three or four presidents," he said.
On Monday, Trump also defended his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, a move that has drawn Mueller's scrutiny. Trump called the Russia probe "a whole big fat hoax."
Special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into Russian election interference and whether Trump's campaign coordinated with the Russians. He also is investigating possible obstruction of justice by Trump. - (AP)

Devin Nunes: Report on Mueller inspecting pre-inauguration event a 'fake news' hit job

Texto completo: Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., on Tuesday dismissed a report that said special counsel Robert Mueller is scrutinizing an event he attended with former national security adviser Michael Flynn and foreign officials days before President Trump's inauguration as a "fake news" smear.

Asked to respond to the Daily Beast's report, Nunes told Fox News, "These guys — it's always another day, they do another fake news story."

Not denying he was in attendance, Nunes explained that it was his job to meet with foreign officials as a member of Trump's transition team and continues to be the case today as he is the top Republican of the House Intelligence Committee.

"I don't even know what they're talking about," he said, casting doubt on the implications drawn in the article. "As chairman of the Intelligence Committee at the time, I'm now still Republican leader of the Intelligence Committee, my job is to meet with foreign dignitaries. So I do that on daily basis, multiple times per day. During inauguration week there were numerous events that I attended I continued to attend. I continue to meet foreigners all the time, especially working with the ambassadors here in Washington."

The breakfast event in question took place at Trump International Hotel in D.C. on Jan. 18, 2017, and included multiple foreign diplomats. The event has attracted the attention of federal investigators for multiple reasons, including whether foreign interests tried to buy influence via donations to Trump's inaugural committee and a pro-Trump super PAC.

Flynn, who was pushed out as national security adviser in February 2017, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian envoy and has been cooperating with Mueller's Russia investigation.

Nunes has been a vocal defender of Trump amid the ongoing federal Russia investigation looking into potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Reacting to a New York Times report last week that said the FBI opened a counterintelligence inquiry into Trump after he fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 to examine whether he was a Russian asset, Nunes called the story "totally ridiculous" and conceded he didn't know if it was "fake news," but if it was true, "I think the Secret Service or someone would have known."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee spent more than $100 million on celebrating his arrival to office a couple years ago, including $10,000 for makeup alone. The spending total is double or more what former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush raised for their first and second inaugurations. Federal prosecutors are examining donations to Trump’s inaugural committee and whether any of them were illegal, foreign contributions passed through Americans. Most of the spending from the committee was related to staff payroll and hotel chains or other vendors involved in the events surrounding Trump’s inauguration. About $1.5 million went to Trump International Hotel for services such as the use of a ballroom. [NYTimes]

Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump and crony capitalism

Texto completo: Donald Trump’s Tweet dubbing Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s billionaire founder, “Jeff Bozo” reveals more than the locker room MO of our president. Our country’s roots are in England, where people of importance are knighted. In America, we now have our own version of knighthood: a nickname from Donald Trump.
Amazon is this little hidden gem you may not have heard of where you can buy things. It’s just like eBay except the Amazon stuff doesn’t show up at your house smelling like cigarette smoke and moth balls. If you order a battery from Amazon, they find it, ship it on a truck, then a plane, then bubble wrap it in a box the size of a mini-fridge, then put it on another plane and another diesel truck belching smoke to drop it at your house — all the while bragging about how “green” they are.
Amazon is also in the entertainment business. It paid Woody Allen millions to tell his story, from his childhood growing up on the playgrounds of NYC to his current days hanging around playgrounds of NYC.
When Trump and Bezos look at each other, aside from both thinking “What happened to his hair?”, they see similar-style political billionaires and crony capitalists. Both capitulate to political power to run their businesses. Remember, Trump was a Democrat most of his life; he wouldn’t have made it in New York otherwise.
As in all of Trump’s bombastic bluster, there’s an important truth. He suggests in his Tweet that The Washington Post ought to have to register as a lobbyist because of its leftist and one-sided coverage, leaks and activism.
Remember how the left vilified the Koch brothers for their one-sided political activity? Had they been Dems, you would never have heard of them. The Washington Post, New York Times and the like are not much more biased, influential and worthy of scrutiny than Koch Enterprises.
Trump also made another good point: The National Enquirer has broken as many or more important stories than the mainstream media outlets. From Gary Hart’s affair, John Edwards’ paying off his mistress with campaign money (John Edwards was tried and the jury was hung — but you know how men on a jury lie), Bob Dole’s mistress, O.J. Simpson’s “evidence,” Jesse Jackson’s love child, Bill Clinton’s affairs… and it had the Stormy Daniels/Trump story. Can you name another news outlet that has had that many scoops?
The Enquirer and TMZ-like outlets play important roles when leftist newspapers abdicate their position as watchdog journalists to pursue their political agendas. Tabloids have uncovered Kevin Spacey’s foibles and pedophile priests’ misdeeds where clergy were only punished by the Church with a warning: Don’t fondle little boys.
The Enquirer sees a story and money to be made — not political gain. It exposed Mark Souder (R-IN), who was a Christian radio show host, and caught him cavorting conjugally with his girlfriend in a state park. While Republicans are usually OK with drilling on public property, this outed Souder into obscurity.
The point is, like Trump with his brashness and the supposedly low-brow National Enquirer, there is often more truth in what they say than the media “elites” spew.
Trump picked a fight with Bezos and Amazon last year when he rightfully pointed out that our Postal Service subsidizes Amazon’s package delivery. The United States Postal Service is a unionized behemoth that delivers CVS flyers six days a week to even the most rural American. It loses $5 billion a year, making it the most successful federal program we have.
Amazon has to have political cover since it dances in the gray area of government, not only with our Postal Service, but with drone delivery, the newspaper business, and in privacy rights with its Echo home voice commands. Americans haven’t thought through just how much of our privacy we have given up to Google and Amazon. I’m not sure if my Roomba is cleaning my house or casing the joint.
I fear the ongoing corporate cronyism of Amazon/The Washington Post is worse than The National Enquirer being paid by Trump to bury one story. Amazon just went around the country peddling its headquarters out to the city that would fork over the most money. Instead of one city, they got bought by two. Presumably by doing so, Amazon got free shipping.

Texto completo: At a precarious moment for the Republic, with an unstable and vindictive President feeling increasingly under siege, the Senate begins confirmation hearings for former U.S. Attorney General William Barr to assume the post under President Trump.
Barr, who earlier called Robert Mueller's probe "fatally misconceived" in following a theory that Trump obstructed justice by firing FBI Director James Comey, must give ironclad assurances under oath that he will not interfere one iota with the essential investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Monday, Barr released an opening statement in which he called it "vitally important" that "the Special Counsel...complete his work. The country needs a credible resolution of these issues."
It is a promising commitment that must be reinforced in every imaginable way by members of the Judiciary Committee, especially in light of alarming revelations of recent days.
The New York Times reported that the FBI opened up a counterintelligence investigation - meaning, a probe designed to determine whether a foreign power has compromised U.S. security - into Trump himself following his firing of FBI boss Jim Comey, after which the President boasted to top Russian officials firing: "I faced great pressure because of Russia," he said. "That's taken off."
And the Washington Post disclosed that Trump has bent over backward to prevent the contents of his meetings with Russia's Vladimir Putin from being shared. After one such sitdown, he even took the extraordinary step of confiscating his own interpreter's notes.
The Mueller probe, which Trump and his allies decry as a wasteful witch hunt, has already produced more than 30 indictments or convictions. And it took custody of that counterintelligence investigation, which yielded who knows what other explosive leads and conclusions.
Will Barr allow Mueller to continue down such a path?
If he can't say yes, believably and unconditionally, he should not be confirmed.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Donald Trump on Monday denied he ever worked for Russia against U.S. interests, addressing an extraordinary question that has haunted his presidency and shows no sign of going away.

Speaking from the South Lawn, Trump issued a flat denial: "I never worked for Russia." He blasted former FBI and Justice Department officials and repeated his claim that the investigation into his ties to Moscow is a hoax.

Trump raised eyebrows over the weekend when he didn't directly answer the Russia question in an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, a personal friend.

He was asked about a New York Times report that law enforcement officials began investigating, in 2017, whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against U.S. interests.

Trump said the question was "insulting," but did not directly deny it.

Monday's clear denial demonstrated the unprecedented pressure Trump faces as the special counsel's Russia investigation shows possible signs of wrapping up. After two years in office, the president is still being questioned about whether he was compromised by Russian intelligence agencies and he is still struggling to answer clearly.

White House aides expressed regret over the weekend that the president did not more clearly and forcefully deny being a Russian agent on Saturday when asked by the usually friendly Fox News host, according to three White House aides and Republicans close to the White House. The three spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.

When Pirro asked if he had ever worked for Russia, Trump said it was "the most insulting thing I've ever been asked."

"I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing," he said.

Trump went on to assert that no president has taken a harder stance against Russia than he has.

"If you ask the folks in Russia, I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else, any other ... probably any other president, period, but certainly the last three or four presidents," he said.

On Monday, Trump also defended his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, a move that has drawn Mueller's scrutiny. Trump called the Russia probe "a whole big fat hoax."

Special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into Russian election interference and whether Trump's campaign coordinated with the Russians. He also is investigating possible obstruction of justice by Trump.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
With this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol.
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.

Texto completo: President Trump said Monday that he “never worked for Russia” and is insulted to even be asked that question.

"I never worked for Russia. And you know that answer better than anybody. I never worked for Russia,” Trump told reporters before departing for Nashville to speak at a farmer’s convention Monday morning. “Not only did I never work for Russia, I think it's a disgrace that you even asked that question because it's a whole big fat hoax. It's just a hoax."


Since the inception of the investigation into Russian collusion and involvement in the 2016 campaign and election, Trump has said it is a “hoax” and a “witch hunt.”

Over the weekend, Trump told Fox News during a live phone interview that being asked if he ever worked for Russia is the “most insulting thing” he has ever been asked.

"I’m going to ask you, are you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?" host Jeanine Pirro asked.

"I think it's the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked,” Trump said. “I think it's the most insulting article I’ve ever had written. And if you read the article, you'd see that they found absolutely nothing."

Trump was referring to a Friday report from the New York Times that said Trump was secretly investigated by the FBI on suspicion that he was working for Russian, whether it was knowingly or unintentionally.

The report indicated that the FBI opened the counterintelligence investigation into Trump the day after he fired then-FBI Director James Comey in the spring of 2017.

Alexander: Still an uphill battle for Chargers in L.A.

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE, R.I. — On the field, as long as you discount Sunday’s boat race against the Patriots, the 2018 season was an unqualified success for the Chargers. A 12-4 regular season, one playoff win, and a core of young, talented players suggest a bright future.
On the streets and in the boardrooms and living rooms of L.A., do people care?
The overnight TV ratings for Sunday’s Divisional Round playoff game in Foxborough were down slightly nationally (19.2), despite huge numbers in the Boston market. In L.A., the game drew a 17.2 rating. In San Diego it drew a 29.7, underlining the fact that it remains the home of the only group of football fans who still truly care about this franchise.
(I mean, hating is caring, right?)
This is, as we have been constantly told, a long-term play for the Chargers in Los Angeles. Playing in the recently renamed 28,000-seat soccer stadium in Carson was meant to transition the franchise into the market while building an audience and selling seat licenses for their tenancy in the stadium that Rams owner Stan Kroenke is building in Inglewood.
We are now two years into this adventure and there’s no going back. Dean Spanos told the New York Times last week, “There’s no doubt we are the Los Angeles Chargers. Los Angeles is our home.”
They’ve sold some seat licenses for the StanleyDome, shrewdly offering them for as little as $100 with the idea of ultimately positioning themselves as the people’s team.
Anecdotal evidence, though, suggests few people are buying it. How often do you see people wearing Chargers gear in public, for instance, compared to the number of people wearing Rams gear?
L.A. is an incredibly competitive sports market, and it takes time to create a niche. The Chargers had the misfortune of coming in a year after the Rams and their pre-existing history and legacy in L.A. They may still be digging out from the 0-4 start in their inaugural L.A. season, in terms of public perception.
Yes, winning does matter. But the Chargers’ success came the same season that the Rams were just a little bit hotter. And with the Chargers done, guess who has the L.A. football stage all to itself this week?
Whether the Spanos family likes it or not, this is still perceived in many quarters as a franchise that belongs to, and in, San Diego. Even now, two years in, the Lyft driver in Baltimore, the radio/podcast commentator in Cleveland, the occasional referee announcing a penalty and observers throughout the country still refer to the team as “San Diego.”
(Then again, during the wild card game in Baltimore last week referee Clete Blakeman slipped and declared that “San Francisco is charged with its first timeout” after an unsuccessful Chargers challenge. Yeah, we know, all those California teams are interchangeable.)
Consider this, going back to TV ratings: For much of the season, the Chargers’ L.A. ratings were in single digits and significantly trailed those in its former home. The Baltimore game last Sunday drew an 18.0 rating and 43 share in Los Angeles, a significant improvement … but in San Diego, split between those who still love the team and those who despise Spanos, the game drew a 30.7 rating and 60 share. Sunday against the Patriots was pretty much more of the same.
The ratings figure is deceptive, of course, because of the difference between a point in No. 29 market San Diego (10,028 homes, as measured by Nielsen) and No. 2 L.A. (53,186). Translated, 914,799 households in L.A. had the Patriots-Chargers game on, compared to 297,832 in San Diego.
Numbers can be crunched. Passion is harder to measure.
The San Diego Union-Tribune sent a reporter to New England this past weekend. San Diego TV people show up at home games and midweek availability in Costa Mesa. And there seems to be a constant debate in San Diego over how much that city’s media should pay attention to the city’s former team. Meanwhile, in L.A. it is one team among many and simply fighting for attention.
That shouldn’t be surprising at all. When this team played in San Diego, I had always maintained that with its low national profile, the only people who really, really cared about the Chargers resided in San Diego County, plus parts of Orange and Riverside counties. Even now, I’m convinced that the majority of those who are Charger fans are holdovers from the San Diego era.
The guy in the middle of all of this? Philip Rivers, who is still a San Diego resident and commutes to practices in Costa Mesa in a chauffeured SUV that has been converted into a rolling film room.
“San Diego will always be special for me and for many of us,” the quarterback said last week. “I’m not out and about very much this time of year, but I think … I don’t know the best way to say it. You hope that some of those fans can be happy and excited for the team they cheered for. And I know many others may not.
“And, you know, that’s a hard decision and position to be in. But certainly, you know, the people I run into have always been very supportive.”
Meanwhile, we know it’s a long-term project in a tough market. But at some point the audience size has to grow significantly, right?

He was asked about a New York Times report that law enforcement officials began investigating, in 2017, whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against U.S. interests.
Trump said the question was "insulting," but did not directly deny it.
Monday's clear denial demonstrated the unprecedented pressure Trump faces as the special counsel's Russia investigation shows possible signs of wrapping up. After two years in office, the president is still being questioned about whether he was compromised by Russian intelligence agencies and he is still struggling to answer clearly.
White House aides expressed regret over the weekend that the president did not more clearly and forcefully deny being a Russian agent on Saturday when asked by the usually friendly Fox News host, according to three White House aides and Republicans close to the White House. The three spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.
When Pirro asked if he had ever worked for Russia, Trump said it was "the most insulting thing I've ever been asked."
"I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing," he said.
Trump went on to assert that no president has taken a harder stance against Russia than he has.
"If you ask the folks in Russia, I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else, any other ... probably any other president, period, but certainly the last three or four presidents," he said.
On Monday, Trump also defended his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, a move that has drawn Mueller's scrutiny. Trump called the Russia probe "a whole big fat hoax."
Special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into Russian election interference and whether Trump's campaign coordinated with the Russians. He also is investigating possible obstruction of justice by Trump.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump avoided directly answering when asked whether he currently is or has ever worked for Russia after a published report said law enforcement officials, concerned about his behavior after he fired FBI Director James Comey in 2017, had begun investigating that possibility.

Trump said it was the "most insulting" question he'd ever been asked.

The New York Times report Friday cited unnamed former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.

Trump responded to the story Saturday during a telephone interview broadcast on Fox News Channel after host Jeanine Pirro, a personal friend, asked the Russia question.

"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked," Trump said. "I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing."

Trump never answered Pirro directly, but went on to assert that no president has taken a harder stance against Russia than he has.

"If you ask the folks in Russia, I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else, any other ... probably any other president, period, but certainly the last three or four presidents."

Trump's claim was disputed by Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. He said almost all the sanctions on Russia arose not in the White House but in Congress, due to concerns by members of both parties about Moscow's actions. Warner accused the White House of being very slow to put in place the penalties.

The Times reported that FBI agents and some top officials became suspicious of Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign but didn't open an investigation at that time because they weren't sure how to approach such a sensitive probe.

Trump's behavior in the days around Comey's May 2017 firing helped trigger the counterintelligence part of the probe, according to the newspaper.

In the inquiry, counterintelligence investigators sought to evaluate whether Trump was a potential threat to national security. They also sought to determine whether Trump was deliberately working for Russia or had unintentionally been influenced by Moscow.

Trump tweeted early Saturday that the report showed that the FBI leadership "opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof" after he had fired Comey.

Robert Mueller took over the investigation when he was appointed special counsel soon after Comey's firing. The overall investigation is looking into Russian election interference and whether Trump's campaign coordinated with the Russians, as well as possible obstruction of justice by Trump. The Times says it's unclear whether Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence angle.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said the report "may well suggest what it was that helped start this investigation in the first place." He and other Democratic senators said this report and others within the past week questioning Trump's behavior toward Russia give new urgency to the need for the Mueller investigation to be allowed to run its course.

A new report in The Washington Post said Trump went to extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin even from high-ranking officials in his own administration. The report cited unnamed current and former U.S. officials.

In the Fox News interview, Trump questioned why the newspaper made such a "big deal" out of his discussions with Putin in Helsinki last summer. "Anybody could have listened to that meeting, that meeting is up for grabs."

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., defended the president, who he said was "burned earlier by leaks of other private conversations."

Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the Times he had no knowledge of the counterintelligence inquiry but said that since it was opened a year and a half ago and they hadn't heard anything, apparently "they found nothing."

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is close to Trump and chairs the Judiciary Committee, said he intends to ask the FBI director if there was a counterintelligence investigation into the president. "If this really did happen, Congress needs to know about it and what I want to do is make sure how could the FBI do that?"

Trump has repeatedly and vociferously denied collusion with the Russians.

Also Sunday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he will force a vote in the coming days on the Treasury Department's decision to ease sanctions on three companies connected to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week defended the decision, saying the companies are undergoing a major restructuring to "sever Deripaska's control and significantly diminish his ownership." He saids Deripaska himself and any companies he controls remain under sanctions.

Schumer, however, contends the Russian oligarch maintains significant influence on these companies, including the aluminum manufacturing giant Rusal, and said it's important the sanctions remain in place while Mueller's investigation proceeds. Deripaska has figured into the investigation due to his ties to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Warner predicted some Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate would join Democrats in voting to override the removal of these sanctions.

Warner and Johnson spoke on CNN's "State of the Union," while Coons and Graham appeared on "Fox News Sunday."

Top House Democrats Issue Stern Warning to Trump Over His Comments on Cohen

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Three newly empowered Democratic House committee chairmen, alarmed by statements over the weekend by President Trump about his former lawyer's planned testimony before Congress, cautioned on Sunday that any effort to discourage or influence a witness's testimony could be construed as a crime.
The warning, a stark and unusual message from some of Congress's most influential Democrats, underscores the increasing legal and political peril facing Mr. Trump. Democrats are beginning their own investigations of him as the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, appears to move toward a conclusion in his investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia and potential obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump.
In a Fox News interview on Saturday night, Mr. Trump accused the former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, of lying about him to win leniency from federal prosecutors and spoke cryptically of the existence of damaging information against Mr. Cohen's father-in-law. Mr. Cohen, who has been sentenced to three years in prison, has accused Mr. Trump of directing him to make illegal hush payments during the campaign.
"Our nation's laws prohibit efforts to discourage, intimidate or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress," the chairmen wrote. "The president should make no statement or take any action to obstruct Congress's independent oversight and investigative efforts, including by seeking to discourage any witness from testifying in response to a duly authorized request from Congress."
The message seemed to imply that if Democrats in the House were to ever try to build an impeachment case against Mr. Trump, attempts to interfere with their work could be used as evidence.
One of the chairmen who signed the letter, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who leads the Oversight and Reform Committee, announced last week that Mr. Cohen would testify publicly for the first time next month about his work on behalf of Mr. Trump. The hearing promises to be a blockbuster session that could further erode Mr. Trump's public image and clarify the extent of his legal exposure.
In August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to tax fraud, making false statements to a bank and a campaign finance violation. He later pleaded guilty to an additional charge of lying to Congress about how long negotiations for a Trump Tower project in Moscow went on in 2016. He acknowledged that Mr. Trump's associates pursued the project well into 2016, as the Kremlin was escalating its efforts to interfere in the American election on his behalf.
In court, he said Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to stop them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with him. He worked closely alongside Mr. Trump during his time as a businessman and candidate, and has spent more than 70 hours with federal prosecutors in Manhattan as well as with Mr. Mueller's team.
As Mr. Trump's attacks on him have intensified, Mr. Cohen has told friends that he is worried for his safety, though no public evidence of any such threats has emerged.
Mr. Trump's comments about Mr. Cohen on Saturday, made during a friendly interview with Jeanine Pirro of Fox News, were his first extended remarks on the matter since Mr. Cohen's congressional testimony was announced. Asked by Ms. Pirro if he was "worried" about the testimony, Mr. Trump called Mr. Cohen "weak" and asserted -- in contradiction to filings by federal prosecutors in Manhattan -- that Mr. Cohen had "no information" on him.
"He's in trouble on some loans and fraud and taxicabs and stuff that I know nothing about," Mr. Trump said. "And in order to get his sentence reduced, he says, I have an idea, I'll tell -- I'll give you some information on the president."
Mr. Trump then implied that Mr. Cohen ought to be sharing information instead on his father-in-law, whose name he said he did not know.
"But he should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that's the one that people want to look at," he said, adding, "That's the money in the family." Pressed by Ms. Pirro for more details, Mr. Trump said, "I don't know, but you'll find out, and you'll look into it because nobody knows what's going on over there."
Mr. Cohen's father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, emigrated from Ukraine in 1975. The year before his daughter's marriage to Mr. Cohen, he pleaded guilty to evading federal reporting requirements for large cash transactions, admitting that he had cashed $5.5 million worth of checks to evade disclosure laws. He was sentenced to probation after cooperating with prosecutors in a related case.
Saturday was not the first time Mr. Trump has targeted Mr. Cohen's family. After Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to his crimes, the president said Mr. Cohen had done so only to save his wife and his father-in-law.
As they prepared to indict him, prosecutors had signaled to Mr. Cohen that his wife could be implicated, since she had also signed his tax returns. That threat helped push Mr. Cohen to plead guilty to the charges, according to a person familiar with the events.
Prosecutors have made no move toward his wife since Mr. Cohen's guilty plea in August.
The statement from the three chairmen was also signed by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman. Both men are investigating the president for various reasons, and Mr. Nadler's committee would be the body to weigh a possible impeachment.
Mr. Nadler has said he will wait for Mr. Mueller to complete his work before seriously considering impeachment, but he told The New York Times last month that the campaign finance fraud laid out by prosecutors in New York was likely to meet the criteria for an impeachable offense and warranted congressional investigation.
He has also issued repeated warnings about Mr. Trump's attacks on federal law enforcement officials, including Mr. Mueller.
In 1974, the Judiciary Committee included obstruction of congressional investigations and proceedings among a litany of offenses for which it voted to impeach President Richard M. Nixon. He resigned from office before the full House voted on the impeachment articles.

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President. "
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop. " The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and the New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.

“I think it’s the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked,” he said. “I think it’s the most insulting article I’ve ever had written, and if you read the article you’ll see that they found absolutely nothing. ”
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.

Texto completo: Border-wall debate
Earl Crittenden Jr.,chair, OnePulse Foundation: Can the president declare a national emergency as a way to build his border wall? Published expert legal opinions are surprisingly all over the map and from unexpected sources. For example, The New York Times has said yes, he can. And Fox News has said no, he can't. But little has been focused on the reality that well over a third of the land needed is privately owned and the eminent-domain power would be necessary, and surely unpopular, to invoke. (Texas landowners have already made that clear.) For what it's worth, note that it took 15 years for the army to seize land by eminent domain for the Truman Dam.
DeSantis and environment
John L. Evans Jr.,consulting unit chief for a global investment firm; former congressional staffer: Catchers are pugnacious, as all baseball and softball players know. Our new governor played the position, and as demonstrated this past week in the inaugural buzz, Ron DeSantis will be indefatigable in executing conservative policy. Said differently, this is no Charlie Crist. One interesting and welcome subplot for many conservatives: Will he really be a Teddy Roosevelt pro-environment Republican? Red tide must be reckoned with. Scientists suggest this is a deep, protracted problem ... Time will tell if the right guy is behind the plate.
March for Life
Francisco Gonzalez, philanthropy director, National Review Institute: If you're reading this, you're a survivor. You made it out of your mother's womb alive. In 2017, there were 68,935 fetuses in Florida (and nearly 1 million nationwide) who were not so lucky. To bring light to this great injustice, hundreds of thousands of Americans will congregate this week in Washington, D.C., for the 45th annual March for Life. While there are many lives to mourn, the good news is these annual numbers are in decline, mostly thanks to technology providing further awareness, through sonograms, that life begins far before we detach from that umbilical cord.
Helping on MLK Day
Anna McPherson,past president, Junior League of Greater Orlando: As Martin Luther King Day approaches on Jan. 21, now's the time to consider participating in the "Great Day of Service." Since the assassination of Dr. King, as a society we have made great strides toward the dream where "people are not judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character," but we still have much more work to do. In our politically charged environment, Martin Luther King Day gives us a moment to stop, reflect and serve our communities together. Consider marking the day by participating in an act of service. Check out www.Orlando.gov/initiatives/mlk for more information.
Talent is priority, concern
Pamela Nabors,president/CEO, CareerSource Central Florida: January brings out the economists, as we look ahead to a year full of economic opportunities ... and challenges. UCF and the Florida Chamber Foundation are hosting events this month that will be all about - guess what - talent! The Chamber's 2019 Economic Outlook Summit takes place Monday in Lake Nona Medical City. Florida's 2.5 million small businesses comprise 99.8 percent of businesses in the state, and employ 3.3 million workers. That makes talent - and talent acquisition - a top priority ... and concern. This statewide summit gives Central Florida an opportunity to chime in on emerging regional issues and contribute solutions to populate the talent pool.
'Hamilton' on the way
Brendan O'Connor, editor in chief, Bungalower.com: "Hamilton" is coming to Dr. Phillips, as you know if you have annoying friends like I do who happened to get tickets. Not everyone got tickets, Deborah, I'm happy for you, but keep it to yourself. Stay off Facebook next week if you don't want to hear about it. Huge win for Dr. Phillips Performing Arts Center, though, who have been on a roll with their blockbuster programming.
Collaboration key to innovation
Ed Schons,president, Florida High Tech Corridor Council: Those who have mastered the art of working smarter understand the importance of finding someone who has already solved a problem before tackling the challenge alone. This rings true among leaders in our technology industry who know better than most that collaboration is key to unlocking innovation. Indeed, two events, Otronicon and the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy's Press Play, will foster the sharing of knowledge among Orlando's top companies and institutions to spark innovation and inspire future generations. Surely, by the end, a seed will have been planted for the next big idea to emerge from our region.

Texto completo: The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Iowa Republican congressman Steve King says he's not a racist, but he faced intensifying criticism Friday over his remarks about white supremacy, including from a black GOP senator who said such comments are a blight on the nation and the party.
For the second time in two days, King insisted that he is an advocate for "Western civilization," not white supremacy or white nationalism. But he didn't deny remarks published a day earlier in The New York Times in which he was quoted saying: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?"
Within hours Thursday, the House's top three Republicans condemned his remarks, and on Friday, GOP Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, published his disapproval in an op-ed column.
King, who has denied being racist, appeared on the House floor after most lawmakers had left town.
"One phrase in that long article has created an unnecessary controversy. That was my mistake," King told his colleagues. King said terms describing bigotry, such as racism, are unfairly applied to "otherwise innocent" people.
King, in his ninth House term, spoke as key members of his party publicly took issue with his remarks and as a Republican from back home lined up to challenge him in a GOP primary.
Scott, who is black, cast King's remarks and those like them as a blemish on the country and the Republican Party, which has long had a frosty relationship with black voters.
"When people with opinions similar to King's open their mouths, they damage not only the Republican Party and the conservative brand but also our nation as a whole," Scott wrote.
King's views, Scott added, are separate from the conservative movement and "should be ridiculed at every turn possible."
"Some in our party wonder why Republicans are constantly accused of racism - it is because of our silence when things like this are said," Scott wrote.
In fact, House Republican leaders swiftly condemned King's remarks as racist. And on Wednesday, King drew a 2020 primary challenger: Randy Feenstra, a GOP state senator.
But King's position in the GOP had been imperiled even before then.
In 2017, he tweeted: "We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies." Then he doubled down on CNN, telling the network, "I'd like to see an America that's just so homogeneous that we look a lot the same."
Shortly before the 2018 midterm elections, in which King was running, Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, then the head of the GOP campaign committee, issued an extraordinary public denunciation of him.
King on Friday suggested he's been misunderstood. He said the foundation of the Times interview was partly a Sept. 12 tweet in which he wrote: "'Nazi' is injected into Leftist talking points because the worn out & exhausted "racist" is over used & applied to everyone who lacks melanin & who fail to virtue signal at the requisite frequency & decibels. But...Nazis were socialists & Leftists are socialists."
On Friday, King said on the House floor that the interview "also was discussion of other terms that have been used, almost always unjustly labeling otherwise innocent people. The word racist, the word Nazi, the word fascist, the phrase white nationalists, the phrase white supremacists."
King said he was only wondering aloud: "How did that offensive language get injected into our political dialogue? Who does that, how does it get done, how do they get by with laying labels like this on people?"

Texto completo: Two decades into his tenure running Raytheon Co., Thomas L. Phillips paid a visit to a class of business graduate students at Suffolk University and offered uncommon advice.
Mr. Phillips, who was 94 when he died Wednesday in his Weston home, told the aspiring MBAs that he would never reprimand an employee in front of others “because the dignity of the individual must be preserved."
To run a good company, he added, trust and integrity are essential.
An unusual figure among the executives who transformed Route 128 into a premier technology corridor, Mr. Phillips was 40 when he became Raytheon's president in 1964.
“It was under Tom's vision and leadership that Raytheon grew into a global defense technology leader — a legacy we continue to build upon to this day," Thomas A. Kennedy, Raytheon's current chairman and CEO, said in a statement. “Tom was a link to Raytheon's past and future."
An electrical engineer by training, Mr. Phillips helped turn Raytheon into a billion-dollar business, then a multibillion-dollar enterprise.
And he did so with what Wall Street analysts called a gentlemanly style. More precisely, Mr. Phillips was a CEO grounded in his Christian faith.
A few years into leading Raytheon, he “attended a Billy Graham crusade in New York City and responded to the call," Mr. Phillips recalled in an interview posted on a website of Gordon College, on whose Board of Trustees he served for many years.
“I knew it was all different from that point on," he added. “I walked out into New York City and it was raining slightly and everything was beautiful. It was just an amazing experience."
Mr. Phillips paired his approach to leadership with a professionalism rooted in Raytheon's mission. Before arriving at the company, he had graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute with a bachelor's degree and a master's in electrical engineering.
He joined Raytheon in 1948, the year Charles Francis Adams became the company's president. Adams later served as board chairman during the early years Mr. Phillips was president.
Rising steadily and quickly, Mr. Phillips became manager of the missile systems department five years after arriving. He was named a vice president in 1960, general manager of the missile and space division early the following year, and executive vice president by the close of 1961. Three years later, he was president. He was named CEO in 1968, became chairman in 1975, and retired in 1991.
While Mr. Phillips was CEO, Raytheon “developed the Patriot missile defense system, navigational computers used on the Apollo lunar missions, the Cobra Dane early warning radar installation, and the Standard Missile franchise," Kennedy said. “Tom Phillips's business acumen grew Raytheon's revenue 18-fold during his tenure."
Diversification was a hallmark of his leadership. Though Raytheon's post-World War II reputation and success were closely linked to its missiles, Mr. Phillips and Adams believed the company would need other revenue if military spending tapered off. As a hedge against that possibility, Raytheon acquired companies in the engineering and publishing fields.
In some ways, the two were an unlikely pair to guide Raytheon's success. Adams was the great-great-great-grandson of President John Adams. Born to Greek parents, Mr. Phillips had arrived in Boston as an immigrant, via Canada, with an Anglicized name.
In 1985, Adams told the Globe that Mr. Phillips was “a man with a first-class mind and first-class character."
Among those whose lives Mr. Phillips changed was his friend Charles Colson, who had been special counsel to President Richard M. Nixon and who served a prison term for his role in the Watergate scandal. Inspired by Mr. Phillips's faith, Colson became an evangelical Christian and founded the Prison Fellowship, a now-international outreach organization for inmates, former prisoners, and their families.
“He led me to Christ," Colson said of Mr. Phillips in a 1976 interview with The New York Times. “What had happened in his life became a model in my own."
Amid the Watergate investigation, Colson visited Mr. Phillips in Weston in 1973. Mr. Phillips read aloud to him from the Bible and “Mere Christianity," by C.S. Lewis, “and out on my driveway, right there, he committed his life to Christ," Mr. Phillips recalled in the interview for Gordon College.
Though Mr. Phillips was somewhat private about his faith, Colson was more open and recounted that encounter in “Born Again," a memoir. “As a result of Chuck's book 'Born Again,' I was out of the closet as a Christian for everybody to see at Raytheon," Mr. Phillips said in the Gordon College interview, “and it worked out just fine."
The younger of two siblings, Thomas Leonard Phillips was born in Istanbul to Greek parents, Andromache and Leonidas. He was a boy when his father died and moved with his mother and sister first to Athens, then Paris, and eventually to Canada.
Mr. Phillips was told by his mother and sister that he was born in 1924, though Canadian immigration records suggest he was a year older. He always used 1924 as his birth year.
“My father was very stoic and strong," said his son, Tom of New York City. “He always said he got a lot of breaks along the way."
According to a family story, Mr. Phillips sold newspapers as a young boy in Canada to help his family's finances. He didn't understand why the tips were large and numerous on one particular day until his boss explained that it was Christmas.
When Mr. Phillips was 12, his mother married a widower and they moved to Mission Hill to become a blended family of seven children. Excelling at Boston Latin School, Mr. Phillips started his college studies at Northeastern University, where he played football and basketball.
At a dance, he met Gertrude Van Iderstine, a Wheelock College student, and they married in 1944. Drafted into the military, he left Northeastern and was stationed in Virginia, where he began taking classes at Virginia Tech while still serving in the Army.
After graduate school, Mr. Phillips was about to launch a teaching career when, on the advice of a Boston friend, he inquired about working for Raytheon. He was hired and stayed there his entire career.
To encourage other business leaders to think about ethical questions, Mr. Phillips founded First Tuesday, a group that met for breakfast once a month. Among those who attended over the years were Kenneth Olsen, who cofounded Digital Equipment Corp., and Governor Edward King.
Mr. Phillips also served on many boards, including those for Digital, John Hancock, and Knight Ridder, and he endowed a scholarship fund in his family's name at Boston Latin.
Despite his many business commitments, “he would say, 'Put family first' — that family was ahead of anything professional," his son said. “And he would repeat that throughout his life"
In addition to his son, Tom, Mr. Phillips leaves three daughters, Patty Fraser of Concord, Bobbie Suratt of Wellesley, and Debbie of Rye, N.Y.; 11 grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.
A funeral service will be held at 2 p.m. Jan. 20 in Trinitarian Congregational Church in Wayland.
Mr. Phillips was so committed to his faith that he carefully considered the potential use of weapons Raytheon manufactured. “If I thought we were providing provocative or offensive arms then I would feel at an impasse as a Christian," he told the Times in 1976.
Ultimately, he believed defensive weapons were necessary in “an imperfect world," he told the Globe in 1985.
“We would like it to be a world where armies and weapons were not necessary," he added, but people are “flawed, I believe. And nations are flawed. We have to provide for a common defense just as a city must protect its citizens with a police force."

King speaks on House floor about Times quote

Texto completo: Rep. Steve King addressed the controversy surrounding his statements about white nationalism and white supremacy in a New York Times article on the U.S. House floor Friday.
Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, yielded his time to the Iowa Republican as the House debated the southern border wall funding impasse. King used the time to say he "made a freshman mistake" talking with a New York Times reporter without recording the interview.
"But one phrase in that long article has created an unnecessary controversy," King said. "That was my mistake."
The quote that King said sparked "heartburn" appeared in the article published Thursday about King's role in the U.S.-Mexico border wall discussion and President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" King told the Times reporter. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
On the House floor, King said the quote was taken out of context. King argued he was saying terms like white supremacist, white nationalist and Nazi were "almost always unjustly labeling otherwise innocent people."
"It was about how those words got plugged into our dialogue, not when the words became offensive, which is what the technical interpretation of it is," King said. "It's how did that offensive language get injected into our political dialogue."
The 4th District representative also issued a news release Thursday denouncing white nationalism and white supremacy.
However, that has not stopped the barrage of condemnations from Republicans and others over the controversial quote.
King wasn't told by Republican leadership that they were condemning his comments, according to a reporter for The Hill, but he also hasn't received signals that further punishment is coming.
Fellow conservatives have been condemning King for months, even prior to the 2018 midterm election where King narrowly beat Democrat challenger J.D. Scholten.
Last October, U.S. Rep. Steve Stivers, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, disavowed King in a statement on Twitter. Three major U.S. companies also announced they will no longer donate campaign money to King.
Now, King faces two primary challengers, Iowa Sen. Randy Feenstra and Bret Richards.

Texto completo: Tennis is well known as the "Sport for a Lifetime" and medical science reveals why. For those making New Year's resolutions, tennis burns a lot of calories and is an excellent form of exercise. In fact, competitive tennis burns more calories than aerobics, inline skating, or cycling. A typical singles player burns 300 to 660 calories an hour playing recreationally. Doubles players burn from 200 - 460 calories an hour.
Tennis is a active sport with short bursts of intense activity during a point followed by a brief period of rest. Since this kind of interval training occurs naturally in tennis, the body's muscles have to use oxygen more efficiently and to burn more calories than constant motion exercising.
In September, Gretchen Reynolds wrote in the New York Times about a new epidemiological study of Danish men and women that concluded that playing tennis could add years to one's life. The study found that adults who participated often in tennis and other team sports lived longer than sedentary people. They also lived longer than people who practice such solitary sports as jogging, swimming and cycling.
The Copenhagen City Heart Study, published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, confirmed other studies that have noticed a beneficial effect from social sports. No one doubts that exercise contributes to health and longevity. It appears that the social benefits of tennis are a bonus. As Dr. James O'Keefe, a study co-author, said, "Raising your heart rate is important, but it looks like connecting with other people is, too."
The study compared the life spans of 8,600 Danish adults over 25 years. All but a 1,000 of them were exercisers. The researchers found that tennis players had the biggest gains in life expectancy over sedentary people, adding 9.7 years to their lives. This was followed by badminton (6.7 years), cycling (3.7 years), swimming (3.4 years), jogging (3.2 years) and low-intensity calisthenics (3.1 years). Health club workouts with treadmills or weights added just 1.5 years.
According to Dr. Jim Gavin, who wrote the "The Exercise Habit", tennis is better than most other sports in developing positive personality characteristics such as teamwork, friendship, and competitiveness. Meanwhile, Dr. Joan Finn at the Southern Connecticut State University found that tennis players also ranked higher in vigor, optimism and self-esteem and reported less depression, anger, and anxiety. Scientists have also found that tennis can promote a lifetime of brain development because tennis requires alertness and tactical thinking. Emotionally, tennis contributes to personal discipline, good sportsmanship, and resiliency.
COACHES CLINIC: The USTA Mid-Atlantic Section will sponsor a High School Coaches Workshop on Feb. 3 at the Junior Tennis Champions Center in College Park from 9:30 am to 3:00 pm.

STEYER WON'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020

Texto completo: San Francisco Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer won't run for president in 2020 and will instead invest $40 million more in his campaign to impeach President Trump, his political organization said Wednesday.
The billionaire environmental activist and former hedge fund chief, who had mulled a presidential bid and went as far in recent weeks as conducting polling and choosing campaign staff, announced his decision at an anti-climactic speech in Des Moines, shortly after the New York Times reported his plans.
"Most people come to Iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president," Steyer said. "But I am proud to be here to announce that I will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president."
Steyer has already invested millions of dollars over the last year and a half in his ad campaign calling for impeachment, making the case in slickly produced commercials that usually featured him talking into the camera. He also was one of the party's top donors during the 2018 midterms, backing Congressional candidates and funding voter outreach efforts that helped Democrats retake the House.
More recently, he's visited other early primary states to campaign against Trump's policies. His political organization also posted job listings for "state directors."
His organization said Steyer will continue airing national TV ads in 2019 and also target organizing efforts in the districts of House Democratic committee chairs, including Southern California Reps. Maxine Waters and Adam Schiff. He'll also hold an "impeachment summit" with supporters in D.C. this month.
Steyer barely made a blip in the early polls of the 2020 Democratic primary, which could have a vast field of more than 20 contenders. But his considerable for tune with a net worth pegged by Forbes at about $1.6 billion would have made him an important player if he had decided to invest heavily in his own presidential bid.
Still, a Steyer run may not have appealed to Democratic activists focused on getting big money out of politics. In a clear shot at Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who's also considering a bid, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts argued this month that voters should reject "billionaires" funding their own campaigns. And the qualifications for the party's primary debates are expected to include measures of grassroots fundraising.
Steyer's decision ends only his latest political will-he-or-won't-he act: he previously mulled bids for U.S. Senate and California governor in 2016 and 2018 before deciding not to run for either.
Other potential California contenders for the White House include Sen. Kamala Harris, who's embarking a national book tour this week, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and East Bay congressman Eric Swalwell.
Sue Caro, a California Republican Party vice-chair in Oakland, said Steyer spending big on an impeachment campaign amounted to a waste of his money. "As long as the Republicans are in charge of the Senate, it's not going to happen," Caro said.
But she acknowledged that Steyer's millions had been effective in boosting Democrats during 2018 congressional races, when "he really creamed us in Orange County."
"I wish he could decide to go retire on some island," she said.

Oscar glory for ‘Black Panther’? Centerville grad who worked on film featured in the New York Times

Texto completo: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told CNN on Wednesday night that he did not know about sexual harassment and pay disparity allegations during his 2016 presidential campaign.
Allegations from multiple women who worked on Sanders' campaign surfaced Wednesday in the New York Times. Former supporters told the Times that Sanders' campaign did not adequately address incidents of sexual harassment, sexist mistreatment and pay disparities between men and women.
On CNN, Sanders apologized to "any woman who feels like she was not treated appropriately. " When asked if he had been aware of the complaints, Sanders said, "I was little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case (to be elected as president). "
The allegations and his perceived failure to rectify the issues, female campaign workers told the Times, bring into question whether he can fight for women's interests if he again seeks the presidency.
"I am not going to sit here and tell you that we did everything right in terms of human resources, in terms of addressing the needs that I'm hearing from now, that women felt they were disrespected, that there was sexual harassment which was not dealt with as effectively as possible," Sanders said on CNN.

He told CNN his campaign would do better if he pursues a 2020 presidential nomination. His 2018 Senate re-election campaign, he added, established new protocols for handling sexual harassment allegations.
"We put forward the strongest set of principles in terms of mandatory training, in terms of women, if they felt harassed, having an independent firm that they can go to," Sanders said. "And I think that that's kind of the gold standard of what we should be doing. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Watchdog seeks faster notice of lawmaker trips

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO >> A consumer advocacy group is calling for California lawmakers to immediately disclose their trips to educational events with lobbyists following a report that a dozen legislators were attending an event in Hawaii with utility lobbyists while deadly wildfires raged in California.
The demand Wednesday by Los Angeles-based Consumer Watchdog looks to ensure the public would know about such trips before they occur. Lawmakers currently must report once a year gifts they receive worth $50 or more, including travel accommodations, on their annual financial disclosure forms.
"These junkets should not occur," said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. "But if they do occur, they should be disclosed in real time."
He wants the Legislature to change its own rules so lawmakers must post their plans online once they accept an invitation for a trip funded by another organization, along with the names of lobbyists expected to attend and the organizations employing them.
Consumer Watchdog made its demand after the New York Times reported that a dozen lawmakers were attending an event in Hawaii with utility lobbyists while deadly wildfires raged in California last November. The summit at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort on Maui was organized by the Independent Voter Project, an organization co-founded by a former state lawmaker to bring together legislators and executives, and cost $8,000 per person, according to the Times.
The event included officials from Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy, the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric, two of the state's big three utilities. According to the Times, officials from Pacific Gas & Electric planned to attend but backed out after the start of the Camp Fire, which began near the time and place that PG&E reported an irregularity with a transmission line.
Lizelda Lopez, a spokeswoman for Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, said the Senate leader's office is looking into the request. A spokesman for Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, Kevin Liao, said no decisions have been made. Atkins and Rendon are both Democrats.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry.
She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: According to the FBI, about 25 to 35 armored trucks and drivers are robbed each year, compared with about 4,000 banks. Banks are hit more often because criminals know that armored car robberies are far more dangerous ...
The armored car driver who disappeared last month, reportedly with $850,000, has been charged with theft and awards totaling $60,000 have been offered for information leading to his arrest, Louisville police and the FBI announced Wednesday.
The disclosure came a few hours after the Courier Journal reported Mark Espinosa, 29, was let go by GardaWorld within five days of his disappearance Dec. 5 from Jefferson Mall.
Authorities had previously declined to say if he was a victim of a theft or the perpetrator.
But Wednesday the FBI said its joint investigation with police determined Espinosa was "directly involved in the theft."
Louisville Metro Police Lt. Steve Kaufling told reporters that Espinosa is "armed and dangerous" and has ties to the Northeast along with family members on the West Coast and in Texas and Florida. The FBI is offering $10,000 for information leading to his arrest, while GardaWorld is offering $50,000. Anyone with information is asked to call the FBI at 502-263-6000.
The Montreal-based armored car company told a city licensing agency in a Dec. 10 email that Espinosa was no longer an employee.
Branch manager Lu Lopez, who wrote the email, declined to tell the Courier Journal why Espinosa was let go, or whether that shows the company concluded he was responsible for the theft.
Isabelle Panelli,a spokeswoman for GardaWorld, said the company doesn't comment on personnel matters.
Kaufling on Wednesday declined to say how much was taken from the armored car, but James Grimes, the owner of the Radcliff-based Gun School, which provides training for armed guards, told the Courier Journal he was told the amount lost was $850,000.
In a 911 call about the theft, a police dispatcher mentions that a second Garda employee returned from making a drop in the mall to find Espinosa's gun on the seat.
Grimes said that could mean Espinosa was headed for the airport and knew he couldn't take his gun through security.
If the $850,000 was evenly split among $1, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills, it would have weighed about 60 pounds, according to the Courier Journal's calculations. The cash would fit in a pair of large duffel bags.
Jim McGuffey, a security consultant and 26-year veteran of the armored car industry, said a commercial jet getaway is plausible.
"The larger the bills, the less it would weigh," McGuffey said.
Kaufling said investigators have several theories about how Espinosa made his getaway but wouldn't comment on them.
The only previous blemishes on his record were speeding tickets. Family members declined comment and referred questions to the police, although Kaufling said there were cooperating with the investigation.
Espinosa lived with his father in a modest brick home in Pleasure Ridge Park purchased in 2014 for $46,703. He also has had an address in New Britain, Connecticut, records show.
GardaWorld declined to say how much Espinosa was paid or when he started, but according to the Indeed.com job website the average starting pay for Garda drivers is $12.46 an hour. City records show he was licensed as an armed guard in September.
Rare crime If Espinosa did take the money and run, he's joined a small fraternity of criminality.
Last year there were only 22 armored car robberies nationwide, according to Lowers Risk Group, based in Purcellville, Virginia. Two were in Kentucky.
On Sept. 28, two men ambushed an armored car guard in a shopping center in Newport and fled with $26,000 in cash.
According to the FBI, about 25 to 35 armored trucks and drivers are robbed each year, compared with about 4,000 banks.
Banks are hit more often because criminals know that armored car robberies are far more dangerous: Unarmed bank tellers are trained to fork over the cash with no questions asked. Armored car couriers are armed and trained to use deadly force —without waiting for the robber to shoot first.
After four of its trucks were robbed — and two guards shot — in Houston in 2013, Garda took the unusual step of talking tough publicly to potential robbers.
"We're letting the bad guys know we're going to defend ourselves," Robert Hatchett, the senior manager for GardaWorld's Texas operations, told the New York Times. "They can expect, in one way or another, to pay with physical injury, harm, possible death. They're going to pay for it with prosecution, and they're going to pay for it with restitution. We're not going to let it go."
Successful armored car robberies are also infrequent because the vehicles, which weigh up to 25,000 pounds and are made of hardened steel with bullet-resistant windows, are tough to crack.
Tough, but not impossible.
Just last week near Bari, Italy, about 280 miles southeast of Rome, a brazen group of submachine-gun-toting robbers used bulldozers and giant diggers to pry open an armored car and make off with the equivalent of $2.3 million.
Perhaps because armored cars are rolling safes that may carry millions of dollars, thefts from them have captured the public imagination since the first one, in 1927, when the Flathead Gang dynamited a truck 7 miles outside of Pittsburgh and made off with $100,000 in cash, the equivalent of $1.4 million today.
Such heists have been dramatized in movies, including the critically acclaimed but unimaginatively titled "Armored Car Robbery" in 1950.
That same year, in real life, nine armed thieves set the U.S. record for a cash robbery when they took $2.7 million from a Brink's depot in Boston.
They nearly got away with it, but six years later — just five days before the statute of limitation would have expired — one of the robbers, Joseph "Specs" O'Keefe, turned on the rest and testified for the government.
Successful armored car robberies are notoriously difficult because they usually happen in broad daylight in public places and often require a team of professionals. Many are amateurish jobs, like the one in 2016 at a Rite Aid Pharmacy at 4000 Taylorsville Road, in which Royten Beaudoin, 35, told a courier he had a gun and demanded money. The courier refused, and police arrested Beaudoin while he was trying to break into the armored car. He pleaded guilty to robbery.
But some more sophisticated criminals, who planned for months or even years, have pulled off armored car heists without paying the price.
Roberto Solis, who killed an armored car driver in a 1969 heist and spent 24 years in prison writing critically acclaimed poems and plotting his next crime.
In 1993, Solis had his 21-year-old girlfriend, Heather Tallchief, take a job with Loomis Armored Car in Las Vegas. Two month later, on Oct. 21, 1993, she simply drove off with about $3 million while couriers were re-stocking ATMs at the Circus Circus Casino. The truck was found weeks later in a rented storage space, some of the money still in it.
But with Tallchief disguised as an old woman and Solis pushing her in a wheelchair, the couple boarded a chartered jet and flew to Denver. The pilot told authorities they had a couple of large packages with them. Eventually, they went into hiding in Amsterdam.
In 2005, after a low-key life as a single mother and maid in Holland, Tallchief returned to the U.S. and surrendered. She told authorities she left Solis years earlier and had no idea where he was. She served six years in prison. Neither Solis nor the $2.5 million they took to Europe have ever been found. If he's still alive, he would be 73 years old.

Texto completo: NEENAH - But for the presence of a woman right in front of him in a New York courtroom, Gary Merkling was in direct line for a kiss blown by one of the biggest drug cartel kingpins the world has ever known.
The kiss blown last week by Joaquin Guzman Loera — that's El Chapo, to you and me — was intended for his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, but Merkling, a factory worker from Neenah, was right behind her, and close enough for collateral damage.
Merkling wasn't there for a kiss. Just a glimpse. Merkling is sort of a drug cartel kingpin fanboy, and with Pablo Escobar dead, El Chapo is the kingpinniest of them all.
That's why Merkling took two days off from his job at Sonoco paper mill in Neenah so he could jump on a plane, fly to New York City, rush over to the courthouse in Brooklyn before dawn to be sure of getting a good seat, then head home after hearing about four hours of testimony.
Joaquin Guzman Loera was part of what the New York Times has dubbed the Big Apple's latest attraction: narco-tourism. Forget the Empire State Building and the Christmas tree in the Rockefeller Center, reporter Alan Feuer proclaimed last week; the hot commodity is the El Chapo trial. Dozens of people have been traveling from all over the world to watch bits of the trial, Feuer wrote, including a French scholar, a pair of Lithuanian tourists, a retired Connecticut banker, and Merkling.
"The New York Times guy told me (that) in the first couple weeks of the trial, hundreds showed up, and they only let in 40," Merkling said.
Interest had dwindled after about a month's worth of testimony, so when Merkling went, he was one of about 50 people who showed up, and he was practically first in line. That got him the best seat in the house, right behind the press corps and then behind Mrs. Chapo.
"El Chapo was right there," Merkling said. "He was waving at his wife a lot and blowing kisses to her."
Merkling had been following the trial online as best as he could, Googling it every day, but he had no idea who or what he was going to see in court that day. It turned out to be one of El Chapo's Colombian supply guys. Alleged.
"They were asking him how they met, talking about drug routes, how he gifted El Chapo with a million-dollar helicopter," Merkling said. "He went into really in-depth details about smuggled drugs, how they chartered speedboats to go out on the ocean, and tuna-fishing boats. ... All behind-the-scenes stuff."
Testimony was all in Spanish but with an interpreter.
Outside the courtroom was interesting, too, Merkling said. Federal agents were walking around with bulletproof vests under their suit jackets. Merkling had to pass through two lines of security, give up his cellphone, and get up close and personal with drug dogs and sniffing machines. During one of the breaks, he looked out one of the windows of the eighth floor they were on and saw armed SWAT snipers on the roof of the adjoining building.
So what got Merkling so interested in El Chapo, anyway?
"I've always been fascinated," he said. "I had just heard of him when he broke out of prison, I forget, maybe the second time, or whatever, but I just started following him, looking up stuff about him. Once I saw his trial had started, I said it would be crazy to go to that, but I kept looking online to see if it was open to the public."
He was similarly fascinated with Pablo Escobar. A year ago last fall, he sprung for a week's vacation to go to Colombia and tour Escobar's estate.
"I just find it fascinating, the money, the crazy lifestyle," he said. "They say Pablo supplied like 80 percent of all the cocaine in the U.S. One man supplied that? The power and how crazy the money is. ... I've been interested in Escobar for a long time."
Merkling makes it kind of his lifestyle to take quick, random little trips all over, and it's not all about cocaine kingpins.
"I went to Dubai this September, me and a buddy, for a week. The week before I went to New York, I went to North Carolina to watch a Duke basketball game. In November, me and my girlfriend flew to Seattle for the Packer game, and just flew right back."
Otherwise, he works 60 to 70 hours a week, stockpiles his money, and, if something comes up, like a major cocaine conspiracy trial in New York, he can just go.
The New York trip would have cost him just a couple of hundred bucks for airfare, an Uber and room and board for a night, except for a two-day weather layover in Chicago on his way home.
"I had to rent a car, and it cost me $300, basically the cost of the whole trip otherwise," he said. "That sucked. It would have been a nice, cheap trip otherwise."
El Chapo's trial, which began in November, is expected to last several months.

Texto completo: Iran confirms it has jailed American vet Michael White
TEHRAN, Iran - Iran confirmed Wednesday it is holding U.S. Navy veteran Michael White at a prison in the country, making him the first American known to be detained during President Donald Trump's administration.
White's detention adds new pressure to the tension between Iran and the U.S., which under Trump has pursued a maximalist campaign against Tehran that includes pulling out of its nuclear deal with world powers.
Although the circumstances of White's detention remain unclear, Iran in the past has used its detention of Westerners and dual nationals as leverage in negotiations.
The semi-official Tasnim news agency, believed to be close to the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, reported the confirmation, citing Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi.
"An American citizen was arrested in the city of Mashhad some time ago and his case was conveyed to the U.S administration on the first days" of his incarceration, Ghasemi was quoted as saying.
The State Department said it was aware of reports of an American citizen's arrest, but was otherwise unable to comment.
White's mother, Joanne White, had told The New York Times that her 46-year-old son, who lives in Imperial Beach, Calif., went to Iran to see his girlfriend and had booked a July 27 flight back home to San Diego via the United Arab Emirates. She filed a missing person report with the State Department after he did not board the flight. She added that he had been undergoing treatment for a neck tumor and has asthma.

Comatose woman who had baby is hospitalized, police say
PHOENIX - An Arizona woman in a vegetative state who was sexually assaulted at a long-term care facility and had a baby is recovering at a hospital along with her child, authorities said Wednesday.
Commenting for the first time on the investigation since the Dec. 29 birth came to light, Phoenix police said finding a suspect is a top priority. Police are gathering DNA from all male employees at the facility.
Hacienda HealthCare owns the care facility and said it welcomed the DNA testing. Authorities served a search warrant Tuesday.
Local news website Azfamily.com first reported that the woman in a vegetative state for more than 10 years after a near-drowning had given birth to a boy.
It's unclear if staff members at the facility were aware of her pregnancy until the birth.

Republican senator signals interest in Trump's tax returns
WASHINGTON - Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley said he's examining his authority to obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns, a move to ensure he could see any forms his Democratic counterpart in the House potentially receives.
Grassley said he's planning to meet with nonpartisan congressional tax advisers to learn more about the process. Under a decades-old law, the heads of the tax-writing committees in Congress can request the tax returns of any taxpayer, including the president, from the Treasury Department.
Still, the Iowa Republican cautioned Wednesday that he hasn't yet made a decision about whether he would ask Treasury to release the documents. Trump refused to release his tax returns during the 2016 campaign.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and wife divorcing after 25 years
SEATTLE - Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, are divorcing, ending a 25-year marriage that played a role in the creation of an e-commerce company that made Bezos one of the world's wealthiest people.
The decision to divorce comes after a trial separation, according to a statement posted Wednesday on his Twitter account.
Left unanswered was how the assets amassed during the marriage will be divided.
Jeff Bezos' fortune hovers around $137 billion, according to estimates by Forbes and Bloomberg. Virtually all of that is tied up in the nearly 79 million shares of Amazon stock (currently worth about $130 billion) that he owns.
Because they married before Amazon was founded, it's likely that MacKenzie Bezos holds a large claim to that fortune.

Jury sees El Chapo texts sent to wife while on run
NEW YORK - Text messages exchanged between notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman and his wife while he was on the run in 2012 surfaced Wednesday at his U.S. trial, evidence the FBI says it uncovered with the help of a tech for the cartel who flipped on the kingpin.
The tech, Christian Rodriguez, also testified how Guzman was obsessed with spyware he had Rodriguez install on mobile phones he gave to members of his inner circle to keep an eye on them. The software churned out reports on phone activity that are being used against Guzman.
Also saved were text messages between Guzman and his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, in which they touched on logistics for drug smuggling and shared encouragement as he fled a raid by authorities on a mansion in Cabo San Lucas, Baja.

Feds: Former commander at Gitmo slowed death probe
WASHINGTON - A former commander of the Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was arrested Wednesday on charges that he interfered with the investigation into the death of a civilian with whom he fought after an argument over whether the officer had an affair with the man's wife.
Navy Capt. John Nettleton remains on active duty, but he was removed from command shortly after civilian Christopher Tur was found floating in January 2015 in the waters off the base on the southeastern coast of Cuba.
Nettleton denied to his superior officer and others that he had the affair, but investigators later determined that it had happened, according to a federal indictment.
Nettleton was commander of the base since June 2012, but not the prison where suspected terrorists are held.

In LA: The union representing teachers in the nation's second-largest school district postponed a strike until Monday because of the possibility of a court-ordered delay. United Teachers Los Angeles had said its 35,000 members would walk off the job Thursday if a deal wasn't reached on pay raises and smaller classes.

Seeking asylum: A Saudi woman who fled her family to Thailand, alleging abuse, moved a step closer Wednesday to her goal of gaining asylum in Australia after a U.N. agency granted her refugee status.
Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun's father denied physically abusing her or trying to force her into an arranged marriage.

Texto completo: Headnote Guest Commentary
We all have our favorite traditions, some that we've inherited from our families - others that have more to do with our willingness to comply with societal norms. One tradition common among those living in the Western Hemisphere that gets plenty of mileage during the first days of January remains making New Year's resolutions.
Simply put, it's a promise to us that for the new year we'll change undesired traits or behaviors, focus on accomplishing individual goals or generally working toward improving our lives.
Centuries ago, both the Babylonians and Romans began each year by making promises to their god(s). Later, medieval knights took a vow to reaffirm their commitment to chivalry at the start of each year. Today, many Christians prepare for the year ahead by praying and making resolutions while attending watch night services on New Year's Eve.
But successfully achieving these goals, as we all probably know, tends to be an annual effort in futility as recent studies indicate with 88 percent of those who set New Year's resolutions failing to achieve them - one-third failing to make it past the end of January according to the time management firm Franklin Covey.
The greater failure rates came from those who admitted they'd set unrealistic goals but not far behind were those who simply didn't keep track of their progress or who just forgot about it. Finally, there are those who make too many resolutions and realize that they've put themselves on an impossible quest.
Consider: A lot of these resolutions fail because they're not the right resolutions. And a resolution may be wrong for one of three main reasons: it's a resolution created based on what someone else (or society) is telling you to change; it's too vague; or you don't have a realistic plan for achieving your resolution.
One solution: make your goals SMART - an acronym coined in the journal Management Review in 1981 for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. It makes sense for managers, but it could be helpful in establishing and keeping your resolutions, too.
Specific. Your resolution should be absolutely clear. Instead of promising to lose weight, decide to lose 10 pounds in the next three months.
Measurable. Keep track of your progress, or lack thereof, in a journal or make notes on your phone or in an app designed to help you track behavior. You'll better be able to reinforce the progress, no matter what your resolution.
Achievable. Goals requiring a giant leap are good. But too big a step too fast can leave you frustrated and negatively impact other areas of your life.
Relevant. Is this a goal that really matters to you, and are you making it for the right reasons? Doing things because of self-hate, remorse or momentary passion will undoubtedly be difficult to maintain. But if you believe your new goals will improve your life, surround yourself with people who both agree with and will support your resolution.
Time-bound. Make sure your timeline allows you to reach your goal in a realistic span of time. Give yourself enough time to do it by including smaller, short-termed goals along your path.
"Focus on these small wins so you can make gradual progress," said Charles Duhigg, author of "The Power of Habit" and a former New York Times writer. "If you're building a habit, you're planning for the next decade, not the next few months."
Let's see how we all fare a few months from today. Break a leg!

Texto completo: The Associated Press
ANKARA, Turkey - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused the U.S. national security adviser of making "a very serious mistake" Tuesday by demanding that Ankara guarantee the safety of Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria before the U.S. withdraws its troops from the war-torn country.
A strained morning of negotiation in Turkey ended without assurances of protection for forces that fought alongside U.S. troops against the Islamic State group, and indeed brought them fresh new threats from Turkey. The diplomatic setback raised fresh questions about how the U.S. would protect its allies in the fight against IS and about the pace of the drawdown of U.S. forces in Syria.
"John Bolton has made a very serious mistake. We cannot make any concessions in this regard," Erdogan said Tuesday, just before Bolton left the country with tensions between the NATO allies at new highs. He added that Ankara's preparations for a new military offensive against what the Turkish leader describes as terror groups in Syria are "to a large extent" complete.
Bolton had insisted that Turkey refrain from conducting any operation unless it was approved by and coordinated with the U.S. Turkey's presidential spokesman fired back publicly that Turkey would not seek permission from its allies to conduct a military offensive against Syrian Kurdish fighters, but was willing to coordinate operations.
A senior administration official said Erdogan's comments did not reflect President Donald Trump's understanding of his Dec. 23 conversation with the Turkish leader, days after the U.S. president announced his intent to withdraw American troops from northeastern Syria. Trump "thought he got a commitment from Erdogan" to protect the Kurds, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to speak on the record.
An official at Tuesday's meeting between Bolton and senior Turkish officials said presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin stated that Erdogan committed that Turkey would not take offensive action while U.S. forces were there.
Bolton departed Turkey without meeting with Erdogan in an apparent snub by the Turks - the meeting had been expected for days. A spokesman for Bolton said U.S. officials were told Erdogan cited the local election season and a speech to parliament for not meeting with him.
In the more than two-hour meeting with Kalin, Bolton outlined five U.S. principles for the Syria drawdown, including that "the United States opposes any mistreatment of opposition forces who fought with us against ISIS."
In the high-stakes session in Ankara's presidential complex, Bolton also rebuked Erdogan's column in The New York Times, in which the Turkish leader restated his position that the Syrian Defense Forces were members of terrorist groups and criticized the U.S. air campaign against the Islamic State.
An official at the meeting said Bolton told Kalin that Erdogan's op-ed was "wrong and offensive."
The official added that the U.S. stuck by Trump's request that the Kurds who fought with the U.S. not be mistreated, and the Turks stuck by their position that the Kurds "are terrorist groups and they're free to go after them."
Trump abruptly announced last month he intended to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, and the U.S. has sent mixed signals over how soon that would be accomplished. Bolton's trip to the Mideast was aimed at assuring allies it would not be done precipitously.
But Kalin told reporters after talks with Bolton there is no slowdown in the timetable for U.S. withdrawal from Syria. He said U.S. officials have said during their discussions that the withdrawal could take place within "120 days."
Kalin said talks with Bolton focused on how the U.S. would collect the weapons that were given to Kurdish militia fighting Islamic States as well as the future of U.S. bases in Syria. He said he handed over two dossiers to Bolton - one on Turkish help to Kurdish populations in Iraq and Syria, the other on the Kurdish militias' "criminal activities and human rights violations."
A Bolton spokesman, Garrett Marquis, said in a statement that Bolton and Turkish officials "had a productive discussion of the President's decision to withdraw at a proper pace from Northeast Syria."
But Erdogan, for his part, said Bolton had "made a very serious mistake. Whoever thinks this way is also mistaken. We cannot make any concession in this regard and those involved in a terror corridor" in Syria would "receive the necessary punishment."
Trump's shifting timetable for pulling U.S. troops out of Syria has left allies and other players in the region confused and jockeying for influence over a withdrawal strategy that appeared to be a work in progress.
Trump faced widespread criticism that he was abandoning the Kurds in the face of Turkish threats. Officials said at the time that although many details of the withdrawal had not yet been finalized, they expected American forces to be out by mid-January.
After Bolton announced this week the U.S. pullout would not be as immediate as Trump had initially declared, U.S. allies were still seeking clarification from American diplomats.
Turkey insists its military actions are aimed at Kurdish fighters in Syria - the Syrian Kurdish Peoples Protection Units, or YPG - whom it regards as terrorists, and not against the Kurdish people. That has been Ankara longtime position and Turkey has rejected any role for Kurdish fighters in restoring peace to the war-torn region.
The Pentagon said Monday no U.S. troops have withdrawn from Syria yet but added that there is an "approved framework" for withdrawal.
Bolton maintained there is no fixed timetable for completing the drawdown, but insisted it was not an indefinite commitment to the region. Still, some 200 U.S. troops will remain in the vicinity of al-Tanf, in southern Syria, to counter growing Iranian activity in the region, he said.

Texto completo: Mason Moyle, who owns Keg & Cow in Cape Coral, was perfectly primed to launch his own restaurant.
The 26-year-old Michigan native started in restaurants right out of college when he moved to Madison, Wisconsin and began working for the corporate stores of Mr. Brews Taphouse, a burger and beer chain popular in lower and central Wisconsin.
"I worked my way through the company," Moyle said.
"I started as a cook then went from cook to server to bartender to corporate auditor. There really wasn't a whole lot I didn't do."
In 2016, the corporate owner of Mr. Brews Taphouse decided to launch a location in Cape Coral, and when Moyle was asked to open the restaurant, he jumped at the opportunity.
His previous experience with all the levels of Mr. Brews served him well.
"I like to be really hands-on," he said, "and I like to know how to do everything in the restaurant. If it's busy and the kitchen gets backed up, I'll hop on the line and crank out tickets. I like to be able to help everyone."
In late 2018, Moyle decided he wanted to change a few things in the format of his restaurant. After talks with the corporate headquarters of Mr. Brews, he decided to go out on his own and re-branded his restaurant as Keg & Cow.
"I still have a great relationship with Mr. Brews," Moyle said.
"We mutually agreed that I wanted to do my own thing by changing up the menu, and they were very receptive. It was a very mutual decision to both go our own ways."
The space inside Keg & Cow is much the same as it was under Mr. Brews, though a touch cozier, Moyle said. The most notable updates are to the menu.
"The menu change, that's the thing we were really excited about," said Moyle.
"Being able to play with the menu and to have a seasonal menu. We're still beer and burgers, but we were able to add a lot more salads and sandwiches, play around with appetizers and change up the desserts. We also added more house-made sauces."
On the new menu, one of the most popular items is the Bourbon Barrel Burger, which is drizzled with a root-beer bourbon mayonnaise made in-house.
"It's awesome," Moyle said. "My personal favorite."
Other popular dishes include the Cowlifornia Burger with pepper jack cheese, house-made guacamole and chipotle lime sauce, as well as the beer-battered onion rings, pretzels and cheese curds. The restaurant also has 48 beers on tap, with at least half dedicated to local beer, including Southwest Florida breweries such as Fort Myers Brewing, Palm City Brewing and Scotty's Bierwerks.
The new menu has gone over well, Moyle said, as has the shift to Keg & Cow.
"The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. It's been a really, really fun transition. We had two cool years as Mr. Brews, and now we get to fully do something new," Moyle said. "It's still a friendly place with a cozy atmosphere. We love talking to people about beer and sports, and we love serving great food."

Texto completo: Are doctors responsible for obesity? What about dentists, are they responsible for cavities? And why aren't the police responsible for crime?
But you tell me, the teacher is responsible for learning. I say, baloney.
I am a teacher and a good one. My wife and I combined have nearly a half-century of teaching experience — small schools, big schools, inner-city schools and rural schools. So I know what I am talking about.
Teachers are a lot of things. We are all those nice words like caring, dedicated, passionate, resourceful, etc, etc. But we are also professionals, and I expect to be treated like one.
So here is my beef with you: Just because you went to school and sat through years of lessons, does not make you knowledgeable about what we do, just as eating at a restaurant does not make you an expert on cooking.
You point your finger at me and tell me to do my job and make your kid learn. Did you spend time with them before preschool reading or did you hand them your phone to shut them up.
Did you count numbers in your house and help them color what they saw in nature?
Once they finally got into preschool did you continue reading with them each night?
Jason McCutcheon, Douglas
An open letter to Arizona's new United States senators Senators Martha McSally and Kyrsten Sinema, I would like to ask you where you stand on border security and the government shutdown?
You have been in Washington for a week now and all we hear is crickets from your Senate offices on these issues.
If ever there was a time for reaching across the aisle to develop solutions it is now. After all, you do represent one of the four states that make up the southern border and have many citizens that are affected by the shutdown.
I would think you might have some concerns. It's time for you to work together, stand up and be heard, present the facts of the state of the southern border as you know them, and push the Senate to work to find a solution instead of sitting back and watching the world go by.
David Brooks has an op-ed in the New York Times on the current state of the government that both of you should read and absorb. In the case of Ms Sinema, you were elected to get things done. For Ms. McSally, Sen. McCain must be rolling over in his grave.
John LeMoine, Phoenix
It is wrong and unethical to back Donald Trump's corrupt behavior I do not support a wall. Even if we do get a wall the government will still need to fund surveillance, technology and officers to patrol the area. An investment in technology and resources would be more practical.
That being said, my family is suffering a great deal from this shutdown just as we have from shutdowns in the past. We are real people with real bills to pay. We have three children, a mortgage and two car payments.
We cannot afford to be without pay. The president is flat out wrong to continue this shutdown. This is abuse of power and abuse of his people. It is wrong and unethical to support his corrupt behavior.

Marie Kondo, decluttering, and the war being waged on your stuff

Texto completo: Most people spend their lives accumulating things. We buy homes and cars and the latest technology. Closets overflow, junk drawers swell, garages threaten to erupt. We don't dare part with old letters or old journals. Our personal spaces are defined by personal things.
But what if the "stuff" in our lives got a demotion? Americans have a reputation for mindless consumerism, but in the last several years a growing minimalist movement has claimed abundance is the ultimate burden, and that clearing clutter is how to make space for real joy.
A search for #minimalism on Instagram shows the hashtag has been used more than 9 million times. Embracing the philosophy, it seems, starts with decluttering, the process of purging excess stuff. Many point to Marie Kondo's 2014 mega-seller, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing, as the moment minimalism went mainstream (the book remained on USA TODAY’s best-seller list for 123 weeks). In 2015, "declutter" was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.
More: Want to get organized? Marie Kondo's tips for decluttering
In the years since, much attention has been paid to the minimalist phenomenon — and its lofty goal of enlightenment.
"I think that the recent interest in tidying is showing that people began to shift their mindset, and are now feeling the need to possess only what is necessary and lead a simpler life," Kondo recently told USA TODAY. Mass production made people's lives easier, she said, but it also meant people ended up owning a lot more than was required (or even desired).
Minimalists like Kondo — who proselytize a more intentional kind of consumerism — say clearing clutter isn't just practical, it's healthful. Psychologists tend to agree.
"Less stuff that clutters our space and our mind can help us be more attuned to what we feel and think," said New York psychologist Vivian Diller, who has treated people who declutter obsessively (any behavior, she says, can become compulsive).
"It's like writers who clear their desks and sharpen their pencils, or artists who clean their pallets or organize their paints," she said. "A sense of internal order can promote external productivity. "
Kondo said the greatest impediment to clearing clutter is nostalgia.
"When trying to let go of things, people often feel as though they are also parting with the effort it took to possess the item and the memories that come with it," she said. "But even if the things are gone, it doesn’t mean that the memory is. "
Emily Evans, owner of Eliminate: Professional Organizing in Lexington, Ky. , said this is why some people who want to organize need a fresh set of eyes.
"A professional organizer is trained to help you see your belongings in a new way," she said.
Jason Cubert, a 44-year-old lawyer in Lexington, said he hired Evans last fall to help him declutter his home.
"I think anytime you free up space for one thing — spiritually, emotionally, practically — you spiritually, emotionally, and practically have room for something else, and you want that something else to be more personally beneficial than just 'stuff,'" he said.
Cubert said his parents were notorious for not throwing things away, and he didn't want his living situation to mirror theirs. He hired Evans in an effort to save himself time spent (looking for things) and money (purchasing items he already had but couldn't find). He found the clutter made it difficult to concentrate in his own home.
"Emily would get in there and really question me about, 'Do you really need this? Have you used this? Is this really that important to you? If and when the time came that you did need it, would it set you back financially?'" he said. "You can have everything organized, and still be overwhelmed by stuff, whereas if you purge I think you can get a bigger picture. You can see space for more things in your life. "
The stream of weekly blog posts and stories on decluttering, and the increasing popularity of services like the one Evan's provides, (the National Association of Professional Organizers started with only a handful of members and now boasts around 4,000) show how drawn we are to the promise of a simpler, more organized life. But the social phenomenon also has its fair share of critics — those who find it difficult to discern how much of minimalism is about shaking off the yoke of consumerism, and how much of it is style dressed up as spirituality.
Even Evans admits that if minimalism is nothing more than an aesthetic, it isn't minimalism at all.
"If you’re getting rid of stuff in your home because you’re going for 'a look' or are planning to replace it with 'simpler' furniture, you’re still buying into our capitalist, consumerist society," she said. "Decluttering should be about making your life easier so you can take part in things that are important to you. "
But what about those who have less — and not by choice? Some critics of the mainstream minimalism movement say it tends to ignore that for many people, an easier life may actually mean having more "stuff. "
Stephanie Land, a social and economic justice writer who spent years as a single mother in Missoula, Mont. , was living in a 600-square-foot apartment in low-income housing with her two young daughters when she saw the trailer for Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things. The 2016 Netflix film was produced by the hosts of The Minimalists podcast, Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus, who maintain minimalism is the path to freedom.
Land, who worked as a house cleaner to put herself through college as a single mom (and details the experience in her forthcoming memoir Maid) knows all too well what it's like to live with less.
She calls herself "a minimalist in nature," and while she said she supports more mindful consumerism, what she saw in the trailer was a kind of "social shaming" that made her so uncomfortable she wrote an op-ed about it for The New York Times, "The Class Politics of Decluttering. " When she eventually watched the full documentary, she was even angrier.
"They showed flashes of Black Friday shoppers rushing — presumably Walmart or Best Buy — and pointed to them as a need for this minimalism movement, and that really upset me, because those aren't the people who need minimalism," she said. "When you're living on the very edge or under the poverty level, all the world is a bunch of things that you can't have. When one does come into your reach, you're going to want it. "
Minimalism is only "a virtue," she said, when it's "a choice. "
After years of being forced to live sparsely, Land has moved into a house that boasts a new couch, a stocked fridge and an abundance of space that may not be considered minimal, but still feels pretty joyous.
"I have my very own office," she said. "My daughters can play in our fenced-in backyard. . . . It's blowing my mind constantly. "
Some of us probably ought to live with less. Many of us deserve to live with more. But deciding what to keep and what to toss doesn't just say something about who we are and what possessions, as Kondo famously says, "spark joy. " It reveals how we see our future. Where we think we'll be, where we hope we'll be and what we aren't worried about missing when we get there.

Texto completo: Are doctors responsible for obesity? What about dentists, are they responsible for cavities? And why aren't the police responsible for crime?
But you tell me, the teacher is responsible for learning. I say, baloney.
I am a teacher and a good one. My wife and I combined have nearly a half-century of teaching experience — small schools, big schools, inner-city schools and rural schools. So I know what I am talking about.
Teachers are a lot of things. We are all those nice words like caring, dedicated, passionate, resourceful, etc, etc. But we are also professionals, and I expect to be treated like one.
So here is my beef with you: Just because you went to school and sat through years of lessons, does not make you knowledgeable about what we do, just as eating at a restaurant does not make you an expert on cooking.
You point your finger at me and tell me to do my job and make your kid learn. Did you spend time with them before preschool reading or did you hand them your phone to shut them up.
Did you count numbers in your house and help them color what they saw in nature?
Once they finally got into preschool did you continue reading with them each night?
Jason McCutcheon, Douglas
An open letter to Arizona's new United States senators Senators Martha McSally and Kyrsten Sinema, I would like to ask you where you stand on border security and the government shutdown?
You have been in Washington for a week now and all we hear is crickets from your Senate offices on these issues.
If ever there was a time for reaching across the aisle to develop solutions it is now. After all, you do represent one of the four states that make up the southern border and have many citizens that are affected by the shutdown.
I would think you might have some concerns. It's time for you to work together, stand up and be heard, present the facts of the state of the southern border as you know them, and push the Senate to work to find a solution instead of sitting back and watching the world go by.
David Brooks has an op-ed in the New York Times on the current state of the government that both of you should read and absorb. In the case of Ms Sinema, you were elected to get things done. For Ms. McSally, Sen. McCain must be rolling over in his grave.
John LeMoine, Phoenix
It is wrong and unethical to back Donald Trump's corrupt behavior I do not support a wall. Even if we do get a wall the government will still need to fund surveillance, technology and officers to patrol the area. An investment in technology and resources would be more practical.
That being said, my family is suffering a great deal from this shutdown just as we have from shutdowns in the past. We are real people with real bills to pay. We have three children, a mortgage and two car payments.
We cannot afford to be without pay. The president is flat out wrong to continue this shutdown. This is abuse of power and abuse of his people. It is wrong and unethical to support his corrupt behavior.

Gender-neutral proposal advances

Texto completo: Cambridge officials Monday advanced a proposal to add a gender-neutral option to birth certificates issued in the city while letting those who don't identify with the gender assigned to them at birth amend the document without having to jump through certain administrative hoops.
The policy order, which was introduced this month by Mayor Marc McGovern, was passed unanimously by the City Council during the first meeting of the New Year Monday night.
The proposal specifically asks the city solicitor to draft a home-rule petition to the state Legislature, because adding a third gender category — “X" — on birth certificates would require state approval.
The city solicitor did not immediately reply to a request for comment about how long that process could take.
Under current state law, Massachusetts residents can amend the sex on a birth certificate with what is termed “proper evidence," according to the state's website. The process requires a note from a physician stating a person has completed medical intervention for the purpose of permanent sex reassignment, the website says.
Cambridge officials have said adding “X" would give residents born in the city “more control in defining for the government who they are and affirming their humanity and dignity," according to details of the order.
The proposal follows in the footsteps of similar legislation passed across the country.
In October, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed a bill allowing residents who don't identify as male or female to amend a birth certificate and select “X" instead.
The bill also removed the requirement for people to get a note from a doctor or mental health professional before making the change, according to the New York Times. It went into effect in New York City on Jan. 1, 2019.
California, Oregon, Washington state — and soon, New Jersey — offer similar gender-neutral options for those who want to amend their assigned gender on legal documents.
Officials said they hope by advancing the order to the state Legislature, other communities throughout Massachusetts will do likewise.
During Monday night's meeting, McGovern said he's spoken to delegates at the State House who have been supportive of the measure and that the proposal is long overdue.
“Hopefully this will give it some momentum on a larger scale," McGovern said.
A spokeswoman for House Speaker Robert DeLeo said in a statement Monday that the House would “review any proposal sent" its way.
On Tuesday morning, after the initial proposal was approved, Cambridge City Councilor Alanna Mallonsaid in a tweet that the move is “a signal to the transgender and non-binary conforming community that their municipal leaders care about them."
She added, “This would be one step in ensuring that transgender residents receive the dignity and respect they deserve."
Councilor Sumbul Siddiqui, who cosponsored the proposal, said in a statement to The Boston Globe that the changes would be a simple step with substantial effect for anyone who does not feel the sex indicated on their birth records match their identity.
“The current system is one that does not uphold our community values," she said of the process to make changes to the document. “I feel it's the government's responsibility to remove complex and dehumanizing barriers wherever possible."

Power of the Majority Only Goes So Far Against the President

Texto completo: With the House of Representatives now under Democratic control and the gavel in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's hands, some of President Trump's critics are eagerly anticipating a surge of congressional investigations.
Democratic leaders have promised to scrutinize a host of issues, including Mr. Trump's ties to foreign governments, his administration's child separation policy, possible violations of campaign finance regulations and ethical lapses by his cabinet.
But some of the more extreme or coveted goals of Mr. Trump's critics may not be imminent or even feasible. Here's what Congress can -- and cannot -- do to investigate.
Impeaching the President
Impeachment clearly resonates with a majority of Democratic voters, and with some more zealous members of Congress. Democratic leaders, however, have been more cautious. Ms. Pelosi on Friday called impeachment "divisive" and suggested that dissatisfied voters should look to remove Mr. Trump in an election, rather than by impeachment.
Logistically, impeaching a president or other top government official involves two steps.
A majority of the House must first vote to approve articles of impeachment, which essentially serve as an indictment of the official and sets up a trial in the Senate. Then, two-thirds of the Senate must vote to convict the official to remove him or her from office.
To date, only two presidents have been impeached -- Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Both were acquitted in the Senate. According to the Congressional Research Service, of the 15 federal judges, one senator and one cabinet member whom the House has voted to impeach since 1797, the Senate convicted eight federal judges.
For those hoping that Congress might impeach Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, there is even less precedent for impeaching members of the nation's highest court than for the presidency. The House has only once voted to impeach a Supreme Court justice -- Justice Samuel Chase in 1804 -- and he was also acquitted by the Senate.
Mr. Trump, for his part, has cast impeachment proceedings as a political liability for Democrats. In a Friday tweet, he also again wrongly claimed that he is the most popular Republican president in history.
Obtaining and Releasing Tax Returns
Democratic leaders have said that obtaining Mr. Trump's long-sought tax returns is a priority. Congressional tax-writing committees do have the authority to request taxpayer filings -- including the president's -- from the Treasury Department, but there are a few hurdles that Democrats must first clear.
Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has said that he would prefer that Mr. Trump release his tax returns voluntarily. Still, Mr. Neal cautioned to CNN that there was the possibility of a "a long and grinding court case."
Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, has vowed to fight such a disclosure in court, arguing that Democrats have no legitimate reason to request the tax returns.
In a scenario that could pit the president's personal interests against the government's obligations, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told The New York Times in November that he would honor any legal requests from Congress to release the president's tax returns. Even if congressional Democrats do obtain Mr. Trump's tax returns, they may face legal and political risks for releasing the documents to the public without his approval.
Jailing Those Who Refuse to Comply
Some Democratic voters, concerned by the possibility of witnesses ignoring congressional subpoenas, have raised the specter of jail time as a punishment or deterrent for noncompliance. But the road to such an outcome would be too long and cumbersome for effective oversight.
There are three methods by which lawmakers can penalize uncooperative people or compel cooperation.
First, the House or Senate can each try to imprison witnesses, but this process has been "long dormant," according to the Congressional Research Service. It was last used in 1934 when Herbert Hoover's commerce secretary was declared in contempt of the Senate for attempting to destroy subpoenaed materials; he was jailed for 10 days.
Congress can also refer a contempt case to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. But prosecutors do not always pursue those cases.
In 1982, the Justice Department did not bring charges against Anne Gorsuch Burford, who was then the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, for refusing to cooperate with congressional investigators. Nor did similar refusals compel prosecutors to charge Joshua Bolten, the White House chief of staff, or Harriet E. Miers, the White House counsel, in 2008, or Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in 2012.
Additionally, Congress can file a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to enforce a subpoena. But this approach could lead to a protracted legal battle. For example, the case against Ms. Miers dragged on for 19 months and was ultimately dismissed.

Keto? Paleo? Whole30?

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.
Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.
Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle.
With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease."
Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: A spinoff of "The Fosters" debuts on Freeform. And a scripted drama series begins on the History channel.
What's on TV
GOOD TROUBLE 8 p.m. on Freeform. By the time "The Fosters" wrapped up last summer, fans were already itching to keep the drama going with this spinoff series. After graduating, sisters Callie (Maia Mitchell) and Mariana (Cierra Ramirez) move into a shabby communal home in downtown Los Angeles where dinners bring the residents together and rats roam free. They take up new jobs -- Callie works for a conservative judge (Roger Bart) and Mariana joins a male-dominated start-up -- that leave them wanting more. True to coming-of-age fare, their new reality proves that "adulting" comes with plenty of battles. "Good Trouble" echoes the social consciousness of "The Fosters," the creator Joanna Johnson told Variety, but it is on the lighter side and draws out the story through a more complex, nonlinear narrative.
LINDSAY LOHAN'S BEACH CLUB 8 p.m. on MTV. Lindsay Lohan has been out of the limelight in recent years. This new series highlights one of the projects that has kept her busy: opening Lohan Beach House, a sprawling beach club in Mykonos, Greece. In "Vanderpump Rules" format, the show follows a very serious Lohan as she manages the club's eight employees at the sun-drenched tourist destination.
ELLEN'S GAME OF GAMES 8 p.m. on NBC. The second season of this tournament show, hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, starts with two back-to-back episodes. Contestants compete for a chance to win $100,000 in a series of games based on DeGeneres's daytime talk show.
FINDING YOUR ROOTS 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). In this Season 5 opener, the host Henry Louis Gates Jr. helps the "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" actor Andy Samberg and the "Game of Thrones" author George R. R. Martin unravel mysteries about their ancestry.
PROJECT BLUE BOOK 10 p.m. on History. This new scripted series reimagines clandestine investigations into unidentified flying objects led by the United States Armed Forces from 1947 to 1969. The cases, part of a program called Project Blue Book, were led by the Ohio State astrophysicist J. Allen Hynek (Aidan Gillen of "Game of Thrones") and a World War II pilot, Capt. Michael Quinn (Michael Malarkey of "The Vampire Diaries"). The show begins with the "Gorman Dogfight," a 27-minute air encounter between a military pilot and a white orb above Fargo, N.D.
What's Streaming
PAN'S LABYRINTH (2006) on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Netflix, Vudu and YouTube. This dark allegorical fairy tale by Guillermo del Toro bears much resemblance to his 2017 fantasy drama, "The Shape of Water." Set after the Spanish Civil War, it centers on a girl (Ivana Baquero) who finds an escape from the tyranny of her military officer stepfather by entering a labyrinth where a faun (Doug Jones) reveals her destiny. What distinguishes the movie from other fairy tales, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, "is that it balances its own magical thinking with the knowledge that not everyone lives happily ever after."

Texto completo: BANGKOK -- An 18-year-old Saudi woman who expressed fear that she would be killed if sent back to her family was allowed to remain in Thailand on Monday evening, ending a tense 48-hour drama at Bangkok's main international airport.
The young woman, Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, was on the verge of being deported earlier in the day at the request of the Saudi government. But after she and human rights advocates mounted a global social media campaign, Thai immigration officials agreed not to send her home.
"Thailand is a land of smiles. We will not send someone back to die," said the country's immigration chief, Maj. Gen. Surachate Hakparn. "We will take care of her as best as we can."
After meeting with Ms. Alqunun and officials from the United Nations refugee agency Monday afternoon, General Surachate said that Ms. Alqunun had been allowed to leave the airport with agency representatives. They will take up to 10 days to process her request for refugee status and find a country that will accept her.
Earlier in the day, she posted a short video from an airport hotel room in which she had barricaded herself, saying she would not leave without seeing United Nations officials.
"I want asylum," Ms. Alqunun said in a clear, calm voice.
Every woman in Saudi Arabia has a male "guardian," typically a father, husband, brother or uncle. A woman must have permission from her guardian to do an array of things, including to travel, obtain a passport, marry or divorce.
[Read more about how Saudi Arabia's guardianship restricts women.]
King Salman relaxed some of the rules in 2017, allowing a woman, under some circumstances, to go to school, get a job, or rent an apartment without her guardian's permission, but those changes are not always observed in practice. Women's rights advocates say that the police often require a guardian's permission for a woman to report a crime, making it all but impossible for her to report domestic abuse committed by her guardian.
Human Rights Watch has called the guardianship system "the most significant impediment to realizing women's rights in the country, effectively rendering adult women legal minors."
In a telephone interview with The New York Times, Ms. Alqunun said she had slipped away from her family on Saturday during a trip to Kuwait, where women are allowed to travel without a male guardian, and had flown on her own to Bangkok.
She said that she had planned to spend a few days in Thailand and continue to Australia, for which she had a visa, and that she planned to request asylum.
But on arrival at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, she was intercepted by a man she identified as Saudi who said he would help her. Instead, he took her passport and brought over Thai immigration officials, who said they would send her back to Kuwait at her family's request.
The deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, Phil Robertson, who played a crucial role in mobilizing support for Ms. Alqunun, said he was pleased with the results of the fast-paced campaign.
Thousands of people called the United Nations refugee agency to express support for Ms. Alqunun, and ambassadors worked the phones to help find a solution, he said.
"Today really was a good day for the cause of human rights around the world, with Rahaf's tremendous courage and resilience being met with a global surge of sympathy for her," he said. "It all came together to persuade Thailand to do the right thing."
Thailand, which has been run by a military regime since 2014, is not a signatory to international agreements allowing travelers to seek asylum and was not bound to honor her asylum request.
Ms. Alqunun's plight has attracted attention around the world. She opened a Twitter account over the weekend and already has tens of thousands of followers.
Ms. Alqunun told The Times that she had been planning her escape since she was 16. She said her brother and other family members often had beat her, and that she was once locked in a room for six months because she had cut her hair in a way disapproved by her family.
"They will kill me because I fled and because I announced my atheism," she said. "They wanted me to pray and to wear a veil, and I didn't want to."
General Surachate said that Ms. Alqunun was free to go wherever she wanted in Thailand and that there were no government restrictions on her now that she had entered the country.
She will be under the care of the United Nations refugee agency until her departure, he said.
"There are no conditions," he said. "There's no detention or control over her."
He said officials initially had planned to deport Ms. Alqunun because of her lack of money and concrete travel plans.
"Once we heard the update on the situation, that she was in trouble, that it was life-threatening if she went back," he said, "Thailand welcomed her."

As odds for impeachment rise, NYT columnist Leonhardt lays out the case

Texto completo: Now that Democrats hold a substantial majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, the odds that President Donald Trump will be impeached are substantially increased. No duh. I’m not saying it will happen, just that the odds went up from zero last year to some double-digit percentage of likelihood.
Of course, I use the term “impeached” precisely, by which I mean the first step in the constitutional process for removal of a president, the one that occurs in the U.S. House and requires only a majority vote. As you know, the second step for the involuntary removal of a president requires trial in the Senate and a vote of two-thirds of the senators to convict the president of an impeachable offense.
Exactly what constitutes such an offense is a murky legal/political/constitutional question. The phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” is, basically, whatever a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate (after conducting a “trial”) decide it is. Only two presidents — Andrew Johnson just after the Civil War and Bill Clinton in 1998-99 — have ever been impeached. And none was been convicted/removed. (Richard Nixon resigned before his impeachment proceedings reached a vote in the U.S. House.)
While the odds of a majority vote in the House (now that Democrats are in the majority) have risen, the odds of conviction and removal in the Senate, which requires a two-thirds majority vote, still strike me as low.
The proper grounds for impeachment and removal, “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,” are, to say the least, subject to interpretation, especially the last two categories. If things go that far, with Democrats currently holding 47 Senate seats, it would require at least 20 Republican senators to vote for conviction. As things now stand, that borders on unimaginable.
If things even start down this path, Trump would have to be charged with a specific list of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” My main purpose in discussing the question today is just to pass along an impressive column from yesterday’s New York Times by columnist David Leonhardt, in which he enumerates some of the allegations that he believes could be used to make the case. It ran under the headline: “The People vs. Donald J. Trump; He is demonstrably unfit for office. What are we waiting for?”
The column is right here. Stop reading me right now and read the whole powerful column.
But if, despite my recommendation, you are still reading this, here are couple of excerpts (although you really need to see how the whole things builds momentum):
Leonhardt quotes two of the key Framers of the Constitution and authors of the Federalist Papers, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, who described the impeachment powers as necessary to remove officials for “the abuse or violation of some public trust” (Hamilton) or for demonstrating the “incapacity, negligence or perfidy” of a president (Madison).
Then Leonhardt suggests some of the categories of alleged Trumpian perfidy and abuse he thinks might qualify:
[Trump] has repeatedly put his own interests above those of the country. He has used the presidency to promote his businesses. He has accepted financial gifts from foreign countries. He has lied to the American people about his relationship with a hostile foreign government. He has tolerated cabinet officials who use their position to enrich themselves…
To shield himself from accountability for all of this — and for his unscrupulous presidential campaign — he has set out to undermine the American system of checks and balances. He has called for the prosecution of his political enemies and the protection of his allies. He has attempted to obstruct justice. He has tried to shake the public’s confidence in one democratic institution after another, including the press, federal law enforcement and the federal judiciary.
Those are generalizations, but Leonhardt offers plenty of specifics. You’ll have to read him to get those, but he broke them down into these four categories of possibly impeachable allegations:
Trump has used the presidency for personal enrichment.
Trump has violated campaign finance law.
Trump has obstructed justice. And:
Trump has subverted democracy.

Texto completo: Police reporting
The press can publish articles about public crimes that have yet to be proven through New York Times vs. Sullivan, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
This ruling allows the press to publish false information without the likelihood of a lawsuit unless there is actual malice. The press can take a police report, which can be false, and publish that information to the public. These articles can change the defendant's case before he goes to trial in many ways.
For example: If a defendant elects to go to trial with a jury, the jury could have a verdict in their head based off facts from an article that presented false information. The public can also view that person differently based on an article that presented false information.
The public doesn't care if you are innocent until proven guilty if the story sounds good! At the end of articles for someone awaiting trial, it should read: "The defendant is innocent until proven guilty, and that the information presented in the article could be incorrect."
All of the things listed above has happened to me on numerous occasions, and I feel that it is time for a change.

President Trump
I did not see the letter that prompted Wendy Winett Costello to write a letter (The Capital, Jan. 3). Also, I do not believe a back and forth with anyone about politics today is productive.
Part of the country wants President Donald Trump's administration to succeed and part of the country believes Trump is the Anti-Christ. There does not seem to be a middle ground. Nonetheless, I feel obliged to respond to some of Costello's charges.
Trump may criticize the press but that is not the same as threatening it.
"Proven liar?" An exaggerator, yes. A real liar would be President Woodrow Wilson who dragged us into World War I or President Lyndon Baines Johnson into Vietnam.
"Role model?" Maybe not. Perhaps President Bill Clinton is a better one.
"Harms others in business?" This charge really cannot be explained. Unemployment is at an all-time low among every demographic. Wages are rising. Manufacturing is rebounding. The United States is at long last addressing the systematic cheating, technological and intellectual property theft of the Chinese government that has been hurting U.S. businesses for years.
"The quality of our air and water are now compromised. We the people are getting sick?" Where does such a charge come from? Does The Capital just print anything without any evidence? The EPA reports air and water quality are at all-time highs, far better than just 30 years ago.
"He wishes to dismantle the public school system?" This is the most far-out charge of all. Where on earth does this come from?
"Trump turns thumbs down to the rule of law?" What does this mean? I'll remind Costello that we have three very robust branches of government and I do not mean the Senate, House and White House.
"He shows a lack of compassion." There are legal ways to immigrate to this country or seek asylum. There are over 700,000 asylum seekers in the United States today. Most will not receive a hearing or decision for many years due to the backlog in the courts.
I hope Costello really does not believe we on the verge of slipping "into the abyss." I think there are only great days ahead.

Nancy Pelosi tamps down talk of impeachment

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to quell a rising furor Sunday over whether Democratic lawmakers will seek to impeach President Trump, saying in an interview on CBS News' "Sunday Morning" that the public has yet to hear the conclusions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
Democrats are unlikely to pursue a path of impeachment without Republican backing, Pelosi hinted. That could hinge significantly on whether Mueller's probe uncovers concrete evidence of wrongdoing.
"If and when the time comes for impeachment," she said, "it will have to be something that has such a crescendo in a bipartisan way."
Pelosi's remarks come amid days of Democratic infighting after newly elected Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan vowed at a progressive gathering on Thursday to impeach Trump, using a profanity to refer to the president.
Many of Tlaib's colleagues have cautioned against moving too quickly toward impeachment. Others said that while House lawmakers could "line up the votes," a bid for impeachment would be fruitless without Republican support in the Senate.
"If the Republican senators, at least some of them, are not on board, then all you have is a failed impeachment, and I don't think that benefits the country," Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on CNN.
WASHINGTON POST
Pentagon chief of staff quits after ex-boss's departure Rear Admiral Kevin M. Sweeney has resigned his post as chief of staff to the secretary of defense, the Defense Department said.
Sweeney had become chief of staff to former defense secretary Jim Mattis in January 2017, and his resignation comes soon after Mattis's own pointed departure in December. The two had known each other for years.
Mattis said then that he had resigned in protest of President Trump's decision to withdraw US forces from Syria and in protest of the president's rejection of international alliances.
Mattis had originally said he would step down at the end of February, but Trump removed him from his post two months early.
Patrick M. Shanahan, the former deputy secretary of defense, became acting secretary of defense on Jan. 1.
“After two years in the Pentagon, I've decided the time is right to return to the private sector," Sweeney said in a statement on the department's website.
Sweeney retired as a rear admiral from the Navy in 2014, according to the Department of Defense. The department said as commanding officer of the USS Cole, he had overseen the destroyer's restoration.
Sweeney's resignation follows a number of recent high-profile departures from the Trump administration, including that of Mattis. The president said in December that John F. Kelly would step down as White House chief of staff. Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, also announced his resignation last month.
NEW YORK TIMES
Trump not rushing to replace acting Cabinet members President Trump on Sunday said he's in no rush to name permanent members of his Cabinet after a series of departures, asserting that members of his administration serving in an acting capacity give him "more flexibility."
"Well, I'm in no hurry," Trump told reporters outside the White House before departing for Camp David. "I have 'acting.' And my actings are doing really great."
He praised Acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, saying they are "doing great" in their temporary roles. "I sort of like 'acting,"' Trump said. "It gives me more flexibility; do you understand that? I like 'acting."'
In addition to Mulvaney and Bernhardt, other officials serving on a temporary basis include Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and acting Environmental Protection Agency administrator Andrew Wheeler.
WASHINGTON POST
Collins prepping 2020 run, splits blame for shutdown Senator Susan Collins is "getting ready to run" for reelection, she said during a television appearance Sunday, but she reiterated that she won't make a decision until the end of the year.
Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine who was first elected to the Senate in 1996, also said on NBC's "Meet The Press" that she thinks Republicans and Democrats are both at fault for the government shutdown and that a compromise could be brokered soon.
Democrats and liberal groups have targeted Collins for her role in the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year. A crowd-funded effort to boost her opponent in 2020 has received more than $3.7 million.
Collins has yet to make a firm commitment about whether she's running for reelection. She told "Meet The Press" host Chuck Todd she would prefer to use this year to legislate rather than campaign.
Collins was reelected with ease in 2014, but Democratic organizers have vowed to hold her accountable for Kavanaugh's confirmation if she seeks another term.

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

Texto completo: MIDDLETOWN —
The eldest sister of the McGuire Sisters, the trio born in Middletown and raised in Miamisburg, with six Top 10 Billboard hits including No. 1 hits “Sincerely” and “Sugartime,” died just before New Year’s in Las Vegas.
Born Ruby Christine McGuire, the sister behind the iconic group’s matching attire, to Asa and Lillie McGuire on July 30, 1926, died on Dec. 28, 2018, at 92. McGuire’s family confirmed her death in a statement released on Friday, according to the New York Times, and no cause of death was given.
Phyllis McGuire, 87, the youngest of the trio, is the sole survivor of the McGuire Sisters, who were born in Middletown. Dorothy “Dottie” McGuire died in 2012 at 84.
The McGuire Sisters performed for five presidents — Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush — and Queen Elizabeth II. They were inducted into three halls of fame: the National Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 1994, Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001 and Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2009.
The sisters stopped performing in the late 1960s but made a comeback in 1985, including performing at casinos and clubs in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Their last televised performance was a 2004 PBS special, “Magic Moments: The Best of ’50s Pop.”
The sisters were close, said Pat Hayes, of Middletown, who organized the McGuire Sisters’ 1991 Middletown bicentennial performance at the Sorg Theater.
“I’m sure (Phyllis) is a very lonely lady,” Hayes said after hearing the news of Christine’s death. “They were really quite close as sisters, and I’m sure as entertainers.”
In their 1991 Middletown performance, the McGuire Sisters had a sold-out one-night, two-show performance, said Hayes, who organized the event with her husband, Norm.
“They put on a really big show,” she said.
The McGuire Sisters started out singing in church and after being discovered on local television, signed with Coral Records in 1952. Their first record, “Picking Sweethearts” was released in 1953. Their first Top 10 hit, “Goodnight Sweetheart, Goodnight,” reached No. 7.
“They definitely set a standard, a high standard, for music and the good life,” said Hayes, who recalled the sisters as “very much down-to-earth” and consummate professionals. And as with most professionals, they had a few requests before they performed. One request was something they grew up with: Jug Burgers from The Jug on Central Avenue.
“They were just really fun,” Hayes said.
Ann Mort, a former Middletown school board and city council member, said that 1991 performance “was a major event” in Middletown.
“And every man of a certain age claimed to have dated one of the sisters,” she said.
Christine McGuire’s death is “certainly a major name being lost to the music world,” Mort said. “They did a lot for their home communities, and were always interesting and fun people as a group.”
The New York Times contributed to this story.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.
Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.
Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets of the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle.
U.S. News and World Report has released its annual rankings of the Best Diets for 2019, revealing the Mediterranean diet was the best overall choice.
Each diet description below is a rating of its effectiveness, based on U.S. News and World Report rankings. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease."
Here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions this year.
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet. Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So, instead, it burns fat. The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that aren't always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.

Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago. Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.

Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat? The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally. However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 3.0/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.4/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.9/5 on Healthy
A healthy diet doesn't require a complete life change. Instead, make smarter choices more often when shopping, cooking and eating.

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump invoked the term "American carnage" in his inaugural address, he wasn't referring to gun violence, but the label undeniably fits: Record numbers of Americans are killing themselves or each other with firearms.
During the first year of Trump's presidency, guns were used to kill 39,773 Americans, the greatest number of such deaths since the government began tracking them in 1979, according to a recent report from federal health officials. Suicides made up more than half the total. A United States awash in firearms, approximately one for every resident, continues to lead the world in gun-related homicides at a rate four to 16 times higher than any other advanced nation.
Even with Democrats taking power in the House on Thursday, relying on Congress to do anything about this growing national health crisis seems a distant dream, particularly given the power of the national gun lobby and continued Republican control of the Senate and White House.
The good news is that after last year's shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, more than half the states enacted new restrictions on firearms. Absent new federal gun-control legislation, here are three ideas to staunch the killing:
More states could follow Massachusetts' lead and require an identification card to purchase rifles or shotguns, and a license to buy handguns. Applicants pay a $100 fee and are photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed, and they take a gun safety course. Licensing extends to private sales, negating the so-called gun-show loophole. Finally, police can deny a handgun license to an applicant deemed a public threat. It's surely no coincidence that Massachusetts boasts the lowest gun-death rate in the nation at 3.4 per 100,000.
Financial institutions could alert authorities to highly unusual credit card activity related to purchases of guns and ammunition. A New York Times analysis of 13 mass shootings during the past decade revealed that in at least eight cases, killers racked up thousands of dollars on credit cards, often where they couldn't otherwise have afforded the arsenal.
Slightly more than half of suicides in America are committed with a firearm. More states could adopt "red flag" laws that allow families, often in voluntary cooperation with the relative who is suicidal, to obtain a temporary court order for seizing that person's firearm until the crisis passes. The order would also prevent that person from purchasing a gun during the same period. Thirteen states have such laws.
Despite the disconnect between the majority of Americans who want sensible gun control and a Congress that does nothing about it, headway is possible through the states and by pressuring commercial businesses such as banks. American carnage doesn't have to be a tragedy without end. — USA TODAY

A sign of intelligent life for Dems

Texto completo: WASHINGTON
If Republicans have a lick of sense, they are alarmed by a recent sign of intelligent life in the other party. The sign is the election by Democrats in the House of Representatives of Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In November, she won a fourth term by 24 percentage points, the largest margin of any Democrat running in a district Donald Trump carried in 2016. Her task as chair, which is to cement the Democrats' House majority in 2020, involves this arithmetic:
In the next Congress, 31 Democrats will represent districts Trump carried. In 2018, 40 Democrats flipped districts from red to blue -- 41, if the Democrat wins the North Carolina race clouded by allegations of vote fraud. Twenty-two Democrats won by 5 percentage points or less. Twenty-three lost by 5 points or less. Democrats have noticed that Bustos prospers in a mostly rural district that extends along the Mississippi from the Wisconsin border to a portion of Peoria. Sixty percent of the district's residents live in towns with populations of 1,000 or fewer; 85 percent are in towns of 5,000 or fewer. In November, she won all of her district's 14 counties, 11 of which are entirely rural.
What lessons can Democrats learn from her success among Trump voters? They might start by marrying a cop. She says she gets "instant credibility" by telling audiences that her husband, who has been in law enforcement for 34 years, is the sheriff of Rock Island County. Regarding guns, it is helpful if one of your sons finished second in the national collegiate trap-shooting competition. It also is helpful if another son is a union welder.
Favorable trends might tempt Democrats to think that they can thrive without the voters Bustos reaches. The Economist, noting that Trump's approval rating is "stratified by age," reports that baby boomers -- those born between 1946 and 1964 -- who have been America's largest age cohort for more than five decades will in 2019 be outnumbered by millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996. Boomers are -- were, they are shuffling off stage -- almost 75 percent white; millennials are 56 percent white. In this year's midterm elections, Democrats won two-thirds of voters ages 18 to 29, and 71 percent of millennial women.
Furthermore, The New York Times reports that with the Democrats' capture of New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, Republicans now hold no "truly urban" district. Since Republicans lost four Orange County, California, seats in November -- the Democrats lost only two seats nationally -- come January there will be no Republican from there in Congress for the first time since 1940. And there will be no Republicans from New England.
If, however, Democrats aspire to be less of a coastal party -- come January, there will be more House Democrats from California than from 36 other states combined -- they should want to emulate Bustos' success among voters she calls "Trump triers," those who are less than his devoted acolytes.
Bustos sometimes connects with her constituents by asking them what they do for fun. When one woman answered "cable television," Bustos asked if her family did not go out to movies. No, the woman replied, four tickets and popcorn exceed the family's budget. This answer spoke volumes about the constituent's disposable income. Bustos' question revealed a well-honed political intuition. Democrats, she says, have to "own" districts like hers, "not rent them." This is what ownership looks like: Her four margins of victory have been 6 percentage points, 11, 20 and 24.

'Schindler' Is Debated In Germany

Texto completo: BERLIN -- The director Steven Spielberg cited a "renewed cycle of hate" in society behind his decision to bring "Schindler's List" back to movie theaters around the world, hoping it would provoke discussion.
An independent movie theater in western Germany embraced that very idea when it offered free tickets to members of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, to its screening of the classic film on Jan. 27, Holocaust Remembrance Day.
But some members of the AfD, whose leaders have dismissed the Nazi era as a "speck of bird poop in more than 1,000 years of successful German history" and have referred to the country's main Holocaust Memorial as "a monument of shame," saw the offer from the Cinexx theater more as a provocation than an invitation.
They have called it a "tasteless instrumentalization" and a "senseless provocation."
Members of left-leaning political parties and others in Germany have praised the offer, however. As justification, they point to the AfD's penchant for reciting slogans like "Germany for the Germans," for questioning the country's post-World War II culture of atonement and for being willing to march alongside neo-Nazis during protests in the eastern city of Chemnitz.
The Cinexx theater in Hachenburg, which offered the free viewing last month when it published its January schedule, said in a statement: "We see ourselves as a meeting place; films are windows on the world and initiate discussion in society."
"We are in no way asserting that those who vote for the AfD are Nazis -- everyone has to judge for themselves whether they need clarification about history," the theater said, adding that free tickets were regularly offered to different groups, including migrants, women and children.
Karin Leicher, who runs the movie theater, told the regional broadcaster SWR that she realized the offer was provocative, "but if someone feels the need to insult and threaten us, then they obviously feel addressed" by it.
Asked about his decision to rerelease the 1993 film, Mr. Spielberg said that he saw an increasing need for parents and educators to teach the next generation about the horrors of the Holocaust as an antidote to rising anti-Semitism.
"With this renewed cycle of hate," Mr. Spielberg told The New York Times in December, "I thought it could open up a conversation that genocide can happen anywhere when an ordinary society goes wrong."
Students across the United States were offered free admission to screenings when the film reopened in December.
A survey released last year found that as time passes, knowledge of the Nazis' mass genocide is receding among adults in the United States. In Germany, where remembrance of the Holocaust and the commemoration of its victims have been the cornerstone of a post-World War II history, a recent survey indicated that less than half of people age 18 to 34 said they knew "very little" about the Holocaust.

Texto completo: ALBANY – Former Vice President Joseph Biden has the "best case" for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Cuomo, a Democrat, offered an endorsement Wednesday of a potential Biden presidential campaign, arguing that the Delaware Democrat has "credibility" with the American public.
The governor, who has denied interest in running in 2020 himself, made the comment after he was asked about Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential prospects.
"My two cents? I think of all the names that are out there, I think Joe Biden has the best case," Cuomo said on WAMC-FM (90.3) in Albany. "I think Joe Biden has the best case because he brings the most of the secret ingredient you need to win, which is credibility."
Cuomo was asked whether he might want to be Biden's running mate, but Cuomo demurred.
"I am not even focusing on any of that," Cuomo said. "What I'm doing is what I believe I need to do for this state."
Cuomo has long counted Biden as a powerful ally.
Biden delivered a speech endorsing Cuomo for re-election at the state Democratic Convention in May, praising him for pushing big infrastructure projects and emphasizing the need to get things done.
Prior to that, Biden has made trips to New York to hail Cuomo for increasing the minimum wage and mark the groundbreaking on improvements at LaGuardia Airport.
Cuomo, who was inaugurated for a third term Tuesday night, has repeatedly denied he will run for president himself, saying in an August debate that he would serve a full four-year term "unless God strikes me dead."
Another New Yorker, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, of Brunswick, Rensselaer County, has said she's exploring a bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020.
The New York Times reported last week that Gillibrand has been weighing potential campaign managers and a location for a headquarters, likely to be in upstate New York.
On Wednesday, Cuomo said the potentially huge field of Democratic presidential candidates should work on highlighting the positives of their work.
"I think the main issue for the Democrats is not going to be the articulation of the negative," Cuomo said. "It's going to be the articulation of the positive and the credibility of the positive."

PETA to Tiffany Haddish: We love you, so please protest without fur

Texto completo: Animal rights group PETA loves comedian Tiffany Haddish, but its members still want her to find a protest strategy that doesn't require fur.

The entertainer, who has appeared in films including "Girls Trip" and "Keanu," annoyed activists and animal lovers alike when she posted a recent Instagram video vowing that fur garments would remain part of her wardrobe until police "stop killing black people."

Wearing a fur vest given to her by a fan after a show at the Comedy Store in West Hollywood, Calif., Haddish said in the clip she's protesting deaths of minorities in policy custody.

"When the police stop killing black people, I’ll stop wearing fur," Haddish said in her video, replayed more than 1.1 million times so far. "It's my new protest. Sorry, PETA, don’t be mad at me, be mad at the police."

PETA, or People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, doesn't appear to be mad, but it does offer some constructive criticism. "As an animal rights organizations, we advocate for, and believe in, kindness towards all, including animals," the organization said in a statement. "We hope that you choose to protest in a different way that doesn't harm any humans or any animals, but is kind to all."
Instagram

Law enforcement-linked deaths of minorities garnered national scrutiny after incidents including the shooting death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray in Baltimore in 2015, which prompted riots.

In 2018, an off-duty Dallas officer fatally shot 26-year-old accountant Botham Shem Jean when she mistook his apartment for her own, and 22-year-old Stephon Clark was shot dead in his grandmother’s backyard by police investigating property damage in Sacramento, according to the New York Times. An officer was fired in six of 15 prominent cases over a three-year period but only convicted at trial in three, the news organization said.

"Every single police shooting case is different," one Instagram user said in response to Haddish. "I would not want to be one of the guys to run into a dark room looking for a known killer. The police do it every day!"

Texto completo: Growing up as the daughter of an NBA referee, basketball has always been a central part of Kristi Toliver's life. She became an NCAA champion at Maryland in 2006 and a WNBA champion with the Los Angeles Sparks a decade later.
After nine years in the WNBA, the past two of which she has spent with the Washington Mystics, the NBA's Washington Wizards offered Toliver the chance to take the first step toward her longtime desire to coach after her playing days are over. The Wizards made Toliver an assistant coach this season - the first active WNBA player to serve as an NBA assistant.
There was only one problem. Toliver, according to the New York Times, is making just $10,000 for a season of work with the Wizards - well below what NBA assistants normally make, which can stretch from around $100,000 to more than $1 million, depending on the experience of the coach.
"It wasn't an easy decision," Toliver told the New York Times. "For me, I looked at the pros and the cons, the pros obviously being I get to rest my body, it being my first time in 10 years of not playing year-round, not going overseas. Obviously there are financial burdens that come with that, but this is also a very exciting opportunity that I want to take advantage of, being home, still being around the game, around the best players in the world, around the best coaches in the world."
Toliver's low pay is the result of the Wizards and Mystics' ownership structure. Because Ted Leonsis owns both teams, the WNBA determined that Toliver's pay as an NBA assistant had to come out of the $50,000 total each WNBA team allocates to pay their players for offseason work.
Mike Bass, who oversees public relations for both leagues, cited competitive fairness for the WNBA's decision. The Mystics are one of five teams in the WNBA that share an owner with an NBA team in the same market.
"While it's necessary for competitive fairness to ensure the integrity of the W.N.B.A. salary cap, the league is committed to providing robust career development opportunities to both current and former players," Bass told the Times.
The news of Toliver's low salary comes after a WNBA season in which players spoke loudly about the desire for a larger slice of revenue, what many around the league perceive as a lack of resources directed at marketing the women's game, and unfair treatment of WNBA players.
Elena Delle Donne, Toliver's Mystics teammate and one of the biggest stars in the WNBA, spoke out last spring after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told ESPN about what he believes to be the WNBA's deficiencies from a business standpoint. Delle Donne issued a statement on social media at the time and continued to speak on the issue throughout the season.
When the Las Vegas Aces canceled a game against the Mystics in Washington after 25 hours of flight delays, players spoke about the difficulties of flying commercial, especially when traveling two time zones in a short period of time. NBA teams fly charter.
The WNBA players' union also announced in November that it is opting out of the current collective bargaining agreement after the 2019 season.
Terri Jackson, the executive director of the WNBPA, told the Times that the union is concerned about the pay gap between Toliver and other NBA assistants and plans to examine the issue in negotiations.

An Average Day at the El Chapo Trial

Texto completo: Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.
Covering a major prosecution such as the drug conspiracy trial of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican crime lord known as El Chapo, is, I imagine, a bit like commuting to work on a space station. It takes a long time to make it to your job and actually get inside the courtroom. Once you're there, you tend to feel as if you're floating in an isolated capsule, far away from Earth.
The trial began two months ago in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, but for the dozen or so reporters who have shown up every day -- and plan to be there until the end comes in another month or two -- it has seemed like an eternity. Routines have formed. Inside jokes have developed. As a community of El Chapo watchers, we study the defendant's choice of clothing and try to read the cryptic expressions that every now and then flicker across his face.
I have been covering trials on and off for almost 20 years, but this trial, more than most, has been a true immersive experience. Here are a few notes -- jotted down on a morning of quiet testimony -- about what an average day at the El Chapo trial is like.
Before court: The line to enter Room 8D, where the trial is being heard, starts to form at 7 a.m. But the courtroom doesn't open until 8:30 a.m., leaving plenty of time for idle conversation.
Naturally, most of that concerns the trial itself. Standing in the hallway with cups of snack-bar coffee, we often go over favorite moments: for example, when Mr. Guzmán's former personal secretary described surviving a hand grenade attack in jail by hiding behind his toilet. Or that time a bald defense lawyer joked with a witness about how he liked his hair plugs.
We also play a kind of parlor game, trying to determine which secret witness might next appear in court to testify against Mr. Guzmán. From well before the trial began, the government has gone to great lengths to protect the witnesses' identities, concerned that one of Mr. Guzmán's allies in the Sinaloa drug cartel might find a way to silence them. Public court records have provided clues, but it has largely been a guessing game. Sometimes our suspicions have been right; sometimes we've been totally surprised.
During court: The trial begins each day at 9:30 a.m. -- after another hour-long wait. The most dramatic moment is when a group of federal marshals brings Mr. Guzmán into the courtroom from his secure holding area. He tends to wear a suit and tie these days, though once, during jury selection, he appeared in court with his shirt unbuttoned to his sternum, "Scarface"-style. He invariably gives a little wave to his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, who has shown up every day to support him.
Unless there is an issue that the parties need to discuss, Judge Brian M. Cogan calls at once for the jury, and testimony starts. So far, we have heard from the former personal secretary, another one of Mr. Guzmán's former deputies, his main supplier of Colombian cocaine, a Colombian lawyer who worked as the supplier's frontman and Mr. Guzmán's main American distributor.
Beyond a few dull patches, their stories have been riveting enough that, in 12 days of testimony, I have filled up six entire notebooks.
After court: The trial comes to a close each day at 4:30 p.m. And that's when the real work begins.
There is an old-fashioned press room -- phone booth, vintage crime scene photos -- on the first floor of the courthouse and we all rush down to write our daily stories. The atmosphere is frantic but collegial: reporters checking quotes with one another and trying to decide if a name like Ramírez needs an accent over the i.
I tend to submit my stories by 7 p.m. or so but stick around for another hour while getting edited. Even then, the day is not quite over.
On many nights, the defense or prosecution (sometimes both) files papers in the case. Reading them is a perfect way to fall asleep before getting up early in the morning to start the process all over again.

2018: How did it go so wrong?

Texto completo: Ah, 2018! I can still almost remember what it was like to be alive in February 2018. Drake was on the radio, and there was an Olympics! Did you know that there was an Olympics in 2018? Someone reminded me recently that this happened, and I ceased speaking midconversation and just sat there with my mouth hanging open. I have lost all track of time. I entered 2018 a comparatively young, spry individual; I am emerging from it broken and in need of ointment, like Scott Pruitt (a man you may have forgotten, who a very long time ago was the head of the Environmental Protection Agency).
There was once such a thing as the environment. I think I remember some aspects of it - trees; a pleasing duck; forests that were not on fire. But that was a long time ago. September, maybe?
Everything of 2018 has been with us forever. Everything that departed in 2018 has been gone for as long as we can recall. The "Queer Eye" reboot was this year! This year!
Meghan Markle married Prince Harry, a member of the hereditary monarchy of England, which was nice of her.
We responded to distressing news about the pace of climate change by deciding that it was probably too late to do anything about it, but, just to be sure, we should maybe burn a little more coal. We responded to distressing news of numerous mass shootings by deciding that it was probably too late to do anything about them, but, just to be sure, we should arm all teachers with deadly weapons.
President Trump continued to find new ways of getting people to leave his administration. At the rate he is going, soon no one will be working in his White House; everyone will be malfunctioning.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., announced he would be leaving Congress after having achieved everything a person could possibly hope to achieve without compromising anything but his morals, and is presumably headed to the grassy, pleasant place where former Speaker John Boehner frolics and posts pictures of himself with increasingly large glasses of wine.
Facebook is even creepier than we thought, it turns out. The good news about Facebook is that someone did in fact read and like everything you shared. The bad news is that this person worked for Cambridge Analytica.
In other good news, they rescued a soccer team from a cave! This just shows: If you really want your students to be safe, don't send them to school in the United States, where all kinds of bad things may happen; trap them in a cave in northern Thailand.
Special counsel Robert Mueller continued to investigate. The Mueller investigation appears to be the equivalent of when you start off by looking for something straightforward on Wikipedia and suddenly it is 3 a.m. and you are on the Wikipedia page for rat kings, with 83 tabs open and no recollection of how you got here. But the family of at least one ostrich got the measure of justice they deserved since Paul Manafort came into their lives.
The president made a new friend: Kim Jong Un! It is important to make friends - like those in Saudi Arabia - so that, hypothetically, when your intelligence apparatus later suggests they are responsible for murdering a journalist, you can accept whatever they say happened. Also, the president seems to be losing friends, who are all busy testifying or writing anonymous op-eds for the New York Times.
There was a midterm election that could be described as a blue wave only in the narrow and limited sense that it was the biggest Democratic gain in the House since the post-Watergate election. Still, some people were discouraged from voting, and that must be counted in the nature of a red win.
And 2019 is on the horizon, when we must deal with the first half of 12 Democratic primary debates. Maybe by the time they are done, the Mueller investigation will be complete, but everyone who remembers why it was started in the first place will be too aged and feeble to speak.
