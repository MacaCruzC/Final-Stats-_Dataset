Texto completo: EXETER, N.H. - Former Vice President Joe Biden is accustomed to fielding questions from voters about picking a running mate. But on Monday, he was asked a particularly provocative one: Would he consider choosing a Republican as his vice president?
"The answer is I would, but I can't think of one now," Biden said at a town hall-style event in Exeter, New Hampshire, drawing laughter from the crowd.
Biden then elaborated on what he meant. "There are some really decent Republicans that are out there still, out here's the problem right now o: the well-known ones: They've got to step up," he said.
Biden hasemphasized the need for a future Democratic president toworkwitl Republicans, stressing the importance of consensus in order to gst things done. That viewpoint las been criticized by some literals who see it as an unacceptable embrace of the status quo and others who think Biden is naive about trying to work with Republicans.
But choosing a Republican to be his running mate would be a far more grievous act in the eyes of many Democrats, something many party officials and both liberal and moderate activists would oppose.
On Monday, Biden made a point of noting that it was presumptuous to talk about a running mate, given that he has not won the Democratic nomination. He went on to recall his working relationship with President Barack Obama and their trust for each other, telling the crowd, "The only thing I know about is the qualifications for vice president."
As for his own vice-presidential pick, Biden noted that there were "a lot of qualified women" and "a lot of qualified African Americans."
"There's a plethora of really qualified people," he said. "Whomever I would pick were I fortunate enough to be your nominee, I'd pick someone who was simpático with me."
Biden, like other presidential candidates, has been largely circumspect about naming names, though he did say this month that he would consider a former rival in the race, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, as a possible running mate.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Maine Sen. Susan Collins has become the second Republican to question the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's approach to the impeachment trial of President Trump, underscoring how a few GOP defections could upset Mr. McConnell's control of the highly charged proceedings.
In an interview with Maine Public Radio, Ms. Collins said she was "open to witnesses" while the Republican leader from Kentucky wants a quick trial without witnesses.
Ms. Collins also criticized Mr. McConnell for saying that he was coordinating with the White House as it defends Mr. Trump against House-approved charges that he should be removed from office for abusing his power and obstructing Congress.
"I've heard the Senate majority leader saying that he's taking his cues from the White House," Ms. Collins said in the Monday interview. "There are senators on both sides of the aisle, who, to me, are not giving the appearance of and the reality of judging this in an impartial way."
The comments came days after Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) said she was disturbed by Mr. McConnell's promise of total coordination with the White House.
Republicans control the Senate with a narrow majority, holding 53 of 100 seats. That means that just four Republican senators breaking ranks could upend Mr. McConnell's strategy for the trial , assuming Democrats remain united behind Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). Mr. Schumer has called for hearing from four witnesses and for subpoenaing documents.
This is because Senate impeachment trials don't unfold according to any particular set of procedures. Instead, a simple majority of 51 votes would be needed to determine almost every step of the process, from witness testimony to the timing of a final vote.
The Democratic-controlled House last month voted to impeach Mr. Trump on charges that he abused power by pressuring Ukraine to initiate investigations that would help him politically, including one into former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democrat presidential nomination in 2020. The House also charged the president with obstructing Congress by blocking witnesses from testifying and subpoenaed documents. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.
One sign that Democrats in the Senate may stick with Mr. Schumer is that Sen. Doug Jones (D., Ala.), who is up for re-election next year in a deep-red state, wrote an op-ed published Monday in the Washington Post that backed Mr. Schumer's call to hear from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and a top aide, Robert Blair, along with former national security adviser John Bolton and Office of Management and Budget official Michael Duffey.
Mr. Schumer on Monday repeated his calls for the four witnesses to testify, citing a New York Times story that detailed some of their actions as Mr. Trump moved to withhold nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine without telling Congress.
"This new reporting shows that there were serious concerns raised by Trump administration officials about the propriety and legality of what the president was doing," Mr. Schumer said on Monday at a news conference in New York.
Messrs. Schumer and McConnell have remained deadlocked over the format of the trial. Mr. McConnell wants to open the trial first, and hold votes for witnesses after opening arguments—the same procedure as followed during the 1999 impeachment trial of former President Bill Clinton.
Mr. McConnell's office and the White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in hearing from witnesses, suggesting the trial would be used to unmask the whistleblower whose complaint triggered the inquiry and undermine others who view his dealings with Ukraine as highly improper.
Mr. Schumer wants to lock in an agreement to bring in witnesses and subpoena documents, including communications between administration officials about the withholding of military assistance for Ukraine and requests for Ukraine to publicly commit to open investigations.

Texto completo: NEW YORK CITY
Education Official
Fired After Arrest
A deputy chief of staff to New York City Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza was arrested in Wisconsin, where he was charged with using a computer to facilitate a child sex crime, a city official said Monday.
David Hay has been terminated, a Department of Education spokeswoman said.
Mr. Hay became deputy chief of staff in October 2018, helping to organize Mr. Carranza's equity agenda. Department of Education officials said he didn't have regular contact with children in his role.
"These allegations are incredibly disturbing and absolutely unacceptable," department spokeswoman Miranda Barbot said by email. "We took immediate action removing Mr. Hay from payroll and are terminating him."
Anastasia Coleman, special commissioner of investigation for the city's school district, said SCI is looking into the matter and declined to comment further.
Mr. Hay was arrested Sunday by police in Neenah, Wis. He couldn't be reached for comment, and it couldn't be determined if he had a lawyer. The New York Times earlier reported the arrest and firing.
Mr. Hay began working with the city Department of Education in 2016, serving as an adviser to then-Chancellor Carmen Farina, according to his LinkedIn page. It said he had worked as a high school principal in two Wisconsin districts.

NEW YORK
Minimum Wage
Changes Take Effect
The minimum wage is rising to $15 for all workers in New York City -- making it among the first places in the country to reach the goal sought by many labor activists.
Workers elsewhere in the state will make less: $13 in the city's near suburbs and $11.80 upstate. The changes took effect Tuesday.
In 2013, New York raised the minimum wage to $9 from $7.25 for non-tipped workers. A 2016 law called for the state to eventually raise its minimum wage to $15, but phased it in at different rates for New York City, the suburbs and upstate. The law also gave New York City employers with 10 or fewer workers an extra year to make it to $15.
Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has praised the rate, which has gone up at a time when unemployment is historically low at 4% in New York. His administration recently released a report that cited such unemployment figures and rising average wages, and found "negligible, if any impacts" on labor demands throughout the state.
Critics have said businesses might be forced to cut hours and jobs because of the hike.

CONNECTICUT
Man Loses Appeal
Over Revenge Plot
A federal appeals court rejected the appeal Monday of a former Connecticut police officer convicted of trying to get the judge in his home-foreclosure case in trouble with the IRS through a bogus tax filing.
A three-judge panel of the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York dismissed the arguments of Raymond McLaughlin, who said the federal court system had no jurisdiction over him.
The judges called Mr. McLaughlin's position consistent with the "Sovereign Citizen" ideology in which proponents believe the federal government is illegitimate. The ruling said Mr. McLaughlin's argument "raises an issue that warrants a clear statement from this Court, to deter future litigants from making similar claims."
A federal jury in Hartford convicted Mr. McLaughlin, a former Windsor police officer, in 2018 of making a false statement on a federal tax form. He was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison.
Federal prosecutors said Mr. McLaughlin, of East Hartford, sent documents to the Internal Revenue Service in 2014 falsely stating that he had paid Judge Robert Vacchelli and the court system about $332,000, with the apparent goal of getting the judge in trouble with the IRS for not paying taxes on that income.

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign is moving its headquarters to Times Square.
The former three-term New York City mayor announced to staff Monday that his new campaign headquarters will open in early January on the eighth floor of 229 W. 43rd St., the building previously home to the New York Times.
The move comes slightly more than a month after the billionaire businessman launched his late Democratic presidential bid. With more than 300 staffers, the campaign has outgrown its current headquarters on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a campaign spokesperson said.
The new campaign headquarters will occupy one floor of the historic Midtown building and include an open-office layout -- a design the 77-year-old former mayor used both at City Hall and at his company, Bloomberg LP.
"Walls just get in the way, by stifling communication and making collaboration more difficult," Mr. Bloomberg said in an email to staff Monday. "Some people like to build walls. I like to tear them down."
"My desk will be out in the open like everyone else's, and I'll be coming by to see how each team is doing," Mr. Bloomberg said.
The campaign headquarters also will display countdown clocks like those he used in City Hall. These clocks will show the number of days until Super Tuesday and the general election -- March 3 and November 3, respectively -- his staff note. The office's conference rooms and other spaces will be named after states and the number of delegates each one sends to the Democratic National Convention, which is slated for July in Milwaukee.
If he makes it to the White House, Mr. Bloomberg told staff, he would transform the East Room "into an open office environment, where I'll sit side by side with our team." He said he would use the Oval Office "for some official functions."
A representative from Columbia Property Trust, which owns the office space in the building, declined to comment. Jared Kushner, White House senior adviser and President Trump's son-in-law, also owns several floors of the building.
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has in recent weeks opened offices in states including Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and North Carolina, with plans to open more in other states. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the Bloomberg campaign plans to keep staffers and offices in six battleground states through the general election, even if Mr. Bloomberg isn't the presidential nominee.
Since joining the crowded 2020 Democratic field in late November, Mr. Bloomberg has expanded his campaign efforts in New York in the months before the state's April 28 presidential primary.
One of the world's richest people, Mr. Bloomberg has said he would self-fund his campaign. Just before entering the race, he launched a $100 million digital-advertising campaign, targeting Mr. Trump.

Mr. Biden, like other presidential candidates, has been largely circumspect about naming names, though he did say this month that he would consider a former rival in the race, Senator Kamala Harris of California, as a possible running mate. He also said that he would consider another primary rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
In November, Mr. Biden referenced four female Democrats as possible running mates: Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, both of New Hampshire; Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader and the party's nominee for governor there in 2018; and Sally Q. Yates, the former acting attorney general who was fired by President Trump in 2017. Mr. Biden did not name the women, but rather referred to them indirectly -- in the case of Ms. Abrams, as "the woman who should have been the governor of Georgia."

David Hay has been terminated, an Education Department spokeswoman said Monday. Mr. Hay became deputy chief of staff in October 2018, helping to organize Mr. Carranza's equity agenda. Department of Education officials said he didn't have regular contact with children in his role.
"These allegations are incredibly disturbing and absolutely unacceptable," department spokeswoman Miranda Barbot said by email. "We took immediate action removing Mr. Hay from payroll and are terminating him. We referred this to the Special Commissioner of Investigation and we will fully comply with any investigation."
Anastasia Coleman, Special Commissioner of Investigation for the city's school district, said SCI is looking into the matter and declined to comment further.
Mr. Hay was arrested Sunday by police in Neenah, Wisc. He couldn't be reached for comment, and it couldn't be determined if he had a lawyer. The New York Times earlier reported the story.
Mr. Hay attended Harvard University Graduate School of Education and began working with the city Department of Education in 2016, serving as an adviser to then-Chancellor Carmen Farina, according to his LinkedIn page. It said he had worked as a high school principal in two Wisconsin districts.
Mr. Hay earned $168,444 in 2019, according to payroll data collected by the Empire Center, a think tank based in Albany.

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign is moving its headquarters to Times Square.
The former three-term New York City mayor announced to staff Monday that his new campaign headquarters will open in early January on the eighth floor of 229 W. 43rd St., the building previously home to the New York Times.
The move comes slightly more than a month after the billionaire businessman launched his late Democratic presidential bid. With more than 300 staffers, the campaign has outgrown its current headquarters on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a campaign spokesperson said.
The new campaign headquarters will occupy one floor of the historic Midtown building and include an open-office layout —a design the 77-year-old former mayor used both at City Hall and at his company, Bloomberg LP.
"Walls just get in the way, by stifling communication and making collaboration more difficult," Mr. Bloomberg said in an email to staff Monday. "Some people like to build walls. I like to tear them down."
"My desk will be out in the open like everyone else's, and I'll be coming by to see how each team is doing," Mr. Bloomberg said.
The campaign headquarters also will display countdown clocks like those he used in City Hall. These clocks will show the number of days until Super Tuesday and the general election—March 3 and November 3 respectively—his staff note.
The office's conference rooms and other spaces will be named after states and the number of delegates each one sends to the Democratic National Convention, which is slated for July in Milwaukee.
If he makes it to the White House, Mr. Bloomberg told staff, he would transform the East Room "into an open office environment, where I'll sit side by side with our team." He said he would use the Oval Office "for some official functions."
A representative from Columbia Property Trust, which owns the office space in the building, declined to comment. Jared Kushner, White House senior adviser and President Trump's son-in-law, also owns several floors of the building.
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has in recent weeks opened offices in states including Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and North Carolina, with plans to open more in other states. The Wall Street Journal previously has reported that the Bloomberg campaign plans to keep staffers and offices in six battleground states through the general election, even if Mr. Bloomberg isn't the presidential nominee.
Since joining the crowded 2020 Democratic field in late November, Mr. Bloomberg has expanded his campaign efforts in New York in the months before the state's April 28 presidential primary.
One of the world's richest people, Mr. Bloomberg has said he would self-fund his campaign. Just before entering the race, he launched a $100 million digital-advertising campaign , targeting Mr. Trump.

PROTECTING RELIGIOUS LIBERTY EVANGELICALS SHOULD THANK TRUMP FOR HIS JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS

Texto completo: Evangelicals who minimize the importance of President Donald Trump's judicial appointments betray a naivete about the perils to religious liberty in the United States, perils that have been growing over the past decade.
Many people, outside of the relatively small group of constitutional law professors and Supreme Court and appeals courts practitioners, may not grasp the sheer number of cases on the religious clauses of the First Amendment that have reached the high court in recent years. Six of these cases illustrate the stakes. (There are scores more religious liberty cases that are resolved in federal district and circuit courts, as clashes between the world of faith and the vast administrative state in the United States accelerate.)
In 2014, in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores , the Supreme Court decided, by a 5-4 vote, that the Affordable Care Act's mandate that for-profit corporations supply their employees with contraceptives - even forms of contraception violating the corporations' owners' beliefs - was barred by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Had the court majority gone the other way, there is no doubt that Hobby Lobby, a company employing 32,000, would have closed. The Green family, who owns that company, was not going to "bend the knee" to the demands of the government had they lost. Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia sided with the company's religious liberty interests.
Also in 2014, in the case Town of Greece v. Galloway, the court - again by a vote of 5-4 and again with Kennedy and Scalia in the majority - held that a town's practice of opening its town board meetings with a prayer offered by members of the clergy did not violate the Constitution's establishment clause because that practice was consistent with the tradition long followed by Congress and state legislatures. Greece did not discriminate against minority faiths in determining who offered prayers, and the prayers did not coerce participation by anyone. Secular absolutists wanted this and similar practices in other jurisdictions banned.
The court in 2017, by a vote of 7-2, ruled in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia Inc. v. Comer that excluding religious organizations from aid programs run by governments violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. That two members of the court thought religious preschools were banned from state grants to upgrade playgrounds for safety purposes illustrates just how extreme is the anti-religion animus among some within the judiciary.
The court's 2018 ruling in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission upheld the right of a baker to refuse to make a cake for a same-sex wedding, but only because the Colorado Civil Rights Commission seemed hostile toward religion. Don't be misled by the 7--2 vote. It was a very close-run decision. Meanwhile, the persecution of the baker by Colorado's extreme anti-faith militants has continued.
The court, also in 2018 and again by a 5-4 vote, held in National Institute of Family Life Advocates v. Becerra that a California law violated the First Amendment because it required "pro-life" pregnancy centers to provide notices about the availability of abortion services. These centers are almost always run by faith-based groups. The California law was a "jam down" statute by the abortion-rights forces dominant in the California legislature, which has moved further to the left in recent years.
The Supreme Court held the line against absurd interpretations of the Constitution's bar on establishment of religion in 2019's American Legion v. American Humanist Association. Although the lower court had ordered the demolition of a large cross that had stood in a public park in Maryland for a century, the court - voting 7-2 - held that the display and maintenance of such a large memorial by a local government did not violate the establishment clause. Keep in mind the lower court had held exactly the opposite.
Battles over religious liberty continue. The court has recently agreed to review decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit crucial to the future of religious education. The high court's decision should arrive by June. In this proceeding, the decisions of two Catholic schools - St. James School in Torrance, Calif., and Our Lady of Guadalupe School in Hermosa Beach. Calif. - concerning two teachers and whether they could continue to teach at these schools were upheld by trial courts but reversed by two different panels of the 9th Circuit, thought the most liberal circuit court in the country. This is a major free-exercise case that will affect tens of thousands of faith-based schools.
Critics of the president who play down the importance of Mr. Trump's judicial appointments make an enormous mistake. For those whose faith is crucial to their lives, "Trump judges" make all the difference in the world.

Nonprofit boards and your personal liability

Texto completo: In our last two columns you’ve read about some of the responsibilities of a director on a nonprofit’s board. You may now be thinking, “But why? I’m a volunteer!”
And so enters the lawyer to tell you why in two words: personal liability.
When is a board member liable?
While a board member is a volunteer and afforded substantial protection by law, when duties to the organization are violated (whether through acts or omissions), when certain taxes aren’t paid (notably, payroll taxes), or when a board member engages in self-dealing transactions with the organization or allows others to do so, personal liability may arise.
What are their legal duties?
A nonprofit board member, sometimes called a “trustee,” is a fiduciary — a person who must act for the benefit of another. In this case, a board member is charged with acting for the benefit of the public. It is a serious duty, and a breach of the duties can result in both personal liability and the loss of the entity’s tax exemption.
So what are those duties? In general, a board member owes the duties of care and loyalty.
The duty of care
The duty of care requires the following:
* Exercising proper business judgment based on the best interest of the organization (not its board members and certainly not yourself)
* Being properly informed on all matters voted on, and attending the meetings
* Appropriate information flow in and out (you’re obtaining all information you need to make an informed decision), and you’re not disclosing confidential information to anyone
* Following the organization’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
A board member who violates their duty of care (for example, does not attend meetings, or ask questions about matters they don’t understand, or who, through inaction, allows a behavior detrimental to the organization to continue) can be held personally liable for any damage that occurs. There is a California case where a board, because they couldn’t agree on which investment adviser to hire, allowed a multi-million-dollar gift to sit in a non-interest checking account for two years. This caused the organization to lose significant income, and the board members were held personally liable for that. And, they were removed from the board by the Attorney General.
The duty of loyalty
This requires a board member’s faithful pursuit of the interests of the organization they serve and not the financial or other interests of the director or another person or organization. California law prohibits self-dealing transactions between board members and non-profits.
Serious fines can be imposed against the organization and board members if a transaction is entered into between the organization and an interested director, without steps taken to assure that the corporation did it for its own benefit in a fair and reasonable way that was approved in good faith by a majority of directors then in office (not just those at the meeting where the vote is taken), Did they know material facts? And, prior to approval, did the board consider and determine in good faith after reasonable investigation that they could not have obtained a better deal elsewhere?
Say, for example, the organization needs to paint its building. Director Dave is a long-term board member who happens to own a painting business. Dave offers to paint the building for $X and get it done in the next 48 hours. Board members cannot simply decide Dave is a good guy and deserves some business in return for his years of service, plus, he’s willing to do it quickly so why bother looking elsewhere.
No, the board needs to get bids from other painters and make sure that Dave’s price and quality is the best deal. Does the building need to be painted quickly or does that just to suit Dave’s schedule? Is the price fair? Is Dave properly licensed and bonded?
In other words, board members need to do the same due diligence they would for their selves. If they don’t, they could be liable for the funds lost by the organization. And abstaining from the vote won’t help you — if you don’t feel the board has done its due diligence, you will only be spared personal liability by voting “No.”
The IRS wants a word, too
Board members can also encounter unexpected tax liabilities. The IRS has its own rules against self-dealing (or what it calls “Excess Benefit Transactions”). If a “disqualified person” (someone who in the previous five years was in a position of influence over the organization, such as major donors, board members and executive staff) engages in a transaction with the organization that was to the benefit of the disqualified person, the IRS can exert a penalty against not just the disqualified person, but the entire board, for as much as 200% of the amount of the transaction. If Director Dave had been paid more than the going rate for his painting services, he and the board could face these penalties.
And finally, perhaps most shockingly, board members can be held personally liable for the unpaid payroll tax liabilities of the organization. If payroll taxes are not paid, the IRS will look to all responsible parties — the CEO, the CFO, and often board members — to recover the taxes. This is a very good reason for checks and balances for non-profit financial matters and regular audits.
Emphasis on service
It’s a privilege to serve on a non-profit board. First and foremost it’s a service to the community. To perform that service, always look out for the organization first. And. you should also be certain the organization carries Directors & Officers Liability insurance. It’s the smart thing to do.

REVIEW --- Word on the Street: From a Civil War Battle To Arguments Over Trump's Impeachment

Texto completo: [Stonewall]
One article of impeachment drafted by House Democrats against President Trump outlines a charge officially known as "obstruction of Congress," but politicians and pundits alike often favor giving it a snappier one-word label: "stonewalling."
The impeachment resolution passed by the House alleges that Mr. Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine's president to announce investigations that would benefit him politically and that he obstructed Congress by preventing officials from testifying and blocking the release of related records.
As House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler put it during the impeachment debate on Dec. 18, "President Trump stonewalled Congress's investigation to cover up his misconduct." Mr. Nadler's counterpart on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, echoed the phrasing, saying that Republicans had "made their choice, despite this president and the White House stonewalling every subpoena, every request for witnesses and testimony from this coequal branch of government." (The Trump administration has said it is essentially boycotting an episode of partisan overreach.)
The "stone wall" metaphor might seem straightforward to describe obstructive or uncooperative procedural tactics. But the historical route of "stonewalling" into U.S. politics has been circuitous.
The immovable metaphor is most famously associated with Thomas Jonathan Jackson, a Confederate general in the Civil War who stubbornly held his ground at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. As the story goes, an officer yelled out, "There stands Jackson like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians!" The "Stonewall" nickname stuck as his military exploits grew legendary.
Yet Stonewall Jackson was never described as "stonewalling." Australian cricketers turned the word into a verb of obstruction. As used in cricket slang Down Under, "stonewalling" in the late 19th century described a batter playing defensively by continually blocking balls rather than trying to score.
That obstinacy was transferred to Australia's political arena, with "stonewalling" used to refer to obstructive parliamentary tactics. In 1875, when liberal leader Graham Berry lost his power as premier in the state of Victoria, his backers became known as "stonewallers" thanks to their dogged opposition to the conservative government.
"Stonewalling" remained rarely used in the U.S. through much of the 20th century. A New York Times columnist wrote in 1958 that Dwight Eisenhower's secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, was "stonewalling for time in order to close the missile gap" with the Soviet Union. But it was Richard Nixon's administration that turned "stonewalling" into a regular item in the political lexicon. William Safire, who worked as a speechwriter for Nixon, recalled first hearing the term in late 1969 from Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who complained that "the North Vietnamese are stonewalling us."
The Watergate tapes offer a glimpse of how the usage spread within the White House. On one tape from February 1973, White House counsel John Dean told the president, "We are stonewalling totally." Nixon picked up on the term a month later, telling his associates, "I want you all to stonewall it, let them plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up, or anything else." That led Congress to draft a charge of obstruction of justice as one of Nixon's articles of impeachment.
Many political scholars see Mr. Trump's resistance as going further. Harvard Law School professor Noah Feldman observed in a Bloomberg opinion column that "no other president has ever stonewalled Congress entirely when it comes to impeachment," since even Nixon "allowed some executive branch witnesses to testify and provided some documents to Congress." Time, and a Senate trial, will tell whether cracks may emerge in Trump's stone wall.

Texto completo: Readers react to an editorial in Christianity Today that harshly criticized the president.
To the Editor:
Re "Evangelicals Closing Ranks With President" (front page, Dec. 21), about reaction to a Christianity Today editorial calling for President Trump's removal:
When I was a child, the parable about George Washington confessing to cutting down the cherry tree left several questions floating around in my head, but the message was clear -- telling the truth is a fundamental virtue exemplified by the first president of our great country.
Our current president provides a shocking contrast and shameful example to Americans of all ages. He repeatedly, publicly and unapologetically violates nearly all the moral precepts fundamental to every religious community in our country. Yet until the clear and bold statement from an important portion of the evangelical Christian community, most of our religious leaders have been silent while the president disregards and undermines core values they spend their lives professing.
I helped organize and worked closely with Jewish, Christian and Muslim leaders in the United States, Israel and the Palestinian Authority with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I deeply respect their faith, appreciate the organizational constraints within which they exercise leadership and have applauded their courageous public statements. But their remarkable silence in the face of the president's abject immorality is an abdication of their leadership responsibility, and undermines the credibility of the faith communities to which they have dedicated their lives.
Does it take the fresh eyes and innocence of a child to say, "The emperor has no clothes"?

To the Editor:
Like many Americans, I don't like President Trump's rude and hostile tweets and comments; I abhor his lack of both repentance and humility. For these reasons, as an evangelical Christian, I would never hold up Mr. Trump as an example of someone who lives out his Christian faith. But morality has never been a qualification for the office of president.
We Christians should understand what the left really wants, and it isn't a president of high moral standing. Among other objectives, what many on the left really want is to trample our right to exercise our religious beliefs as we see fit.
Many on the left are up in arms because some Christians do not want to do things that conflict with their religious beliefs, like provide abortion services or wedding services for same-sex couples. We may or may not agree with these beliefs, but we should support the right of our fellow Christians and people of other faiths to believe these things. Mr. Trump will support those rights; Democrats would trample them.
Our country and our Christian faith can survive immoral presidents; we have done so in the past. Surviving a president who will wreck our country's longstanding and constitutionally guaranteed right of religious liberty will be much harder.

To the Editor:
Re "That Editorial Won't Sway Evangelicals" (Op-Ed, Dec. 23):
Sarah Posner misses the point about the Christianity Today editorial that held President Trump accountable because he "attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president's political opponents." The editor showed immense courage by not only observing that Mr. Trump violated the Constitution but also saying his actions are "profoundly immoral."
The point is not that the editorial was going to sway entrenched so-called Christians who have embraced a hate-filled and racist-supporting president. The point is that it told the truth about a man who garners evangelical support "in spite of his blackened moral record," as the editor said.
I am not aware of any publication on the right that has spoken the truth about this president and risked his wrath and the virulent attacks from a base that brooks no critique of its hero. Hats off to Mark Galli, the magazine's editor in chief.

Texto completo: The killings of three women and six children, members of a binational community that farms land in northern Mexico, reverberated worldwide.
MEXICO CITY -- The police chief of a small town near Mexico's border with the United States has been arrested on suspicion that he was involved in the massacre of nine women and children of a Mormon family last month, the Mexican authorities said Friday.
The federal authorities arrested Fidel Alejandro Villegas, the police chief in the town of Janos in the state of Chihuahua, as part of their investigation into the Nov. 4 attack in a remote region in the neighboring state of Sonora.
Mr. Villegas was arrested this week on suspicion of protecting organized crime in the region and of colluding in the killings, a spokesman for Mexico's Public Security Ministry said.
He is the fourth person to be arrested on suspicion of participating in the murder of the three woman and six children, members of a binational Mormon community that farms land in northern Mexico. The case has reverberated across the border, with President Trump once threatening to designate Mexican organized crime groups as foreign terrorist organizations.
The women and children, dual citizens of Mexico and the United States, were traveling in sports utility vehicles on a remote country road when they were attacked by gunmen believed to belong to an organized crime group. Federal officials have said that they are investigating the possibility that the victims were mistaken for members of a rival group.
The F.B.I. has worked with the Mexican authorities in the investigation.
Julián LeBarón, a cousin of the victims, said that the arrest of the Janos police chief confirms that Mexican law enforcement often collaborates with organized crime. "It's common knowledge down here that the police work with the criminals," he said by telephone from Chihuahua.
"They have a monopoly on security and they get paid a wage for protection, and later we find out that they participate in the murder of women and children," he said. "These people take resources to protect us and they are murderers themselves."
Mexico is about to close its most violent year on record, with 32,600 murders reported through November.
The violence is proving to be the biggest challenge to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has centered his crime-fighting strategy around a new law enforcement agency, the National Guard, and promised that an emphasis on social policies would address the root causes of crime.
But the National Guard proved to be of little help on the day the members of the extended LeBarón and Langford families were killed. The authorities did not arrive at the scene until 10 hours later, Mr. LeBarón said.
"I've been marching in Mexico and speaking out against the violence," he said. "And I have never seen a case where a victim has had justice." Mr. LeBarón's brother was killed 10 years ago when he stood up to local gangs and nobody has been tried for that crime, he said.
"The justice system has collapsed," he said. "The impunity rate is almost 100 percent."

David Leonhardt: The press has a bias for centrism, and calls it objectivity

Texto completo: John F. Harris is about as mainstream as the mainstream media gets. He spent 21 years at The Washington Post, including as its political editor. Then he became the founding editor of Politico, where he is now a columnist.
Last month, Harris wrote a column that I can’t get out of my head. In it, he argued that political journalism suffers from “centrist bias.” As he explained, “This bias is marked by an instinctual suspicion of anything suggesting ideological zealotry, an admiration for difference-splitting, a conviction that politics should be a tidier and more rational process than it usually is.”
The bias caused much of the media to underestimate Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Donald Trump in 2016. It also helps explain the negative tone running through a lot of the coverage of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this year.
Centrist bias, as I see it, confuses the idea of centrism (which is very much an ideology) with objectivity and fairness. It’s an understandable confusion, because American politics is dominated by the two major parties, one on the left and one on the right. And the overwhelming majority of journalists at so-called mainstream outlets — national magazines, newspapers, public radio, the non-Fox television networks — really are doing their best to treat both parties fairly.
In doing so, however, they often make an honest mistake: They equate balance with the midpoint between the two parties’ ideologies. Over the years, many press critics have pointed out one weakness of this approach: false equivalence, the refusal to consider the possibility that one side of an argument is simply (or mostly) right.
But that’s not the only problem. There’s also the possibility that both political parties have been wrong about something and that the solution, rather than being roughly halfway between their answers, is different from what either has been proposing.
This seemingly radical possibility turns out to be quite common, as the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. — author of the classic book “The Vital Center,” no less — pointed out. The abolition of slavery, women’s suffrage, labor rights, the New Deal, civil rights for black Americans, Reagan’s laissez-faire revolution and same-sex marriage all started outside the boundaries of what either party favored. “The most consequential history,” Harris wrote, “is usually not driven by the center.”
Political and economic journalism too often assumes otherwise and treats the center as inherently sensible. This year’s Democratic presidential campaign has been a good case study. The skeptical questions posed to the more moderate Democrats are frequently about style or tactics: Are you too old? Too young? Too rich? Too far behind in the polls?
The skeptical questions for the more progressive candidates, Sanders and Warren, often challenge the substance of their ideas: Are you too radical? Are you being realistic? And, by golly, how would you pay for it all?
I recently took a detailed look through the coverage of the wealth tax, favored by both Sanders and Warren, and centrist bias seeps through much of it. The coverage has slanted negative, filled with the worries that centrists have — that the tax wouldn’t work in practice or would slow economic growth.
Experts who favor a wealth tax, like Gene Sperling, Felicia Wong and Heather Boushey, or whose academic research suggests it would work, like Lily Batchelder and David Kamin, have received less attention than experts who don’t like the idea. For that matter, the complaints of obscure billionaires have gotten more attention than the arguments of sympathetic experts. “Billionaire whining about a wealth tax,” as Ilyana Kuziemko, a Princeton economist who’s sympathetic to a wealth tax, told me, mostly isn’t newsworthy.
I’m not suggesting that journalists lather the wealth tax with praise. There are real questions about it, and journalists are supposed to be skeptical. I’m also not suggesting that Sanders or Warren is necessarily the best nominee. As regular readers know, I’m a moderate on Medicare, immigration and college debt, among other subjects. John Harris, for his part, confesses to “a pretty strong bout” of centrist bias.
But maybe that’s why we recognize it and pine for more objective coverage. Not every policy question posed to Democrats needs to have a conservative assumption, and not every question posed to Republicans needs to have a liberal one. If Warren and Sanders are going to be asked whether their solutions go too far, Joe Biden should be asked whether his solutions are too timid: Mr. Vice President, many economists believe that inequality is bad for an economy, so are you doing enough to attack inequality?
Once you start thinking about centrist bias, you recognize a lot of it. It helps explain why the 2016 presidential debates focused more on the budget deficit, a topic of centrist zealotry, than climate change, almost certainly a bigger threat. (Well-funded deficit advocacy plays a role too.) Centrist bias also helps explain the credulousness of early coverage during the Iraq and Vietnam wars. Both Democrats and Republicans, after all, largely supported each war.
The world is more surprising and complicated than centrist bias imagines it to be. Sometimes, people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are right. Even when they’re not, they deserve the same skepticism that other politicians do — no less, no more.

'Stonewall': From the Civil War Battlefield to Impeachment Skirmishes; After the First Battle of Bull Run, the term leaped to Australian cricket pitches before entering modern American political lingo

One article of impeachment drafted by House Democrats against President Trump outlines a charge officially known as "obstruction of Congress," but politicians and pundits alike often favor giving it a snappier one-word label: "stonewalling."
The impeachment resolution passed by the House alleges that Mr. Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine's president to announce investigations that would benefit him politically and that he obstructed Congress by preventing officials from testifying and blocking the release of related records.
As House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler put it during the impeachment debate on Dec. 18, "President Trump stonewalled Congress's investigation to cover up his misconduct." Mr. Nadler's counterpart on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, echoed the phrasing, saying that Republicans had "made their choice, despite this president and the White House stonewalling every subpoena, every request for witnesses and testimony from this coequal branch of government." (The Trump administration has said it is essentially boycotting an episode of partisan overreach.)
The "stone wall" metaphor might seem straightforward to describe obstructive or uncooperative procedural tactics. But the historical route of "stonewalling" into U.S. politics has been circuitous.
The immovable metaphor is most famously associated with Thomas Jonathan Jackson, a Confederate general in the Civil War who stubbornly held his ground at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. As the story goes, an officer yelled out, "There stands Jackson like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians!" The "Stonewall" nickname stuck as his military exploits grew legendary.
Yet Stonewall Jackson was never described as "stonewalling." Australian cricketers turned the word into a verb of obstruction. As used in cricket slang Down Under, "stonewalling" in the late 19th century described a batter playing defensively by continually blocking balls rather than trying to score.
That obstinacy was transferred to Australia's political arena, with "stonewalling" used to refer to obstructive parliamentary tactics. In 1875, when liberal leader Graham Berry lost his power as premier in the state of Victoria, his backers became known as " stonewallers " thanks to their dogged opposition to the conservative government.
"Stonewalling" remained rarely used in the U.S. through much of the 20th century. A New York Times columnist wrote in 1958 that Dwight Eisenhower's secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, was "stonewalling for time in order to close the missile gap" with the Soviet Union. But it was Richard Nixon's administration that turned "stonewalling" into a regular item in the political lexicon. William Safire, who worked as a speechwriter for Nixon, recalled first hearing the term in late 1969 from Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who complained that "the North Vietnamese are stonewalling us."
The Watergate tapes offer a glimpse of how the usage spread within the White House. On one tape from February 1973, White House counsel John Dean told the president, "We are stonewalling totally." Nixon picked up on the term a month later, telling his associates, "I want you all to stonewall it, let them plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up, or anything else." That led Congress to draft a charge of obstruction of justice as one of Nixon's articles of impeachment.
Many political scholars see Mr. Trump's resistance as going further. Harvard Law School professor Noah Feldman observed in a Bloomberg opinion column that "no other president has ever stonewalled Congress entirely when it comes to impeachment," since even Nixon "allowed some executive branch witnesses to testify and provided some documents to Congress." Time, and a Senate trial, will tell whether cracks may emerge in Trump's stone wall.

As Pelosi plays games with impeachment, what now, GOP?

Resumen: The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, at around 8 p.m., the Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

Texto completo: The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. The votes, in which two articles of impeachment passed, were held around midday. By 3 p.m., the House had named its impeachment managers and physically delivered the articles to the Senate for trial.
Impeachment was on. The House, controlled by a Republican majority, was serious about its ultimately failed effort to remove Clinton from office.
Contrast that to today. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, at around 8 p.m., the Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately announced the House would not appoint managers, and the articles would not be delivered to the Senate. The next day, Pelosi told reporters she did not want to talk anymore about it, and the House went into recess until Jan. 7.
Impeachment was not on, or at least a Senate trial was not on. Pelosi was holding out, apparently, for better terms in a Senate trial.
Pelosi acted after a Harvard professor and zealous impeachment advocate, Laurence Tribe, published an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing the Democratic strategy should be "voting for articles of impeachment but holding off for the time being on transmitting them to the Senate."
Withholding the articles, Tribe said, would strengthen Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer’s hand as he negotiates with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the terms of the trial. It would do so, Tribe speculated, "because of McConnell’s and Trump’s urgent desire to get this whole business behind them."
Without concessions from McConnell, Tribe urged Democrats to withhold the articles indefinitely, because a trial dominated by majority Republicans "would fail to render a meaningful verdict of acquittal."
It seemed a far-fetched idea, to be generous. McConnell and Senate Republicans would be perfectly happy if they never had to hold a trial.
I asked one GOP lawmaker, via text, what the party’s reaction was. He texted back a one-word answer: "Laughter."
Nevertheless, Tribe’s idea took off in some circles of the Democratic left. His column was published on Monday morning, and by Wednesday night Pelosi had adopted his plan.
Just to be clear: Pelosi has no leverage over a Senate proceeding. The Constitution gives the House the "sole power" to impeach, a power Pelosi and her majority used to its fullest. But the Constitution gives the Senate the "sole power" to try all impeachments. The speaker of the House has no role.
Given that, Republicans have been wondering what Pelosi is up to. Crazy theories — at least they seem to be crazy theories — have emerged.
Democrats would impeach the president repeatedly. (That was actually a serious suggestion from a New York Times columnist in October.) Or Democrats would never send the articles to the Senate, to keep impeachment hanging over Trump’s head. Or whatever.
The key Democrats aren’t saying. But one plausible notion came from The Hill columnist A.B. Stoddard. There is, Stoddard said, "a lot of pressure on Democrats to wait this out until there is more to throw at the president."
It’s not clear precisely how that would work, because the House has already passed two articles of impeachment that make specific accusations.
Beyond that, withholding impeachment indefinitely in hopes that a federal investigation will come up with something big — basically what Democrats did in the Trump-Russia affair — might end in disappointment.
In any event, Pelosi is withholding the articles of impeachment. It is unclear how long she will do it, but it seems they will be withheld at least until Jan. 7, when the House returns for business. That alone will delay a Senate trial significantly.
In the limbo Pelosi has created, almost anything seems possible.

Texto completo: WAUSAU - Wausau might retract its ban on snowball fights after the question of whether you can legally throw a snowball at a friend has again drawn the attention of national media outlets.
After some national headlines this month called Wausau "the worst town in America" for outlawing snowball fights, the City Council will consider removing the word "snowball" from the ordinance at its next meeting on Jan. 14.
It was first discussed in a public health and safety committee meeting on Dec. 16.
The city has had some fun with the attention, though. The police department and City Hall cleared it up with a video explaining the snowball ordinance, where Deputy Chief Matt Barnes threw a snowball right at the back of Mayor Robert Mielke's head. (He wasn't cited for the incident.)
The video didn't spell the end of Wausau's national attention this holiday season, though.
The Associated Press recently wrote a story about a potential end to the snowball ordinance. It was picked up by newspapers like the Chicago Tribune, which published it Monday, and the Minneapolis Star Tribune.
On Tuesday, the New York Times published its own story about the snowball ordinance and the police department's video, making Wausau a national Christmas story this week.
The law on snowballs is a small part of a larger ordinance that bans people from throwing objects such as stones, arrows and yes, even snowballs, on city-owned property.
Lisa Rasmussen, City Council president, told the Associated Press it was time to reconsider the ordinance because of recent negative national attention.
Those stories included inaccurate details, such as suggesting the ordinance was recently adopted. It's actually from 1962, Barnes said.
Not to mention that the ban on snowball fights is rarely enforced. Police have written citations under the ordinance only about 10 times in the last 15 years, Barnes said.
Wausau's ordinance drew national attention after WASW-TV published a story the day before Thanksgiving. It got picked up by national outlets that wrote "factually inaccurate" articles, Barnes said.
This is not the first time the city's snowball ordinance has garnered national attention. The ordinance was mentioned on a travel blog and legal website in 2016.
Here's the full text of Wausau ordinance 9.08.020 "No person shall throw or shoot any object, arrow, stone, snowball or other missile or projectile, by hand or by any other means, at any other person or at, in or into any building, street, sidewalk, alley, highway, park, playground or other public place within the city. This subsection shall not apply to archery ranges under the supervision of the park and recreation committee, nor shall it apply to the bow hunting provisions within 9.08.010."

Teen Tied to Barnard Killing Is Questioned

Texto completo: He is believed to have wielded the knife that killed her, the police said.
Two weeks after an intensive manhunt for a 14-year-old linked to the killing of Tessa Majors, police officers finally located the teenager on Thursday at a family member's home in the Bronx.
The authorities believed that the teenager's family was shielding him until a mark on his hand healed, an official briefed on the case said. The official described the mark as consistent with a bite.
But just hours later, after he was questioned by the police, the 14-year-old was released on Thursday afternoon. It was unclear whether he would be charged in the murder of Ms. Majors, the Barnard College student who was found bleeding to death earlier this month just outside Morningside Park in Manhattan.
The police have said that Ms. Majors bit one of her three attackers during a park mugging, and that the 14-year-old is believed to be the person who wielded the knife that killed her.
Initial DNA tests performed in the case have been inconclusive, the official said, adding that the authorities were hoping that pending test results would provide crucial information. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.
The interview with the 14-year-old came a week after the Police Department had taken the unusual step of releasing a photo of a minor in an effort to find him. The chief of detectives, Rodney Harrison, announced on Thursday morning that the teenager was in custody, to the relief of police officials who are under pressure to solve the first high-profile murder under the new police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea.
But after several hours of questioning at the 26th Precinct station house in Morningside Heights, near where the killing took place, the 14-year-old was released without being charged.
"This was a significant development in the investigation process," Chief Harrison said at around 2:40 p.m. "Although he has since been released to the custody of his attorneys, the investigation remains very active."
Neighborhood Defender Services of Harlem, which is representing the teenager, declined to comment.
Ms. Majors's murder jolted a city now accustomed to low rates of violent crime, and it recalled an era three decades ago, when many parks were considered dangerous to enter after dark.
The case also evoked memories of the infamous attack on a jogger in Central Park in April 1989, and the police have been proceeding cautiously. In the 1989 case, the police and prosecutors obtained confessions from several teenagers through tough interrogation techniques. Those confessions turned out to be false.
Mark Levine, the City Council member who represents Morningside Heights, said the 14-year-old's release "has confused people in the community."
"Some wondered if the case is not strong," Mr. Levine said. "In truth, investigators are proceeding with enormous caution."
Ms. Majors, who had moved to New York from Virginia to attend Barnard months earlier, was walking in Morningside Park the night of Dec. 11 when, the police said, at least three teenagers, ages 13 and 14, tried to rob her.
She struggled, and one of her assailants stabbed her with a knife several times, the police said. A campus security guard found her fatally wounded on a sidewalk, just outside the park near West 116th Street and Morningside Drive.
A 13-year-old was arrested the next day and gave statements to the police implicating himself and two 14-year-old middle school classmates in the crime. According to two detectives who have testified at hearings, the teenager, whom The New York Times is not naming because he is not being charged as an adult, said his friends grabbed Ms. Majors from behind and took a plastic bag from her pocket. Then one stabbed her as she fought back, the 13-year-old told the police, recalling that the feathers from her down coat floated in the air.
The police tried to interview one of the 14-year-olds, but he requested a lawyer and declined to give a statement. He was released on Dec. 12.
For weeks, detectives were unable to locate the second 14-year-old. The department distributed photographs of him nine days after the murder and asked for the public's help.
The Times generally does not publish photos of minors accused of crimes.
At a news conference last week, Mr. Shea said he was troubled by the ages of people tied to an uptick of robberies in pockets of the city, including the neighborhood where Ms. Majors was attacked.
"Thirteen is young," Mr. Shea said. "I mean, I think it should disturb any New Yorker when we have a child involved in something this serious."
A public defender for the 13-year-old, who took the case after the police interviewed the teenager, has laid the groundwork to challenge his confession -- pointing out in court that even though the teenager was accompanied by his uncle when he met with detectives, the police used some techniques that might call the reliability of his statements into question.
Specifically, the defense lawyer, Hannah Kaplan of the Legal Aid Society, has said in hearings that one of the detectives badgered and yelled at the teenager. The detective also introduced the idea of the knife into the conversation even though the 13-year-old had not mentioned a knife, Ms. Kaplan said.
Beyond the 13-year-old's statements, the police have footage from security cameras of the teenagers leaving the park and one grainy video of the attack, according to the detectives' testimony in two previous hearings. They have yet to locate the murder weapon.
The Legal Aid Society has also sought to undermine the credibility of one of the detectives involved in the investigation, Wilfred Acevedo, pointing out that he has been sued several times over allegations of misconduct, including false arrest, making false accusations and withholding evidence helpful to a defendant.
None of the allegations were proved at trial, but the city settled some of the lawsuits out of court. The lawsuits were reported in Gothamist.
"These allegations of a pattern of serious misconduct cast further doubt on the case against our client, and given Acevedo's long problematic history of violating New Yorkers' constitutional rights, he simply cannot be regarded as credible," the Legal Aid Society said in a statement.
In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Shea responded, saying that Detective Acevedo and other police officials were taking extra steps to safeguard the teenagers' legal rights.
"The calculated, personal attacks against a member of the investigative team working to solve the murder of Tessa Majors is an obvious and unethical effort to make prejudicial statements outside the courtroom to affect a jury pool," Mr. Shea said. He commended Detective Acevedo's 237 arrests -- 93 of those for felony cases -- and 24 department medals.
"Trying to undermine the case by singling out one investigator, and producing dated and unproven allegations and leaking those to the press, rather than in written form to the court, is the opposite of responsible," Mr. Shea added.
As detectives were interviewing the 14-year-old on Thursday, officials at nearby Columbia University sent an email to the school community warning that several faculty and staff members at both Columbia and Barnard had received "viciously racist" robocalls from a white supremacist group. The messages were related to Ms. Majors's death, according to the email, which was sent by three Columbia vice presidents, including the school's head of public safety.
In a separate email to Barnard staff members on Wednesday night, Barnard officials described the calls as a "racist voice mail" left that afternoon. Neither email provided more details about the messages, other than describing them as "abhorrent."
The Police Department was investigating the calls, school officials said. Representatives for Barnard and Columbia declined to comment further.
Michael Gold, Jan Ransom and Andrea Salcedo contributed reporting.

Whicker: Santa Anita turns to technology in effort to limit horse tragedies

Texto completo: They will not quit running into each other. They will not quit having heart attacks, or clipping the heels of their competitors. They will not stop getting sick.
But maybe more thoroughbreds will get through this Santa Anita meet alive, thanks to a scanner that deepens the power of probability.
Santa Anita is the first track to use the Mile-Pet Scanner, developed by the veterinary medicine department at UC Davis.
Its purpose is to find things inside a horse’s leg, specifically the ankles, that will cause a problem today and tomorrow.
It will not eliminate tragic outcomes on the racetrack, but the hope is it will keep unfit horses in the barn and perhaps reduce the 2019 death toll of 37, capped by Mongolian Dream in the last steps of the last race of the Breeders’ Cup in November.
Forget all the championship performances that preceded it that weekend, before the arrival of the dreaded Green Screen. The New York Times headlined it like this: “Another Horse’s Death Overshadows Vino Rosso’s Win At Breeders’ Cup Classic.”
According to Dr. Andrew Spriet of UC Davis, the Mile-Pet finds trouble spots in two ways.
“Before, we could only see the images in two dimensions,” he said. “Now we can use three dimensions.
“And before, we could focus on the structural problems. This allows us to see what the molecular issues might be, and we can take action before it becomes a bigger injury.”
Dr. Dionne Benson is the chief veterinary officer for the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita. She points out that most of the concerning injuries involve the ankle, specifically the sesamoid bones.
We have sesamoids, too, but horses have three of them inside each limb, and they provide anchor points for the ligaments. Heavy work can cause the ligaments to rub against those bones and cause damage, which, until now, couldn’t always be seen by imaging technology.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other scans have been involved in racing for many years. But in order to properly examine a horse, you needed comprehensive anesthesia, when the horse has to lie down.
“They can’t tell us how they’re feeling coming out of anesthesia,” Dr. Benson said, “and when they do wake up it can be dangerous for them and the people working with them.”
UC Davis found a scanning technique that bypassed all that. The horses are still sedated, but they are still standing. They can be guided into a wheeled device shaped like a ring that compresses tightly around the leg.
“Since horses can sleep standing up,” Dr. Benson said, “this makes the procedure simpler and also faster.”
Spriet said four horses were recently scanned at UC Davis in a span of 35 minutes. Nine horses at Santa Anita have been examined with the Mile-Pet technology.
Still, there has to be a trigger mechanism to send a horse to the new scanner.
Trainers who feel a horse isn’t reacting normally, or even if the horse’s performance has slipped inexplicably, can ask for a Mile-Pet scan, which begins with the injection of an isotope.
“A lot of people have a misconception about a bone, as if it’s made of steel or some other substance,” Benson said. “A bone is a very active thing, and it changes, particularly after exercise. What this technology does is show us what’s going on before there is a fracture.
“It’s always a challenge, but 80 percent of the problems involve the sesamoid or something else in the fetlock area.”
Spriet emphasizes that the Stronach Group’s investment is a prime reason this technology has become available. There have been complaints about the manner of Santa Anita executives, particularly when it comes to pressuring trainers to fill out fields with horses that the trainers feel aren’t ready to run. But Stronach management, particularly with Craig Fravel on board, seems to realize another 2019 is not survivable.
There are too many downward pressures on horse racing’s popularity, and too many trainers and top horses moving east and south for bigger purses, to tolerate Santa Anita’s image as an equine graveyard.
The track also plans to install a standing MRI at the Nuclear Medical Facility early in 2020.
Spriet has said the Mile-Pet will “transform the diagnostic approach for finding pre-existing conditions in horses.”
Naturally, the picket lines won’t dissipate if the death toll goes down. Nobody applauds a pilot for a safe landing. And the fingernail-chewing will not decrease Saturday when the new meet begins.
It is not about eliminating the risk. For the short term, it’s about eliminating confusion and dread from Santa Anita’s pre-existing conditions.

Nonprofit changing immigration narrative

Texto completo: Watching the NBC show "Superstore" is like stepping into a Walmart in Middle America.
The show's big-box store called "Cloud 9" is filled with a family of employees tackling the day-to-day grind of a retail job. But the characters in the comedy, whose fifth season premiered in September, are not caricatures – they are an intricate and genuine reflection of this country's diversity.
Amelia "Amy" Sosa, the store manager played by America Ferrera, is a Honduran-American and single mother. Garrett McNeil, a Cloud 9 associate played by actor Colton Dunn, is paralyzed from the waist down.
And Mateo Liwanag, a gay Filipino store associate, is an undocumented immigrant.
The conversation around immigration was intense and highly politicized in 2016 when the writers for "Superstore" decided they wanted a main character to be undocumented.
To get the story right, NBC sought the help of an organization headquartered in Louisville: Define American.
What started as a social movement and storytelling platform asking people to #DefineAmerican, the Louisville-based nonprofit is trying to change the narrative around immigration and citizenship in the United States. It's studied the way words and images in media – from Hollywood portrayals to news articles – affect marginalized communities and the public perception of them.
In addition to "Superstore," Define American has consulted on big-name projects like ABC's "Grey's Anatomy," the longest-running television medical drama in history, and "Roswell, New Mexico," a sci-fi show on the CW.
Thousands of people have used the platform to share their stories, including an undocumented actor who was cast in Marvel's "Black Panther."
Define American, founded in 2012 by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and activist Jose Antonio Vargas, has also garnered support from high school and college students, politicians and celebrities alike.
At its core, Define American believes that before there can be policy change, there must be cultural change around immigration in the form of storytelling.
That the conversation is being led from Kentucky, the birthplace of iconic cultural figures such as Abraham Lincoln and Muhammad Ali – and the former Confederate States President Jefferson Davis – is no accident.
Louisville is a community with a starkly opposite dichotomy that has coexisted for years, said Ryan Eller, Define American's executive director.
"These juxtapositions that exist in our community are permeating just below the surface, and I can't think of a more perfect place to have this conversation," Eller said. "We think that with Define American, we can finally come together, reckon with the conflict and aspire to something new."
"It's time to start asking, who we are as a people?" Eller added.
And how do we define "American"?
'Can't you just get legal?' In the second season of "Superstore," the 2016 Olympics are in full force and Mateo's co-workers are encouraging him to be more patriotic. While stacking toys in the children's department, Mateo tells a co-worker he just doesn't understand American culture.
"(Americans) are way too into brunch, I wish Asians were allowed to vote and I don't really understand basements," he says, rolling his eyes.
Jonah, a co-worker played by Ben Feldman, interrupts Mateo to ask if he's a U.S. citizen. Mateo is defensive but then hastily makes a phone call and the scene cuts to him realizing that the ID he got from a "green card store" with his grandmother was fake.
Played by Filipino actor Nico Santos, who also appeared in "Crazy Rich Asians," Mateo's "coming out story" was one of the first times a television show on a major network portrayed an honest, nuanced depiction of what it's like to be undocumented in the U.S. – his status was neither a punchline nor a stereotype.
Mateo's fictional story resembles Vargas', who publicly came out as undocumented in a 2011 New York Times Magazine essay. Mateo, like Vargas, is gay and Filipino. And Vargas – like so many – didn't realize he was undocumented until he went to the DMV to apply for a driver's license.
Their parallel is no accident.
When Define American was brought in by NBC to consult for "Superstore," the organization gathered a room full of undocumented people who shared their stories with the production team.
Not understanding the complexity of the legal immigration system in the U.S., the show's writers wanted Mateo to come out as undocumented in one episode, and get citizenship by the next – an impossible task in real life.
It's the same question Vargas still hears every day, even after years of immigration advocacy: "Can't you just get legal?"
It's not that simple.
"All you have to do is talk to an immigrant to find out how complex, nonsensical and contradictory immigration is," Vargas said.
Depending on how someone enters the U.S., what country they originally came from, what immigration status they're seeking and who is able to sponsor or petition their stay, it can take years for someone just to be able to apply for a green card.
And for those who are undocumented, there are almost no pathways to citizenship.
The misunderstanding and culture of indifference are what Vargas has been trying to fix since he wrote that essay eight years ago.
"This is my home," Vargas wrote in the 2011 essay. "Yet even though I think of myself as an American and consider America my country, my country doesn't think of me as one of its own."
The night before his article published, Vargas prepared for the worst, afraid he'd be deported.
"What if nobody cares?" Vargas asked a friend. "What if after this big risk, when my lawyers said not to do it, what if I put everything on the line and it lands with a whimper?"
It landed with an uproar – Vargas' story drew international attention.
Soon, he was speaking at events across the country and producing a CNN documentary titled "Documented," which followed his journey.
It was at one of those talks where Eller met Vargas.
A ninth-generation Appalachian, Eller is no stranger to stereotypes. He grew up with images depicting Appalachians as no-shoes-wearing rednecks in shows like "The Beverly Hillbillies," movies like "Dukes of Hazard" and cartoons about the "Hatfield's and McCoy's."
An ordained chaplain with a history of leading nonprofits and pushing for social change in and outside of the church, Eller helped Vargas take Define American from a social movement to a storytelling platform and full-fledged nonprofit organization.
But it's not just a nonprofit. For many, like Vargas, it's a life-changing mission.
"From the beginning of founding Define American, I risked my life for this movement," Vargas said.
Vargas makes it clear he's not working on immigration policy and that his mission with Define American is to start a cultural shift surrounding the perception of immigration.
"I am not a lobbyist," Vargas said. "I'm a storyteller."
Changing the cultural narrative Define American has been at the forefront of helping storytellers in both news and entertainment think deeply about the language they use.
In a 2019 study of major U.S. news outlets, including USA TODAY, The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, Define American found that from 2014 to 2018, each of the four publications increasingly published stories with dehumanizing terms such as "illegal" and "alien." It also found the outlets frequently cited sources such as the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigration think tank.
Influenced in part by Define American's efforts to change the immigration narrative, The Associated Press announced in 2013 that it would no longer use the term "illegal" to describe people and would abandon the term "illegal immigrant."
But for some, even with a change in "accepted" language surrounding immigration, announcing oneself as undocumented is a huge risk.
At least it was for actor, Bambadjan Bamba, who took a real-life risk when he came out as undocumented three months before his role as a Nigerian militant leader in Marvel's "Black Panther," which went on to make more than $1 billion worldwide at the box office.
Bamba, whose family sought political asylum in the U.S. in 1992 after fleeing Africa's Ivory Coast, used Define American to share his story as a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient. Enacted under President Barack Obama's administration, DACA provides administrative relief from deportation for eligible immigrant youth who came to the United States when they were children. It also helps immigrants get a Social Security card, go to school and receive work permits.
The night before an L.A. Times article detailing his story was published, Bamba couldn't sleep.
"I thought, 'What's going to happen?'" he told The Courier Journal. "What if it's career suicide? What if they cut my scene out of 'Black Panther' and I never work again?"
Bamba remembers talking to his wife about the gut feeling he could no longer ignore. He was inspired by the young people coming forward in the face of President Donald Trump's administration and its decision to rescind DACA.
"I realized I had to do this for my daughter," Bamba said. "I had to remember that I didn't come all this way for nothing, that my parents didn't work so hard for me not to stand up for something."
He used his platform in Hollywood and privilege in having DACA status to advocate for those who don't.
"People were shocked to see that someone who has achieved so much in the entertainment industry is still dealing with these challenges," Bamba said.
Leading the tide of change from Louisville A few days before Define American hosted a summit in early October, where several hundred people from around the U.S. gathered at the Muhammad Ali Center in downtown Louisville, Eller's cellphone was pinging with texts from the organization's chapter leaders.
There were tears in his eyes when one of the leaders of a Define American college chapter, a medical student at Stanford, texted with the news that his father was dying. The student had to choose between coming to the Louisville conference or traveling to his father's deathbed. As a DACA recipient, he could go to the funeral in Mexico, but he could not reenter the U.S.
"He, like so many, risked a great deal to come to Louisville for the summit," Eller said.
It's why Vargas and Eller have known how important it is that Define American's efforts are grounded in Kentucky – because immigration is not just a coastal issue.
According to the American Immigration Council, immigrants make up 3% of Kentucky's population – more than 150,000 people.
"We're here in Middle America, fly-over country, where a lot of people feel ignored," Eller said. "So when we tell people we're headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, it carries a lot of weight ... because they realize we are doing something different."
For Sanchez and many others, it's about having a safe place where people can come together and share their stories and to introduce the immigration narrative to people who have never experienced it before.
"It's about trying to get people from sympathy to empathy to compassion," said Sanchez. "From looking through the window at someone in the rain, to standing next to them in the rain, to holding the umbrella over them."

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - The Taliban ambushed a peace convoy in western Afghanistan and abducted 26 activists who are members of a peace movement, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
The insurgents staged the ambush in the district of Bala Buluk in Farah province on Tuesday. The Taliban forced the six-vehicle convoy to a halt, then got into the cars and drove them and the activists to an unknown location, said provincial police spokesman Mohibullah Mohib.
According to Mohib, a police operation is underway to locate and free the activists whose convoy was going village-to-village to rally for peace.
Bismillah Watandost of the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan, to which the activists belong, said that 27 of their members were abducted by the Taliban in the Farah assault. The different figures could not immediately be reconciled.
The Taliban, who have been active in Farah, have not claimed responsibility for the abductions. However, Watandost also said that tribal elders in the province launched an effort to negotiate with the Taliban to release the abducted activists. He added that phone lines were down in the region, making communication and getting information from the area difficult.
The latest rallies by the activists from the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan started on Friday, first in southern Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold.
At a similar series of peace rallies in October, the Taliban abducted six activists from the movement in eastern Logar province but released them the same day.
Time and cost of relocation of US base in Okinawa to double
TOKYO - The relocation of a U.S. Marine Corps base to a less-crowded area of the southern Japanese island of Okinawa will take more than twice as much money and time as previously estimated because of the need to stabilize the reclaimed land it will be built on, Japan's government said Wednesday.
The Defense Ministry said the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from densely populated Ginowan to Henoko on Okinawa's eastern coast will cost $8.5 billion and take 12 years, pushing its completion into the 2030s. That adds more than a decade to the plan already delayed by more than 20 years because of local opposition.
Under an earlier plan agreed to by Tokyo and Washington in 2013, construction was to cost about $3.2 billion and take five years, with completion expected in about 2022.
Michigan AG asserts Nassar probe not suspended after all
LANSING, Mich. - Michigan's attorney general on Wednesday said her communications director's statement declaring the suspension of a nearly two-year criminal investigation into Michigan State University's handling of complaints against sexual abuser Larry Nassar was "inadvertently misleading."
Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a written statement that the investigation is ongoing.
The probe, which began under Nessel's predecessor, has resulted in charges against three former school officials. One was convicted. Two others, including former President Lou Anna Simon, were ordered to trial.
"For the record, I remain deeply committed to finding the truth about who knew what about Larry Nassar at MSU, " Nessel said.
Songwriter Allee Willis, who penned 'Friends' theme, dies
LOS ANGELES - Allee Willis, a songwriter whose work included the Broadway musical "The Color Purple" as well as the theme song from the TV show "Friends" and Earth, Wind & Fire's "September," has died. She was 72.
The cause of death Tuesday was a cardiac event, The New York Times reported, but did not specify where she died, though she had been living in Los Angeles.
Willis was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018 - more than 30 years after she won a Grammy for co-writing Patti LaBelle's "Stir It Up" for the "Beverly Hills Cop" soundtrack.
She was also nominated for an Emmy for the "Friends" theme song, "I'll Be There for You" performed by the Rembrandts but lost to the theme of "Star Trek: Voyager."
Burning Man organizers sue over US permit fees
RENO, Nev. - Burning Man organizers sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to recover millions of dollars they say the government has overcharged them in fees over the past seven years at the counterculture celebration.
Black Rock City LLC, the nonprofit that produces the annual Burning Man event, filed the lawsuit Dec. 13 in U.S. District Court in Washington.
Organizers told the Reno Gazette Journal they're tired of waiting over the past four years for the bureau to provide justification for the nearly $3 million it charges annually for a permit to hold the 80,000-person event in the Black Rock Desert about 100 miles north of Reno.
In recent years, Black Rock City has been required to reimburse the BLM, which provides law enforcement and oversight at the event, for its services and expenses.
Relief group: 216,000 have fled homes in NW Syria
BEIRUT - More than 200,000 men, women and children fled their homes in northwest Syria in buses, trucks and cars in recent weeks, amid intense air and ground bombardment by government forces, a Syrian relief group said Wednesday.
Government forces have been bombarding southern and eastern Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold in the country, since late November. A ground offensive that began last week has displaced more people and government forces have captured more than 40 villages and hamlets, according to the Syrian army and opposition activists.
The Syrian Response Coordination Group, a relief organization, said 216,632 people have fled their homes, many of them with no specific place to go. Many have been heading toward the Turkish border for safety.
In Chile: Helicopters on Wednesday dropped water on the outskirts of the Chilean port city of Valparaiso to extinguish a fire that destroyed about 150 homes.
Dozens of people living in the city's Rocuant and San Roque hills sifted through the ruins of their homes after the fire, fanned by strong winds, swept through their neighborhoods on Tuesday. Residents had been evacuated and there were no reports of casualties.
Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel said authorities believe arson caused the blaze and urged people to report any suspicious activity.
The fire was doused in urban areas but remains "active" in the woods, said Ricardo Toro, head of the national emergency office.

World News: U.S. Weighs Cut to West Africa Forces

Texto completo: The Pentagon is considering a reduction in the number of U.S. troops in Western Africa as part of a long-term strategy of shifting the focus of forces, ships and air squadrons toward potential threats from Russia and China, defense officials said Tuesday.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper is considering the shift as an early step in a proposed realignment of U.S. troop posture around the world, as spelled out in Trump administration policy documents on national security and defense, the officials said. There are approximately 7,000 American troops now deployed across Africa.
During the fall, Mr. Esper requested that officials with U.S. Africa Command, which is responsible for U.S. military operations on the continent, provide an assessment of their resource needs, one defense official said, a first step in the potential shift.
Mr. Esper has since approached all other Pentagon regional commanders with similar requests, encompassing Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Western Hemisphere, the official said.
The defense chief asked for the assessments to better align troop and resource deployments with the Pentagon's 2018 National Defense Strategy, which prioritizes great power competition, especially from Russia and China, over counterterrorism operations in places like Africa and the Middle East, the official said.
However, the U.S. has repeatedly confronted pressing needs in the Middle East, and has had difficulty following through on the strategy of refocusing security resources, officials have said.
The U.S. military first withdrew forces as part of its realignment last year when it removed roughly 700 troops, largely from West Africa.
U.S. troops in Western Africa conduct a range of counterterrorism operations against militant groups, including Boko Haram. But some policy makers question whether such groups pose a threat to the U.S. itself, which has been the criteria used for justifying such deployments in the past.
The U.S. began increasing its forces as part of a global contingent led by France following extremist gains in 2012.
The defense officials said there is no timeline for specific decisions or determinations of troop levels. Any final decision is likely to further shrink the U.S. footprint, although the Pentagon instead could decide to consolidate forces in Western Africa, the officials said.
Major changes to the number of U.S. forces in other parts of Africa are unlikely, they said. The New York Times reported on a possible shift in troops in Western Africa.
Significantly reducing U.S. troops on the continent likely would draw the ire of allies, particularly France, which still has thousands of troops deployed. Critics of the U.S. force posture have noted that both Russian and Chinese influence has expanded throughout Africa as both of those nations have funded weapons purchases, built installations or invested in local infrastructure.
The relatively small U.S. presence, together with European and local forces, has yet to contain threats from al Qaeda and a burgeoning Islamic State.
This month in Niger, which has been in a state of emergency since 2017 because of the threats from extremist groups, militants attacked a military base and killed 71 Nigerien soldiers. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.
On Saturday, during a visit to the Ivory Coast, French President Emmanuel Macron said France's troops had killed 33 militants during a raid in Mali and said the coming weeks would represent a "turning point" in the war against terrorism in the area.
In addition to West Africa, the administration is considering a troop reduction in Afghanistan, as part of peace talks between the U.S. and the insurgent Taliban movement. There are about 13,000 U.S. troops currently assigned to Afghanistan.
The Pentagon also has approximately 5,200 troops in Iraq, some of which could be withdrawn following the defeat of Islamic State units there.
After Mr. Esper completes his assessments, the responsibility for carrying out any changes in the U.S. posture would fall to the Joint Chiefs of Staff,the officials said.

The relatively small U.S. presence, together with European and local forces, has yet to contain threats from al Qaeda and a burgeoning Islamic State.
This month in Niger, which has been in a state of emergency since 2017 because of the threats from extremist groups, militants attacked a military base and killed 71 Nigerien soldiers. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.
On Saturday, during a visit to the Ivory Coast, French President Emmanuel Macron said France's troops had killed 33 militants during a raid in Mali and said the coming weeks would represent a "turning point" in the war against terrorism in the area.
In addition to West Africa, the administration is considering a troop reduction in Afghanistan, as part of peace talks between the U.S. and the insurgent Taliban movement. There are about 13,000 U.S. troops currently assigned to Afghanistan.
The Pentagon also has approximately 5,200 troops in Iraq, some of which could be withdrawn following the defeat of Islamic State units there.
After Mr. Esper completes his assessments, the responsibility for carrying out any changes in the U.S. posture would fall to the Joint Chiefs of Staff,the officials said.

Trump endorses Collins for reelection

Texto completo: In a tweet Monday, President Donald Trump wrote he agrees 100% that Collins is needed to ensure Republicans keep control of the U.S. Senate next year.
When Donald Trump ran for president in 2016, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine refused to vote for him.
Denouncing him for mocking the vulnerable and attacking “ethnic and religious minorities,” she wrote in House Speaker Paul Ryan instead, a choice that did not even register in the final results since the Wisconsin Republicans had not registered as any sort of candidate in Maine.
But it appears Trump, unusually for him, is not holding a grudge.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham issued a tweet recently hailing Collins, a four-term Republican, for showing “unbelievable courage” during the bitter confirmation fight last year surrounding U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh “and at other times when our country has needed a steady voice.”
“We need her to ensure a GOP majority in 2020,” Graham wrote, and urged his supporters to send money to Collins’ campaign.
Graham also linked to her recent reelection announcement.
On Monday evening, Trump retweeted Graham’s words and added a few of his own.
“I agree 100%!” Trump wrote.
It marks one of the few times Trump has directly praised Collins, who has proven a presidential ally on some key issues and a thorn in his side on others, especially in her 2017 vote to block repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
The day after her speech in favor of Kavanaugh in September 2018, Trump told reporters, “I thought that Susan was incredible yesterday.”
Collins has avoided saying anything about whether she will endorse Trump in 2020, focusing instead on what she perceives as the need to work with him on matters of national importance.
While she has not taken a stand on the presidential race next year — which is bound to have a major impact on her effort to win a fifth term — she also has not retracted any of the harsh comments she issued about Trump in a 2016 column in The Washington Post.
Collins has expressed distaste for Trump’s tweets on a number of occasions, occasionally denouncing some as over the line and sometimes simply wishing he would stop using the social media platform.
It is not clear whether Trump has ever referred to Collins so directly before on Twitter.
In 2018, he blasted a bipartisan immigration bill she cosponsored, claiming it would be “a total catastrophe” for the nation.
Generally, though, he has avoided mentioning her.
Trump has retweeted or touted U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican, dozens of times. The president has also assailed Gail Collins, a New York Times columnist, more often than he has ever referred to Maine’s senior senator.
One of the Democrats hoping to unseat Collins in Maine’s election next year, Betsy Sweet of Hallowell, wrote Tuesday on Twitter that Trump and Graham want Collins to return to the Senate in 2021 “because they know she’ll take the side of Republican special interests, not the people of Maine.”

Barr's Loyalty Is to the Constitution, Not a Party

Texto completo: Washington's knives are out for Attorney General William Barr, and the stabbing has intensified since he delivered a November address at the Federalist Society. Predecessor Eric Holder -- who while serving in the Obama administration described himself as "the president's wingman" -- accused Mr. Barr of championing "essentially unbridled executive power." In the same Washington Post op-ed, Mr. Holder added that Mr. Barr's "nakedly partisan" remarks rendered him a pawn of President Trump and "unfit to lead the Justice Department" -- an utterly unhinged claim.
In the New York Times, William Webster, who directed both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, chastised Mr. Barr for criticizing FBI bias. Meanwhile, the Never Trump group Checks and Balances accused Mr. Barr of advancing an "autocratic vision of executive power" that is "unchecked" by Congress and the courts.
Some of the attacks are mere symptoms of Trump derangement syndrome, but others reflect by a deep-seated resistance to the Constitution's separation of powers and the threat that its enforcement poses to the unaccountable administrative state. In either case, they're wrong. Far from calling for executive supremacy, Mr. Barr has vigorously advocated the Framers' vision of the Constitution's separation-of-powers architecture, featuring the three governmental branches -- Congress, the president and the judiciary -- each exercising its distinctive authorities while checking the others. In his Federalist Society address, Mr. Barr, quoting Justice Antonin Scalia, explained that the Constitution gives the president and Congress "many 'clubs with which to beat' each other."
Mr. Barr's extolling of the "unitary executive" is hardly revolutionary -- nor, as critics imagine, is it a call for dictatorship. It posits only that the president, being responsible for execution of the law, must be able to control his subordinates. This was the rule across the government until Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. (1935), in which the Supreme Court carved out an exception for members of certain "independent" regulatory agencies, whom the president can fire only for "good cause."
The Framers had good reason to favor a strong presidency. The early republic's weak civilian executive leadership almost lost the Revolutionary War, shifting nearly the entire burden to Gen. George Washington. Postwar government under the Articles of Confederation was a ruinous shambles, unable to assert any sort of national leadership. To be sure, the Framers also feared legislative overreaching. They resolved all these problems by creating a coequal executive who could act, in Mr. Barr's words, with "energy, consistency and decisiveness."
Humphrey's Executor was only the beginning of the attack on the constitutional design. Congress whittled away at executive power, depriving the president of the authority and duty to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed." The courts not only approved those usurpations, but themselves meddled in disputes between the political branches and seized broad swaths of executive discretion.
Numerous lawmakers, most of the media and much of the political class now claim -- at least during a Republican administration -- that even core executive-branch activities, such as diplomacy and law enforcement, must be substantially free from presidential control. Hence the steady drumbeat of criticism directed at Mr. Trump for overseeing and making policy for the Justice Department, the FBI and the intelligence community as a whole.
The result isn't a strong Congress but the supplantation of the Constitution's checks and balances with a worst-of-all-worlds muddle. Leaders of independent agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau exercise executive power free from accountability to the president or voters and subject only to the partisan whims of Congress. The bureaucratic "resistance," spurred on by its allies in Congress, openly defies presidential decisions, undermining the principle of democratic control even in core areas of presidential responsibility like foreign policy. For their part, the courts increasingly police ordinary separation-of-powers disputes between Congress and the executive, destroying the possibility of compromise through political means.
These deviations from the Framers' blueprint explain much of the government's current dysfunction. Congress avoids politically dangerous decisions by palming tough choices off on agencies and the courts. The legal and political limbo of the so-called Dreamers is a ready example. Ceaseless congressional investigations nearly incapacitate the White House and are designed to achieve precisely that result. Executive agencies find their every action -- even those involving inherently discretionary matters -- subject to judicial scrutiny and nationwide injunctions imposed by judges whose jurisdiction is supposed to be limited to a state or district. Whereas the separation of powers fostered practical compromise, today's judicial supremacy reduces everything to winner-take-all litigation.
Mr. Barr warned in his address that we must "take special care not to allow the passions of the moment to cause us to permanently disfigure the genius of our Constitutional structure." Too often, previous attorneys general regarded the elements of separation of powers opportunistically, as cudgels to be employed in particular disputes. Mr. Barr's vision and goals are broader. He's concerned not only with the conflicts of the day but the structure necessary for the federal government to work. It's a bold vision, but it's the opposite of a partisan one.
If Mr. Barr achieves even a fraction of his agenda to restore the Framers' vision of a strong, independent executive, he will go down as Mr. Trump's most consequential executive appointment.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES — Allee Willis, who wrote the iconic theme song to the TV show “Friends” and co-wrote the Earth, Wind & Fire classics “September” and “Boogie Wonderland,” died on Christmas Eve in Los Angeles at the age of 72, it was announced Wednesday.
Willis also co-wrote the Broadway musical “The Color Purple” and the Pointer Sisters’ “Neutron Dance” — among hundreds of other songs — and won a Grammy for 1985’s “Beverly Hills Cop” soundtrack.
She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018.
Willis’ death was reported Tuesday night by Variety, which said she suffered cardiac arrest just after 6 p.m. By Christmas Day, her social media accounts were flooded with a mix of shock and warm tributes.
Willis was born in Detroit, and moved to Los Angeles in the late 1970s when her career was starting to heat up. In addition to her prodigiously successful songwriting exploits, she also directed music videos for Blondie and the Cars.
She became known around Los Angeles for her lavish home near North Hollywood, an architectural gem designed by William Kesling in 1937, which Willis bought in 1981 and filled with pop culture artifacts and artwork. The home was nicknamed “Willis Wonderland.”
“Her famously wild parties are carefully planned, too,” read a 2011 profile of Willis in The New York Times. “Parties are in the air here, she explained, since the house was built as a retreat for Paramount, a place where actors could let loose on the weekends, in a remote area that was once mostly orange groves and walnut orchards, except for one neighbor down the dirt road, Amelia Earhart.”
According to the SHOF website, which posted an obituary of Willis on Wednesday, she began curating The Allee Willis Museum of Kitsch website in 2009.
“Her work in art direction, set design and animation was recognized in 2008 by both the Webby Awards and the W3 Awards for her Allee Willis Presents Bubbles & Cheesecake music video collaboration with singer-songwriter Holly Palmer. A cyber pioneer, she designed lilytomlin.com as an online tour of LilyTomlin’s life, and has consulted and created content for numerous entertainment and technology companies,” the SHOF said.
Willis is survived by a brother, Kent Willis, and sister, Marlin Frost; and niece, Mandy Becker, according to the SHOF.
“I’m someone that absolutely loves writing very joyful music,” she said in a 2008 Songfacts interview. “And with everything else I’ve ever written, (“September” is] still that song that when people found out I’d written that, they just go, ‘Oh my God,’ and then tell me in some form how happy that song makes them every time they hear it.”

California businesses at the breaking point due to minimum wage hikes

Texto completo: California’s minimum wage rises to $13 an hour on Jan. 1, and a number of its localities now have wage rates above $15 an hour.
Labor groups promised that $15 would be an economic boon for the state, while then-Gov. Jerry Brown worried that “economically, the minimum wage may not make sense.” The state’s experience with rapidly rising wage rates show the former governor was right to be concerned.
Consider the impact on the state’s full-service restaurant industry, which faces a double-whammy when the wage floor rises. California is one of a handful of states that doesn’t count tips towards an employee’s income; even if a server earns $300 on a Friday night, an effective wage rate of $60 an hour, his employer can’t count one cent of it towards the minimum wage requirement.
Restaurant owners are forced to give a raise to top-earning employees who take home far more than the minimum, with few options to offset the cost.
Paul Fraga, who announced he’s closing Sacramento diner Original Perry’s after more than 50 years in business, explained the dynamic. “For every dollar that [minimum wage] goes up, it costs me around $40,000…I can’t raise menu prices fast enough to compensate [for] that.” He added: “If they could sign a waiver, 99 percent of my servers would be against a minimum wage increase…”
Fraga isn’t alone in feeling the pinch from a rising minimum wage. Another affordably-priced option in town, the beloved Greek restaurant Opa! Opa!, announced that after 14 years in business it would be shuttering its doors. The owner said that since he first opened, prices have increased over 50 percent as a result of burdensome mandates placed on him by the state. Now, fourteen employees are left jobless right before the holidays.
These aren’t just anecdotes. Census Bureau data suggests the state’s restaurant owners have reacted to scaled-up wage costs by scaling back on hiring. In Los Angeles County, for instance, year-over-year full-service employment growth topped seven percent as recently as 2012; it’s fallen every year since then, and dipped below one percent in 2018. In Orange County, growth last year was near-zero.
A similar trend is seen statewide, with sub-one percent growth replacing five percent growth from as recently as 2013. In San Francisco County, stagnant growth turned negative last year, with the city losing nearly 1,000 restaurant jobs. A study published by Harvard University Business School and Mathematica examined the impacts of wage increases in the San Francisco Bay Area. The results were startling. The research found that each one dollar increase to the minimum wage resulted in a 14 percent increase in the likelihood that a 3.5 star (the median rating) restaurant would be forced to close.
Another study, recently released by my organization, found that in states like California with a high minimum wage for tipped employees, full-service restaurants hired 18 percent fewer tipped workers as a share of the workforce. In practice, that means full-service restaurants embrace self-service alternatives where the customer provides much of the service themselves. (The New York Times chronicled a trend in San Francisco of fine-dining restaurants adopting elements of fast-food style service models.)
Will California legislators wise up? Don’t hold your breath.
The state’s Future of Work Commission, which was assembled by the governor to examine future workplace challenges for employers and employees, is stacked with some of the very parties responsible for those challenges. SEIU president Mary Kay Henry, who co-chairs the governor’s commission, has overseen more than $100 million in spending on the Fight for $15, a policy that has forced countless employers to replace human employees with automated alternatives. Another commission member, labor activist Saru Jayaraman, has encouraged other states to follow California’s failed payment model for tipped employees. She’s been opposed in that goal by thousand of tipped servers, who understand the consequences for their own bottom line should their states make California’s mistake.
Gov. Newsom boasts that California is setting an example for the rest of the country to follow. He’s right; the state is showing the rest of the country why a $15 minimum wage is a bad idea.

Texto completo: I’m a good uncle. I help my older niece with her reading. I go to my nephew’s football games (it’s flag football; calm down). I play dress-up and house with my younger niece.
And, around Christmas time, I sneak into their home and steal some of their favorite toys.
Some background: I am not a competent singer. Nor is anyone in my family. We can’t sing Broadway or Beatles tunes or even “Baa Baa Black Sheep.” And yet both my sister and I can perfectly vocalize a torturous song from Sesame Street’s Pop-Up Pals baby toy. A toddler pushes a button, and Elmo sings:
“This is the song; la la la la; Elmo’s song!”
We can do it in tune.
“This is the song; la la la la; Elmo’s song!”
On key. Every note.
Last December, a careless, tasteless or downright mean relative gifted the musical toy to my younger niece. She loved it. She played it morning, noon and night. Endlessly. Until one winter weekend when I crept into their house and disappeared it.
Not only do I steal from children; I steal from the children I love most. And I highly recommend it.
I do it when there’s no one home, and my sister and I never discuss it. She never asks me to do it. She wouldn’t. But I know when there’s something she especially hates. And then, it’s gone. That’s the only way it works: If her child, her innocent, sweet little girl, asks her, “Mommy, where is the Elmo toy?” My sister can look her in the eye and reply, truthfully: “I don’t know. We can’t find it. Do you want to do drawing?”
Kids have terrible taste. They love the worst stuff: food, games, outfits — the more garish, the better. Like every parent, my sister has to choose every day which of her kids’ magnificently awful desires will be satisfied, but the challenge presented by Christmas and contemporary consumerism is just too overwhelming for any one person. So she has me.
It all began a few years ago, with a book, “Angelina Ballerina,” which had been given to her elder daughter. It’s a pink-hued tale that follows a wee mouse named Angelina in her desire to become a prima ballerina. My sister is not especially concerned with gender politics, but she does care about literature, and this book was, in her words, “sucky” beyond belief.
Of course, her daughter loved it, and insisted that it be read to her at every opportunity. My sister works hard. She treasures the opportunity to read to the kids before bed. Moreover, she’s a devoted parent and a gentle, caring person. So, when she told me, “John, I want to kick Angelina Ballerina in her head” (and I’m leaving out some words here), I had to help. Soon, Angelina jeté-d herself over to Housing Works. Elmo and his pals were next. And others have followed.
I told a friend who is a parent about my illicit activities, and his answer was telling: “Can you come over and do my house?” He went further: “I know people who would pay for this.” At the same time, when he told his family what I do, they were horrified. “My mom thinks you’re a monster,” he said.
So be it. When I’ve told others about my Grinchiness, the most common question that follows is, “Don’t the kids miss their toys?” And they answer is “Yes.” For about five minutes. And then neither my sister nor anyone else hears about them again. The kids look for it, they can’t find it, they move on.
I take no pleasure in it. Well, I take some pleasure, in that it makes my sister’s and her husband’s lives easier and improves the quality of the kids’ playtime. For every disappeared musical Sesame Street toy, there is more drawing; for every bedtime story without Angelina there is one with Wild Things or Eloise. These are not my decisions to make, except they are. Even without my sister’s tacit approval and thanks, this is what uncles do. We help out, often in ways parents cannot.
Christmas is exhausting for parents. My sister has to deal with shopping and Santa and the big dinner and transport and family. So why wouldn’t I help out where I can? At the end of the day, if I cannot spare my sister the song-and-dance of Christmas, at least I can spare her that particular song.
Ultimately, it is less an issue of taste than one of excess, something our culture has a problem with. Kids’ toys are cheap. Christmas is an orgy of plastic, pink, lost pieces and paper. It’s not good — for the kids, for the parents, for the gift givers, for the environment.
My Grinchy model, or his creator, Dr. Seuss, summed it up nicely: “What if Christmas, he thought, doesn’t come from a store. What if Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more.”
Which is why I know I’m a good uncle. But I’m a better brother.

Texto completo: Several veterans of past Republican campaigns, including the former head of New Hampshire's GOP, have created a committee aimed at defeating President Trump in 2020 and congressional Republicans who have supported him.
Dubbed the Lincoln Project, the group has Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine as one of its biggest potential targets. Collins already faces a Democratic challenger and growing scrutiny from all corners as the Senate prepares for an expected Trump impeachment trial.
“It is my great hope, as this impeachment process unfolds, that she will have the courage to do what is right, to stand up and put the country over party, to be a voice for the people over Donald Trump," said Jennifer Horn, a former head of New Hampshire's Republican Party and a cofounder of the Lincoln Project.
“If that doesn't happen," Horn said, “then, yes, unfortunately, Senator Collins becomes part of this," a Lincoln Project target.
The project is one of several small, but vocal, rebellions against Trump, who has taken over the national Republican Party apparatus and rarely experiences pushback from its members in Congress.
Collins, who has walked a tightrope through roiling partisan politics, has said little about how she intends to vote in the Senate's expected impeachment trial of Trump. Long known as an independent thinker, Collins infuriated members of her party when she helped kill the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But she faced criticism from Democrats when she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.
Collins, in a statement, offered few clues about how she might vote in an impeachment trial. “I intend to make my decision on whether or not to convict President Trump on the basis of the evidence presented at the trial," she said. “Threats from both the left and the right will have zero influence on that decision."
Trump has remained steadily popular among Republicans across the country, despite his overall low approval ratings and his impeachment last week by the House, all of which makes the Lincoln Project's effort an uphill battle.
When the House voted to impeach Trump for trying to pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden — a potential Trump challenger in 2020 — not a single Republican joined the Democratic majority. In some states, the GOP has maneuvered to keep Trump's primary challengers off the 2020 ballot altogether.
Nonetheless, the Lincoln Project, unveiled in a New York Times op-ed the day before the House impeached Trump, describes the president as a “bogus prophet," whose actions threaten the Constitution and American way of life.
“We do not undertake this task lightly, nor from ideological preference," said the op-ed authors and Lincoln Project cofounders, who include George T. Conway III, an attorney known as an outspoken Trump critic and husband of presidential adviser Kelleyanne Conway.
“Our many policy differences with national Democrats remain, but our shared fidelity to the Constitution dictates a common effort," they wrote.
They envision persuading enough disaffected conservatives, Republicans, and Republican-leaning independents in swing states and districts to vote against Trump and his supporters “even if that means Democratic control of the Senate and an expanded Democratic majority in the House."
Joshua Tardy, a Maine attorney who served as honorary chairman for Collins's last Senate campaign, dismissed the project's goals and chances of success. “There will be a lot of noise makers on both sides and this super PAC will just be another noise maker in a noisy election," Tardy said. (Such political action committees can raise funds from individuals, corporations, unions, and other groups without any limit on donation size or expenditure.)
Collins recently announced she will run for reelection. And while she hasn't said whether she will endorse Trump, the president this week indicated his support for her — via Twitter. When Senator Lindsey Graham encouraged voters to support Collins's reelection, Trump responded: “I agree 100%."
Horn, from the Lincoln Project, said her group raised over $500,000 in the two days after it was announced.
The group's day-to-day activities will be overseen by Horn, who twice ran for Congress from New Hampshire, and by Reed Galen, a longtime Republican strategist. Other members include two former strategists for the late Senator John McCain, Steve Schmidt and John Weaver.
Maine is considered a battleground state in 2020. That's partly because its electorate is divided and unpredictable: The state has a Republican senator, an independent senator, and two Democratic members of the House. The current Democratic governor followed a provocative Republican. Maine is also a key electoral state because it is one of just two (the other is Nebraska) that does not use the traditional winner-take-all method of allocating Electoral College votes. Trump won one of the state's four votes in 2016, the first time a Republican took any of Maine's votes in decades.
Tardy is not worried.
“At the end of the day, Donald Trump and Susan Collins enjoy enormous support by their Republican base," he said.
The Lincoln Project is also focusing on candidates in other states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Colorado, and Arizona.
Former Massachusetts governor William F. Weld, who is challenging Trump for the presidential nomination, said he is focused on beating Trump, but not on targeting other Republicans.
He said, however, that he agreed with the project's mission of defeating Trump.
“I am delighted to see a little hardball on the side of the nice guys," Weld said.
He draws parallels to 1973, when, he said, he was an ambitious young lawyer for the House Judiciary Committee and was advised by others in the Republican Party to steer clear of the impeachment process because of Richard Nixon's popularity, despite the Watergate break-in.
Nixon ultimately resigned in 1974 before the House voted on impeachment, as evidence against him mounted and support from loyal congressional defenders dissolved. Weld believes those who stand by Trump in a Senate trial will suffer politically.
“If the Republicans in the Senate walk the plank silently for Mr. Trump, all of those who are up next year in the 2020 election will lose their seats," he said.
Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and congressman who ended his long-shot campaign for the Republican nomination against Trump last month, had not heard of the Lincoln Project. But Sanford, a fiscal conservative, said he wished the founders well. “I think we need to have a conversation as Republicans as to what it means to be a Republican," Sanford said. “We have lost our way . . . based on a temporary political amnesia that will fade."

Barr's Loyalty Is to the Constitution, Not a Party; The 'unitary executive' implies both a strong presidency and clear limits on presidential powers.

Texto completo: Washington's knives are out for Attorney General William Barr, and the stabbing has intensified since he delivered a November address at the Federalist Society. Predecessor Eric Holder—who while serving in the Obama administration described himself as "the president's wingman"—accused Mr. Barr of championing "essentially unbridled executive power." In the same Washington Post op-ed , Mr. Holder added that Mr. Barr's "nakedly partisan" remarks rendered him a pawn of President Trump and "unfit to lead the Justice Department"—an utterly unhinged claim.
In the New York Times, William Webster, who directed both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, chastised Mr. Barr for criticizing FBI bias. Meanwhile, the Never Trump group Checks and Balances accused Mr. Barr of advancing an "autocratic vision of executive power" that is "unchecked" by Congress and the courts.
Some of the attacks are mere symptoms of Trump derangement syndrome, but others reflect by a deep-seated resistance to the Constitution's separation of powers and the threat that its enforcement poses to the unaccountable administrative state. In either case, they're wrong. Far from calling for executive supremacy, Mr. Barr has vigorously advocated the Framers' vision of the Constitution's separation-of-powers architecture, featuring the three governmental branches—Congress, the president and the judiciary—each exercising its distinctive authorities while checking the others. In his Federalist Society address , Mr. Barr, quoting Justice Antonin Scalia, explained that the Constitution gives the president and Congress "many 'clubs with which to beat' each other."
Mr. Barr's extolling of the "unitary executive" is hardly revolutionary—nor, as critics imagine, is it a call for dictatorship. It posits only that the president, being responsible for execution of the law, must be able to control his subordinates. This was the rule across the government until Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. (1935), in which the Supreme Court carved out an exception for members of certain "independent" regulatory agencies, whom the president can fire only for "good cause."
The Framers had good reason to favor a strong presidency. The early republic's weak civilian executive leadership almost lost the Revolutionary War, shifting nearly the entire burden to Gen. George Washington. Postwar government under the Articles of Confederation was a ruinous shambles, unable to assert any sort of national leadership. To be sure, the Framers also feared legislative overreaching. They resolved all these problems by creating a coequal executive who could act, in Mr. Barr's words, with "energy, consistency and decisiveness."
Humphrey's Executor was only the beginning of the attack on the constitutional design. Congress whittled away at executive power, depriving the president of the authority and duty to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed." The courts not only approved those usurpations, but themselves meddled in disputes between the political branches and seized broad swaths of executive discretion.
Numerous lawmakers, most of the media and much of the political class now claim—at least during a Republican administration—that even core executive-branch activities, such as diplomacy and law enforcement, must be substantially free from presidential control. Hence the steady drumbeat of criticism directed at Mr. Trump for overseeing and making policy for the Justice Department, the FBI and the intelligence community as a whole.
The result isn't a strong Congress but the supplantation of the Constitution's checks and balances with a worst-of-all-worlds muddle. Leaders of independent agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau exercise executive power free from accountability to the president or voters and subject only to the partisan whims of Congress. The bureaucratic "resistance," spurred on by its allies in Congress, openly defies presidential decisions, undermining the principle of democratic control even in core areas of presidential responsibility like foreign policy. For their part, the courts increasingly police ordinary separation-of-powers disputes between Congress and the executive, destroying the possibility of compromise through political means.
These deviations from the Framers' blueprint explain much of the government's current dysfunction. Congress avoids politically dangerous decisions by palming tough choices off on agencies and the courts. The legal and political limbo of the so-called Dreamers is a ready example. Ceaseless congressional investigations nearly incapacitate the White House and are designed to achieve precisely that result. Executive agencies find their every action—even those involving inherently discretionary matters—subject to judicial scrutiny and nationwide injunctions imposed by judges whose jurisdiction is supposed to be limited to a state or district. Whereas the separation of powers fostered practical compromise, today's judicial supremacy reduces everything to winner-take-all litigation.
Mr. Barr warned in his address that we must "take special care not to allow the passions of the moment to cause us to permanently disfigure the genius of our Constitutional structure." Too often, previous attorneys general regarded the elements of separation of powers opportunistically, as cudgels to be employed in particular disputes. Mr. Barr's vision and goals are broader. He's concerned not only with the conflicts of the day but the structure necessary for the federal government to work. It's a bold vision, but it's the opposite of a partisan one.
If Mr. Barr achieves even a fraction of his agenda to restore the Framers' vision of a strong, independent executive, he will go down as Mr. Trump's most consequential executive appointment.

Pentagon Considering a Troop Reduction in West Africa; Defense officials seek a first step toward a Trump blueprint focusing on big-power rivalries, but the strategy has proven elusive

Texto completo: The Pentagon is considering a reduction in the number of U.S. troops in Western Africa as part of a long-term strategy of shifting the focus of forces, ships and air squadrons toward potential threats from Russia and China, defense officials said Tuesday.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper is considering the shift as an early step in a proposed realignment of U.S. troop posture around the world, as spelled out in Trump administration policy documents on national security and defense , the officials said. There are approximately 7,000 American troops now deployed across Africa.
Mr. Esper during the fall requested that officials with U.S. Africa Command, which is responsible for U.S. military operations on the continent, provide an assessment of their resource needs, one defense official said, a first step in the potential shift.
Mr. Esper since has approached all other Pentagon regional commanders with similar requests, encompassing Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Western Hemisphere, the official said.
The defense chief asked for the assessments to better align troop and resource deployments with the Pentagon's 2018 National Defense Strategy, which prioritizes great power competition, especially from Russia and China, over counterterrorism operations in places like Africa and the Middle East, the official said.
However, the U.S. has repeatedly confronted pressing needs in the Middle East, and has had difficulty following through on the strategy of refocusing security resources , officials have said.
The U.S. military first withdrew forces as part of its realignment last year when it removed roughly 700 troops, largely from West Africa.
U.S. troops in Western Africa conduct a range of counterterrorism operations against militant groups , including Boko Haram, but some policy makers question whether such groups pose a threat to the U.S. itself, which has been the criteria used for justifying such deployments in the past.
The U.S. began increasing its forces as part of a global contingent led by France following extremist gains in 2012.
The defense officials said there is no timeline for specific decisions or determinations of troop levels. Any final decision is likely to further shrink the U.S. footprint, although the Pentagon instead could decide to consolidate forces in Western Africa, the officials said.
Major changes to the number of U.S. forces in other parts of Africa are unlikely, they said. The New York Times first reported on possible shift in troops in Western Africa.
Significantly reducing U.S. troops on the continent likely would draw the ire of allies, particularly France, which still has thousands of troops deployed. Critics of the U.S. force posture have noted that both Russian and Chinese influence has expanded throughout Africa as both of those nations have funded weapons purchases, built installations or invested in local infrastructure.
The relatively small U.S. presence, together with European and local forces, has yet to contain threats from al Qaeda and a burgeoning Islamic State.
Earlier this month in Niger, which has been in a state of emergency since 2017 because of the threats from extremist groups, militants attacked a military base and killed 71 Nigerien soldiers. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.
On Saturday, during a visit to the Ivory Coast, French President Emmanuel Macron said France's troops had killed 33 militants during a raid in Mali and said the coming weeks would represent a "turning point" in the war against terrorism in the area.
In addition to West Africa, the administration is considering a troop reduction in Afghanistan, as part of peace talks between the U.S. and the insurgent Taliban movement. There are about 13,000 U.S. troops currently assigned to Afghanistan.
The Pentagon also has approximately 5,200 troops in Iraq, some of which could be withdrawn following the defeat of Islamic State units there.
After Mr. Esper completes his assessments, the responsibility for carrying out any changes in the U.S. posture would fall to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the officials said.

Texto completo: End this brutal division
America is in a very interesting state, politically. Mainly for the citizens' brutal dividing amongst themselves. Left vs. right, donkey vs. elephant, liberal vs. conservative — whatever or wherever someone has decided to be on the political scale, a majority of the time they will stick to it.
Check out the NBC News article, “Americans are divided over everything except division” comparing how divided people are politically and who blames who. Also, considering how easy it is to surround yourself with the information you want, it becomes so apparent to just see what you believe.
But I want to explore the thought of expanding one's personal understanding and seeing the other side. The article by NBC News at the end mentions that people blame the other side generally for this division. What if you as a person accept that everyone is to blame for this division? And as a whole, we better each other by giving other's ideas a chance to at least find common ground, and end this brutal division amongst us, the people of America.

Reading, writing still essential
Recently, I talked with a friend who works as an assistant teacher in the Vancouver school system. She said in a classroom she worked in, that cursive handwriting is no longer being taught. One child's writing was totally illegible. The teacher told my friend “he has his own way of writing.”
Reading online about this, a New York Times article quoted a teacher calling grammar “soul crushing,” and that writing should be “psychologically liberating” (“Why Kids Can't Write,” The New York Times, Aug. 2, 2017).
How common is this? Will our next generation be “psychologically liberated” (whatever that is), but unable to read or write or barely able to communicate in words on a job — only able to push buttons on electronics?
I'm a taxpayer, and feel I am not getting a good value for my education tax dollars.

Place service above self
While a member of Rotary International, I became enamored of their motto: “Service above self.” How different our own country would be if everyone, from the president on down, would practice that simple truth. Serving others is truly more vital than meeting our own needs.
Think about how much misery is caused by self-centeredness. Someone much wiser than I said that there's more than enough for everyone's need; but not nearly enough for even one person's greed. For our lives to be truly memorable and to leave a meaningful legacy, life needs to be less about me, more about us. Or to use a Confucius-like proverb, “Person wrapped in self make very small package.”
“Service above self” offers each of us and all of us a more perfect way, not only to live, but perhaps for civilization to survive.

Her body, her right
Women fought 100 years to gain their rights. It wasn't until March of 1972 that the Equal Rights Amendment was passed by Congress; since then, 37 states ratified the Amendment.
Yet even after gaining their rights, women don't have the right to make their own choices. Six states have passed trigger laws that try to ban abortion in the first and second trimesters. Alabama wanted to pass a law banning abortion at any state of pregnancy with no exceptions for pregnancy resulting in rape and incest. A baby born as the result of close incest has a 50 percent chance of suffering an early death, severe birth defects or some mental deficiency.
The states should not be able to decide for a woman; it is her body and her right.

Texto completo: Lower levies on food, drug ingredients and hundreds of other items will help China keep trading with other nations while many tariffs on American products remain.
BEIJING -- China said on Monday that it will lower tariffs on a variety of goods imported from around the world starting on Jan. 1, moving to support domestic consumers even as a trade truce with the United States has relieved some of the pressure on the Chinese economy.
The action, less than two weeks after Beijing and the Trump administration reached a partial deal to end their trade war, also helps China buttress its assertions that it has continued to open up its market despite the long-running conflict with the United States.
The stopgap trade pact reached this month forestalled one last round of American tariffs that would have extended levies to cover nearly every shoe, laptop and toy that the United States imports from China.
But the deal still leaves many question marks over China's economy, which has slowed as the tariff conflict has dragged on. With many tariffs on American products still in place, China needs to keep trading with other nations to satisfy its people's demands for imported goods.
The list of 859 products that will face lower import levies appears to have been carefully chosen to meet various requirements of the moment.
Among the goods are frozen pork, which the country needs because its pig herds have been devastated by a deadly epidemic of swine fever. The list also includes pharmaceutical ingredients, which China requires as its population ages and demand for new drugs grows, as well as high-tech components, a necessity as China pushes to become a world leader in industries such as computer chips.
Levies will also be lowered on grocery items such as avocados, orange juice and seafood, as Chinese households become choosier about the food they eat.
As frictions with the United States began heating up in 2018, China stepped up efforts to lower trade barriers with the rest of the world. It announced a similar tariff cut a year ago. That one covered 706 products.

Emanuel Ungaro, 86, Fashion Designer Who Hated 'Boring Clothes'

Texto completo: Mr., Ungaro's clothes could be both chic and surprising. Fashion, he believed, should be "disturbing to the eye."
Emanuel Ungaro, whose merging of attention-getting colors and patterns with sleek lines made him one of the most talked-about fashion designers in Paris beginning in the 1960s and served as the foundation for the fashion house that still bears his name, died on Saturday in Paris. He was 86.
The Emanuel Ungaro fashion house, which Mr. Ungaro sold in 2005, announced his death on its Facebook page. No cause was given.
Mr. Ungaro, who came from a family of tailors, established his fashion house in 1965 after working under the designer Cristóbal Balenciaga.
The celebrity journalist James Brady, in a "Brady's Bits" column in 1987, wrote that Mr. Ungaro, whom he had known since the 1960s, financed his first show with a loan that used a girlfriend's Porsche as collateral. The event, Mr. Brady wrote, was held in a small apartment. People sat on the balcony and peered in through windows to see the clothes.
Within a few years Mr. Ungaro's creations were being worn by A-listers like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and being seen in films on Catherine Deneuve (in "Le Sauvage," 1975), Gena Rowlands ("Gloria," 1980) and other actresses.
His ever-changing signatures over the years included stand-up collars, abundant use of suede, wrap dresses, mixed prints and more. He might pair a paisley blouse with a plaid suit, or prescribe a colorful shawl for a distinctive look, or go all in on polka dots.
"I hate boring clothes," he told The Washington Post in 1977. "I hate seeing women dressed in a sad way."
Mr. Ungaro explained his approach to design in 1994, when he opened a boutique in Manhattan.
"If you want to exist in fashion, and in any other manifestation of art, you have to disturb people," he told The New York Times. "Provocation, in my mouth, means disturbing to the eye. Not disturb just to disturb, but disturb by showing something unexpected."
Emanuel Ungaro was born on Feb. 13, 1933, in Aix-en-Provence, in southern France. His father, Cosimo, was a tailor who had fled Fascist Italy.
"My father is like a god to me," Mr. Ungaro told The Boston Globe in 1965. "He taught me to respect line and quality, and to take pains with every stitch."
After working for three years in his father's tailoring business, determined to make a career in fashion but needing a bigger stage on which to do it, he left his hometown for Paris when he was 21.
"I arrived in Paris with two pairs of pants, three shirts and not one cent in my pocket," he told The San Francisco Chronicle in 1992.
He spent two years as a stylist for Maison Camps tailors, then in 1958 took a job with Balenciaga's fashion house. He spent six years there, absorbing Balenciaga's ideas on line and color and how to drape the body.
Beginning in 1964 he spent about a year working with André Courrèges, who shook up the fashion scene in Paris that year with his mod "Space Age" collection. The next year, Mr. Ungaro established his own company, and The Times took note of one of his first showings.
"Emanuel Ungaro was a youth movement unto himself as he carried the Courrèges spirit one step farther," the newspaper wrote.
His early work often drew mixed reviews, but by 1972 his collection was being hailed as the best of the bunch in Paris.
"He likes geometric patterns in multitudinous colors," Bernadine Morris wrote in The Times that July. "He used to mix them up so much that you didn't know where to look, but this time he has put everything together properly."
The 1970s and '80s were his best decades. In 1980, the Associated Press fashion writer Suzy Patterson called his summer show "one of his best couture collections ever -- and certainly the most exciting seen so far this week."
"As usual," she continued, "Ungaro had a field day mixing fabrics with a whole rainbow of silks in the same outfit. In a favorite type of skirt, stripes or plaids and paisley appear on the same piece of fabric, and everything shimmers with Jacquard weave."
By the mid-1990s his company was struggling, and in 1996 he sold a majority stake to Salvatore Ferragamo Italia, the Italian company best known for shoes; the agreement kept the Ungaro company independent, with Mr. Ungaro as president. In 2005, he sold his stake to Asim Abdullah, a venture capitalist, and retired.
Mr. Ungaro's survivors include his wife, Laura Bernabei, whom he married in 1989, and a daughter, Cosima Ungaro.
"There are no rules in this business," Mr. Ungaro told The Chronicle after a show that, a quarter-century into the life of his fashion house, still included surprising mixtures, like an aqua jacket with a taupe pleated skirt and mauve satin blouse. "The only rule you should have is to respect yourself and respect others' dignity."

The 12 podcasts of 2019 you need to listen to

Texto completo: My favorite podcasts of 2019 were those that seemed at first about one thing — Dolly Parton, the reality TV show “Cops,” the mysterious death of New York City punk rocker nearly four decades ago — and carried you away on tangents you never saw coming.
Which, mind you, is not to say I lost all of my ardor for the tried-and-true-crime podcasts, such as “In The Dark,” my favorite of 2018, which just this week resulted in the release on bail of Curtis Flowers, a Mississippi man tried six times who six times had his convictions overturned. There remain plenty of those, though I’ve perhaps become more discerning in my criminal tastes.
The list below presents the dozen podcasts that still resonate for me as the year comes to an end. They’re not in any particular order, so the numbers aren’t rankings, but the first two here are my favorites of the year.
1. Headlong: Running From Cops : Dan Taberski returned this year with his third great podcast in a row – “Surviving Y2K” and “Finding Richard Simmons” preceded this one – and this might be his best. A deep dive into the history of the reality TV series “Cops,” this podcast explores everything from the impact of the show on real-world policing to the way the series may interfere with the rights of the arrested in ways you’d never considered. Entertaining, and it makes you think.
2. The Ballad of Billy Balls : This podcast opens like a typical true-crimer – who killed punk rocker and small-time drug dealer Billy Balls in his East Village apartment in 1982 – but under the empathetic storytelling of host iO Tillett Wright it becomes something much more that incorporates love and grief, family and memory. Billy’s girlfriend Rebecca is an amazing presence throughout the podcast, which reveals one secret after another as Wright seeks the truth of the story.
3. 1619 : This podcast from the New York Times came on the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slaves in America. No dry history lesson, the anthology-style five-episode podcast looks at ways in which the impact of slavery has rippled across four centuries of our history tot he present day. Topics range from the economy to land ownership to health care. If you’d like to get a sense of it, dip your ears into the episode by the Times’ Wesley Morris who explores the ways in which black American music seeded every genre we listen to today — including yacht rock.
4. Dolly Parton’s America : Host Jad Abumrad grew up in Tennessee where Dolly Parton is everywhere, and, like many, he took her a little bit for granted. Then Abumrad noticed how in these divided times everyone from MAGA hat-wearers to drag queens loves Dolly, and he started to investigate. He got hours of interview time with Dolly, which is wonderful, but it’s the side trips into the stories of those who know her – in person, by her music, her career – that make this story a wonderful narrative about a singular woman.
5. Crime Beat: Mom vs. Murderer : The second season of this true-crime podcast by reporter Keith Sharon, our (full-disclosure) Southern California News Group colleague, tells the story of the murder of Cathy Torrez in 1994 and the 21 years her mother Mary Bennett fought to see the main suspect — who lived across the street — convicted. It’s a story about a terrible crime, the frustrating injustices of the justice system and a mother’s determination that her child not be forgotten.
6. Lost Notes : This anthology series from KCRW-FM/89.9 and host Jessica Hooper explores the lives and work of musicians in ways unlike any other podcast, digging deep into history and meaning with strong standalone narratives. A punk rock musician with a regional hit when he was 17 questions the sexism of its lyrics as a 56-year-old father. The sisters of the now mostly forgotten all-female rock band Fanny share their story. A writer narrates an audio letter to the musician Cat Power about the impact of her work on the lives of him and others. There are more in 2019’s second season.
7. The Clearing : April Balascio had feared for years that her father Edward Wayne Edwards was a murderer, and in 2009, her tip led to his conviction in a decades-old case. In this podcast, she teams with host Josh Dean to explore the legacy of her father’s life and crimes. These included more murders to which he admitted, several more that he likely committed and a few he almost certainly did not. It’s a fascinating tale of a sociopath father and a daughter brave enough to seek the truth.
8. Against The Rules with Michael Lewis : Writer Lewis is responsible for some of the great nonfiction of the past few decades with books such as “Moneyball,” “The Blind Side,” and “The Big Short,” all of which were adapted for film. This debut podcast brings his unique and questioning mind to the topic of fairness. He explores everything from sports to financial markets, law to media, and what happens in a world where fewer people accept the judgments of referees. Smart, funny, thought-provoking — what else you want?
9. Over My Dead Body:Tally : There’s a nasty divorce between two lawyers, and one of them ends up gunned down in the garage at his Tallahassee, Florida home. Host and co-reporter Matthew Shaer takes listeners through the story, which moves from a fairy-tale romance that made the New York Times to the split and crime that followed. This first season of the podcast makes it easy for listeners to come to their own conclusions about who is responsible, but justice isn’t so easily served.
10. Nice Try! : Host Avery Trufelman explores the history of intended utopian communities — the Jamestown settlement, the master-planned modernist city of Chandigarh, India, the Oneida religious commune in New York, among others — and why so often they have failed to find the perfection for which they were intended. Through history, architecture, culture, and beliefs, Nice Try! presents a cool new way of understanding the worlds in which we live.
11. The Thing About Pam : From NBC and “Dateline,” this Keith Morrison-hosted podcast peels back the layers of lies and deceit that led to the wrongful conviction of a Missouri man for the murder of his wife, and the ultimate discovery of whodunnit. “Saturday Night Live” used to skewer Morrison’s intimate style of narration, but it’s a pleasure indeed to listen to him tell this story, which never lags or feels padded like too many “Dateline” episodes do.
12. It’s a Pixies Podcast : The Pixies, one of the great modern rock bands, agreed to something few bands would consider and invited author-turned-podcaster Tony Fletcher into the recording studio for the weeks they worked on their new album, “Beneath The Eyrie.” It’s a fascinating look at the creative process, the collaborative nature of making a record, and the push-and-pull of personalities all working toward the goal of making music together. A must for Pixies’ fans, but almost as essential for fans of any band for the insights it delivers.

Texto completo: A new survey finds that Democrats haven't fully embraced progressive policy proposals like free college and Medicare for all.
Progressive policy ideas have dominated the early stages of the Democratic primary campaign. But as candidates gather in Los Angeles for another debate on Thursday evening, Democratic voters may be seeking more moderate options.
Only one in four Democratic voters says they would favor eliminating private health insurance and replacing it with a government-run plan -- the centerpiece of the "Medicare for all" proposals put forward by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. And only one in three favors making public college tuition free for all Americans regardless of income, another idea shared by the two leading progressives in the race.
Those results, from a survey conducted this month for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey, are striking because past polls, including those from The Times, have shown broad-based support for progressive ideas among Democrats. Last month, 81 percent of Democrats said they approved of Medicare for all; in July, 82 percent said they supported making public colleges free for all.
But those earlier surveys asked simple yes-or-no questions. The most recent survey offered respondents more options to choose from. And it found that Democratic voters consistently preferred policies that were well to the left of current law, but were more moderate than those proposed by Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren.
Most Democrats, for example -- 58 percent -- said they would like to make government-run insurance universally available, while allowing people to keep their private insurance if they prefer it, a policy similar to the "Medicare for all who want it" plan proposed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and a related proposal from former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. A further 15 percent said the United States should reform the health care system without adopting a government-run plan at all, or that the current system was working well. Only 25 percent said they would prefer a Medicare for all plan that eliminates private insurance.
The preference for more moderate policies cuts across age groups, races, education levels and even ideology: Among Democrats who said they were "liberal" or "very liberal," only 30 percent chose the most progressive option for health care reform.
Naomi Korchonnoff, a graduate student in Tacoma, Wash., supports Mr. Sanders, who she said would tackle systemic problems that other candidates are afraid to address. But she stopped short of supporting Mr. Sanders's plan to get rid of private insurance.
"I don't agree with the blanket aspect of it because I think that people who earn enough to have their own private insurance, say through their employer, should be able to keep that," she said. "It's ideal insurance to have."
Ms. Korchonnoff, 31, said the lawmakers should make health care available to all, especially low- and moderate-income people who do not qualify for existing government programs but struggle to afford insurance through the subsidized marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.
"Making it available to people who cannot afford to buy marketplace insurance is very important," she said.
The Times survey showed similar results when it came to "free college" proposals. About a third of Democrats said that the government should make public colleges free to low- and moderate-income families, but that the wealthy should still have to pay -- again a policy close to that proposed by Mr. Buttigieg. Another third said that college should be more affordable but that most families should have to pay something. The remaining third expressed the most liberal position, that college should be free for all.
Voters also sounded a note of caution about the cost of candidates' plans: Half of Democrats said the United States should adopt progressive proposals only if they do not increase the budget deficit, compared to 38 percent who said they supported the plans regardless of their fiscal impact. Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren say they will pay for their plans through higher taxes, not through borrowing more money.
In interviews, voters gave different reasons for their positions. Some said they thought the most liberal positions went too far or questioned whether they would work in practice. Others were more focused on political strategy, concerned that liberal positions would hurt Democrats in the general election next fall.
"I have a preferred idealistic position, which is Medicare for all," said Carla Silvey, a tech worker in the San Francisco area. "I don't know how feasible that is."
Ms. Silvey, 50, said she believed a government-run health care system was a near inevitability in the long run because the current system is too broken to last. But she is torn about whether Democrats should embrace that solution now.
"I don't know whether to go bold or to try to be in the middle," she said.
Many Democrats appear to be making similar calculations. Ms. Warren, who surged into the top tier of the Democratic field over the summer, has fallen in the polls in recent weeks, while Mr. Buttigieg has gained ground. (Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have retained relatively steady support.)
Still, the Times survey doesn't necessarily imply voters will abandon progressive candidates. Laura Wronski, a research scientist for SurveyMonkey, noted that many voters said they trusted Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren on health care despite favoring more moderate positions than those candidates.
"Are you voting for the policy, or voting for the person?" Ms. Wronski said.
John Soderholm, a middle school guidance counselor near Minneapolis, doesn't want to give up his private insurance, and worries that the Democratic Party will alienate voters if it embraces too liberal a message. But he said Democrats also run a risk if they are too meek: Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have generated enthusiasm in part by being willing to take bold positions, even if not all their supporters believe their plans will come to fruition.
"Who gets excited about incrementalism?" Mr. Soderholm asked rhetorically. "You've got to have some sizzle too."

About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 4,093 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Dec. 2 to Dec. 8. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus two percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
"Giving Injured Troops Their Day in Court" (news article, Dec. 12) is optimistic that Congress's proposed administrative process for medical malpractice claims against the Defense Department will help open courthouse doors shut to service members. I'm worried that this legislation will have the opposite effect.
Because of the "Feres doctrine," service members cannot file tort suits against the Defense Department. This year, Sgt. First Class Richard Stayskal, who has terminal cancer, bravely fought to overturn Feres in medical malpractice cases. The final version of the National Defense Authorization Act, however, leaves Feres untouched. Instead, it creates an administrative compensation regime.
I'm glad that injured service members will get monetary relief. But I'm concerned that this will placate us. The press is celebrating and Congress is patting itself on the back. Also, the Defense Department can use this remedy to protect Feres. It can now say that there's an avenue for justice.
Service members still deserve their day in court. Under Congress's administrative process, the Defense Department sits as judge and defendant. Where's the neutrality?

Texto completo: When Rita Moreno, Gina Torres and Laurie Hernandez were announced in October as grand marshals for the 131st Rose Parade, the selection was fitting.
Over the years, several past choices reflected California in some way. These three Latina women (a veteran Puerto Rican entertainer, Cuban-American actress, Puerto Rican-American Olympic gymnast) epitomize the 2020 “Power of Hope” theme in a state where Hispanics comprise the population’s largest ethnic group.
“Through their talent, efforts, persistence and dedication, they have achieved excellence and have given back to the world stories of hope, dreams fulfilled, dignity, respect and inspiration,” Laura Farber, the Tournament of Roses president, said about the trio in a statement.
A look at the careers and accomplishments of the 2020 grand marshals:
Rita Moreno — who turned 88 on Dec. 11 — was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in Long Island, N.Y. She started doing Spanish voice-overs for American films at age 11. A couple years later, Moreno scored her first Broadway role and was soon starring in multiple film, television and theater productions.
The multi-faceted entertainer is probably best known for the performances that netted Primetime Emmys (“The Muppet Show,” “The Rockford Files”), a Grammy (“The Electric Company”), an Oscar (1961’s “West Side Story”) and Tony (1975’s “The Ritz”) — putting Moreno in the rare EGOT club. She also won Golden Globe, Peabody, Kennedy Center, Presidential Medal of Freedom and National Medal of Arts awards.
During the 1970s and ’80s, Moreno did guest spots on “The Love Boat,” “The Golden Girls” and “Miami Vice.” Other notable TV appearances include “Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego” (the animated series and its 2019 film version), “Oz,” “The Nanny,” “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” “Ugly Betty,” “Grace and Frankie” and “One Day at a Time.” In late 2020, Moreno will be seen in the Steven Spielberg-directed film remake of “West Side Story,” starring Ansel Elgort.
Having participated in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, famous for one of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s stirring speeches, Moreno still keeps active in social causes. Two years ago, she joined Jennifer Lopez, Gloria Estefan, Camila Cabello, Marc Anthony and others for the Hurricane Maria benefit single, “Almost Like Praying,” under the name Artists for Puerto Rico. The project was spearheaded by “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Gina Torres , 50, is a Manhattan native who grew up in the Bronx. She started singing as a child, attended a performing arts high school in NYC, trained in jazz and opera and was in a gospel choir. Torres appeared in Broadway plays and musicals working with acclaimed theater legends Tommy Tune and Jerry Zaks.
But her main focus was acting, and the 1990s saw appearances on such TV programs as “Law & Order,” the daytime soap opera “One Life to Live,” “Xena: Warrior Princess,” “Hercules: the Legendary Journeys” and “La Femme Nikita.”
Since the 2000s, the Afro-Cuban actress has gained a reputation for taking tough, confident female roles. She added some big screen work, notably with two of “The Matrix” sequels and more television appearances on “Alias,” “Firefly,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” “24,” “The Shield,” “Without a Trace,” “Boston Legal,” “Bones” “Criminal Minds” and “Gossip Girl.”
Astute gamers might recognize Torres’ voice work on “The Matrix” and “DC Universe” online, as well as the “Destiny” series and “Lego DC Super Villains.” More recent TV roles include “The Vampire Diaries,” “Hannibal,” “Westworld” and “The Catch.”
Torres spent seven seasons as Jessica Pearson, the co-founder of a law firm on USA Network’s “Suits” and then transitioned to the short-lived “Pearson” spinoff earlier this year. She is now recurring on “Riverdale.”
Laurie Hernandez , like Moreno, knows her way around the dance floor, from jive to cha-cha and tango. She won ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars” in 2016 with partner Val Chmerkovskiy. Hernandez is the youngest winner of the main competition to date.
The 19-year-old Hernandez is an Olympic medal-winning gymnast born in New Jersey to parents of Puerto Rican descent. As a member of the Final Five women’s team at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Hernandez won gold in the team event and silver on the balance beam.
A 2017 inductee into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame, she is currently training at Gym-Max in Costa Mesa with an eye toward making the U.S. team again for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
Outside of gymnastics, Hernandez has authored “I Got This: To Gold and Beyond,” which covers her young life journey, and the children’s picture book “She’s Got This.” Both appeared on the New York Times Best Sellers list.
On television, she appeared on “Celebrity Family Feud” and co-hosted “America Ninja Warrior Junior” and also voiced the Valeria character on Nickelodeon’s “Middle School Moguls.”
Additionally, Hernandez serves as a global ambassador for STOMP Out Bullying, a prominent national bullying and cyberbullying prevention organization for children and teens.

Democrats may save us yet

Texto completo: Wednesday's impeachment of Donald Trump was neither a surprise nor a turning point. We've known for weeks that the House would vote to impeach. We also know, as surely as we can know anything in politics, that a Republican-controlled Senate won't convict Trump and remove him from office; it may not even pretend to consider the evidence. So it would be easy to be cynical about the whole thing.
But that's not how it felt. For me, and no doubt for millions of my fellow citizens, Wednesday was a very emotional day - a day of both despair and hope.
The reasons for despair are obvious. We could so easily lose everything America is supposed to stand for. The birthplace of liberty may very well be just months away from abandoning all its ideals.
But there were also reasons for hope.
The enemies of freedom are, it turns out, as shameless and corrupt here as they are in nations, from Hungary to Turkey, in which democracy has effectively collapsed. But the defenders of American democracy seem more united and determined than their counterparts abroad. The big question is whether that difference - that true American exceptionalism - will be enough to save us.
Let's back up and ask what we've learned about America over the past three years.
There was never any doubt that Trump would abuse his powers; he telegraphed his contempt for rule of law, his eagerness to exploit his office for personal gain, right from the start. For a while, however, it was possible to imagine that at least part of his party would stand up for democratic principles.
But it was not to be. What we saw Wednesday was a parade of sycophants comparing their leader to Jesus Christ while spouting discredited conspiracy theories straight from the Kremlin. And as they were doing so, the object of their adoration was giving an endless, rambling, third-world-dictator-style speech, full of lies, that veered between grandiosity and self-pity, interspersed with complaints about how many times he has to flush his toilet.
Republicans, in other words, are beyond redemption; they've become just another authoritarian party devoted to the leader principle. And like similar parties in other countries, the GOP is trying to rig future elections through gerrymandering and voter suppression, creating a permanent lock on power.
But if Trump's supporters look just like their counterparts in failed democracies abroad, his opponents don't.
One of the depressing aspects of the rise of authoritarian parties like Hungary's Fidesz and Poland's Law and Justice has been the fecklessness of their opposition - disunited, disorganized, unable to make an effective challenge even to unpopular autocrats as they consolidated their power.
Trumpism, however, faced determined, united, effective opposition from the beginning, which has been reflected both in mass marches and in Democratic electoral victories. In 2017 there were only 15 Democratic governors, compared with 35 Republicans; today the score is 24 to 26. And last year, of course, Democrats won a landslide victory in House elections, which is what made the impeachment hearing and vote possible.
Many of the new Democratic members of Congress are in Republican-leaning districts, and some observers expected a significant number to defect Wednesday. Instead, the party held together almost completely. True, so did its opponents; but while Republicans sounded, well, deranged in their defense of Trump, Democrats came across as sober and serious, determined to do their constitutional duty even if it involved political risks.
Now, none of this necessarily means that democracy will survive. Even as they have been losing elections, Republicans have been consolidating control over the courts and other national institutions. Democratic leaders in Congress have been unexpectedly, even shockingly impressive; the Democratic presidential field less so.
And the unity of purpose we saw Wednesday may not hold next November. If Democrats nominate a progressive like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, will wealthy Democrats decide that defending democracy is less important than keeping their taxes low? If the party nominates a moderate like Joe Biden, will some Sanders supporters express their frustration the same way they did in 2016, by staying home or voting for a third-party candidate? Given the stakes, I'd like to dismiss such concerns, but I can't.
Add in the extent to which next year's election will be rigged in Trump's favor, both by voter suppression and by the skew introduced by the Electoral College - and the even greater skew created by a Senate map that gives small, mostly conservative states as much representation as liberal states with many times their population - and it's all too possible that Trumpism will still triumph.
What we learned Wednesday, however, was that those who define America by its ideals, not the dominance of a particular ethnic group, won't give up easily. The bad news is that our bad people are as bad as everyone else's. The good news is that our good people seem unusually determined to do the right thing.

Texto completo: New York Times bestselling author Ann Patchett's seventh novel, "The Dutch House," is a tale that lingers long after the final page.
A story of home, love, disappointment and forgiveness, the novel centers around the family home of siblings and parents through decades of their changes, longings and, eventually, a comfortable sense of healing that bridges to the next generation.
A graduate of Sarah Lawrence College and the Iowa Writer's Workshop, Patchett has won numerous awards and fellowships, including England's Orange Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award. She has authored six previous novels, three books of nonfiction, and a children's book.
In November 2011, she became co-owner of Parnassus Books in Nashville, where she lives with her husband, Karl VanDevender, and their dog, Sparky.
Reviews for "The Dutch House" often refer to it as "a dark fairy tale," and, indeed, its main characters – two siblings whose childhoods were darkened by the abandonment of their mother, followed by the presence of a cruel stepmother, and their attachment to a large and looming home – spend their lives lamenting their misfortunes in later years, but are still drawn back to the house. Tell us briefly about their childhood regrets.
Danny and Maeve regret that they didn't get the house. They regret that their stepmother won, and they lost. Funny, but when I think about regrets, I tend to think about my own actions and not the actions of others. I think they see themselves as fairly blameless in how the events of their childhood unfolded, and I think they're right. I don't want to give too much away but when Danny is a teenager, he feels he dealt with a terrible situation terribly, but I believe that as an adult he doesn't blame himself or harbor any regret.
The house that siblings Maeve and her younger brother Danny grew up in – and would be banished from – is practically a character itself. The design and features of this unique structure, not to mention its furnishings – loom as large as its physical presence. In what ways does this house stand as a metaphor of this story?
I think of houses as our public face. Our house is how other people see us. Houses represent our success and our failure, our good times and bad. It's where we store our memories. If you've ever had the experience of driving past a house you used to live in, you remember very quickly how you felt when you were there. So, for Danny and Maeve the house represents a happier time when their mother was still with them, and it also represents the security of wealth. They had never imagined another kind of life for themselves, and while Maeve was already out of the house, and in a very small apartment, Danny had no idea about the turns that life might take. Children rarely do.
The story goes far beyond the siblings' childhood years, continuing through their middle age and beyond – as it unfolds their divergent careers and personal lives, and, near the end, the unexpected appearance of a character. When you're developing a story, do you map out the way their lives evolve for such a long time?
I do. Different writers approach this question differently. I really have to know where I'm going, or I just meander around and get nowhere. I like structure and plot, so I work out the larger details of the novel before I start writing. It's my favorite part of the process, thinking a story up. I don't write things down. I keep everything in my head. That way I don't get too attached to a certain idea. I can change my mind. I can just forget about something. My outlines aren't specific, but I have a clear idea about all the characters, who they are, what they want, as well as their arrivals and departures.
It seems that the Dutch House redeems itself at the end. What does that state for the entire story?
I've been told this is a very sad book and I've been told it has a happy ending. I like the fact that different people can read it in different ways. The house never changes. It is, after all, just a house. It's incapable of feelings, a fact that irritates Danny and Maeve who believe on some level that the house should have collapsed in solidarity when they were thrown out. Again, I don't want to give anything away. Let's just say the house is loved and obsessed over for many generations.
Ultimately, this story doesn't seem to be the expected "good guy, bad guy" tale; rather, it's pretty much everyone doing the best he or she can. Could you comment on that?
I'm awful at writing villains. I definitely lean towards sympathetic characters, mainly because most all of the people I know personally are sympathetic. We seem to be living in a world of good and evil now, and who is good and who is evil depends on who you're listening to. But I think most people do the best they can. That said, Andrea is the closest thing I've ever come to a villain, and I can even see how she was young and in over her head. I keep meaning to try harder with my villains, but I spend so much time with my characters and look at them so closely I can't help but feel some empathy for most of them.

Texto completo: storrs - Chris Dailey was first charged with coaching the UConn women's basketball team in late February 1989, when Geno Auriemma was suspended over a scheduling snafu for the regular season finale at St. John's and the Big East Tournament to follow.
Dailey was stressed out.
"I think the only thing I ate in four days was a piece of cake for Kerry Bascom's birthday," she said.
Thirty years later, filling in isn't such a daunting task. And it's hard to imagine Dailey, the program's disciplinarian and protector, stressed out over much of anything in a basketball world UConn has dominated.
"I'm hoping to be bad for basketball," said Dailey, who will coach the Huskies in Auriemma's absence Sunday against Oklahoma. "Some people like the underdog role and all of that. I'd prefer to have the best team and I'd prefer to have people expect us to do well because we expect ourselves to do well."
Remember when UConn was taking heat last year for failing to land a couple marquee recruits?
Dailey, the program's recruiting coordinator, heard all the noise that was ultimately nonsense.
Paige Bueckers, the top recruit in the Class of 2020 and perhaps the most intriguing UConn prospect since Diana Taurasi, was already waiting in the wings. Amari DeBerry (2021) and Isuneh Brady (2022) and several others soon climbed aboard, setting up the Huskies to have one stellar class after another well into the future.
"I laugh at the people that make the comments about where our recruiting is," Dailey said. "They don't know anything about what we do or how we do it. I don't think those same people are making comments now. We don't worry about it, but it does make you chuckle a little bit."
Auriemma continues to recover from surgery to alleviate symptoms caused by diverticulitis.
Seeing Dailey out in front of the operation should remind us what she has meant behind the scenes for all 1,071 victories, all 11 national championships and everything else in a remarkable 35-year run kickstarted by what took place down the stretch of that pre-Gampel Pavilion 1988-89 season.
The Huskies were Big East regular-season champions for the first time in history and soon, under Dailey, conference tournament champions for the first time. With Auriemma back on the bench, UConn also won an NCAA Tournament game for the first time that year. Two years later, the Huskies were in the Final Four, national champions by 1995.
All these years later the blue and white basketball bus keeps rolling like no other operation in college sports, with Dailey behind Auriemma as the meticulous caretaker. No one has more face-to-face time with players during their four years in Storrs.
"I think I just read a headline in the New York Times that said, 'UConn Who?' " Dailey said, citing a story about the recent success of Pac-12 teams. "That made me chuckle, too."
Dailey gets to steer by herself Sunday. She is 9-0 all-time, also coaching three games in 1997 while Auriemma mourned the death of his father and two more last season while he was ill. All the games she has coached have been in February or March.
"This one is a little more difficult because it's earlier in the season," she said. "We have a lot to work on and we have a lot to do to get better. I want us to play better. I want us to get better. Against DePaul [Monday night] we probably played 28 really, really good minutes - between 28 and 30. Our goal this game is we need to cut down the minutes we don't play as well as we want to."
Who runs a more difficult practice? Auriemma or Dailey?
"Don't put this anywhere," Crystal Dangerfield said, smiling. "CD."
"Coach does drills but he goes however long he wants to go," Christyn Williams said. "CD is very, like, on a schedule - get in and get out - which is good, but she's a stickler for details. So is Coach, but she's really a stickler. So it's harder."
That's Dailey - meticulous, detailed, regimented.
She's the constant conversationalist following up with players after Auriemma's broad messages and lessons. She has unique skills in being able to push players, understand them, entertain them. She doesn't screw around - until it's actually time to screw around, so she's the one laying out and enforcing the program's strictest rules and also planning the Easter egg hunts and city tours during road trips.
Her philosophy has always been to set a difficult standard and ease up over time, giving players more of a voice as they begin to understand the program's culture.
"When I first got here, of course I had my tattoo that visible," said Williams, who like every other player in the program history covers that tattoo during games. "So she was talking about that. And I had a nose piercing. I had to take that out. I'm like, OK, there are a lot of rules."
Dailey will have to sacrifice some of the personal conversations that take place at her usual seat on the bench in order to run the game.
"Practice is the same whether he's here or not," Dailey said. "There are things we need to get better at and that's what we're going to do. The [game] is a little different because the things that I normally take care of, I still think about them but I'll make sure [other assistants] have it, whether it's subs or minutes played, timeouts.
"The whole pre-game stuff is different. I don't want to change everything. I like to do what I normally do for [players] but doing that changes because I'm on the other side, making the decisions. It's just a little hectic, that's all."
Still, Dailey running the team for a game or two has a business-as-usual feel.
"I tell the players all the time, you have to be ready," Dailey said. "You never know whether someone's going to sprain an ankle, get sick, foul trouble, and they're not going to be ready to go. So as a coach we have to do the same thing. You don't hope and you never expect that someone isn't going to be able to be there, but him not being there, we all have to step up and be ready. And I think we are ready."

Texto completo: Ward Just had only been a Washington Post reporter for a few months in 1965 when he was offered the opportunity to cover the Vietnam War.
“It was as if some voice said to me, 'This is something you'd better do,' " he recalled in a 2004 Globe interview.
The following 18 months as a war correspondent shaped him into the fiction writer he had hoped to become. “I was watching people, for the first time in my life, in extreme situations," he said, “the way people in that environment dealt with one another, while all the time there was this thundering war going on in the jungles."
Leaving newspaper reporting behind a couple of years after returning home in 1967, he wrote a shelf full of novels — fiction that drew more admiration than awards, to the consternation of his fans.
Mr. Just, who had Lewy body dementia, died Thursday in Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Plymouth. He was 84 and had lived on Martha's Vineyard full time since the early 1990s.
“I can't imagine what my life would have been without Vietnam," he told the Globe in 1982. “It's present in the memory, it moves around with me wherever I am."
Vietnam and the swirling politics in Washington, D.C., often figured in his novels and short stories, and in the magazine and newspaper articles he wrote less often after turning to fiction.
“Echo House," which chronicles three generations of political powerbrokers, was set in Washington — a city “that is his uncontested literary turf," John Hough Jr. wrote in a 1997 Globe review of Mr. Just's novel, which was a National Book Award finalist.
“Surely no living novelist knows Washington better, or brings to it such penetrating intelligence," Hough added.
Mr. Just “is not merely America's best political novelist. He is America's greatest living novelist. To our discredit, he's also America's Greatest Unknown Novelist," Susan Zakin wrote for the LitHub website last year.
His writing reached beyond the battlefields and political campaigns he had once covered as a reporter, however.
“He is equally at home in Chicago, Boston, and Washington," Herbert Mitgangwrote in a 1990 New York Times review of Mr. Just's collection “Twenty-One: Selected Stories."
In the story “About Boston," an O Henry Award finalist, a character says of the Hub: “I like collapsing civilizations. I'm a connoisseur of collapse and systems breakdown and bankruptcy — moral, ethical and financial. So Boston is perfect."
Still, Mr. Just's precise observations had a particular resonance when his subject was a battlefield where he witnessed combatants at close range.
One day in 1966, in a Vietnam rice field, Mr. Just had “settled under a palm tree to make endless notes — a reporter's woolgathering — and then dropped flat at the sound of shots, five of them in very rapid succession," he recalled in a 1982 Washington Post essay.
When the shooting stopped, he spotted a soldier nearby on his back, “and amid all that drab — the green of his fatigues, the black stock of his M16, the sweaty gray of his T-shirt — a small red hole in his heart," Mr. Just wrote.
“My journalist's eye — this is the eye they pay you for and that, in turn, you pay for too, sometimes, in some coin — registered that his cigarette was burning on the ground beside him, a Lucky Strike," he wrote, adding that the soldier had “died before the cigarette did, and I find that now a cheap irony, though I didn't then. From details such as these, according to the canons of journalism, I knew, you could make something larger."
Born in Michigan City, Ind., on Sept. 5, 1935, Ward Swift Just was the son of Franklin Ward Just and Elizabeth Swift.
Mr. Just's grandfather and father served successively as publisher of the Waukegan News-Sun, and he grew up in that Chicago suburb, and in nearby Lake Forest.
“From my earliest moments, my dream was to write fiction," Mr. Just said in 2004. “I wrote a play when I was in the fourth grade and wrote short stories all the way through grade school, prep school, and most of the way through college."
After graduating from Cranbrook, a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., boarding school, Mr. Just went to Trinity College in Hartford, “from which I never graduated but attended more or less faithfully for four years," he recalled in 1982. “I didn't graduate because academe was never my long suit. The only thing I ever wanted to do was write, so I either failed or got D's in everything besides history and courses in creative writing."
Upon his return to Illinois, he found working for his father at the family newspaper an ill fit.
“We fought about how the paper should be organized, what I ought to be doing on the paper, what I was doing, what he should be doing, what he was doing. The problem, essentially, was his shadow. He cast a long one, and I don't like shadows a whole lot," Mr. Just said in 1982, and added: “The only way out was to leave."
He ended up writing for Newsweek magazine, eventually under Ben Bradlee in the Washington bureau. When Bradlee went to The Washington Post, he hired Mr. Just.
After returning from Vietnam, where he had been injured by shrapnel from a grenade, Mr. Just wrote his first book, “To What End: Report From Vietnam."
Then he covered the 1968 presidential bids of Eugene McCarthy and Richard M. Nixon (“a campaign of oceanic tedium," he told the Globe) and wrote editorials for the Post, but “I knew I was finished," he said in 2004. “I was a pretty good war correspondent, but I had absolutely no desire to go back to that war or any other war. With newspaper reporting, you've got to have a lust for news if you're going to do it well. I had lost it."
He wrote his first novel — “A Soldier of the Revolution" (1970) — and was principally a fiction writer ever after. His other novels included “An Unfinished Season" (2004), which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.
“He should have won the Pulitzer half a dozen times," the writer Frederick Busch, who died in 2006, told the Globe in 2004.
Mr. Just's first two marriages, to Jean Ramsay and Anne Burling, ended in divorce.
In 1983, he married Sarah Catchpole, with whom he lived in Paris for several years before settling permanently on Martha's Vineyard, where they had lived part time.
In addition to Catchpole, Mr. Just's survivors include his children from his previous marriages, Jennifer of Woodbridge, Conn., Julia of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Ian of Arlington; and six grandchildren.
Information about a memorial service was not immediately available.
Describing his writing process, Mr. Just said his novels emerged from the writing itself — “I draft and redraft."
“I'm not one to outline," he said in 1982. “I start with the first sentence and never know where I am going to end up. I never know the first sentence until I know the last. That changes."
And switching from journalism to fiction required a realignment of his approach, including paring down the details he included in his prose.
“Factual material can overwhelm the vessel," he said in 2004. “I do think that what is going on behind the eyelids is more important than the eyelids. If you spend a lot of time on descriptive details, that detracts from what is going on inside a character, which you know by gesture and language."

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — As a native New Yorker, writer Michael Powell had a lot of adjusting to do — to the landscape, lifestyle and culture — when he moved to Fort Defiance, Arizona, a quarter century ago where his wife was a midwife for the Indian Health Service.
Powell, his wife and their two young sons took up residence in a trailer on the Navajo Nation in 1993. That months-long experience might have turned out to be just an unusual footnote in Powell's life after he went on to become a sports writer and columnist for The New York Times.
Instead, it became something much greater — an introduction for Powell into how the sport of basketball permeates and reflects society on the Navajo Nation, where high-octane "rez ball" draws huge, intense crowds to high school gyms that regularly exceed the population of a given town.
Powell's interest, and storytelling instincts, were aroused. It would be years before he fully acted on them, but he returned to northeast Arizona a few years ago to chronicle the quest for a state title by the 2016-17 Chinle High School boys basketball team and its coach, Raul Mendoza. The author shares what he observed in his book "Canyon Dreams: A Basketball Season on the Navajo Nation," recently published by Blue Rider Press, an imprint of Penguin/Random House.
Those experiences of living on the Navajo Nation and exploring the passion of its people for basketball — something Powell shares, given his New York upbringing — had a profound effect on him, the author said.
"In the sense of that place, that land, that culture, yes," he said during a telephone interview on Dec. 19 from Milwaukee, where he was traveling to cover that night's NBA heavyweight battle between the hometown Bucks and the visiting Los Angeles Lakers for The Times. "The hooks were in before, but now the hooks go pretty damn deep."
Powell rented a studio apartment in Chinle throughout the season. He described the differences between his stay there and his normal life in Brooklyn with a mix of wonder and bemusement.There was the joy of being able to get up every morning and go for a hike in Canyon de Chelly National Park instead of enduring yet another subway ride, he said. But that was balanced by the frustrations of dealing with limited cell phone service and quickly learning the wisdom of stocking up on groceries and other household necessities during his frequent trips to Albuquerque, Gallup or Flagstaff.
Mostly, though, Powell was there to immerse himself in the culture and try to understand why basketball had such a hold on its people. One of his first steps was developing a sense of trust with his subjects.
"It's not a strictly linear culture, not like setting up a bunch of interviews and doing them in a row — not that that's the best way to go about it anyway," he said. "It's more like you want to be there when the chances present themselves. I found people quite welcoming as long as you put in your time — and put being a Type A New Yorker aside."
Powell, long accustomed to covering sports at the college and professional level, reveled in the access he had to the players and coaches in Chinle.
"The great aspect of writing about a high school team is, you can just walk into the locker room and be there every day at practice," he said, comparing that experience to the limits placed on him as a media member covering the NBA, "where you're looking at it with your nose pressed to the glass."
Even with that increased access, there were some obvious differences to be gotten over as he built relationships with the players, Powell noted. After all, he was an older, Anglo guy trying to relate to Native teenage boys.
"So, it's different. But no one was hostile to me in the least," he said.
Biding his time and making the effort to blend in, Powell eventually found himself invited to some family dinners — large, elaborate gatherings that included extended aunts, uncles and grandparents. One of his lasting impressions about social life on the Navajo Nation, he said, was the range of everyday discussions.
"I would get into conversations about things that are sometimes quite a bit deeper than you would find in New York or Albuquerque," he said. "It's that sense of tradition that cuts beyond what you immediately see on the surface."
Powell's efforts to relate the story of a distinct, geographically isolated place and culture, not just write a book about a high school sports team, make it nearly impossible not to compare "Canyon Dreams" to "Friday Night Lights," H.G. "Buzz" Bissinger's seminal 1990 account of a season with the Permian High School football team in Odessa, Texas, a community where football had taken on a grossly outsized importance. That book not only became a bestseller, spawning a film version and TV series, it became the gold standard for books of that genre.
Powell acknowledged "Canyon Dreams" covers many of the same elements as Bissinger's book, but he said he never worried about his book being characterized as a basketball or Navajo version of "Friday Night Lights."
"I'm aware that the book exists," he said. "I even read part of it years ago. In fact, I took it with me and decided not to read it. I didn't want to have it like a parrot talking to me in my ear. I only recently read it, but it never served as a template for me, even though it's a beautiful, brilliant book."
It has long been the job of writers to cast their stories in a multidimensional fashion, Powell said, one that examines a central theme — in this case, basketball — from a 360-degree perspective.
"How do you tell more than that one aspect of a story? How do you tell more than a politics story if that's what you're writing? You do it by telling a story in the round," he said. "There have plenty of other books that have done a similar deep dive. And when you start getting compared to something like ("Friday Night Lights"), that's probably a sign that you did you job."
With "Friday Night Lights," Bissinger succeeded in drawing a nuanced and empathetic yet honest portrait of an entire community, not a mere sports book. Powell hopes he has done something similar with "Canyon Dreams."
"If he had written a formulaic football book, bad on him, and bad on me, if that's what I had tried to do," Powell said. "But he didn't. And I think this is a really good goal to shoot for in a broader sense."
In the forward to his book, Bissinger wrote of the tremendous affection he developed for the community and especially the players after a year spent living in Odessa to research "Friday Night Lights." While reporters and writers are taught to maintain a professional distance from their subjects, Powell said he never worried about avoiding those feelings during his extended stay in Chinle.
"If you're being honest with yourself, if you spend that much time somewhere, you can't help but start to feel the job or the pain of the people you're writing about," he said. "I don't worry about that aspect at all. ... You have to feel what people are going through. The bigger challenge is writing about it in a clear-eyed way. I think I did that."

Texto completo: [OK Boomer]
As 2019 ends, various dictionary publishers are choosing their "Word of the Year," a term they believe has surged the most in usage and importance. The originator of this practice, the American Dialect Society, makes its choice on Jan. 3, and this time the gathering of scholars will also pick a "Word of the Decade."
Full disclosure: As chair of the society's New Words Committee, I'll be overseeing the selections. Earlier this week, I visited my son's eighth-grade class at his Jersey City middle school to give a talk about the process, and I asked the students what their nomination would be for 2019. Several piped up with "boomer" and "OK boomer."
My Generation Z audience then proceeded to break down the significance of an epithet that has indeed made a big impact over the past year. For millennials and especially post-millennials, "OK boomer" has become a sly linguistic weapon of intergenerational warfare.
In its current use as a put-down, "boomer" has strayed from its original meaning referring to members of the baby boom generation born after World War II -- and long known, partly thanks to their outsize numbers, as powerful trendsetters for the culture as a whole. Members of the postwar generation began to be called "baby boomers" as early as 1963 and simply "boomers" by 1974.
But in Generation Z parlance, "boomer" can be applied to anyone older who has a condescending or out-of-touch attitude toward young people and their concerns. As my Gen Z son puts it, "It's not an age group -- it's a mind-set." (Confusion over what exactly "boomer" means now is reflected in "what is a boomer" being one of Google's top searches in 2019.)
The full phrase "OK boomer" has been embraced as a handy retort to mock anyone stodgily complaining about kids today, with the kids themselves spreading the expression in viral fashion on video-sharing platforms like TikTok. The phrase was mostly percolating under the radar until it garnered major media attention in late October, in widely shared articles from NBC News and the New York Times.
Pretty soon "OK boomer" was everywhere, and the backlash from the older side of the generational divide was swift. Conservative radio host Bob Lonsberry, in a now-deleted tweet, went so far as to declare that "boomer" is now "the n-word of ageism." Myrna Blyth, editorial director of AARP Media, told Axios, "OK, millennials. But we're the people that actually have the money." Others have tried out "OK zoomer" as a comeback to the comeback, using "zoomer" as a snarky label for Generation Z.
The phrase next made international news: Chloe Swarbrick, a 25-year-old member of New Zealand's Parliament, became an online sensation when she used "OK boomer" to respond to heckling of a climate-change speech she was giving. In U.S. politics, meanwhile, targets of the jibe have included 77-year-old former vice president Joe Biden (born before the baby boom generation, whose members now range from 55 to 73). As I mentioned in a previous column, one Iowa voter reacting to Mr. Biden's old-fashioned campaign slogan "No Malarkey" told Politico, "I'm afraid he's going to be disregarded as, 'OK boomer.'"
"Boomer" talk has even crossed linguistic boundaries. This week, Van Dale, a dictionary publisher in the Netherlands, announced "boomer" as the Dutch Word of the Year after an online vote of more than 17,000 people. In New Zealand, thanks to Ms. Swarbrick, "OK boomer" topped a "Word of the Year" poll held by media commentator Russell Brown. Will the American Dialect Society similarly honor "OK boomer"? If it loses out, I can guess what the terse response from those eighth-graders is going to be.

Facebook Discovers A.I. Being Used to Disinform

Texto completo: Researchers said the profiles, linked to the Epoch Media Group, used photos generated by artificial intelligence in a preview of an "eerie, tech-enabled future of disinformation."
Facebook said on Friday that it had removed hundreds of accounts with ties to the Epoch Media Group, parent company of the Falun Gong-related publication and conservative news outlet The Epoch Times.
The accounts, including pages, groups and Instagram feeds meant to be seen in both the United States and Vietnam, presented a new wrinkle to researchers: fake profile photos generated with the help of artificial intelligence.
The idea that artificial intelligence could be used to create wide-scale disinformation campaigns has long been a fear of computer scientists. And they said it was worrying to see it already being used in a coordinated effort on Facebook.
While the technology used to create the fake profile photos was most likely a far cry from the sophisticated A.I. systems being created in labs at big tech companies like Google, the network of fake accounts showed "an eerie, tech-enabled future of disinformation," said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.
Scientists have already shown that machines can generate images and sounds that are indistinguishable from the real thing or spew vast volumes of fake text, which could accelerate the creation of false and misleading information. This year, researchers at a Canadian company even built a system that learned to imitate the voice of the podcaster Joe Rogan by analyzing audio from his old podcasts. It was a shockingly accurate imitation.
The people behind the network of 610 Facebook accounts, 89 Facebook Pages, 156 Groups and 72 Instagram accounts posted about political news and issues in the United States, including President Trump's impeachment, conservative ideology, political candidates, trade and religion.
"This was a large, brazen network that had multiple layers of fake accounts and automation that systematically posted content with two ideological focuses: support of Donald Trump and opposition to the Chinese government," Mr. Brookie said in an interview.
The Atlantic Council's lab and another company, Graphika, which also studies disinformation, released a joint report analyzing the Facebook takedown.
The Epoch Media Group denied in an email sent to The New York Times that it was linked to the network targeted by Facebook, and said that Facebook had not contacted the company before publishing its conclusions.
The people behind the network used artificial intelligence to generate profile pictures, Facebook said. They relied on a type of artificial intelligence called generative adversarial networks. These networks can, through a process called machine learning, teach themselves to create realistic images of faces, even though they do not belong to a real person.
Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of security policy, said in an interview that "using A.I.-generated photos for profiles" has been talked about for several months, but for Facebook, this is "the first time we've seen a systemic use of this by actors or a group of actors to make accounts look more authentic."
He added that this A.I. technique did not actually make it harder for the company's automated systems to detect the fakes, because the systems focus on patterns of behavior among accounts.
Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, said that "we need more research into A.I.-generated imagery like this, but it takes a lot more to hide a fake network than just the profile pictures."
Facebook said the accounts masked their activities by using a combination of fake and authentic American accounts to manage pages and groups on the platforms. The coordinated, inauthentic activity, Facebook said, revolved around the media outlet The BL -- short for "The Beauty of Life" -- which the fact-checking outlet Snopes said in November was "building a fake empire on Facebook and getting away with it."
Mr. Gleicher said Facebook began its investigation into The BL in July, and accelerated its efforts when the network became more aggressive in posting this fall. It is continuing to investigate "other links and networks" tied to The BL, he said.
Facebook said the network had spent less than $ 9.5 million on Facebook and Instagram ads. On Friday, Facebook said The BL would be banned from the social network.
The Epoch Times and The BL have denied being linked, but Facebook said it had found coordinated, inauthentic behavior from the network to the Epoch Media Group and individuals in Vietnam working on its behalf.
The Epoch Media Group said in its email that The BL was founded by a former employee and employs some of its former employees. "However, that some of our former employees work for BL is not evidence of any connection between the two organizations," the company said.
A Facebook spokeswoman said executives The BL were active administrators on Epoch Media Group Pages as recently as Friday morning.
In August, Facebook banned advertising from The Epoch Times after NBC News published a report that said The Epoch Times had obscured its connection to Facebook ads promoting President Trump and conspiracy content.
Twitter said on Friday that the social network was also aware of The BL network, and had already "identified and suspended approximately 700 accounts originating from Vietnam for violating our rules around platform manipulation." A company spokeswoman added that its investigation was still open, but Twitter has not identified links between the accounts and state-backed actors.
Facebook also said on Friday that it had taken down a network of more than 300 pages and 39 Facebook accounts and their coordinated, inauthentic activities on domestic political news in Georgia.
Facebook said the network tried to conceal its coordination but it found that the accounts responsible were run by the Georgian Dream-led government, and Panda, a local advertising agency in the country. The owners of the Facebook pages masqueraded as news organizations and impersonated public figures, political parties and activist groups.
In a related move, Twitter said it also took down 32 million tweets from nearly 6,000 accounts related to a Saudi Arabian social media marketing company called Smaat, which ran political and commercial influence operations.
Smaat was led in part by Ahmed Almutairi, a Saudi man wanted by the F.B.I. on charges that he recruited two Twitter employees to search internal company databases for information about critics of the Saudi government, said Renee DiResta, a disinformation researcher at the Stanford Internet Observatory, which separately analyzed Twitter's takedown.
The operation was "extremely high volume," and automatically generated by "Twitter apps that made religious posts, posts about the weather" and other topics, Ms. DiResta said.
At times, the accounts were used for "more tailored purposes," including more than 17,000 tweets related to Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and columnist for The Washington Post, who was killed while visiting a Saudi consulate in October last year.
Many of the tweets claimed that those criticizing the Saudi government for their involvement were doing so for their own political purposes.

One lab director said the discovery showed "an eerie, tech-enabled future of disinformation." (PHOTOGRAPHS BY GRAPHIKA/THE ATLANTIC COUNCIL'S DIGITAL FORENSIC RESEARCH LAB) (B4)

California Coastal Waters Are Acidifying at an Insane Rate—Here’s Why It Matters

Texto completo: A new study, conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has results that will make you more disturbed about the state of climate change. The scientific agency’s research has shown that the waters off the coast of California are acidifying twice as fast as the rest of the oceans around the world.
What does this mean exactly?
SEE ALSO: Even a Coal-Powered Tesla Is Greener Than a Normal Car
Here’s a staggering statistic: roughly 27% of all carbon dioxide emitted since 1959 has gone into the Pacific Ocean off the California coast. Put into the mix that California is the second highest producer of carbon dioxide in the country (right behind Texas, which, incidentally, doesn’t have an ocean), and you have a date with ecosystem disaster.
Have you seen the air around Los Angeles? Pretty crappy isn’t it? In 2018, the region violated federal smog standards for 87 consecutive days. That violation took home the record for the longest stretch of bad air in the past 20 years. The smog around L.A. sometimes makes your eyes water.
Hmmm, do you think there’s a connection to the massive amount of traffic and lack of decent public transport in the area to what’s going on with the waters off the coast?
So, while we, humans, continue to pollute the atmosphere with more and more planet-warming carbon dioxide, the ocean off the California coast has become like a carbon sponge. The carbon dioxide gas is absorbed in huge quantities by seawater. In turn, the oceans keep the planet from getting hotter than it already has.
And the crazed record heat that Californians have been experiencing is no fluke. In fact, in the last five years, California temperatures have been the hottest in 124 years.
And guess what?
The result makes the ocean more acidic, which is commonly referred to as ocean acidification . It has not only devastating effects on the ocean off the California coast but also around the globe. (Spoiler Alert: In general, oceans around the world are now 30% more acidic than they were before the industrial revolution.)
But let’s get back to California.
The study has also made connections to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle that scientists have noted is playing a major role in the higher and faster rates of sea level rise hitting California. In recent years, this has come in the form of such major storms as El Niño and La Niña. Researchers have found these climatic change cycles have also added stress to the extreme changes we’ve seen in the ocean’s chemistry.
So what does this mean for Californians, in particular?
Well, it threatens the nation’s most economically valuable fisheries. Also, the carbon dioxide that has turned the seawater acidic devastates shell-forming species and corals. Researchers reconstructed a 100-year history of acidification along the West Coast by collecting and analyzing a specific type of shell on the seafloor. They used the data to determine that since 1900, shells have gotten 20% thinner—indicating an increase in acidic waters which blocks the chemicals sea creatures use to form shells.
Dr. Emily Osborne, one of the study’s authors, told The New York Times : “I could just watch the shells literally getting thinner as I moved up through the record and got closer to the present day.”
While the ocean serves an important role in mitigating climate change by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, there will come a point at which oceans can’t absorb anymore.
“This makes the extremes even more extreme. It’s like a double whammy for this region of the world,” said Osborne. “From this study, and so many other published studies, there’s no question that the answer is to curb our carbon emissions.”
Until then, we’ll see you at the next California wildfire, in 120-degree heat, as we pray that sea-life will somehow adapt to this climate change disaster.

Texto completo: Whoever said that relative performance doesn't put food on the table never worked on Wall Street.
A year ago, Heard on the Street's columnists consoled ourselves with the results of the second annual stock-picking contest by pointing out that we lost less than the overall stock market and also beat an index of hedge-fund managers. This year, the team made a profit, but barely enough for a virtual value meal. The 14 "buy" and 10 "sell" recommendations earned an average return, not including dividends, of just 3.8% over four months. More picks lost money than made money.
While many Heard writers' arguments had holes in them, one did so in a very good way— a "buy" recommendation on Crocs by Hong Kong-based columnist Jacky Wong that preceded a 62% gain. He argued that the company's ugly shoes were gaining support from social influencers and that, despite a strong run over the past year, they remained reasonably valued at 15 times forward earnings. On the other hand, skepticism was warranted for Heard's second-best pick— a recommendation to sell then-sizzling Beyond Meat shares, which lost nearly half of their value.
A large number of Heard's readers also were skeptical about the surging stock's prospects. Despite being a new and not especially large company, Beyond Meat was the 2nd-most-picked stock out of over 7,000 entries and one of the few that had more readers betting against it than for it.
Subscribers weren't laughing all the way to the virtual bank with some other popular negative bets, though. For example, Tesla, which attracted a record 282 picks and also the most "sell" recommendations at 195, rose sharply. While it wasn't one of our columnists' selections, Heard columnist Charley Grant wasn't enthused about the company after its October share-price surge on a surprise quarterly profit. Netflix was another popular "sell" with 126 out of 166 readers thinking it would drop. The stock rose modestly despite the emergence of stiff competition in the so-called Streaming Wars.
Another stock frequently in the news, former blue chip General Electric, attracted 98 sells out of 150 picks, but the stock rose by about 10%. It had briefly cratered in August, right when the contest began, after Harry Markopolos, the forensic accountant who had warned authorities about Bernard Madoff, made sensational claims about accounting irregularities. Heard wrote these claims "had little merit." And, despite possibly reading somewhere on Twitter that it is "failing, " readers betting against New York Times Co. had all the losses fit to print.
By contrast, there were some stocks that were universally loved by readers. Such unanimity is usually a sign to steer clear, but it wasn't in these cases. Retailers Dollar General and Lumber Liquidators both rose, and the latter was the third-best performer among columnists' picks. It was briefly the top performer following reports that its founder had purchased shares on the open market and might take the company private. He instead sold most of them for what was reportedly a nearly 50% gain .
Stocks rose overall with the S&P 500 gaining 8.6% during the contest. In such an environment, it should come as little surprise that optimism paid off for both columnists and subscribers. Four of the top five Heard picks were "buy" recommendations while four of the five worst ones were "sells." Some 42% of Heard's picks called for stocks to fall while only 21% of readers bet against stocks. That helps to explain readers' superior results—an average profit of 5.1%, some 1.3 percentage points better than Heard's scribes.
Share Your Tips
What advice do you have for stock pickers? Join the conversation below.
There is a wry saying on Wall Street that a long-term investment is a short-term one that didn't work out. While Heard's picks relied more on fundamental analysis than short-term sentiment and may yet redeem themselves, most readers grasped the key to glory in a short-term contest with imaginary money: You either go big or go home .
All five of the top reader picks were money-losing drug-development companies led by Forty Seven Inc., Chemocentryx and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals. Many of the worst picks were companies close to the precipice such as Dean Foods and Superior Energy Services, which stumbled rather than rebounding. Try to catch a falling knife and you'll probably wind up bloodied. Skeptical bets on loss-making exercise-band maker Fitbit, by contrast, blew up when Google agreed to buy the company.
Heard's writers, after three years of being mostly humbled by the market—and this year also by our readers—can see the wisdom in legendary investor Benjamin Graham's words that in the short run, the market is merely a "voting machine." As we dust ourselves off, we take heart in the continuation of the quote: that in the long run it's a "weighing machine."

Texto completo: For years, air quality in the U.S. steadily improved. And just like that, deaths related to air pollution fell off, too.
However, in 2017 and 2018, new data show, the amount of fine-particle air pollution got worse, with concentrations rising 5.5 percent after falling by 24.2 percent the previous five years.
The reversal made a real difference in the lives of thousands of Americans. Using reliable formulas that reflect the relationship between pollution and mortality, researchers say in 2018 alone, worsening air quality can be linked to more than 10,000 additional deaths.
Fine-particle air pollution - from tailpipes of cars and trucks, and smokestacks at factories and power plants - is very harmful. Measuring less than 1/30th the width of a human hair, it can be inhaled and absorbed into the bloodstream. It has been linked to heart disease and stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer, as well as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. It can lead to lower test scores and work productivity.
Regulations have gone a long way in limiting the bad effects of air pollution. But even as pollution fell, by one measurement dropping the number of deaths related to it by 47 percent in the two decades prior to 2010, it could still be blamed in part for 71,000 deaths that year - as many as fatal shootings and car accidents combined. In 2015, even as every county in the U.S. met federal air quality standards, pollution was responsible for more than 30,000 deaths.
It's a problem, and now it's getting worse, again.
Americans have driven more and used more natural gas over the last two years, part of the reason pollution is on the rise. Wildfires, mainly in California, also played a role.
But also cited as a factor were actions by the Environmental Protection Agency, beginning during the Obama administration and given the throttle under President Trump.
Enforcement of the Clean Air Act began to fall off under Obama but fell precipitously under Trump. The Trump administration also has rolled back 24 rules and regulations related to air quality, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Last year, the EPA disbanded a panel of experts who advised the agency on fine-particle pollution, replacing it with consultants from the fossil fuel, pharmaceutical and tobacco industries.
And when the EPA found that eliminating the Clean Power Plan - which sought to lower carbon emissions from power generators - would cost an additional 1,400 premature deaths, the Trump administration decided to change the way such calculations are made.
In short, against all scientific evidence, the EPA now says that cleaner air does not lead to better health.
That is simply not the case. Ignoring the very real problems caused by air pollution will only allow it to get worse, affecting the health of tens of thousands of Americans each year.

Democrats May Save Us Yet

Texto completo: America's defenders of democracy take a stand.
Wednesday's impeachment of Donald Trump was neither a surprise nor a turning point. We've known for weeks that the House would vote to impeach. We also know, as surely as we can know anything in politics, that a Republican-controlled Senate won't convict Trump and remove him from office; it may not even pretend to consider the evidence. So it would be easy to be cynical about the whole thing.
But that's not how it felt. For me, and no doubt for millions of my fellow citizens, Wednesday was a very emotional day -- a day of both despair and hope.
The reasons for despair are obvious. We could so easily lose everything America is supposed to stand for. The birthplace of liberty may very well be just months away from abandoning all its ideals.
But there were also reasons for hope.
The enemies of freedom are, it turns out, as shameless and corrupt here as they are in nations, from Hungary to Turkey, in which democracy has effectively collapsed. But the defenders of American democracy seem more united and determined than their counterparts abroad. The big question is whether that difference -- that true American exceptionalism -- will be enough to save us.
Let's back up and ask what we've learned about America over the past three years.
There was never any doubt that Trump would abuse his powers; he telegraphed his contempt for rule of law, his eagerness to exploit his office for personal gain, right from the start. For a while, however, it was possible to imagine that at least part of his party would stand up for democratic principles.
But it was not to be. What we saw Wednesday was a parade of sycophants comparing their leader to Jesus Christ while spouting discredited conspiracy theories straight from the Kremlin. And as they were doing so, the object of their adoration was giving an endless, rambling, third-world-dictator-style speech, full of lies, that veered between grandiosity and self-pity, interspersed with complaints about how many times he has to flush his toilet.
Republicans, in other words, are beyond redemption; they've become just another authoritarian party devoted to the leader principle. And like similar parties in other countries, the G.O.P. is trying to rig future elections through gerrymandering and voter suppression, creating a permanent lock on power.
But if Trump's supporters look just like their counterparts in failed democracies abroad, his opponents don't.
One of the depressing aspects of the rise of authoritarian parties like Hungary's Fidesz and Poland's Law and Justice has been the fecklessness of their opposition -- disunited, disorganized, unable to make an effective challenge even to unpopular autocrats as they consolidated their power.
Trumpism, however, faced determined, united, effective opposition from the beginning, which has been reflected both in mass marches and in Democratic electoral victories. In 2017 there were only 15 Democratic governors, compared with 35 Republicans; today the score is 24 to 26. And last year, of course, Democrats won a landslide victory in House elections, which is what made the impeachment hearing and vote possible.
Many of the new Democratic members of Congress are in Republican-leaning districts, and some observers expected a significant number to defect on Wednesday. Instead, the party held together almost completely. True, so did its opponents; but while Republicans sounded, well, deranged in their defense of Trump, Democrats came across as sober and serious, determined to do their constitutional duty even if it involved political risks.
Now, none of this necessarily means that democracy will survive. Even as they have been losing elections, Republicans have been consolidating control over the courts and other national institutions. Democratic leaders in Congress have been unexpectedly, even shockingly impressive; the Democratic presidential field less so.
And the unity of purpose we saw Wednesday may not hold next November. If Democrats nominate a progressive like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, will wealthy Democrats decide that defending democracy is less important than keeping their taxes low? If the party nominates a moderate like Joe Biden, will some Sanders supporters express their frustration the same way they did in 2016, by staying home or voting for a third-party candidate? Given the stakes, I'd like to dismiss such concerns, but I can't.
Add in the extent to which next year's election will be rigged in Trump's favor, both by voter suppression and by the skew introduced by the Electoral College -- and the even greater skew created by a Senate map that gives small, mostly conservative states as much representation as liberal states with many times their population -- and it's all too possible that Trumpism will still triumph.
What we learned Wednesday, however, was that those who define America by its ideals, not the dominance of a particular ethnic group, won't give up easily. The bad news is that our bad people are as bad as everyone else's. The good news is that our good people seem unusually determined to do the right thing.

Texto completo: The day after voting against impeaching President Trump, the New Jersey representative appeared with him in the Oval Office to announce he would leave the Democratic Party for the Republicans.
WASHINGTON -- The day after he defected from Democrats to vote against impeaching President Trump, Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey on Thursday appeared in the Oval Office with Mr. Trump to make it official: He was becoming a Republican.
Sitting beside the president and Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, Mr. Van Drew, who told his staff over the weekend that he planned to leave the Democratic Party, pledged his "undying support" to Mr. Trump.
"I believe that this is just a better fit for me," Mr. Van Drew said. "This is who I am."
The announcement -- put on the president's calendar just one day earlier -- neatly concluded nearly a week of chaos for Mr. Van Drew after word leaked out over the weekend that he was preparing to switch parties, and courting Mr. Trump's support for his move. And it showcased a mutually beneficial political union between two native New Yorkers who each find themselves isolated in different ways.
Mr. Trump began the day on Thursday grappling with his new status as an impeached president. Mr. Van Drew, a centrist freshman who was one of the few Democrats to break with the party on Wednesday and oppose impeaching Mr. Trump, began the day as a pariah among members of his old party.
But at the White House, as he proclaimed himself a Republican, Mr. Van Drew, who swapped his usual checkered blue jacket for a somber dark suit with a red tie, reveled in the public embrace of a president who carried his district by nearly five percentage points. He also delivered a wide-ranging jeremiad from his seat in the Oval Office, often employing Republican talking points: railing against socialism and the Green New Deal, and lamenting what he called the demise of American exceptionalism and respect for the American flag among Democratic lawmakers.
"I didn't leave my party. My party left me," he said, quoting President Ronald Reagan. "And I'm saying the same thing."
For Mr. Trump, the subtext of the New Jersey lawmaker's support fit neatly into his preferred impeachment narrative: that Democrats had alienated even their own by taking the extreme step of seeking to remove him.
"Democrats impeachment is so compelling," Andrew Clark, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, wrote on Twitter, that "one Democrat actually switched parties. Great post-game!"
Mr. Van Drew's conversion to the Republican Party began as a discussion between allies of Mr. Trump and the congressman's associates over the past few months, according to people familiar with the conversations. Mr. Trump had asked several associates about it after seeing Mr. Van Drew vote against the ground rules for the impeachment inquiry.
Just how much Mr. Trump's backing will help Mr. Van Drew, a former dentist and state legislator, remains to be seen. Several Republican candidates already planning on running for the district's Republican nomination have warily eyed Mr. Van Drew's defection while making clear they intend to stay in the race.
But Mr. Van Drew was facing two unappealing options: most likely lose as a Democrat, or roll the dice and see if he could win as a Republican.
Only last month, Mr. Van Drew seemed to regard the Democratic Party as a perfectly good fit; he vowed that he would remain a Democrat even as he continued to oppose impeachment. But that was before he saw the results of a poll of Democratic primary voters that made plain that he was exceedingly vulnerable in his district, with more than 70 percent saying they would be less likely to support him if he voted against impeaching Mr. Trump.
Mr. Van Drew met privately with Mr. Trump in the residence of the White House last Friday, with Mr. Trump's top adviser, Kellyanne Conway, in attendance, according to two people briefed on the meeting who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations. Mr. Van Drew sought assurances from the president, and Mr. Trump said he would support him publicly, those briefed said.
Others who were closely involved were Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who is a longtime friend of Mr. Trump's, and who still holds extensive sway with Republicans in the state. Bill Stepien, the White House political director, has deep ties in New Jersey and was intimately involved in the effort. He spent the past 10 days in the southern part of the state to work his contacts to help the move come about, according to two Trump advisers.
Congressional Democrats condemned Mr. Van Drew's move. Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chairwoman of the House Democrats' campaign arm, demanded in a scathing statement that Mr. Van Drew apologize to his constituents for "betraying their trust" in a "misguided attempt to save his own political future." (Omitted from the statement was that Mr. Van Drew had also betrayed the trust of the campaign arm, which had intervened in his primary to support him when he won the seat last year.)
Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, was blunter.
"Do you know what we would have done with a guy like that in my neighborhood in Paterson?" Mr. Pascrell told reporters, adding, "I don't advocate violence."
Before he was elected to Congress, Mr. Van Drew cut a conservative figure in the New Jersey legislature, earning a 100 percent approval rating from the National Rifle Association and voting in 2012 against the state's proposed Marriage Equality Act.
Reveling in Mr. Van Drew's anticipated defection on Thursday morning on Capitol Hill, Mr. McCarthy boasted that he could not remember "the last time someone left the majority party to join the minority party."
Referring to comments made earlier in the day by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California that she had a "spring in her step" on Thursday because of the "moral courage" of her caucus, Mr. McCarthy offered his own interpretation.
"That may be true," he said. "Because her conference is going to be a little smaller, and a little lighter."

Texto completo: Robert Mustin had just quit his job and was without health insurance for about four months when he ended up in the Tulare Regional Medical Center emergency room, first in May and then again in July 2014.
The Tulare resident, now 31, didn't think about those two visits until three years later when he was contacted by Kings Credit Services asking him to pay bills that totaled $4,409 for emergency room care and lab tests. The unpaid bills had prompted the credit company to file a lawsuit against Mustin.
Mustin, a truck driver who is often between gigs, was alarmed at the looming debt. He was making just under $22,000 annually at the time, according to his 2016 tax return.
"I tried to work something out with the hospital, but they told me it was too late, and I had to just work with the collection agency by that time," said Mustin, who declined to discuss his reason for visiting the ER, citing privacy concerns.
As he tried to figure out how to resolve the debt he couldn't pay, Mustin stumbled on California's Hospital Fair Pricing Policies, which since January 2007 have mandated that acute care hospitals limit medical bills to the Medicaid reimbursement rate for the uninsured or families with incomes at or below 350% of the federal poverty level — $90,125 in 2019 for a family of four or $43,125 for a single person like Mustin.
This is called charity care. Federal law reinforces this with similar rules for nonprofit hospitals, like Tulare Regional Medical Center. The hospital is now Adventist Health Tulare, after Adventist acquired it in mid-2019.
Hospitals charge private insurance companies a higher rate than they charge government health insurance programs, such as Medicare or Medi-Cal (California's Medicaid program), according to investigations from The New York Times and Kaiser Health News. So, the law says, hospitals can't charge more than the Medi-Cal rate for low-income, uninsured patients. Additionally, hospitals are required to inform patients they can apply for the charity care rate, including posting signs to make the information visible to the public.
Mustin was not informed about the charity care rate or offered an application (in his case, the rate would have been about $573, instead of the billed $4,409). Social justice law firms say it's a common problem.
"A huge problem for the uninsured clients we deal with is people not getting charity care," said Tashara Kuspa, an attorney at Central California Legal Services who focuses on health consumer law. "When patients call and say they can't pay a bill, instead of the hospital offering charity care, they ask, 'Well, what kind of payment can you make?' And then the bill ends up getting to collections and interest starts accruing."
Hospitals in California cut the amount they spent on charity care by half between 2013 and 2017, according to data hospitals reported to California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. The biggest drop came after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, according to a report from Kaiser Health News. The spending has continued to decline since then.
In 2018, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra declined three California hospitals' request to be freed from charity care obligations and ordered them to pay millions of dollars to local nonprofits to meet their 2016 charity care requirement. Mission Community Hospital in Los Angeles had to donate $1.7 million; Emanuel Medical Center in Turlock had to donate $1.9 million; and the University of Southern California's Verdugo Hills Hospital had to donate $1.7 million.
The hospitals argued that they should be required to spend less on charity care following the passage of the Affordable Care Act, as most people should have been insured and not in need of financial assistance as a result of the law.
But Mustin was like many others who qualified for Medi-Cal but didn't enroll in coverage. In the 2017-2018 enrollment year, an estimated 529,000 uninsured people were eligible but not enrolled in Medi-Cal, according to the California Health Interview Survey. University of California researchers estimate that 730,000 uninsured people will be eligible for Medi-Cal in 2020 but will not enroll.
Mustin didn't enroll in Medi-Cal at that time because he said he didn't plan to be unemployed long and thought he would have an employer-offered health plan soon. The Medi-Cal application is 36 pages long. Once the application is submitted to the state, the applicant must wait for the state's approval, making sure he or she qualifies for subsidized care, before accessing the benefits.
It can take 45 to 60 days to process an application. For someone who believes he won't be uninsured long, it might not seem worth the effort to apply. In this case, Mustin didn't expect to be unemployed for four months.
He didn't anticipate ending up in the emergency room twice during his employment gap either.
When the collections agency started inundating him with mail and phone calls in early 2017, he decided to take the issue into his own hands before reaching out to Central California Legal Services in Fresno. He started by sending letters to Tulare Regional Medical Center and Kings Credit Services notifying them of the charity care law.
"I believe that I should have been offered and granted financial assistance ... for the medical services that I received ... I am uninsured, and the hospital did not inform me that I could apply for financial assistance," Mustin wrote in a letter to the Kings Credit Services in July 2017.
"I was not given written notice regarding the hospital's charity care or discount payment policy," he wrote in another letter to the hospital the same month.
Soon after Mustin sent those letters, Joy Dockter, an attorney at Central California Legal Services, stepped in to help Mustin argue his case.
By early March 2018, the interim CEO of Tulare Regional Medical Center, Larry Blitz, had admitted to Dockter that Mustin's medical bills should have been waived because he wasn't offered charity care, according to court records from Tulare County Superior Court.
"I apologize (on) behalf of the (Tulare Local Health Care District) and want to assure you that our new management team and Board of Directors shall fully comply with these laws and regulations," Blitz wrote in a letter to Dockter in March 2018.
The law firm has routinely assisted with charity care lawsuits, in addition to reaching out to hospitals about their charity care practices.
"There are definitely some hospital systems that are worse than others at managing charity care," Kuspa said. "We have reached out to hospitals in the Central Valley and explained to them on a face-to-face level what the law says and what their hospital policy says and what their actual practice is, and how those things aren't lining up. We found a lot of success in doing that."

Texto completo: Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Chatsworth-based MGA Entertainment opened the doors on Thursday to its pop-up store L.O.L. Surprise!.
The company — also known for its line of Bratz dolls — is rolling out the store for a limited time to “surprise and delight fans during the holidays, making them feel like they truly stepped into the L.O.L. Surprise! world,” the company said in a statement.
Visitors are offered an immersive and photo-friendly experience, according to the company. They get to walk through seven interactive surprise installations featuring games, photo moments, fashion walks and products, including Winter Disco experience room.
It just so happens that L.O.L. Surprise! dolls — and MGA — is enjoying a bit of a boom these days, reminiscent of the rise of the Bratz line not so long ago.
As the New York Times recently put it, “L.O.L. Surprise! dolls, are pint sized, candy colored and have impossibly huge eyes, which makes them look like something out of an acid trip.” And then there’s the “stylish hairdos, as well as varying accessories, like a handbag, coffee cup or headband.”
As the holiday buying season ramped up, you could find them all the way from the shelves of Walmart to the web pages of Amazon. Or, in short, everywhere.
MGA, the toy company behind L.O.L Surprise!, just held an open house in August at its 24-acre North American headquarters in Chatsworth for local leaders and reporters to see where nearly 400 employees work — and where many will live.
Referred to as “24,” the project was touted by many, including its founder and CEO Isaac Larian, as a first-of-its-kind development in Los Angeles.
Employees have been working at the site since May. An on-site apartment complex was under construction.
MGA Entertainment Inc, which stands for Micro-Games America Entertainment, was founded in 1979.
The pop-up is at 9220 Winnetka Ave. in Chatsworth.

Virtue Signal from Goldman Sachs; Given the characters with whom Goldie has done business, lawful U.S. energy production is beyond the pale?

Texto completo: Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R., Alaska) says that he and his fellow Alaskans will have to decide "whether we want to do business" with Goldman Sachs anymore. And who can blame Alaska if it chooses to cut ties with the Wall Street megabank?
In an update to its environmental policy, Goldman says: "We will decline any financing transaction that directly supports new upstream Arctic oil exploration or development."
The financial giant is receiving applause from green groups. But in a visit to the Journal this week, Gov. Dunleavy says the decision will have real costs for Alaskans and the U.S. economy while generating unintended environmental consequences. That's because many oil-producing regions of the world have much less stringent environmental regulation than Alaska does. "You're going to push jobs and wealth and revenues" to overseas areas and "exacerbate" ecological problems, adds the governor.
The good news is that if Goldman doesn't want this business, others do. Warren Stephens is Chairman and CEO of Stephens, Inc., among the largest investment banks outside of Wall Street. Mr. Stephens tells this column via email:
We hear many institutions are not investing in traditional energy projects. We think this is short sighted on their part. The US energy business is very dynamic and will offer good returns. It is also extremely important to our country's energy independence. We would welcome the opportunity to help these projects with their capital needs just as we try to help alternative energy projects.
Within reason, Goldman should be allowed to choose with whom it does business. But given the firm's history, it's hard to understand why Alaskans engaged in lawful commerce don't make the cut.
Liz Hoffman and Aruna Viswanatha report today:
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is in talks with the U.S. government to pay a multibillion-dollar fine, admit guilt and agree to continuing oversight of its compliance procedures in order to resolve a criminal investigation into its role in a Malaysian corruption scandal.
Goldman and the Justice Department have largely agreed on a fine of just under $2 billion to settle allegations that the Wall Street firm ignored red flags while billions of dollars were looted from its client, a Malaysian government fund known as 1MDB, people familiar with the matter said.
The bank and U.S. officials have discussed a deal in which a Goldman subsidiary in Asia—not the parent company—would plead guilty to violating U.S. bribery laws, some of the people said.
In April of last year, the Journal's Julie Wernau reported :
Venezuela's cash-strapped government stopped paying its foreign debt months ago. But a unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recently received payments of tens of millions of dollars for bonds that ignited controversy last year when they were purchased at a big discount, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Venezuelan government made the payment in November, but the money had been held up by a clearing house that processes these payments over concerns that it may have been in violation of U.S. sanctions, these people said.
The purchase in May by Goldman's asset management arm sparked charges that the New York firm was providing a financial lifeline to Venezuela's embattled government. The public anger seemed to catch Goldman off guard, in part because the asset management arm hasn't usually been prone to controversy.
Perhaps someone at Goldman can explain why they were surprised that Venezuela, presided over by tyrant Nicolas Maduro, would attract controversy.
Back in 2007 Guy Chazan reported in the Journal:
MOSCOW -- In Western capitals, Vladimir Putin has an image problem. Politicians in the U.S. and Europe routinely accuse him of squelching domestic dissent, strong-arming foreign oil companies and using Russia's vast energy resources to blackmail neighbors.
One constituency, however, has a strikingly different take on the Russian president. To many investors, Mr. Putin is a hero. The reason: the Russian stock market's spectacular rally during his seven years of rule...
Foreign direct investment, though still low in proportion to the size of the country's economy, doubled last year to $30 billion. Major U.S. investment banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley have ramped up their Moscow operations, drawn there by the emergence of strong, cash-rich Russian companies looking to list overseas and buy assets abroad.
Against that backdrop, the market is ready to indulge Mr. Putin.
Goldman doesn't really have to indulge Alaskans. It could simply avoid treating them as pariahs for producing energy for a world that needs it.
This column should note that in that model of enlightenment known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Goldman is only earning about $3 or $4 million for its role in the recent initial public offering of state-owned oil giant Aramco, according to a recent report from the Journal's Ben Dummett and Julie Steinberg. But don't shed a tear for Goldman—more fees could be in its future as the dictatorship considers an international listing of the world's most profitable producer of fossil fuels.
This column is not arguing that Goldman Sachs is operating at a Clinton Foundation or Hunter Biden level of ethics when it comes to foreign business dealings. But given the international cast of characters with whom Goldie has done business—including some of the world's biggest, least free and most environmentally insensitive petro-regimes, blackballing Alaska's Arctic projects is absurd.

Life &amp; Arts -- Sightings: More Than a Monster: Boris Karloff the Actor

Texto completo: Chuck Jones's much-loved 1966 animated version of Dr. Seuss's "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" will be telecast for the umpteenth time by NBC on Christmas night. The narrator is Boris Karloff, whose speaking voice (he sounded like a kindly Edwardian uncle) will be familiar to anyone who's seen "Grinch," though he was far better known in his own day for having played the heavily made-up monster in James Whale's 1931 screen adaptation of "Frankenstein," the movie that made him a full-fledged star. Julie Harris, who later appeared opposite Karloff on Broadway and TV, called him "a great actor. . . . He had an enormous warmth and humanity, and this fascinating darker quality. It was mysterious. You wanted to know where such a man came from." But unless you've seen "Frankenstein," it's possible that you won't recognize his name -- and you certainly won't know that there was far more to him than the monsters and madmen he played on screen.
Karloff made his professional stage debut in 1910, spending a decade acting in traveling stock companies before moving to Hollywood, where he became a highly admired character actor. His early sound-film performances include striking supporting parts in two fine pre-Code movies, appearing opposite Edward G. Robinson as a drunken, unscrupulous newspaperman in Mervyn LeRoy's "Five Star Final" (1931) and playing a religious fanatic in John Ford's "The Lost Patrol" (1934).
As a result of the success of "Frankenstein," alas, he was permanently typecast, and spent the rest of his life appearing in horror films that were mostly of indifferent quality (remember "Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"?). A few of them, fortunately -- above all "The Body Snatcher" (1945) and "Bedlam" (1946), both produced by Val Lewton, and "Targets" (1968), Peter Bogdanovich's first feature film -- were more than good enough to suggest how sensitive an actor he was beneath the bogeyman makeup that he often wore on screen. He was also highly literate: Joseph Conrad was his favorite novelist, and Mr. Bogdanovich praised his "intelligence and taste that came across on a very high level."
Karloff's first real opportunity to show his stuff came when, in 1941, he returned to the stage after a long absence -- in a comedy. He made his Broadway debut in the original production of "Arsenic and Old Lace," Joseph Kesselring's now-classic black farce, which ran for 1,444 performances. In it, he created the role of Jonathan Brewster, a psychopathic mass murderer whose life is ruined when an alcoholic plastic surgeon inadvertently makes him look like -- yes -- Boris Karloff.
At first he was terrified by the thought of acting in front of live audiences after having spent so long in Hollywood. A month after the show opened, he recalled, "I got on the scales and I had lost 26 pounds -- in sheer fright." But to everyone's amazement, his own included, he turned out to have a knack for comedy, and the rave reviews that he received for "Arsenic" inspired him to continue performing in plays as a more artistically fulfilling sideline.
On top of all this, Karloff even managed to make the transition to the small screen at the dawn of network television. Fortunately for posterity, he appeared in numerous live-TV dramas, some of which were small-screen versions of the plays in which he starred on Broadway. Several of these telecasts were preserved on kinescope and can be viewed on YouTube. They include an excellent 1962 "Hallmark Hall of Fame" version of "Arsenic" in which he shares top billing with Tony Randall -- it's far better than Frank Capra's grossly overacted 1944 film version, in which he was replaced by Raymond Massey -- and an uneven but interesting 1958 "Playhouse 90" adaptation of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" in which he is startlingly vivid as Mr. Kurtz, uttering the line "Exterminate all the brutes!" with shocking conviction.
Best of all is another "Hallmark Hall of Fame" special, this one based on the original Broadway production of a play of real substance. "The Lark," telecast in 1957, was Lillian Hellman's English-language stage adaptation of "L'Alouette," Jean Anouilh's 1952 retelling of the story of Joan of Arc, who was played on both Broadway and TV by Julie Harris. Karloff, cast as the bishop who reluctantly sentenced her to death, once again received glowing reviews for his performance, which Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times praised as "paternal, sorrowful, pleading."
Years later, Harris told Scott Allen Nollen, Karloff's biographer, that working with him in "The Lark" had been "a dream. . .. He would have been great in any play." How remarkable that so heartfelt a tribute should have been paid to Boris Karloff by one of the greatest American stage actors of her generation! Yet to view the TV version of "The Lark" today, even on a faded kinescope, is to be left in no doubt of Karloff's own formidable powers as a stage performer, as well as his ability to grapple with a role of near-classical scope. Not too shabby for a movie monster.

Texto completo: After three years and more than 130 columns, the smartphone was tops. There were also some deliberate Luddites among us.
Several years ago, some colleagues and I were chatting about what was missing from tech journalism. Plenty of news media outlets had written breathlessly about hot new gadgets and apps. But what were people really doing with that tech?
That question spawned Tech We're Using, a weekly feature that documented how New York Times journalists used tech to cover a wide variety of topics, including politics, sports, wars, natural disasters, food and art.
With the decade coming to a close, we decided to also wrap up the column after interviews with more than 130 Times reporters, editors and photographers. Here were our biggest takeaways.
Indispensable Tech: Encryption Apps and Batteries
Unsurprisingly, the smartphone was the most vital work tool among journalists. Many reporters relied on smartphones for recording interviews and turned to A.I.-powered apps like Trint and Rev to automatically transcribe interviews into notes.
Most Times reporters now also rely on some form of encrypted communication, particularly messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp or the emailing service Protonmail, to keep their sources and conversations confidential.
That is a remarkable shift. Encryption technologies became popular only a few years ago, after the former government security contractor Edward Snowden revealed the extent of what the United States government was doing to surveil its own citizens.
Another indispensable tool underlined a type of tech that has not improved much: batteries. Many reporters, especially national correspondents who live out of a suitcase, desperately needed phones with longer-lasting batteries, so battery packs were a staple in their arsenal of tools.
The Most Tech-Enthused Journalists Were Not Tech Reporters
Some of the reporters who were savviest about using tech worked in politics and investigations. That is because they needed apps to pore through documents that were thousands of pages long, or software tools to inspect what was going on under the hood of a website's code. Others needed special apps to hide their identities with burner phone numbers.
Many photographers were also early adopters of new tech. One key example: drones. Those were constantly getting smaller, and their cameras were improving, which created possibilities for new types of photography, like overhead shots of houses damaged in a fire.
In contrast, many tech reporters tried to minimize the amount of tech they used. That could be, in part, a symptom of knowing too much about the companies they covered and the wide swaths of data those companies collected.
Tech Has Changed Everything
Many editors and reporters also talked about how tech had transformed the industries they cover.
In the world of dining, digital photography and platforms like Instagram have become the main method that restaurants use to communicate with patrons. Rocket launches are now live-streamed online, which let our space reporter watch from his phone instead of heading to the space station. And in the entertainment world, video streaming has opened doors to a wealth of new content -- so much that reporting on movies and TV shows has become an art of curation.
What's ahead? If tech has invaded everything, the answer is: even more transformation.

Texto completo: He traveled with the anthropologist Margaret Mead, teamed up with President Lyndon Johnson and shot for Life and Look, creating revelatory pictures.
Ken Heyman, a leading photographer who worked with Margaret Mead, shot scores of assignments for Life magazine, collaborated with President Lyndon B. Johnson and endlessly sought new, revelatory ways of seeing the world, died on Dec. 10 at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
His daughter Jennifer McCarthy confirmed his death.
Mr. Heyman first accompanied Mead, the noted cultural anthropologist, on a trip to Bali in 1957, and he took the photographs for "Family," an acclaimed 1965 collaboration in which the two examined families around the world in images and text.
"The combination," Jacob Deschin wrote in a review in The New York Times, "more integrated than is usual in word and picture associations, should make anthropology palatable for many who might never be inclined to pick up a book on the subject."
The next year he collaborated with President Johnson on "This America: A Portrait of a Nation," a book intended to illustrate Johnson's "Great Society" initiatives. Johnson wrote the text.
Those two books were among more than 40 that Mr. Heyman published, either on his own or in collaboration with writers. Some were whimsical, like a series of children's books with Ann Morris that took a global look at particular subjects ("Bread, Bread, Bread," "Hats, Hats, Hats"). Others documented the grown-up world, like "Pop Art" (1965) and "The Private World of Leonard Bernstein" (1968, with John Gruen).
"Ken Heyman seems to use his skill and the photographic process to allow other people, his subjects, to make their own pitch about themselves," an essay about him in the book "U.S. Camera '62" said. "He doesn't really take pictures of people and things (or, God forbid, grind out endless examples of his own cleverness). He photographs feelings and relationships."
He would often do so from unexpected perspectives, a technique illustrated by "Hipshot: One-Handed, Auto-Focus Photographs by a Master Photographer," a 1988 book of images shot with a cheap camera held at knee height, resting on the ground or otherwise positioned to capture an unusual perspective. Kelly Wise, in a review in The Boston Globe, called it "a book that almost hums with its own street sounds."
Kenneth Louis Heyman was born on Oct. 6, 1930, in Manhattan to David and Ruth (Stein) Heyman. He first became interested in photography in high school, and once he enrolled at Columbia College he continued to pursue that passion, taking photographs for the campus newspaper, working late in the darkroom so often that he tended to sleep through his morning classes.
"I was put on scholastic probation," he said in a 2012 video interview for the website What If It Really Works, "and during the Korean War those people were drafted."
After two years in the Army, from 1952 to 1954, he returned to Columbia.
Studying to be a social worker, he tried one of the popular classes being taught by Mead. She invited students to include photographs with their final papers, and Mr. Heyman turned the invitation into a photo essay about boys he had been working with at a settlement house in Harlem.
"I got my first A," he said, "and she called me into her office and said she wanted me to take her graduate course," even though he wasn't a graduate student. Not long after, she invited him to join her on a trip to Bali as her photographer, which he did after graduating in 1956.
Mr. Heyman had also begun going on assignments for Life magazine. In a 2014 interview with Sharpen, the online magazine of the American Society of Media Photographers, he explained how that came about.
"I was shooting a project for myself that I called 'Broadway Islands,' pictures of people around 112th Street, near Columbia," he said. "I walked into the magazine's office and showed them these images. They accepted the work and included it in their series known as 'Speaking of Pictures."'
He had essentially no formal photography training.
"The summer between my junior and senior year at Columbia I took a class at an art institute in the city," he said. "I was kicked out because they thought I wasn't serious enough. Working for Life magazine was my training ground."
He ultimately shot more than 150 assignments for the magazine, he said. Other magazines to feature his work included Time and Look.
In 1975 Mr. Heyman collaborated with Mead, who died in 1978, on a second book, "World Enough." He traveled all over the world photographing various cultures and customs, but he also photographed his share of household names, including Ernest Hemingway and Elizabeth Taylor. He especially liked to tell the story of one celebrity he met before he became famous.
In 1959 he paid a young artist $ 400 to paint a bathroom in his apartment. The resulting paint job included a tree, cherries, butterflies and two cats, one on the toilet seat. The painter was Andy Warhol.
A few years later, by then well known, Warhol was more than accommodating when Mr. Heyman asked to photograph him for the "Pop Art" book. But Mr. Heyman moved out of the apartment building without ever capturing the Warholian bathroom on film, and the building later burned down.
Mr. Heyman's marriages to Wendy Drew and Brenda Redmond ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. McCarthy, from his first marriage, he is survived by his wife, Judith Raboy, whom he married in 1998; another daughter from his first marriage, Amanda Silverman; three sons from his first marriage, Tim, Chris and Jason; two stepdaughters, Sara Raboy Hanley and Amanda Raboy Lewis; and 16 grandchildren.
Mr. Heyman frequently taught or spoke to classes, including in elementary schools. He would sometimes pose a question to schoolchildren: If you had a third eye, where would you put it? It was a question that, he thought, had a correct answer.
"Most of them said in the middle of the forehead and that sort of thing," he recounted in the 2012 video interview. "But the answer is, in the middle of the palm of your hand. Because you could look underneath things, you could look behind you."
Photograph Ken Heyman, bottom right, was sent on assignment to Peru, left, in 1965 to document adult education for the U.S. Information Agency. "The Rail Splitter," above, taken in a lumber yard in Lagos, Nigeria, in the 1960s, was one of his most famous photos.; Mr. Heyman photographed the anthropologist Margaret Mead in the village of Byun Gede, Bali, in 1954, and Anthony Quinn in Italy during filming of "The Secret of Santa Vittoria" in the late 1960s.

Texto completo: It was, all in all, a fine week for Donald Trump.
Sure, he’s getting impeached. And he is agitated about that, judging by his fandango of self-pitying tweets. And he did lose out to a 16-year-old girl for Time’s Person of the Year, which made him so jealous he couldn’t resist mocking her, amplifying just how big a loser he is.
But on a scale of one to prison, last week wasn’t a bad week. His disheveled pal, Boris Johnson, won in a landslide over an unappetizing liberal, which many took as a good harbinger for Trump in 2020.
On the Hill, the party of Faust stuck together and vociferously defended their Apollyon.
Even as Democrats declaimed that their hearings were momentous, many deemed them monotonous. The evening news broadcasts demoted impeachment to their No. 4 story and no one seemed to move a scintilla in either direction.
Trump is pretending that his pressure on Ukraine’s president was about fighting corruption when we all know that he fosters corruption. He sins in the saintliest areas. It was just announced that he had to pay $2 million to eight charities after admitting that he diverted funds from his foundation to his campaign and to cover business debts.
The left keens that the president is destroying our sacred institutions and jeopardizing our national security. But for many Americans, last week’s events prove that Trump is right to be cynical about a rigged system and deep-state elites.
The inspector general’s report about the FBI’s Russia investigation offered a hideous Dorian Gray portrait of the once-vaunted law enforcement agency. As Charlie Savage wrote in The Times, the report uncovered “a staggeringly dysfunctional and error-ridden process.” The FBI run by Comey and McCabe was sloppy, deceitful and cherry-picking — relying on nonsense spread by Christopher Steele.
With the stunning and sad “Afghanistan Papers,” The Washington Post revealed what we knew in our hearts: We have spent 18 years and a trillion dollars in Afghanistan, with generals lying and hiding evidence that the war was unwinnable, just as the generals did in Vietnam. As one general conceded, they did not understand Afghanistan and didn’t have “the foggiest notion” of what they were doing.
Then there’s “The Report,” streaming on Amazon, the heroic saga of Daniel Jones, played by Adam Driver. Jones is working for Dianne Feinstein on the Senate Intelligence Committee and spends years compiling a report documenting the CIA’s use of waterboarding and other forms of torture in secret prisons, a barbaric, un-American and ineffective system designed by two creepy psychologists who were paid about $81 million by the CIA.
If this weren’t enough institutional perfidy for one week, we had the Boeing hearing in Congress: An FAA analysis done after the first deadly crash off the coast of Indonesia showed that the agency knew that if it did not act, the Boeing 737 Max was likely to crash 15 times in the 45 years it was expected to fly, theoretically killing more than 2,900 people. But that wasn’t enough to immediately ground it. The government is supposed to protect us from the greedy capitalists, not the other way around.
Unfortunately, this climate of confusion and cynicism allows Trump to prosper. He did not come to Washington to clean up the tainted system; he came to bathe in it.

More Than a Monster: Boris Karloff the Actor; Most recognizable today for narrating Dr. Seuss's 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' and playing the monster in 'Frankenstein,' he was a skilled actor with a wide range and experience in many mediums.

Texto completo: Chuck Jones's much-loved 1966 animated version of Dr. Seuss's "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" will be telecast for the umpteenth time by NBC on Christmas night. The narrator is Boris Karloff, whose speaking voice (he sounded like a kindly Edwardian uncle) will be familiar to anyone who's seen "Grinch," though he was far better known in his own day for having played the heavily made-up monster in James Whale's 1931 screen adaptation of "Frankenstein," the movie that made him a full-fledged star. Julie Harris, who later appeared opposite Karloff on Broadway and TV, called him "a great actor....He had an enormous warmth and humanity, and this fascinating darker quality. It was mysterious. You wanted to know where such a man came from." But unless you've seen "Frankenstein," it's possible that you won't recognize his name—and you certainly won't know that there was far more to him than the monsters and madmen he played on screen.
Karloff made his professional stage debut in 1910, spending a decade acting in traveling stock companies before moving to Hollywood, where he became a highly admired character actor. His early sound-film performances include striking supporting parts in two fine pre-Code movies, appearing opposite Edward G. Robinson as a drunken, unscrupulous newspaperman in Mervyn LeRoy's "Five Star Final" (1931) and playing a religious fanatic in John Ford's "The Lost Patrol" (1934).
As a result of the success of "Frankenstein," alas, he was permanently typecast, and spent the rest of his life appearing in horror films that were mostly of indifferent quality (remember "Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"?). A few of them, fortunately—above all "The Body Snatcher" (1945) and "Bedlam" (1946), both produced by Val Lewton, and "Targets" (1968), Peter Bogdanovich's first feature film—were more than good enough to suggest how sensitive an actor he was beneath the bogeyman makeup that he often wore on screen. He was also highly literate: Joseph Conrad was his favorite novelist, and Mr. Bogdanovich praised his "intelligence and taste that came across on a very high level."
Karloff's first real opportunity to show his stuff came when, in 1941, he returned to the stage after a long absence—in a comedy. He made his Broadway debut in the original production of "Arsenic and Old Lace," Joseph Kesselring's now-classic black farce, which ran for 1,444 performances. In it, he created the role of Jonathan Brewster, a psychopathic mass murderer whose life is ruined when an alcoholic plastic surgeon inadvertently makes him look like—yes—Boris Karloff.
At first he was terrified by the thought of acting in front of live audiences after having spent so long in Hollywood. A month after the show opened, he recalled, "I got on the scales and I had lost 26 pounds—in sheer fright." But to everyone's amazement, his own included, he turned out to have a knack for comedy, and the rave reviews that he received for "Arsenic" inspired him to continue performing in plays as a more artistically fulfilling sideline.
On top of all this, Karloff even managed to make the transition to the small screen at the dawn of network television. Fortunately for posterity, he appeared in numerous live-TV dramas, some of which were small-screen versions of the plays in which he starred on Broadway. Several of these telecasts were preserved on kinescope and can be viewed on YouTube. They include an excellent 1962 "Hallmark Hall of Fame" version of "Arsenic" in which he shares top billing with Tony Randall—it's far better than Frank Capra's grossly overacted 1944 film version, in which he was replaced by Raymond Massey—and an uneven but interesting 1958 "Playhouse 90" adaptation of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" in which he is startlingly vivid as Mr. Kurtz, uttering the line "Exterminate all the brutes!" with shocking conviction.
Best of all is another "Hallmark Hall of Fame" special, this one based on the original Broadway production of a play of real substance. "The Lark," telecast in 1957, was Lillian Hellman's English-language stage adaptation of "L'Alouette," Jean Anouilh's 1952 retelling of the story of Joan of Arc, who was played on both Broadway and TV by Julie Harris. Karloff, cast as the bishop who reluctantly sentenced her to death, once again received glowing reviews for his performance, which Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times praised as "paternal, sorrowful, pleading."
Years later, Harris told Scott Allen Nollen, Karloff's biographer, that working with him in "The Lark" had been "a dream….He would have been great in any play." How remarkable that so heartfelt a tribute should have been paid to Boris Karloff by one of the greatest American stage actors of her generation! Yet to view the TV version of "The Lark" today, even on a faded kinescope, is to be left in no doubt of Karloff's own formidable powers as a stage performer, as well as his ability to grapple with a role of near-classical scope. Not too shabby for a movie monster.

Texto completo: Abortion access is facing a monumental crisis, as states across the nation continue to advance and enact restrictive abortion laws, the Trump administration puts in place reproductive health policies that ignore science, and the Supreme Court is set to decide a major case on abortion regulations next year.
Amid this treacherous landscape, two key factors will help determine the future of abortion in the United States: the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, and the outcome of ongoing efforts to make medication abortion (also called the abortion pill) easier for people to get.
So far, the Democratic presidential candidates have not engaged in a robust conversation about their views on the crucial issue of expanding access to medication abortion. But they should. And fortunately, that is starting to change.
Just last month, the Democratic presidential candidates responded to a New York Times survey about their positions on abortion, including a question about whether they would make mifepristone and misoprostol — the two pills used in medication abortion —available over the counter. Seven candidates said they supported OTC medication abortion, two were unsure and seven didn’t answer the question.
Growing crisis of abortion access
While there has been public discussion about OTC access to birth control pills, there has been little buzz about making abortion pills available without a prescription. The public response to the survey results has ranged from concern about abortion pills being sold like aspirin, to relief that this could ease the growing crisis of abortion access.
Six states have only one abortion clinic left, and some states could soon have none, depending on how the Supreme Court rules in the Louisiana case it has accepted.
I’ve been doing research related to OTC access to medication abortion for several years, both in the United States and abroad, and the reality is that this is not an immediate panacea. More studies are needed, and it is likely several years before the Food and Drug Administration will review an application to make abortion pills available without a prescription.
Even so, it’s an important step that the Democratic candidates were even asked about this policy change, which has the potential to radically transform how people access and experience abortion care.
Research increasingly indicates that people are interested in OTC access to abortion pills. In a 2017 survey we conducted of over 7,000 U. S. women ages 18-49 about their interest in obtaining abortion pills over the counter, 37% said they supported OTC access to abortion pills. They often cited advantages related to convenience and how it would facilitate access to care earlier in pregnancy. In another survey we did of abortion patients in states with limited access to the service, 80% said they supported OTC availability.
As a practicing OB-GYN, I have few concerns about the safety of making medication abortion available without a prescription or clinical evaluation. This treatment is simple and involves taking the two medications, usually 24 hours apart, which leads to cramping, bleeding and expulsion of the pregnancy.
Most of the eligibility assessment for the abortion pill involves a simple list of questions that patients themselves could easily complete. For example, we ask patients whether they have an intrauterine device in place, because it needs to be removed before using abortion pills, and we ask whether they’re taking blood thinners, which can increase bleeding.
Research shows these pills are safe
Currently, medication abortion is FDA-approved for use up through 10 weeks of pregnancy; after this point, the drug regimen changes. If abortion pills were available without a prescription, one question is whether patients could accurately self-assess their gestational age, and another is whether they might choose to use the pills beyond 10 weeks because they had limited alternatives. We are conducting a study of the accuracy of gestational age self-assessment, which will help answer at least the first question.
In many parts of the world, people already have access to abortion pills without a prescription. In most of Latin America, where abortion is largely restricted, misoprostol is often available in pharmacies without a prescription — and its expanded access has been associated with a reduction in deaths and complications from unsafe abortion.
Research from Peru and Bangladesh suggests that women can safely and effectively use abortion pills they obtain without a prescription.
Our research shows: Abortion laws are not based on facts and can even harm women
Of course, over-the-counter abortion pills are not the answer for everyone. Many patients appreciate the support they receive from clinicians and clinic staff. The future of patient-centered abortion care must include a range of options, including facility-based services.
As in other countries, there are an increasing number of reports about U. S. women accessing abortion pills without a prescription, including through online sources, which the FDA claims is illegal.
At least 21 people have been arrested or criminally investigated for allegedly attempting to self-induce their abortion or for helping someone else, and women of color have been disproportionately targeted for criminalization.
Make abortion pills easier to get now
An FDA move toward approving OTC abortion pills would help decriminalize and destigmatize self-managed abortion. But first, in order for the FDA to approve medication abortion for over-the-counter sale, a pharmaceutical company would need to perform specific research showing that women can safely and effectively use the product without medical supervision. That would take at least three to five years, assuming the studies go well and there is no political interference in the FDA approval process.
Out of step: Trump's new Title X plan requires ineffective birth control most women don't want
That timeline is too long to make a difference for people living in the South and Midwest who are facing an immediate and potentially worsening crisis of abortion access. But there are steps policymakers could take now to improve access to the abortion pill and help people obtain safe care early in pregnancy: lifting medically unnecessary regulations that prohibit doctors from prescribing the pill for dispensing at a pharmacy, lifting restrictions in almost 20 states on telemedicine (which research shows is safe and effective for medication abortion), and allowing nurse practitioners and other advanced practice clinicians to provide the abortion pill (fewer than 20 states do now, though outcomes are similar).
As more abortion patients seek out online options for self-managed care, it’s time to meet their needs with services like over-the-counter access to medication abortion. This is the future of reproductive health care, and we must continue to ask politicians, including those currently seeking the presidency, about how they plan to make it a reality.

Upward Mobility: The Democrats Could Re-Elect Trump in 2020

Texto completo: Rep. Adam Schiff, who prides himself on being one of President Trump's leading Democratic tormentors, argued last week that the president must be impeached pronto so that he doesn't "cheat in one more election." I know Democrats are eager to expand the scope of impeachable behavior, but since when do we impeach presidents based on what they might do in the future?
Mr. Schiff ought to reacquaint himself with special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony before Congress earlier this year. Mr. Mueller stated that his investigation "did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its election interference activities." But Democrats who are panicking over the prospect of Mr. Trump's winning a second term should be at least as concerned with the mainstream media's behavior as they are with Russia's.
Mr. Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016 came as a surprise to so many people because journalists consistently played down his chances of winning. Thinking Mrs. Clinton was a shoo-in, many Democrats stayed home on Election Day. Much has been written about the millions of voters who switched from supporting Barack Obama to backing Mr. Trump in important battleground states like Iowa and Wisconsin. But Democratic nonvoters, who either couldn't stomach pulling the lever for Mrs. Clinton or didn't think she needed their support to prevail -- were also a decisive factor. In Michigan, for example, Mrs. Clinton received 300,000 fewer votes than Mr. Obama did in 2012, and Mr. Trump won the state by just 11,000 votes.
The media continues to harp on Mr. Trump's unpopularity, which is news but needs context and is hardly a reason for Democrats to be complacent. Despite low unemployment, rising wages and relatively strong economic growth, the president's job-approval rating has remained in the 40s. This could be a problem for the incumbent next year, particularly if the economy goes into recession, but it's not an insurmountable obstacle. President Obama was also polling in the low to mid-40s in December 2011 and went on to be re-elected in 2012.
The press is also inadvertently helping Mr. Trump by giving the most favorable coverage to the most liberal Democratic candidates running to replace him. The president's strategy has been to paint the other party as too extreme to trust with the White House. Joe Biden has led the Democratic nomination race in national polling from the moment he announced his candidacy. But he is not the preferred candidate of the Washington media elites, as their coverage of him thus far makes clear. Progressive proposals to end private health insurance and decriminalize illegal immigration get far more and far better press coverage than Mr. Biden's alternatives. If the Democrats do go ahead and nominate a progressive who loses to Mr. Trump, the media can share the blame.
As Mr. Schiff's remark suggests, many Democrats in Congress have never accepted Mr. Trump as a legitimate president. Speaker Nancy Pelosi understood that the case for impeachment was weak, overly partisan and doomed to fail in the Senate. She moved ahead anyway to placate the progressives in her caucus who share Mr. Schiff's sentiment. And she now wants it over as soon as possible to placate more-moderate Democrats from districts Mr. Trump carried, who want to spend next year campaigning on other issues.
The irony for Democrats is that fallout from their overzealous get-Trump offensive could strengthen the president's argument for a second term. He is a disrupter, if nothing else, and after the revelations contained in the Justice Department inspector general's report, who can argue that some disruption wasn't in order? "At more than 400 pages, the study amounted to the most searching look ever at the government's secretive system for carrying out national-security surveillance on American soil," wrote Charlie Savage in the New York Times. "And what the report showed was not pretty."
What the report showed was that FBI officials deceived a court into obtaining warrants to wiretap Carter Page, a U.S. citizen and former Trump adviser, during the 2016 campaign. It also showed that a discredited "dossier" compiled at the request of Democratic operatives was "central and essential" to the FBI's warrant application, something the anti-Trump media had long disputed. In a hapless effort to demonstrate that Mr. Page was working for the Russians, the agency manipulated documents and hid information that could have exonerated him.
Democrats are playing down these findings because, however badly the FBI behaved, it was in the service of taking down Mr. Trump. But voters might see things differently, and I don't suspect that the president will stop talking about how his opponents in the government and the media have spent the past three years using lies and deception to portray him as a White House squatter.

Texto completo: One of Rudy Giuliani's pals accused of campaign finance crimes and implicated in President Trump's effort to dig up Ukrainian dirt on Joe Biden can't go back to the country due to "threats," according to his attorney.
The attorney, Joseph Bondy, slipped the claim into a Monday letter pushing back against accusations from federal prosecutors that Lev Parnas (inset) poses a flight risk and should be locked up pending trial.
"[Parnas] cannot flee to Ukraine, where he has been the subject of threats since even prior to his arrest," Bondy wrote.
The nature of the threats were not explained in Bondy's letter, but the attorney suggested in a text message that a notorious Ukrainian oligarch could be responsible.
"Remember Rudy's tweet," Bondy texted along with a link to a May 18 tweet from the ex-mayor saying billionaire oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky had "returned to Ukraine from exile in Israel and the first thing he did is threaten American citizens."
Bondy did not respond to follow-up questions.
Kolomoisky, one of Ukraine's wealthiest men, is reportedly under FBI investigation over alleged money laundering.
Giuliani unsuccessfully pressured Kolomoisky into arranging a meeting with the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, according to The New York Times.

But voters might see things differently, and I don't suspect that the president will stop talking about how his opponents in the government and the media have spent the past three years using lies and deception to portray him as a White House squatter.

Texto completo: "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" has been unveiled following the world premiere in Hollywood Monday night, with members of the media weighing in on social media, spoiler free, ahead of Wednesday's 12:01 a. m. EST review embargo.
The results were a mixed emotional bag from journalists for the J. J. Abrams-directed film which ends the Skywalker saga and opens in theaters Thursday.
USA TODAY's critic Brian Truitt noted that "Rise of Skywalker" was, "Not the best #StarWars but one with great new characters, cool twists and a fantastic group dynamic. "
"TheRiseofSkywalker definitely tries to wrap up nine movies - a LOT happens - and does so in often funny, sometimes surprising, emotional and bombastic fashion. "
There was much discussion on social media stating that 2017's Rian Johnson's "The Last Jedi" took hits from Abrams in the new movie.
"Rise of Skywalker could only have been ruder to Rian Johnson if they had motion-smoothed it," wrote the New York Times' Kyle Buchanan in a tweet that was retweeted and discussed consistently.
'I'm 92% terrified': Director J. J. Abrams unveils 'Star Wars': The Rise of Skywalker'
Germain Lussier, entertainment reporter for Gizmodo, retweeted Buchanan's "Last Jedi" note, calling it "1000% true. "
Lussier added of the movie, "I loved parts, I didn’t love others, and I’m leaving the theater very, very conflicted about it. "
Mike Ryan of Uproxx called it "the most convoluted Star Wars. "
"There is a lot I liked, but the first half gets so bogged down with exposition and new plot and doodads and beacons and transmitters, it feels like it should have been three movies on its own," he wrote. "The whole first half felt like all exposition. It does get better. "
Cinemablend editor Eric Eisenberg wrote that, "There is good in 'Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker. ' But there is more that is disappointing. "
"I'm bummed," he added.
Terri Schwarz of entertainment site IGN tweeted that she is "still processing" adding that "a couple things I didn’t like sour the movie for me. "
Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair summed up his tweet of the movie with, "I absolutely loved it. "
Erik Davis, managing editor of the ticket site Fandango. com, called the film, "Epic. All of it. "
"#TheRiseofSkywalker is a terrific finale that is just stuffed with so much of everything," he wrote. "I spent the entire second half with tears in my eyes - a wonderful way to end the Skywalker story. "

Texto completo: Within the next few weeks, every member of the House and Senate will make a public declaration of their judgment of President Donald Trump's misdeeds. While each has their own beliefs and their own incentives, the politics of impeachment are much simpler than you might think.
There are no double bank shots to be played, no mass public conversions that can be engineered and no clever stratagem that will transform the outcome of this process. Which ought to be liberating, at least for most members of Congress.
Let's start with the state of overall opinion. Before the impeachment inquiry began, Democrats hoped it would turn the public more against Trump than they already were, and Republicans hoped there would be a backlash from their own voters. What we saw instead was something simple. As FiveThirtyEight's tracking shows, before the Ukraine scandal broke, around 38-40% of Americans thought Trump should be impeached, and around 50-53% thought he shouldn't.
But since the scandal broke, around 48% think he should be impeached and around 43-45% say he shouldn't. Any given poll may produce a slightly different result, but that's the general pattern.
If you're a member of Congress, the national picture doesn't matter nearly as much as what your own constituents think. But whether you're in a swing district or one that votes overwhelmingly for your party, your calculation is essentially the same: If you go against what your party believes, you're basically doomed in the next election.
Which you can see in the strange case of Rep. Jeff Van Drew, D-N.J., the exception that proves the rule. Van Drew opposes impeachment, which is apparently a belief he holds sincerely and strongly enough to sacrifice his political career over it. Though Van Drew was elected last year to represent a district Trump won narrowly in 2016, the New York Times reported that he recently saw a poll showing that "the overwhelming majority of Democratic primary voters - 71% - would be less likely to support his re-election if he opposed the charges against Mr. Trump."
Voting against impeachment would have gotten Van Drew a primary challenge that he'd likely lose. So he took another path: He'll be switching parties, and come next year, he'll be challenged in the primary by a genuine Republican and probably lose.
Contrast that with Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., who also represents a district Trump won in 2016. Rather than try to save herself with some complicated switcheroo in a vain attempt to win over Republicans in her district, Slotkin decided to vote yes on the two articles of impeachment and is now explaining to her constituents why she made that decision.
These Democrats likely understand that swing districts aren't made up of moderate voters, they're made up of roughly equal numbers of partisan Republicans and partisan Democrats. Whichever party you're in, voting for the other side won't get you much credit with them, but it will destroy your support among your own partisans.
Which means that the best thing for Democrats in swing districts (and states) isn't finding some kind of middle way. It's making sure that Trump is as discredited and damaged as possible.
We can't be sure about how this will affect next year's presidential election, since no president has run after being impeached. But in all likelihood it will follow the simple pattern we're seeing so far. Democratic and Republican voters are both energized by it, which will contribute to an election likely to have extremely high turnout.
So where does that leave us? Impeachment was always the right thing to do substantively, because Trump's misconduct was so clear and egregious. And it's the right thing to do politically, because it builds up the case about Trump's corruption even if it doesn't result in his removal. Everything else is details.

The '1619 Project' Gets Schooled

Texto completo: 'So wrong in so many ways" is how Gordon Wood, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of the American Revolution, characterized the New York Times's "1619 Project." James McPherson, dean of Civil War historians and another Pulitzer winner, said the Times presented an "unbalanced, one-sided account" that "left most of the history out." Even more surprising than the criticism from these generally liberal historians was where the interviews appeared: on the World Socialist Web Site, run by the Trotskyist Socialist Equality Party.
The "1619 Project" was launched in August with a 100-page spread in the Times's Sunday magazine. It intends to "reframe the country's history" by crossing out 1776 as America's founding date and substituting 1619, the year 20 or so African slaves were brought to Jamestown, Va. The project has been celebrated up and down the liberal establishment, praised by Sen. Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
A September essay for the World Socialist Web Site called the project a "racialist falsification" of history. That didn't get much attention, but in November the interviews with the historians went viral. "I wish my books would have this kind of reaction," Mr. Wood says in an email. "It still strikes me as amazing why the NY Times would put its authority behind a project that has such weak scholarly support." He adds that fellow historians have privately expressed their agreement. Mr. McPherson coolly describes the project's "implicit position that there have never been any good white people, thereby ignoring white radicals and even liberals who have supported racial equality."
The project's creator, Nikole Hannah-Jones, is proud that it "decenters whiteness" and disdains its critics as "old, white male historians." She tweeted of Mr. McPherson: "Who considers him preeminent? I don't." Her own qualifications are an undergraduate degree in history and African-American studies and a master's in journalism. She says the project goes beyond Mr. McPherson's expertise, the Civil War. "For the most part," she writes in its lead essay, "black Americans fought back alone" against racism. No wonder she'd rather not talk about the Civil War.
To the Trotskyists, Ms. Hannah-Jones writes: "You all have truly revealed yourselves for the anti-black folks you really are." She calls them "white men claiming to be socialists." Perhaps they're guilty of being white men, but they're definitely socialists. Their faction, called the Workers League until 1995, was "one of the most strident and rigid Marxist groups in America" during the Cold War, says Harvey Klehr, a leading historian of American communism.
"Ours is not a patriotic, flag-waving kind of perspective," says Thomas Mackaman, the World Socialist Web Site's interviewer and a history professor at King's College in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. He simply recognizes that the arrival of 20 slaves in 1619 wasn't a "world-altering event." Slavery had existed across the world for millennia, and there were already slaves elsewhere in what would become the U.S. before 1619.
But "even if you want to make slavery the central story of American history," he says, the Times gets it backward. The American Revolution didn't found a "slavocracy," as Ms. Hannah-Jones puts it. Instead, in Mr. Mackaman's telling, it "brought slavery in for questioning in a way that had never been done before" by "raising universal human equality as a fundamental principle." Nor was protecting slavery "one of the primary reasons" the colonists declared independence, as Ms. Hannah-Jones claims. It's no coincidence the abolitionists rapidly won votes to end slavery in five of the original 13 states, along with Vermont and the new states of the Midwest.
Ms. Hannah-Jones insists "anti-black racism runs in the very DNA of this country." Mr. Mackaman calls that claim "anti-historical." Proving it requires her to belittle the most progressive declaration of modern history: "that all men are created equal." Ms. Hannah-Jones calls this a "lie" and claims its drafters didn't even believe it. The abolitionists disagreed. So did Martin Luther King Jr: He saw it as a "promissory note."
Mr. Mackaman also protests Ms. Hannah-Jones's "cherry-picking" of quotes to present Lincoln as a "garden-variety racist." He attributes the misleading picture to her "totally racialist interpretation." If whites and blacks are supposed to be "diametrically opposed to each other," he says, "then you have to disregard all the history that runs contrary to that -- and there's an awful lot."
Other "1619 Project" essays are similarly tendentious. Sociologist Matthew Desmond marshals substantially discredited research to tar the whole of American capitalism as a legacy of slavery. Legal activist Bryan Stevenson presents the war on drugs and broken-windows policing as successors to lynching, the Black Codes and other white "strategies of racial control." Times columnist Jamelle Bouie claims Republican opposition to raising the debt ceiling in 2011 was of a piece with Southern defenses of slavery and Jim Crow.
Joseph Kishore, the Socialist Equality Party's national secretary, says the "1619 Project" is aimed at legitimizing the politics of the Democratic Party and at "dividing workers" by race. "The interests of a black worker on the line in an auto plant and a white worker," he says, "are fundamentally the same, and a million miles from the interests of an Oprah Winfrey or a Hillary Clinton." He rejects the "pseudo-left politics" of identity, which "fight out conflicts within the top 10% or so over access to positions of power and privilege" through diversity programs, then "denounce white workers for being supposedly privileged even as they suffer from a decline in life expectancy and horrific social conditions." Nobody is better at deflating the pretensions of progressives than the Left Opposition.
To be sure, the Trotskyists have wild ideas of their own: The World Socialist Web Site's September essay claims "the event that had the greatest impact on the social condition of African-Americans" was the Russian Revolution. But the Times's equally extreme ideas are being feted by the intelligentsia and turned into lesson plans for schoolteachers. "A re-education is necessary," the "1619 Project" webpage warns. Even communists now tell the Times to cool it.

Texto completo: AKRON — With holiday packages arriving by mail and delivery services, the Better Business Bureau of Akron has issued a good warning — be careful of porch pirates who steal packages.
According to a survey commissioned by Comcast and conducted by Wakefield Research, nearly one in four people report being a victim of package theft and nearly half know someone who has had a package stolen.
The data is even higher among millennials, the BBB reports, with one in three having had a package stolen and nearly 60 percent knowing someone who has been a victim.
Here are some tips:
• Have packages delivered to work or a family member who is normally home.
• Communicate with delivery drivers to place packages out of sight.
• Install a smart doorbell to monitor activity.
• Request a signature for delivery.
• Consider security cameras.
• Request to pick up your packages in person or at a locker if the retailer offers this option.
• Network with neighbors to watch out for packages.
What if you suspect your package was stolen?
Be sure to conduct a thorough search. Consumers have reported that Amazon Prime deliveries are often found on their back porch. Amazon sometimes takes pictures after a delivery. The website says: “Capturing delivery photos is intended to help customers see that their package was safely delivered and where. The photo will focus on the placement of the package.”
If your package is missing, communicate with your seller and carrier. Try having your package tracked from the start.
Local police departments recommend filing a police report as well. Without a witness or video, it could prove difficult for the police to investigate, but if there are several reports from your neighborhood, police may begin targeted patrols to watch out for thieves in your area.
Who is Jenny B?
Speaking of packages or mail, a pink greeting card envelope hand-addressed to Erin Armschlinger arrived in the mail about a month ago.
The return label looked like it was smudged and had fallen off.
“Since it looked hand-written, I thought maybe it’s somebody I know,” Armschlinger said.
It was a greeting card that had a cartoon picture of an avocado on it and the words “Holy Guacamole! You’re going to avo baby!”
“That’s news to me because I’m definitely not pregnant and have not been pregnant,” said Armschlinger, 27, who ironically designs cards for a greeting-card company.
She opened the card and saw a message that said something like “I hope you like these,” signed with a heart and just “Jenny B.”
“Originally I thought it was addressed to the wrong person.”
Inside the card were a couple of gift cards for such things as a pregnancy pillow, clothing and baby items. They totaled about $245.
“I was trying to run through my head ‘Do I even know a Jenny B?’ I know a Jenny who has similar handwriting, but I was kind of skeptical,” she said.
“I started Googling the name online.”
She found a thread of discussions with pictures of the same card and gift cards.
Armschlinger is one of many women nationwide who have reported the questionable marketing tactic to area BBBs. Armschlinger, who lives near Cleveland, reported her strange card to the BBB of Akron since a friend works there.
“This type of marketing is very misleading,” said Christy Page, president of the BBB of Akron.
The cards are coming from a Utah-based company called Mother’s Lounge.
The BBB locally has fielded calls about the marketing ploy and the BBB in Utah near the company has more than 70 complaints and reports in BBB ScamTracker. There also have been dozens of negative customer reviews on bbb.org from all across the United States. The company has not responded to any BBB complaints since 2018.
If you receive a similar mailing, read the fine print on both the gift card and their website. Many buyers found additional fees and inflated shipping costs were unexpectedly added to their purchase that they expected to be covered by the “gift card.” Additionally, many consumers reported the products they received were of poor quality and overpriced.
It is unclear if the cards from Jenny B are a scam or just a bad — and potentially insensitive —marketing ploy. Media outlets around the country have tried to reach out to Mother’s Lounge without response. The company did not respond to the Beacon Journal’s request for comment.
A New York Times story about the Jenny B mail included a statement from Scott Anderson, the director of marketing at Mothers Lounge, who called the outreach “heartfelt.”
“The qualified recipients for this mailer have, at one point, subscribed to an opt-in list for maternity deals and coupons through a third party marketing company,” Anderson told the New York Times. “All information from third party companies is only used internally for Mother’s Lounge and is not sold or used for anything else other than the direct marketing of Mother’s Lounge.”
Armschlinger said there’s no reason she ever would have signed up for a pregnancy-related list.
She also doesn’t understand how the company makes money by sending such targeted mailers to consumers who won’t necessarily use it.
“I think it’s just a really misguided marketing tactic,” she said. “It’s also alarming because it’s so invasive. You think somebody you know wrote this letter and it’s going directly to you at your home.
“I consider it pretty shady means. What if somebody had gotten this who had previously miscarried or maybe their daughter isn’t alive. What kind of negative emotions are you going to put this person through just because you’re trying to sell a product?”
Armschlinger threw out the card.
“No matter what Jenny B says, I have no plans to have a baby — at least currently,” she said.

THE BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO MAKE PART OF THE TRUMP TAX CUTS PERMANENT TO ADDRESS BIG MEDICAL BILLS: The deadline for Congress to pass its budget and avoid a shutdown is only five days away, and amid talks over drug pricing and surprise billing, there’s another healthcare cost issue that has gotten less attention: The fact that fewer people are set to qualify next year for the medical expense deduction.
As it stands now, about 4.4 million people use the deduction to recoup all kinds of expenses related to their health, whether it be premiums, doctor visits, equipment, or even dental care.
Because of the Republican tax overhaul, for the past two years people have been allowed to deduct their medical expenses if they add up to more than 7.5% of their income, but that threshold is set to expire and jump to 10% during the next tax season unless Congress enacts a change as part of its spending bill due Dec. 20.
Seniors in particular face major medical costs and use the deduction, even though they get coverage from Medicare. According to AARP, 39% of people who took the deduction are over the age of 65. People who have diabetes, cancer, or a disability also are disproportionately hit by high out-of-pocket medical expenses.
Susan Collins, who chairs the aging committee, is among the senators pushing for making the tax break permanent. Back when the bill was being debated, increasing the deduction was one of the ways that Republican leaders were able to get her support.
If Congress reaches an impasse on surprise billing, then making the medical deduction sit permanently at 7.5% could help them demonstrate they are committed to reducing costs for patients.
It’s very possible the Medical Expense Savings Act, which would make the tax break permanent, will be added to the spending bill, but a senior GOP aide told the Washington Examiner that there’s no word yet one way or another. Even though the GOP tax overhaul was partisan, it seems that at least a couple of Democrats think this part of the bill is worth preserving.
Democrats Maria Cantwell of Washington and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona recently joined with Republicans Martha McSally of Arizona and Collins in asking Senate leaders to extend the deduction by passing the bill they all co-sponsored. As the spending bill comes together, we’ve got our eye on this particular measure.

OBAMACARE TAXES GETTING THE AXE IN SPENDING DEAL: Negotiations are still underway, but a senior Democratic congressional aide confirmed that the House spending deal would repeal the Cadillac tax, the health insurance tax, and the medical device tax.
The deal also includes: A prohibition on tobacco sales to anyone under age 21, and passage of the CREATES Act, which goes after a practice brand-name drugmakers use to block generic companies from making cheaper copies.
But there’s another piece Republicans might not like. Democrats want to block potential regulatory actions by the Trump administration that would block people from being able to automatically re-enroll in plans, and that would block insurers from “silver loading,” which charges the government more for premiums to make them cheaper for enrollees. There’s no word whether the Trump administration will be moving forward on those ideas, but they would make health insurance more expensive for people who get subsidies under Obamacare.
HEALTHCARE.GOV FACES PROBLEMS IN ITS LAST DAY: The website typically faces a huge surge of visits because people tend to hold off on signing up, and that left customers facing a slew of technical glitches. Get America Covered, the group run by former Obama administration officials, urged the Trump administration to extend the deadline by two days, but it did come to a close.
As in past years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said anyone who provided their information by 3 a.m. Monday to a call center or through the website could still get coverage.
Obama tweeted about open enrollment again. Former President Barack Obama released a gif of himself using a zen garden on Twitter and urged people to sign up for plans that can cost as little as $10 a month. The irony is that one of the reasons more plans cost so little was because President Trump ended direct payments for cost-sharing reduction subsidies, a move Democrats widely decried as “sabotage” but that led insurers to stack their plans differently so they can charge the government more and customers less.
NEW BIPARTISAN BILL TELLS VAPING COMPANIES TO CLEAN UP THE MESS THEY MADE: Illinois Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi introduced a bill to fund a nationwide anti-vaping campaign, and he wants vaping manufacturers to pay for it. Krishnamoorthi’s bill, introduced with GOP congressman Peter King, requires vaping companies pay a quarterly fee to the government, as tobacco companies already do, to collect $200 million per year to be directed to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. States would then apply for CDC funding to create their own anti-vaping initiatives.
FEDERAL COURT REAFFIRMS DECISION TO BLOCK MISSISSIPPI ABORTION BAN: The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a 2018 decision to block Mississippi’s 15-week ban on abortions, allowing the state’s sole abortion provider, Jackson Women’s Health Organization, to stay open at least for now.
Friday’s decision is a dress rehearsal for 2020 abortion ban litigation: The court’s decision to strike down the law Friday is the latest in a series of suits arguing against state abortion restrictions, and the wave of suits will continue in 2020. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in March 2020 about a Louisiana abortion restriction in the case June Medical Services v. Gee, the first case SCOTUS will hear on abortion since the confirmations of justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. The law mirrors one in Texas that required abortion providers to have hospital admitting priviliges, which the court invalidated 5-3 in 2016.
REPUBLICANS SAY THEIR DRUG PRICING BILL WILL SAVE LIVES, UNLIKE PELOSI’S: GOP healthcare providers-turned-lawmakers wrote in the Washington Examiner that Nancy Pelosi’s Lower Drug Costs Now Act, which the House passed 230-192 last week, would stifle innovation, while their bill would lower prices without harming the creation of new life-saving drugs. “We need to make sure the next miracle drug sitting in the approval pipeline that could cure childhood cancers, as well as metastatic breast, lung, skin, prostate, or pancreatic cancers, are more quickly available for your loved ones. Lives literally depend on it,” wrote the Republicans, including Buddy Carter of Georgia and John Joyce of Pennsylvania.

The '1619 Project' Gets Schooled; The New York Times tries to rewrite U.S. history, but its falsehoods are exposed by surprising sources.

Texto completo: 'So wrong in so many ways" is how Gordon Wood, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of the American Revolution, characterized the New York Times's "1619 Project." James McPherson, dean of Civil War historians and another Pulitzer winner, said the Times presented an "unbalanced, one-sided account" that "left most of the history out." Even more surprising than the criticism from these generally liberal historians was where the interviews appeared: on the World Socialist Web Site, run by the Trotskyist Socialist Equality Party.
The "1619 Project" was launched in August with a 100-page spread in the Times's Sunday magazine. It intends to "reframe the country's history" by crossing out 1776 as America's founding date and substituting 1619, the year 20 or so African slaves were brought to Jamestown, Va. The project has been celebrated up and down the liberal establishment, praised by Sen. Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
A September essay for the World Socialist Web Site called the project a "racialist falsification" of history. That didn't get much attention, but in November the interviews with the historians went viral. "I wish my books would have this kind of reaction," Mr. Wood says in an email. "It still strikes me as amazing why the NY Times would put its authority behind a project that has such weak scholarly support." He adds that fellow historians have privately expressed their agreement. Mr. McPherson coolly describes the project's "implicit position that there have never been any good white people, thereby ignoring white radicals and even liberals who have supported racial equality."
The project's creator, Nikole Hannah-Jones, is proud that it "decenters whiteness" and disdains its critics as "old, white male historians." She tweeted of Mr. McPherson: "Who considers him preeminent? I don't." Her own qualifications are an undergraduate degree in history and African-American studies and a master's in journalism. She says the project goes beyond Mr. McPherson's expertise, the Civil War. "For the most part," she writes in its lead essay, "black Americans fought back alone" against racism. No wonder she'd rather not talk about the Civil War.
To the Trotskyists, Ms. Hannah-Jones writes: "You all have truly revealed yourselves for the anti-black folks you really are." She calls them "white men claiming to be socialists." Perhaps they're guilty of being white men, but they're definitely socialists. Their faction, called the Workers League until 1995, was "one of the most strident and rigid Marxist groups in America" during the Cold War, says Harvey Klehr, a leading historian of American communism.
"Ours is not a patriotic, flag-waving kind of perspective," says Thomas Mackaman, the World Socialist Web Site's interviewer and a history professor at King's College in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. He simply recognizes that the arrival of 20 slaves in 1619 wasn't a "world-altering event." Slavery had existed across the world for millennia, and there were already slaves elsewhere in what would become the U.S. before 1619.
But "even if you want to make slavery the central story of American history," he says, the Times gets it backward. The American Revolution didn't found a "slavocracy," as Ms. Hannah-Jones puts it. Instead, in Mr. Mackaman's telling, it "brought slavery in for questioning in a way that had never been done before" by "raising universal human equality as a fundamental principle." Nor was protecting slavery "one of the primary reasons" the colonists declared independence, as Ms. Hannah-Jones claims. It's no coincidence the abolitionists rapidly won votes to end slavery in five of the original 13 states, along with Vermont and the new states of the Midwest.
Ms. Hannah-Jones insists "anti-black racism runs in the very DNA of this country." Mr. Mackaman calls that claim "anti-historical." Proving it requires her to belittle the most progressive declaration of modern history: "that all men are created equal." Ms. Hannah-Jones calls this a "lie" and claims its drafters didn't even believe it. The abolitionists disagreed. So did Martin Luther King Jr: He saw it as a "promissory note."
Mr. Mackaman also protests Ms. Hannah-Jones's "cherry-picking" of quotes to present Lincoln as a "garden-variety racist." He attributes the misleading picture to her "totally racialist interpretation." If whites and blacks are supposed to be "diametrically opposed to each other," he says, "then you have to disregard all the history that runs contrary to that—and there's an awful lot."
Other "1619 Project" essays are similarly tendentious. Sociologist Matthew Desmond marshals substantially discredited research to tar the whole of American capitalism as a legacy of slavery. Legal activist Bryan Stevenson presents the war on drugs and broken-windows policing as successors to lynching, the Black Codes and other white "strategies of racial control." Times columnist Jamelle Bouie claims Republican opposition to raising the debt ceiling in 2011 was of a piece with Southern defenses of slavery and Jim Crow.
Joseph Kishore, the Socialist Equality Party's national secretary, says the "1619 Project" is aimed at legitimizing the politics of the Democratic Party and at "dividing workers" by race. "The interests of a black worker on the line in an auto plant and a white worker," he says, "are fundamentally the same, and a million miles from the interests of an Oprah Winfrey or a Hillary Clinton." He rejects the "pseudo-left politics" of identity, which "fight out conflicts within the top 10% or so over access to positions of power and privilege" through diversity programs, then "denounce white workers for being supposedly privileged even as they suffer from a decline in life expectancy and horrific social conditions." Nobody is better at deflating the pretensions of progressives than the Left Opposition.
To be sure, the Trotskyists have wild ideas of their own: The World Socialist Web Site's September essay claims "the event that had the greatest impact on the social condition of African-Americans" was the Russian Revolution. But the Times's equally extreme ideas are being feted by the intelligentsia and turned into lesson plans for schoolteachers. "A re-education is necessary," the "1619 Project" webpage warns. Even communists now tell the Times to cool it.

We're here, we're queer and we watch the Hallmark Channel's corny Christmas movies, too

Resumen: I'm a sucker for those sappy, unrealistic, woefully undiverse Hallmark Channel Christmas movies. Thankfully, queer couples finally make an appearance.

Texto completo: “Mistakes are a fact of life. It is the response to error that counts,” wrote poet Nikki Giovanni. She might as well have been writing about the recent mess at the Hallmark Channel, which in the past two months zigzagged from promises to be more inclusive of LGBTQ families on its TV channel (there are none currently), to yanking four commercials featuring two brides (calling them “controversial”), to completely reversing course this weekend and apologizing to Zola, the wedding planner company that had produced the ads. The president and CEO of Hallmark Cards, Inc. , said the earlier action to ban the ads featuring lesbian brides “was the wrong decision. ”
Good for Hallmark. And good for viewers.
I confess: One of my guilty pleasures is watching the Hallmark Channel’s Christmas movies, especially the royal fantasia “Crown for Christmas. ” Schmaltzy? Check. Unrealistic? Of course. Inclusive? Hardly. The lack of representation of queer people has been only one part of the Hallmark Channel’s failed diversity efforts, which unfailingly presents “white Christmas” storylines, which is to say very few African Americans or other people of color in starring roles.
A white, straight Christmas
As an example, take the two-dozen holiday movies that Hallmark is debuting this month as part of its annual "Countdown to Christmas. " “None center on a same-sex couple or feature LGBTQ characters,” reported LGBTQ news website The Advocate. Fortunately, that failure to represent queer couples and families appeared to be coming to an end when the CEO of Crown Media Family Networks, the Hallmark Channel’s parent company, told The Hollywood Reporter in November they are "open" to any type of movie, including with gay leading characters.
It was a blessing to honor God at work: Chick-fil-A once inspired me to live out my faith in the workplace. Those days are gone.
After all, it’s nearly 2020. There are more than half a million same-sex married couples in the United States, now that gay marriage is legal in every state in the union.
Not coincidentally, before the Zola ads were pulled, the advocacy group One Million Moms, which is a part of the religiously conservative American Family Association and defines part of its mission as the “fight against indecency,” hosted a petition on its site that urged Hallmark to “reconsider airing commercials with same-sex couples, and please do not add LGBT movies to the Hallmark Channel. Such content goes against Christian and conservative values that are important to your primary audience. You will lose viewers if you cave to the LGBT agenda. ”
(As of Monday, the petition had only 30,000 names, while One Million Moms has just about 97,500 “likes” on Facebook. )
Wait, wait — there’s a gay agenda lurking within wedding planning ads? The only agenda I could find was a commercial one: The brides’ guests would have arrived on time and purchased them nicer gifts if they’d used Zola, which brands itself as “the home of all things wedding. ”
A Hallmark Channel spokesman told the New York Times that the brides’ “public displays of affection”— a typical lips-together smooch — were in violation of its policies. Well, that PDA policy wasn’t uniformly applied, since the channel had approved two Zola commercials and, in one of them, the heterosexual couple kissed, too.
A kiss is a kiss is a kiss
As I wrote in my book about LGBTQ etiquette: The acceptability of public displays of affection is about location, not sexual orientation. In other words, where you are (a club versus a church, the movies or the family dining room) and not who you are (a same-sex or opposite-sex couple).
To paraphrase Gertrude Stein: A kiss is a kiss is a kiss.
Do LGBTQ people still need to make the argument that we are families, too? That we are part of the fabric of American life, even as the Trump administration erases equal protections for members of our community? A Zola spokesman nailed it when he said, “All kisses, couples and marriages are equal celebrations of love. ”
Discrimination is far from dead: Obergefell: Supreme Court, lawmakers have more to do to prevent anti-LGBTQ discrimination
Zola was joined by an outpouring of support from the LGBTQ community and celebrities, with the Twitter hashtags #BoycottHallmark trending at one point over the weekend. Ellen DeGeneres and Sandra Bernhard, who played an openly bisexual character on “Roseann,” also weighed in with Bernhard tweeting: "All the groovy gay ladies i know won't be watching your Christmas schlock. "
On “Saturday Night Live” the Hallmark decision was mocked, and Netflix U. S. , a Hallmark competitor, tweeted images from a TV show and film labeled "Titles Featuring Lesbians Joyfully Existing And Also It's Christmas Can We Just Let People Love Who They Love. "
Finally, on Sunday, Hallmark Cards, Inc. , did the right thing, with its president and CEO saying the network would reinstate the Zola ads and stand up for diversity: “Our mission is rooted in helping all people connect, celebrate traditions and be inspired to capture meaningful moments in their lives. Anything that distracts from this purpose is not who we are. We are truly sorry for the hurt and disappointment this has caused. ”
Thank you, Hallmark.
Meanwhile, the One Million Moms website lists a number of active campaigns critical of the supposed "LGBTQ agenda. " Sure, you can try to erase us everywhere. But don’t forget: We are here. We get married. And for now we’ll watch sappy Christmas movies on Netflix and, yes, Hallmark.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The U.S. quietly expelled two Chinese Embassy officials on suspicions of espionage after they improperly drove onto a sensitive U.S. military facility in Virginia in September, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said.
The incident highlights what U.S. officials have said is Beijing's increasingly aggressive intelligence-gathering operations against the U.S., which have heightened tensions between the two economic superpowers even as they try to reach accord on trade and other issues.
The expulsion of the officials, whose names couldn't be learned, took place as President Trump was trying to reach a broad trade agreement with China, and while he was under pressure to take a more forceful stance backing student protesters in Hong Kong.
The U.S. hasn't publicly acknowledged the incident, which was earlier reported by the New York Times. It is believed to be the first time the U.S. has expelled Chinese diplomats for suspected espionage in more than 30 years.
China issued a denial Monday. "The relevant U.S. allegations are totally false...We urge the U.S. to correct its wrongdoing, cancel its decision and protect the Chinese diplomats' interests and rights under the Vienna Convention diplomatic relations," China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a press conference.
The incident in September occurred at a sensitive installation in the Norfolk, Va., area, those familiar with the episode said. The two officials from the Chinese Embassy in Washington tried to gain access to the base but were turned away, one U.S. official said. Nonetheless, they drove about a mile onto the base before they were stopped and detained, U.S. officials said.
The Times reported that the group, which included the officials' wives, attempted to evade military personnel who pursued them and stopped only after firetrucks blocked their way. The Chinese officials then claimed they hadn't understood the guards' English instructions.
It isn't clear which U.S. military installation was breached. The Norfolk area has numerous military sites, including several that house Special Operations forces, including Navy SEALs.
The activity by the Chinese officials seems an unlikely way to gather secret intelligence. Rather, it may have been a way to test the base's security, or to send a psychological signal to the Americans that Beijing intends to become more aggressive in its espionage.
The Chinese Embassy didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is responsible for tracking foreign diplomats and stopping foreign espionage inside the U.S., declined to comment. The State Department declined to comment.
"We take the security of all our installations very seriously. We don't have any information to provide about the alleged incident," a Pentagon spokesman said. "We refer you to the Department of State for questions about Chinese diplomats."
Washington and Beijing are trying to compete and cooperate simultaneously in different arenas. The U.S. and China last week agreed to a so-called phase-one trade deal after months of tense negotiations.
The State Department in October imposed new restrictions on Chinese diplomats in the U.S., requiring that they notify the department before any meetings they have with state and local officials, or with educational and research institutions.
The new measures were primarily a response to even more stringent controls that China had placed on U.S. diplomats. But, one of the officials said, the incident in the Norfolk area was one factor that American policy makers discussed before imposing the new restrictions.

Texto completo: DEDHAM — The Maritana neared Boston Harbor after its long journey from Liverpool, laden with a cargo of coal, wool, iron, steel, and more than two dozen passengers and crew. It was after midnight on Nov. 3, 1861, and Captain G.W. Williams was in command. The weather was thick and the tide was high as they entered the bay. The ship had been navigating through a disastrous gale. From on board, a man on the lookout spotted Boston Light, a sign of welcome and voyage's end.
But as soon as the light came into view, so, too, did the froth of waves lashing rocks.
All hands were on deck. Orders came from Williams to tack ship. Before the vessel could change course, it crashed onto the jagged rocks about a mile from the lighthouse.
For hours, the Maritana was pummeled by the unforgiving sea. The waves churned up by the storm delivered incessant jabs amidships. Eventually, the sturdy wooden vessel could no longer endure, according to books about the shipwreck and several varying newspaper accounts from the time.
A gap opened beneath Williams's feet, as the ship split in half. “Look out for yourselves!" he shouted.
* * *
The demise of the Maritana has been called one of the region's “most violent shipwrecks," an event that reportedly claimed the lives of 13 passengers and 11 crew members. But the area's towering monument to the tragedy was erected some 16 miles inland, near the back of a historic burial ground in Dedham.
“What is it doing there?" reader Brian Keaney wondered. The town's Old Village Cemetery, where the marker bearing Williams's name is found, doesn't offer sweeping views of the Atlantic or the harbor islands.
Our journey to connect the dots between a suburban town and a deadly shipwreck meant navigating through folklore about a cursed artifact and wading into New England's maritime history.
First, the Maritana.
It was “a fine vessel," reported The Boston Pilot, six days after the storm, “991 tons, built at Quincy, Mass., and owned in Providence."
Every great ship needs a figurehead, the decoration placed at its bow, and the Maritana was no exception. When it was built in 1857, the ship's owner, Suchet Mauran II, took interest in a carving of a woman, maritime historian and Massachusetts native Edward Rowe Snow wrote in his book, “Storms and Shipwrecks of New England."
While noted for its beauty, the figurehead had a checkered past. The carving had been salvaged first from a commandeered French warship, and then, later, a ship built in Maine that wrecked off New England.
But the figurehead's time on the Maritana was largely uneventful, Snow said — until the ship set sail from Liverpool in September 1861.
* * *
In the early morning hours of Nov. 3, the ship — stocked with goods and passengers — finally approached Boston Harbor.
Around 12:45 a.m., the journey unraveled, however, when breakers were spotted around the same time as the lighthouse.
“Captain Williams ordered the helm hard up," one newspaper wrote, “and a minute later the ship struck, head on," at Egg Rock, also known as Shag Rocks.
The sea broke constantly over the vessel, “which lifted and hung among the rocks amidships."
The masts were cut away at 3 a.m., reports said. Boats on the davits were “crushed to atoms," The Boston Pilot recalled. The crew's attempts to reach safety were futile.
“The ship, being a very strong one, held together until morning," The Boston Pilot wrote.
Around 8 a.m., it finally began to break in two.
“At the moment the vessel parted, Capt. Williams was standing on the quarterdeck," the Transcript reported. “He went down between the broken fragments, which closing suddenly caught the Captain by the head and crushed it in a frightful manner."
* * *
In all, about two dozen people died. Some were lost to the ocean, while the bodies of others, including Williams, washed ashore.
Around a dozen people survived. They were brought to safety by a rescue operation launched from Hull, according to “Storms and Shipwrecks in Boston Bay, and The Record of Life Savers of Hull."
The New York Times reported that “not a vestige of the ship remained."
That is, except for its figurehead, which was recovered unscathed. Alleged to be cursed, it was passed from owner to owner until it eventually found a home.
“No ship's captain wanted her," the Bostonian Society, a nonprofit and steward of the Old State House and its collections wrote in a blog post.
In 1908, the figurehead was given to the Bostonian Society, which put it on display. It's said that a fire in 1921 started near the carving.
“She was sold and placed in a shop on Lincoln's Wharf . . . the wharf promptly caught on fire and burned!" the society said in the blog post.
Again, it survived.
The figurehead is no longer on display but remains in the museum's collections.
* * *
So what's left of the Maritana's memory? There is another link, bearing us back to the past: the lichen-encrusted monument of a ship's broken mast.
Some archives list Williams as “of Providence." But a small blurb in a Nov. 8, 1861, edition of the Boston Post told a different story. It was an announcement about his funeral.
“The obsequies of the late Capt. G. W. Williams of the ill-fated ship Maritana . . . took place from the residence of his family," it said, “in Dedham."
“The remains," it read, “were interred in the cemetery in that town."
To learn more about Williams's grave marker, we contacted Joan Pagliuca, a Dedham Historical Society board member. She met us at Old Village Cemetery, where a large tree towers over the four-sided marker, guarded by a shin-high border.
“To find the story of his ship is just an incredible story. Especially the headlines — 'The worst shipwreck ever in Boston Harbor,"' Pagliuca said. “And here he is; he's here in our little town cemetery."
The monument resembles a shattered mast wrapped by a torn rope. On one side of its plinth is a message in memory of the Maritana and Williams, “Who Perished In Boston Harbor Nov. 3, 1861, On The Homeward Passage."
A replica of the ship is carved in the stone. It is depicted approaching what's probably Boston Light. If you get close enough, you can see the details of its sails and masts.
Now get down on the ground, on this patch of earth 16 miles from the harbor. There, on the bow, is the faintest silhouette of a figurehead of a woman, staring blankly at the shoreline.

Texto completo: Mr. Hatcher was one of the first two black people elected in 1967 as mayor of a large American city.
Richard G. Hatcher, one of the nation's first big-city black mayors who in two decades leading Gary, Ind., sought vainly to stem its poverty and blight while championing cities and blacks generally, died on Friday night in Chicago. He was 86.
His death, at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, was confirmed by his daughter Renee Hatcher. The cause was not given.
Mr. Hatcher was elected mayor of Gary on Nov. 7, 1967, the same day that Carl B. Stokes, another black Democrat, was elected mayor of Cleveland. Mr. Hatcher served until losing a 1987 bid for a sixth four-year term; Mr. Stokes did not seek re-election after serving two two-year terms.
Mr. Hatcher was a 34-year-old city councilman and civil rights activist when he ousted the white incumbent in the Democratic mayoral primary and narrowly won a racially bitter general election. He took over a sharply segregated city of 175,000 that had become half black amid white flight, which would accelerate after his election.
He also took over a city whose economy was dependent on a single industry -- steel -- whose boom-and-bust history and automation were key factors in Gary's decline despite the efforts of Mr. Hatcher and subsequent mayors.
When Mr. Hatcher was elected, Gary's poverty rate was approaching 15 percent, black unemployment was twice the rate of white joblessness and, the new mayor said, more than 40 percent of housing in the city was unsound or needed major renovation. Crime levels were high and municipal corruption -- a major issue in his reform campaign -- was rife.
During his 20-year tenure, Gary garnered several hundred million dollars in federal aid for subsidized housing and job-training programs. A hotel was built, the local airport was expanded to handle commercial traffic and, in Mr. Hatcher's first term, the police force was enlarged by 40 percent.
Despite these efforts, when Mr. Hatcher left office in 1987, 25 percent of residents were living below the poverty level, unemployment exceeded 20 percent and violent crime was still a big concern. Substandard housing abounded, vacant storefronts lined business-district streets and the population had plummeted toward 117,000, according to the 1990 census, 85 percent of it black.
Mr. Hatcher repeatedly predicted that the city was about to turn the corner. "I think we're on the verge of a great new surge forward," he said in a 1978 interview in The New York Times, and he sounded similar refrains in his re-election campaigns.
He and his supporters argued that racism was a major force in Gary's continuing slide.
Citing a "tremendous" departure of existing businesses and private investment money in the 1978 interview, he charged, "There's almost a vested interest among a lot of powerful business people, the tax assessors and other county officials who keep business taxes low here, in proving that a city run by a black will fail." He also maintained that the federal government had provided too little aid.
Urban affairs experts have pointed to the volatile economic history of the steel industry and its automation of recent decades. The United States Steel Corporation founded the city in 1906 to house workers in the huge mill it was building in the area, and the mill was long Gary's largest employer. Its cycle of layoffs and recoveries impeded lasting economic stability in the city, and the automation later reduced jobs permanently.
When Mr. Hatcher left office, there were fewer than 10,000 people working at the mill, less than half the number when he was elected 20 years earlier. (Gary's decline continued after his mayoral tenure: The 2010 census recorded a 37 percent poverty rate in a population of 80,000.)
The mayor's critics accused him of contributing to the city's Rust Belt descent by squandering the federal money and, as one put it, by "chasing a national image and neglecting Gary."
Mr. Hatcher's explanations and promises of better times prevailed in his first four re-election campaigns, in which all his major opponents were also black. But the criticisms won out in the fifth when another black Democrat, Thomas V. Barnes, soundly beat him in the 1987 Democratic primary -- and again when Mr. Hatcher tried to oust Mr. Barnes four years later.
From the time he had first been elected, Mr. Hatcher was regarded by the national news media as a spokesman for the needs of urban America and blacks.
His persuasive manner and political pursuits beyond Gary kept him in that role even after black mayors were elected in the 1970s in Detroit, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Washington. (A black mayor had taken office in Washington shortly before Mr. Hatcher and Mr. Stokes were elected, but that official, Walter E. Washington, had been appointed by the federal government before residents there gained the right to elect their mayor in the '70s, when they voted to retain Mr. Washington.)
Mr. Hatcher was active in national Democratic politics, serving as a vice chairman of the party's national committee and as a leader of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's two presidential campaigns in the 1980s.
He led associations of city officials, and often testified before congressional committees on federal domestic policy, as when he contended that a budget proposal that included reduced federal aid for programs helping poor children and impoverished older people showed that cities "are increasingly viewed as repositories for the poor, the black, the Latin, the elderly -- those who are relatively powerless against the interests of stronger and more affluent elements of our society."
A decade later, he asserted that another Republican president, Ronald Reagan, was trying to "wash his hands" of such people with his efforts to transfer responsibility for numerous domestic programs to the states under the banner of a "new federalism." It was neglect by the states, Mr. Hatcher asserted, that produced most of the federal programs in the first place.
But Mr. Hatcher also found fault with liberals, black and white, telling a gathering of them that liberalism was "condescending" for conceiving leadership as coming "only from those who have made it in society." He called for a coalition of liberals, black power supporters and white radicals.
Richard Gordon Hatcher was born on July 10, 1933, one of 13 children of Carlton and Catherine Hatcher, in Michigan City, Ind., where his father worked for the railcar maker Pullman-Standard.
Richard Hatcher graduated from Indiana University and, in 1959, Valparaiso University Law School. Settling in Gary, he served as a deputy county prosecutor and worked in private practice, helping to represent plaintiffs in a lawsuit charging the Gary school system with segregation. He joined in picketing a local hospital because of its segregated room polices, and was elected to the City Council in 1963 and ran for mayor four years later.
Winning the Democratic primary was normally tantamount to winning the office in the overwhelmingly Democratic city, but the influential county Democratic organization supported the white Republican candidate in the general election, which Mr. Hatcher narrowly won. The organization said Mr. Hatcher had refused to cooperate with it; Mr. Hatcher called the accusation a "cover-up for the racial issue."
After leaving office, Mr. Hatcher opened a consulting firm and taught at Valparaiso and Indiana Universities.
He is survived by his wife, Ruthellyn Rowles; his daughters Ragen Hatcher, Rachelle Hatcher-Swan and Renee Hatcher; his sister, Margie Davis; and six grandchildren.

Texto completo: For more than a decade, a glass and chrome building on Harrisburg's Seventh Street has been at the center of America's student debt crisis.
The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, an independent state agency that distributes state-funded college scholarships, was created 50 years ago to give modest grants and loans to Pennsylvania students. It's since morphed into one of the largest loan servicers in the nation, managing a portfolio worth more than $425 billion.
PHEAA, as it's more widely known, has come under fire in the press and in the halls of Congress recently for its role administering the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, a federal initiative that's supposed to forgive student debt for nurses, teachers and other eligible professionals.
Borrowers across the country say PHEAA's failure to accurately track their loan payments made them ineligible for loan forgiveness.
PHEAA's operating costs are covered by revenue it earns as a loan servicer. But the agency still receives an annual line item in Pennsylvania's state budget to fund scholarships for in-state students.
It's also overseen by a board that includes 16 members of the state House and Senate, who said through a representative last week that they're powerless to do anything to help borrowers seeking federal loan forgiveness.
Here's how Pennsylvania got into the student loan business and what's happened since.
PHEAA's origins
Pennsylvania's Legislature created PHEAA in 1963 with a simple goal: to help students and their parents in the Commonwealth pay for higher education.
The act signed by then-Gov. William Scranton included a $1.2 million appropriation to get the lending operation off the ground. From there, PHEAA operated much like a traditional bank, borrowing money and loaning it out to Pennsylvania students at higher interest rates, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.
Its loan and grant programs have proliferated ever since.
To date, the agency has distributed 7 million scholarships totaling $11.4 billion through its PA State Grants Program, according to a handbook it published for Pennsylvania state lawmakers.
Although PHEAA scaled back its lending programs after the 2008 recession, it recently began advertising a new loan program called PA Forward, aimed at undergraduate and graduate students and their parents.
The agency also offers targeted scholarship funds, including one for students at Pennsylvania's historically Black universities and another for blind and deaf students.
Some of the funds for those grant programs come from annual appropriations in Pennsylvania's state budget. In the 2018-19 fiscal year, PHEAA got a total of $369 million from state coffers.
But the bulk of PHEAAs budget comes from its work as a loan servicer for federal and private lenders.
In that role, PHEAA facilitates payments between borrowers and the financial organizations that lend them money. Its employees also counsel borrowers who fall behind on their payments.
PHEAA began ramping up its loan servicing operation after the Great Recession in 2008 froze many borrowers out of the debt market, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
In 2009, the agency landed one of its most lucrative gigs to date: a 10-year, $1.3 billion contract to service federal loan forgiveness applications for the U.S. Department of Education.
'Missteps, errors and mismanagement'
Every day, thousands of borrowers across the country interact with PHEAA as they try to take advantage of an imperiled federal program that offers to forgive their student debt.
The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was created in 2007 to encourage more students to enter low-paying public service professions. It offers to wipe away debt for people who work as teachers, firefighters, public interest lawyers, or other qualifying professions, as long as they make 10 years' worth of loan payments while working for the government or eligible nonprofits.
A story published last month in The New York Times described the program as a beacon of hope for workers laden with student loans. But 99% of those who sought relief were rejected, the newspaper reported.
Borrowers and consumer advocates directed some of their ire at congressional lawmakers who wrote the loan forgiveness legislation, and the Department of Education, which administers the program.
But they reserved special criticism for PHEAA, which services loan payments as an entity called FedLoan.
Reviews dating back to 2015 found that PHEAA representatives lost track of loan payments and mistakenly told borrowers they were on track for forgiveness.
A report by a U.S. Department of Education watchdog found earlier this year that PHEAA provides some of the worst customer service among all of its private contractors.
Ten percent of calls to the FedLoan center in Harrisburg between May and June 2017 were considered "failed calls," meaning that employees failed to give struggling borrowers good information on their repayment options, according to a summary of the report in The Philadelphia Inquirer.
The U.S. Department of Education wrote a sternly worded letter to PHEAA in April demanding it improve wait times at the Harrisburg call center.
Congressional Democrats called on a federal consumer protection watchdog to investigate PHEAA in October, saying that its "missteps, errors and mismanagement" of loan forgiveness applications caused harm to tens of thousands of public servants and their families.
PHEAA is currently fighting separate federal lawsuits from the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts, who say FedLoan miscounted loan payments and improperly rejected thousands of applicants who qualified for forgiveness.
Elected officials in Pennsylvania have been silent as borrowers and consumer watchdogs railed against the state's own publicly supported loan servicing corporation.
State lawmakers who sit on PHEAA's board deferred comment on the complaints to agency spokesman Keith New, who said FedLoan administers the program "in accordance with program rules and federal law.'
What's the payoff?
New declined to say whether the agency will seek to renew its contract with the U.S. Department of Education after it expires this month.
If its leaders decide to wash their hands of the cumbersome loan program, they may soon be looking to replace more than a billion dollars of revenue, since PHEAA'S contracts con-s:itute its largest source of income.
Executives say those contracts are a win for Pennsylvania taxpayers and students.
Revenue from PHEAA's loan-servicing business pays the agency's operating costs, including executive salaries that are among the highest in state government. CEO James Steeley earns $330,000 per year, according to PennWatch, a database of state employee salaries.
The revenue also funds scholarship programs for Pennsylvania students.
"We started making money and gave it all back to students," New said. "We do not want to be a drain on taxpayer dollars."
PHEAA's critics say there's a big problem with that defense, though. As the agency's loan portfolio has grown, the student debt crisis in Pennsylvania has gotten worse.
The average student loan debt for new graduates in Pennsylvania is nearly $37,000 per borrower - the second highest rate in the country, according to testimony Attorney General Josh Shapiro prepared for a congressional panel this summer.
That's partially because state support for public colleges and universities has failed to keep pace with inflation, especially after the Great Recession in 2008.
Pennsylvania's per-pupil spending on public universities fell by 30% between 2008 and 2017, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank based in Washington, D.C.
Awards from PHEAA's hallmark scholarship program, meanwhile, have stagnated.
PA State Grants scholarships have been capped at $4,123 for three consecutive years, according to PennLive. The scholarship program narrowly avoided deep budget cuts this year thanks to a lower-than-anticipated number of applicants.
Student debt comes to the Capitol
Lawmakers who sit on the loan agency's board may say they're powerless to help borrowers who blame PHEAA for mishandling their debt forgiveness applications.
But some of their colleagues in the Legislature are looking for alternate methods to hold student loan agencies to account.
State Rep. Jennifer O'Mara, D-Delaware, is a 30-year-old lawmaker who co-chairs the bipartisan Student Debt Caucus in Pennsylvania's state House.
O'Mara told the Capital-Star that the 20-member caucus is considering legislation that would create a statewide student debt ombudsman - an official who will investigate administrative mistakes or problems for Pennsylvania lenders.
O'Mara has spoken publicly about carrying $36,000 in student debt. She said she ran into her own problems with FedLoan when she was on her path to federal loan forgiveness.
When her statements didn't look right, she called PHEAA but never heard back. When she voiced her concerns at a House hearing on student debt in early December, the problem was fixed.
But O'Mara still learned a lesson from the exchange.
"It's frustrating I can only get that attention as a state representative calling them out in public," O'Mara told the Capital-Star.

Texto completo: The U.S. government quietly expelled two Chinese Embassy officials after they breached a sensitive military base in Virginia.
The Chinese officials were with their wives when they drove onto the base near Norfolk in September. The group fled military personnel pursuing them and were only stopped when fire trucks blocked their path, according to The New York Times.
American officials suspect at least one of the Chinese officials was an intelligence officer operating under diplomatic cover.
The expulsions appear to be the first of Chinese diplomats suspected of spying in more than three decades. In 1987, the United States apprehended two Chinese diplomat who had tried to obtain classified National Security Agency documents.
Neither the U.S. nor China announced the incident. It has fueled concerns about Chinese espionage in the U.S. as American officials increasingly warn about China’s threat to national security. American officials said Chinese officials with diplomatic passports have become more daring about showing up unannounced at research or government facilities.
Weeks after the intrusions, the State Department announced restrictions on Chinese diplomats, requiring them to give notice about their meetings with local or state officials and with educational and research institutions. The State Department said at the time that the restrictions were in response to Chinese regulations on the travel of U.S. diplomats.
The Chinese officials and their wives drove up to a checkpoint at the base, where Special Operations forces are stationed. A guard told the group they did not have permission to enter and asked them to go through the gate so that they could turn around and exit the base.
In stead, they continued on to the base and were eventually blocked by fire trucks. The officials claimed they did not understand the guard’s instructions and had gotten lost.
It is unclear what the Chinese were trying to accomplish at the base, but some U.S. officials said they could have been testing security measures.
In September 2018, Chinese student Zhao Qianli was arrested when he was found photographing an American defense intelligence installation near Key West, Florida. The student had gone around a fence that stopped at the ocean and walked onto the base to take photos, including an area with satellite dishes and antennae.
Zhao said he had gotten lost at the time of his arrest. He was sentenced to one year in prison.
A crackdown on Chinese espionage in the U.S. has picked up in recent years. Three former U.S. intelligence officers have been convicted in the last year of conspiring with the Chinese.
Most recently, Jerry Chun Shing Lee, a longtime CIA officer, was sentenced to 19 years in prison. He was suspected of being a mole for the Chinese government who compromised CIA sources, some of whom were killed. Prosecutors were unable to prove that Lee gave classified information to the Chinese, but they argued it explained why he received more than $840,000 while he was being asked for information on the CIA.

Texto completo: Felix Rohatyn, una importante figura de Wall Street a quien se adjudica haber salvado a Nueva York de la bancarrota murió el sábado a los 91 años de edad en su casa de Manhattan, anunció su hijo citado por The New York Times.
Este refugiado judío nacido en Austria y naturalizado estadounidense se hizo conocido en el campo de las finanzas acumulando éxitos en el sector de fusiones y adquisiciones y escalando lugares del prestigioso banco de inversión Lazard Frères (ahora Lazard).
Hábil negociador, se convirtió en un asesor escuchado por las élites políticas estadounidenses e innumerables hombres de negocios, construyendo una reputación como un hombre capaz de encontrar una solución aceptable para los problemas más difíciles. Lo llamaban “Felix, el reparador”.
Esta cualidad le valió la misión de salvar a Nueva York de la bancarrota en la década de 1970 , cuando la ciudad se estaba desmoronando. Una tarea que llevaría a cabo mucho más tiempo de lo inicialmente planeado, supervisando las finanzas de la ciudad durante 18 años.
“La vida extraordinaria de Felix Rohatyn es una historia emblemática de Nueva York”, dijo el alcalde de la ciudad, Bill de Blasio.

Why Maine authors love writing in a winter wonderland The beautiful and isolating winter finds its way into the work of many Maine authors, both as setting and inspiration.

Texto completo: Every time there's a snowstorm, Matt Tavares walks out his back door in Ogunquit and takes pictures to share with the world.
Not that he posts them on Facebook or Twitter or anything like that. He uses those images to bring an icy beauty and frozen authenticity to his children's picture books. His latest, "Dasher," came out in September and has made the New York Times children's best-sellers list. The book tells the story of how Santa's reindeer came to be. Besides using the look of Maine's snowdrifts and icicles to shape his "Dasher" drawings, Tavares says Maine winters also inspire him to do some of his best work.
"I do a lot of my writing during the winter. I find winter in Maine is a good time to clear your mind and really focus on your story," said Tavares. "I take walks in winter to picture the story in mind. I find it inspiring."
Maine's long, beautiful and isolating winters play a major role in the works of many Maine authors, both as setting and inspiration. Some are children's books, like "Dasher," where the state's landscape is the model for a universal winter wonderland, or a setting for Christmas and holiday stories. But there are also novels where the power of Maine's winter intensifies the story, whether it's a mystery, romance or other human drama.
"The challenge of creating a Maine winter in fiction is finding all the elements that make it especially challenging, especially wonderful, especially deadly," said Maine author Bill Roorbach, whose 2014 novel "The Remedy for Love" is set in a blizzard. "I do think beauty is at the top of that list. How could anything so gorgeous be deadly?"
PICTURE THIS
Children's authors often find fertile ground in Maine's winters. There's the stark beauty of snow and ice mixed with the picturesque natural scenery and quaint small-town scenes found all over the state. There are some classic Christmas books featuring Maine ideas and images, like "Christmas in Maine" by Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Robert P. Tristram Coffin, first published in 1941. It's a nostalgic and charming look at a Maine farmhouse crammed with family, food and fun, and includes a wintry sleigh ride. A picture book for all ages, it was republished by Islandport Press in 2015 with original woodblock prints by Maine artist Blue Butterfield.
"My Wonderful Christmas Tree" by noted Maine artist Dahlov Ipcar is another long-loved children's book inspired by a Maine winter. First published in 1986, it features images of nature that Ipcar could see from the window of her home in Georgetown.
Winthrop author Lynn Plourde has set seven of her 35 children's books in winter, including "If I Could Give You Christmas," which came out in September and was illustrated by Jennifer L. Meyer. The book is about the small meaningful moments of the holiday season, like spending time together, embodied by Maine's winter woodland creatures, including moose, deer, otters, lynx, fox and squirrels.
Plourde, who has been writing children's books for more than 20 years, says using a Maine winter as a setting has broad appeal. When people idealize winter they think of the kind of winters we have in Maine, trees frosted with a thick coating of snow, kids making snowmen, long icicles hanging from the roof. They don't think of, say, a mid-Atlantic winter, where people use umbrellas in snowstorms and two inches of accumulation can cause miles of traffic tie-ups.
Plus, there's something comforting about the idea of the kind of long winter days Mainers endure.
"People say the evenings are so long, but I say, 'Oh, it's a nice long evening for reading or writing,' " said Plourde, a Maine native. "And it's beautiful here in the winter, a different kind of beauty."
Tavares grew up near Boston and came to Ogunquit during summers. So he didn't experience a Maine winter until he went to Bates College in Lewiston, where he studied art. Since graduating more than 20 years ago, he's illustrated 20 children's books, half of which he wrote. His 2017 bestseller, "Red and Lulu," also had wintry elements, like snow and towering evergreens. It is the story of two birds who become separated when their evergreen is cut down and taken to a big city to be used as part of the holiday decorations.
Tavares began "Dasher" because his editor thought a holiday-themed book with wintry images would catch people's eye. He researched the written history of Santa Claus and decided to make Dasher and the other reindeer a family, who are part of a traveling circus before they meet Santa. Then he started sketching, using his backyard snow pictures and scenes around Ogunquit as models. He even used a picture of the Ogunquit shoreline taken from a drone. In the book, there's a scene where Santa and his sleigh are flying over a town. Below, the reader can see hotels and church steeples and the general shape of the Ogunquit's shoreline, covered in snow.
"I love painting and drawing new-fallen snow," said Tavares.
A NOVEL APPROACH TO WINTER
Novelists say a Maine winter helps shape their stories in unique and surprising ways.
"I like the way setting a story in a storm limits the size of the stage for the characters, it limits movements and presents challenges," said author Lewis Robinson of Portland, whose 2009 novel "Water Dogs" is set in a Maine snowstorm. "The quiet serenity of a snowstorm can sharpen focus on the interior action."
Robinson says he does his best work in winter, finding he "can't write that well in summer" with all the distractions. "Water Dogs" is about two Maine brothers in their 20s who've lost their father, dealt with a variety of personal issues and economic challenges, and love paintball. During a paintball game in a snowstorm, a rival goes missing. A mystery ensues.
Anthony Doerr, who has since won a Pulitzer Prize for his 2014 novel "All the Light We Cannot See," reviewed Robinson's book for the New York Times and was extremely enamored of the descriptions of snow. "Open practically any page of this book and crystals will shake out," wrote Doerr, who knows something about Maine winters, having graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick in 1995.
Robinson said he set the book in a March snowstorm because that's something unique to Maine and evocative to Mainers.
"Just when the rest of the country is warming up, we get hit with another storm," said Robinson. "No matter how many times we've been through this (in Maine), we still think spring is going to come early some year."
Midcoast author Paul Doiron set his 2016 mystery "Widow-Maker" at a fictional western Maine ski resort. He had written about "hardcore, bone-chilling Maine winters" before, with sled dogs and snowmobiles and such. But "Widow-Maker" delves into the culture of winter in Maine, especially areas that rely on winter tourists for economic stability, and other places that are practically empty after summer tourists leave. The game warden Mike Bowditch investigates a woman's disappearance, which leads to him exploring his own past and inner demons. With the foreboding winter landscape and mountains all around.
"Trying to describe what Maine is like in winter, after millions of visitors have left, struck me as an interesting challenge," said Doiron.
Roorbach, who splits his time between Farmington and Scarborough, said he set "The Remedy for Love" during a Maine winter because "there's no winter like a Maine winter. Cold, for sure, and isolated, but so charged with the energy of blue skies that we forget there are miles to go. "
The book is about a man and a woman who meet at the grocery store, just before a "storm of the century" type blizzard is about to pound western Maine. The man helps the woman get food and firewood for the rustic cabin she's living in, but after his car disappears, he becomes stranded with her as the storm rages. Roorbach said his idea was to put two dissimilar individuals together in an emergency and see if they fall in love.
The storm provides beauty, drama and, of course, the excuse for the pair spending so much time together.
"And then the sun sets. Oh, how pretty, and then the power goes off. Oh, how romantic. And then the emergency continues, day one, day two, day three, a week, 10 days," said Roorbach. "The joy, of course, is allowing Maine itself to become a character, and winter a mood."

Texto completo: I removed my glasses the second I stepped inside Enio's dining room, swabbed them on the sleeve of my coat, then slid them back onto the bridge of my nose. Nope: still blurry. Was the temperature differential of frigid, dry wind outside versus toasty, garlic-scented air inside the narrow trattoria causing my lenses to fog?
"It's not you. Look up," my dinner guest said, squinting at the gauzy glow around the lightbulbs. "It's a little overcast in here."
Enio's is a tiny operation that prides itself on making nearly everything it serves from scratch. That's all the more remarkable when you stop to consider that chef/co-owner Laura Butler runs the back-of-house single-handed, aided only by a dishwasher. Similarly, her husband, co-owner Bob Butler, handles the front solo, with a single busser as backup.
"We're basically a low-key, mom-and-pop place, and we've always done things that way, all the way back to 1996 (when the couple opened Rachel's Wood Grill on Exchange Street in Portland)," Laura Butler said. "We make everything ourselves and get our inspiration from eating out when we visit Italy, little places where the emphasis is on food and wine, letting that be the focus, not being flashy."
To be sure, the former bakery (and flower shop) that houses the South Portland restaurant is so unassuming, it blends stealthily into the stretch of residences that surround it. If you are not on the lookout for Enio's, you might drive past without ever noticing it.
The interior is equally modest: checkerboard linoleum floors, banquettes fashioned from planks charred in the style of Japanese shou sugi ban and off-white walls that reflect the space's diffuse, warm yellow light.
Since mid-2013, when a mostly positive review in this paper described the then-new restaurant as "clean, light and unfussy," little has changed at Enio's, and that includes chef Laura Butler's charmingly "uncomplicated" cooking. Except now, thanks to an open-flame grill installed that autumn (the source of the Vaseline-lens haze that floats over the dining room), her menus have expanded to feature wood-grilled dishes.
These days, brawny cuts of meat like a grill-marked, medium-rare Maine Family Farms pork chop ($31) drizzled with veal reduction and angled, teetering on an enormous portion of porcini-and-fontina risotto, are among Enio's most popular (and successful) dishes.
You'll also find wood-grilled proteins playing supporting roles alongside the dozen or so varieties of homemade pasta that Laura Butler prepares. My favorite is the fat link of blistered Italian-style sausage, prickling with aromatic sage, allspice and rosemary, that she nestles into an ample portion of semolina-and-durum wheat radiatore ($28). Stirred through with kale, roasted red peppers and smoky half-moons of sweet delicata squash, it's a rustic Italian daydream of autumn in New England.
While Enio's dense, nearly cheesecake-like St. Louis Butter Cake with macerated strawberries and house-made chocolate ice cream ($10) isn't Italian, it is a testament to the breadth of Laura Butler's culinary skill, not to mention tenacity in her commitment to scratch cooking. That extends to snacks and appetizers like rich chicken liver mousse topped with a softly bittersweet balsamic vinegar and cabernet sauvignon reduction ($8), where even the accompanying grilled toasts are made from airy-crumbed homemade sourdough.
Yet when Enio's goes off-script things can also go awry, such as when thick slices of that same crusty bread are overloaded with lemon-infused Spanish Matiz sardines, pickled onions and a groaning portion of veiny bleu cheese ($15). What results is a crackling short-circuit of savory and umami flavors on an unwieldy dish. Just ask the couple sitting at one of the bar-height window seats near me last week. I watched as one lifted a toast from his plate and promptly liberated all the toppings into the lap of his friend. The two just laughed it off and ordered another couple of glasses of wine.
On Bob Butler's judicious selection of well-priced, mostly Italian, entirely Old World wines are plenty of options to help you recover from the agony of a lapful of preserved fish. His well-balanced list also seems engineered for pairing with wood-grilled proteins and simple vegetable dishes, especially the tannic, Sangiovese- and Nebbiolo-based Tuscan reds.
One menu item that stands up particularly well to wines with a bit of astringency is the wilted spinach appetizer ($11), a straightforward-appearing plate of sauteed greens seasoned with spinach pesto. Hidden among the thousands of rumpled pleats are flecks of garlic and cannellini beans barely beginning to molt from their skins, white flesh spreading into a blur - a starchy parallel to the soft-focus of woodsmoke floating a few feet above.

Texto completo: Felix Rohatyn, a pioneer of Wall Street's lucrative corporate-acquisition business who steered New York City from bankruptcy in the 1970s and remained an unelected guardian of its finances for almost two decades, has died. He was 91.
Rohatyn's death at his home in Manhattan on Saturday was reported by the New York Times, citing his son Nicolas. No cause of death was given.
As managing director of Lazard Freres & Co., now Lazard Ltd., Rohatyn earned the not entirely flattering nickname "Felix the Fixer" for his deal-making during the mergers-and-acquisitions boom that began in the 1960s. He exerted similar influence in government finance starting in the 1970s.

"Felix may have come as close as any man -- certainly any Jewish man -- in the past century to replicating, in his own, less ostentatious way, the extraordinary financial, political and social influence that J.P. Morgan had wielded in the previous one," William Cohan wrote in his 2007 book, "The Last Tycoons: The Secret History of Lazard Freres & Co."
Rohatyn landed his most public post in 1975, when New York City's finances reached a crisis point.
The city had accumulated short-term debt of about $6 billion, was running budget deficits in excess of $1.5 billion and found itself effectively locked out of credit markets where it could sell new bonds and notes. New York Gov. Hugh Carey and state lawmakers created the Municipal Assistance Corp., empowered it to issue bonds on the city's behalf and gave it control over the city's sales-tax revenue to repay lenders.
Rohatyn, who advised Carey during negotiations over the panel's creation, became chairman of the nine-member board in September 1975. Nine months later, Carey also named him to the state's Emergency Financial Control Board, increasing his power over the city's budget.
The panels guided the city back to fiscal health. The threat of bankruptcy receded in 1978 when the federal government approved $1.65 billion in loan guarantees for New York. Carey's successor as governor, Mario Cuomo, later said of Rohatyn's role: "It would be difficult to exaggerate it. He literally saved the city from bankruptcy."
As chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corp. through 1993, Rohatyn retained extraordinary power to decide how to spend the city's surplus revenue. In all, he amassed and distributed about $3.5 billion, favoring causes close to his heart such as education and mass transit, the New York Times reported in 1993. In his exercise of public power as a private citizen, Rohatyn resembled his hero, Jean Monnet, the French economist who made European economic and political union his lifelong mission, without ever holding public office.
Not everybody celebrated Rohatyn's broad influence. His uneasy relationship with Ed Koch, New York's mayor from 1978 through 1989, flared into acrimony when Rohatyn, shortly after Koch left office, criticized him for the generosity of city labor contracts.
Firing back, Koch accused Rohatyn of stockpiling those billions in city tax revenue by intentionally underestimating interest accruing on money held by the corporation.
Felix George Rohatyn was born May 29, 1928, in Vienna, an only child. His mother, the former Edith Knoll, a pianist, came from a family of wealthy Viennese merchants. His father, Alexander, worked in breweries owned by his own father, who ran a bank.
With anti-Semitism on the rise in Europe in the 1930s, Rohatyn's parents moved their family to Romania, then to France. After they divorced, Rohatyn, at 8, was sent to a French-speaking boarding school in Switzerland. By the time he rejoined his mother in Paris, she had a new husband, Henry Plessner, whose precious-metals company did business with Lazard Freres et Cie.
With German troops approaching Paris, Rohatyn and his mother fled south to Biarritz; Plessner, a Polish citizen, escaped from an internment camp and met them there. The family spent a year in Cannes before securing, from the Brazilian government, the visas they needed to leave France.
Decades later, Rohatyn would learn from the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation that Luiz Martins de Souza Dantas, Brazil's wartime ambassador to France, had provided the visas as part of his secret effort to save Jews.
After yet more stops -- in Algeria, Morocco, Portugal, Brazil -- the family reached New York City in June 1942. The two-year odyssey, Cohan wrote, made Rohatyn "preternaturally pessimistic about the outcome of events, extremely conservative financially and far less prone to excessive ostentation than most of his extremely wealthy investment banking peers."
In New York, Rohatyn attended the McBurney School and graduated in just two years while mastering English. He enrolled at Middlebury College in Vermont, intending to pursue a career in physics or engineering. Upon his graduation in 1949, he got a summer job at Lazard Freres in New York through his stepfather. He worked his way up, interrupted by a two-year stint in the U.S. Army, and became a partner in 1961.
He was a protege of managing partner Andre Meyer, an innovator in the growing field of mergers and acquisitions. Rohatyn helped Meyer buy, improve and then sell Avis Inc. to International Telephone & Telegraph Corp. for a hefty profit. That deal "led directly to the creation of the M&A advisory business and Lazard's domination of it," Cohan wrote.
Much of Lazard's early acquisitions work was in support of ITT's buying spree under then-Chairman Harold Geneen, the executive widely credited with creating the multinational conglomerate.
ITT's 1968 announcement that it would buy Hartford Fire Insurance Co. for $1.5 billion led to 13 years of litigation and investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service into the sale of stock as part of the transaction.
According to Cohan's book, federal prosecutors convened a grand jury to consider whether Rohatyn -- an ITT director as well as its point person at Lazard -- had committed any crime in the case. No charges were filed, and Rohatyn told Cohan that he had "absolutely no recollection" of a criminal investigation.
The case also raised questions about whether President Nixon's administration had undercut an antitrust investigation of ITT in exchange for a $400,000 corporate contribution to the 1972 Republican National Convention.
Rohatyn had met with then-Deputy Atty. Gen. Richard Kleindienst to try to head off the antitrust investigation. When the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings to weigh whether the case should affect Kleindienst's nomination as attorney general, Rohatyn was by his side.
Kleindienst testified that the Nixon White House had stayed out of the antitrust matter. He was confirmed and served a year as attorney general, then pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of perjury when records established that the Nixon administration -- and even Nixon personally -- had in fact intervened on ITT's behalf.
The affair tarnished Rohatyn's name. The Washington Post's Nicholas von Hoffman gave him the pejorative label "Felix the Fixer."
Bad publicity didn't stop his rise, though. In 1970, the New York Stock Exchange named him to head a committee charged with stanching a run of brokerage failures caused by back offices being overwhelmed by surging trading volume. The "Crisis Committee" pulled Wall Street out of trouble. Carey's call to help save New York City came in 1975.
Rohatyn earned no salary for his city service and continued to steer deals at Lazard, including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.'s $4.9-billion acquisition of Nabisco Inc. in 1985, the $15.7-billion merger of Time Inc. and Warner Bros. in 1990, and Viacom Inc.'s takeover of Paramount Communications in 1994 for $9.6 billion.
He also remained an important voice on Wall Street, even if his advice wasn't always followed. In a 1992 article, he warned that derivatives -- the complex financial instruments that would play a central role in the global credit crisis of 2007 -- were "financial hydrogen bombs" created by "26-year-olds with computers." His 2009 book urged the creation of a National Infrastructure Bank to direct federal funds to roads, bridges and schools in greatest need of money.
Long seen as a candidate to lead Lazard, Rohatyn declined the chance in the late 1970s. Toward the end of his long tenure he battled publicly with Steven Rattner, a one-time protege who seemed to be on the path to chairman. Rattner left Lazard in 2000 to start a private-equity firm.
Rohatyn's financial support of the Democratic Party was almost rewarded in 1996 when President Clinton floated his name as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. In the face of opposition by Republican senators, Rohatyn withdrew from consideration. Clinton then named Rohatyn as U.S. ambassador to France, a post he held from 1997 through 2000.
In April 2001, he founded Rohatyn Associates in New York to provide financial advice to corporations. In 2006, he joined Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. as an advisor to Chief Executive Richard Fuld, an affiliation that ended when the firm declared bankruptcy two years later.
Among other roles, Rohatyn was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, vice chairman of Carnegie Hall and a commander in the French Legion of Honor.
Rohatyn had three sons -- Pierre, Nicolas and Michael -- with his first wife, Jeannette Streit, who died in 2012. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979. That year he married the former Elizabeth Fly Vagliano, who served as president of the New York Public Library and founded a nonprofit group, Teaching Matters Inc., that trains public-school teachers. She died in October 2016.

Texto completo: Like any good New Yorker, I mind my own business on the subway. Unless I'm in a bad mood, like that cold day last week when nobody was emailing me back, and my jeans were too tight, and I was late for a meeting I didn't want to go to and this kid turned his profane rap music up to full volume on the platform. Black and brown teenagers are often overpoliced in public spaces, but this kid was as white as Post Malone.
I spotted a small child a few feet away. Perfect. "Turn that off!" I boomed at the teenager, modeling my voice on that Theranos scammer. "Can't you see there is a small child over there?" I didn't care about the child -- she was probably listening to a podcast about murder, anyway -- I was just cranky. But more than that, I didn't need anyone breaking the social contract we all silently enter into when we disappear below ground.
Swiping that MetroCard or jumping that turnstile admits us to a world full of complex rules. I don't mean "let the passengers off first" or "don't spread your giant, important legs" or even "pay the fare." The M.T.A. is about to hire 500 new police officers "mainly to support fare evasion and homelessness outreach mitigation efforts," according to its budget proposal. This has many riders incredulous -- both at the cost, which is $ 50 million a year at a time when the subway is running a huge deficit and desperately needs investment in repairs, and the fact that the New York Police Department says crime on the subway is lower now than it was last year.
Concerned riders have shared videos and photos of police tasing and pointing guns at black teenagers for not paying the fare and hauling away a weeping food vendor's cart. I've noticed graffiti saying "More churros less cops." I'm tempted to take out my pen and correct it to "fewer cops," but otherwise I approve of the sentiment. I'm not worried about an immigrant woman providing treats for a dollar apiece or people who need to get somewhere but can't afford the $ 2.75 fare. I am worried about overcrowding, delays, the welfare of M.T.A. workers and, of course, small children's ears.
The rules I truly care about are the ones that aren't written down, like "don't bother each other" and "keep your eyes on your phone screen at all times." Sometimes, when I take a break from staring at mine and stretch my crooked little neck up to see how many stops I have left, I accidentally lock eyes with someone else. We frown at each other and go back to our screens. As it should be.
That said, every now and then, paying attention can be wonderful. I looked out the window of the B train one afternoon and watched as a woman who had been sitting opposite me took two steps onto the platform, looked at her hand, and then whipped her head back at the train with horror. Right then, the man beside me lunged at the man opposite me. I thought he was attacking him, but he was reaching between his legs because he'd spotted a diamond ring on the floor. He leapt toward the door and handed the ring to the frantic woman, whose face broke into a huge smile. It was as if she were getting proposed to all over again, except this time by a stranger speckled in cement. He apologized to the guy he'd jumped at and we all shared a laugh. It felt good. Thirty-five minutes later, I waved goodbye to the speckled man. He made a "Who the hell are you?" face. He'd forgotten we'd shared that moment and, honestly, that made it perfect.
I don't want to romanticize the subway. It drives me crazy with delays and crowding. When I first moved to New York I was wowed with the possibilities for a dreamily inclusive future that the trains opened up. I would gaze starry-eyed at an elderly Orthodox Jewish man dozing beside a guy with a mohawk and a leather jacket reading beside a woman in a sari holding a baby, etc. Six years later I just want to get a seat so that I can trawl Instagram and eat my churros in peace.
Perhaps I wasn't being naïve, though, according to the book "International Express: New Yorkers on the 7 Train," about the busy Queens subway line where 80 languages are spoken. "A most remarkable characteristic of the process whereby one becomes an urbanite on mass transit is that the ethnic and racial categories that might seem to distance one from fellow passengers are usually and quickly dismissed as secondary," the authors write. "This process of knowing-yet-ignoring whereby riders become 'blasé' New Yorkers on the subways is essential to the establishment of a community in transit."
Still, I worry that we're not all in it together. I wonder how many rich people ever use the train. I wonder why Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the M.T.A. are prioritizing the wrong solutions, and I wonder if I can stand many more years of unreliable service. Then something happens that gets me all mushy again.
Last month, I was in Bushwick waiting for the M train to take me into Manhattan when I saw someone sprint onto the platform and just make it through the closing doors of a J train. He hadn't noticed that he had dropped his wallet on the platform. A woman picked it up and looked at me, making a "What do I do now?" gesture. I reluctantly took out my headphones and asked to see the wallet. The man's ID was in it and I quickly found him on Instagram. His bio stated he was born in Donetsk, Ukraine, and his account showed his work. He's an M.F.A. candidate at Hunter, a conceptual artist. I messaged him and waited to hear back. Then the M came. I got on with the woman and her small child, who leaned against me as I showed them the artist's work. The artist responded right as we boarded the M, saying he would get off the train three stops later. He did, and so did the woman and her child, who waved back at me like we were old friends. I carried on and from my seat on the moving train, I saw that the artist got his wallet back.

Review: A Brother and Sister Triumph Together at Carnegie Hall
The cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason gave a superb New York recital debut alongside the pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason.
In 2016, the British cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason won the prestigious BBC Young Musician of the Year Award. Early in 2018, his debut recording on the Decca label was released, including his arrangement of Bob Marley's "No Woman, No Cry," which has been streamed more than 11 million times on Spotify.
But this attention paled next to the overnight fame he achieved from a single performance in May 2018, when he played during the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, watched on television by an estimated 1.9 billion people.
On Wednesday, things were decidedly more intimate when Mr. Kanneh-Mason, 20, gave his New York recital debut in Carnegie Hall's 268-seat Weill Recital Hall, alongside his slightly older sister, the pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason. (Her own Decca album, of works by Clara Schumann, has just been named to The New York Times's list of the best classical recordings of the year.)
Mr. Kanneh-Mason is a gifted, sensitive artist. And in the demanding works this duo performed -- especially Rachmaninoff's rhapsodic and teeming Sonata in G Minor, which has a virtuosic piano part -- Ms. Kanneh-Mason was a superb collaborator.
The program, available in its entirety at wqxr.org, opened with Beethoven's 12 Variations on "Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen." The jaunty theme comes from Papageno's song in Mozart's "The Magic Flute," in which the rustic bird catcher explains that what he wants most in life is a loving wife. From the first statement of the theme in Beethoven's jolly arrangement, Mr. Kanneh-Mason brought out the wistful subtext of the music, the yearning and loneliness the character feels, with rich, focused tone and elegant phrasing. As the variations grew in intricacy and inventiveness, these impressive musicians responded with crisp stylishness.
They then gave an intense account of Lutoslawski's aptly titled "Grave," a kind of argumentative dialogue that opens with a searching, fragmented theme for cello, which Mr. Kanneh-Mason played with grim beauty. This brooding piece, dotted with skittish, mysterious outbursts for both cello and piano, has a distressed and confused quality, well conveyed here.
By contrast, Barber's Opus 6 Sonata, written when its composer was 22, is a forthright, dynamic and impassioned work. Yet while conveying the soaring lyricism and flinty harmonic vitality of the music, these players teased out the unsettled urgency that runs through the score -- even the glowing slow movement, with its fantastical middle section.
Though these charismatic young artists received a prolonged ovation, they played no encore. What they'd already done in this small space was statement enough.
Sheku and Isata Kanneh-Mason

Minors leadership swings back at MLB after Winter Meetings

Texto completo: Baseball's Winter Meetings are over, but the battle between Minor and Major League Baseball rages on.
Friday evening, MiLB fired off a four-page rebuttal to a dozen points raised in negotiations for a new Professional Baseball Agreement between the sides and, in their view, in disparaging public comments, e-mails, and photographs coming from MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and his deputy, Dan Halem, in San Diego this past week.
The sides engaged in both formal and informal discussions last Friday at the start of the meetings about their PBA, which is set to expire next September and which drew public outcry when it was revealed MLB proposed stripping 42 teams across the country of their major-league affiliation.
On Monday, MiLB president Pat O'Conner expressed cautious optimism, saying talks were productive. On Tuesday, Halem spoke with the Globe, and on Wednesday, Manfred addressed reporters.
“MLB has repeatedly and inaccurately stated the position of MiLB," their missive began, “with respect to several key areas under consideration in the PBA negotiations."
Halem turned over to the Globe an internal e-mail from Carolina League president Geoff Lassiter, asking its 10 teams if any had interest in exploring a sale of their club to establish a new franchise in Wilmington, N.C. In MLB's opinion, the e-mail — dated late last month, while minor-league owners were decrying MLB's contraction proposal — demonstrated that minor-league owners were willing to move teams from their communities with no compunction, and do so frequently.
While turning over the e-mail could also be seen as retaliation for media revelations from October about an in-progress team list that Halem sent to MiLB president Pat O'Conner in confidence, MiLB said the e-mail Halem revealed was more damning to MLB's stance.
“It was not an offer for teams to relocate, but rather a request for an expression of interest," said MiLB's statement. “What MLB failed to disclose [after making the assertion that MiLB team owners jump from city to city in search of a better deal], were the responses to the very e-mail they shared, which were that more MLB-owned teams reported an interest in relocating than non-MLB owned teams."
According to multiple industry sources, three of the five Carolina League teams that expressed interest in exploring a move to Wilmington are MLB-owned teams.
Halem showed to the Globe 21 color photographs of shoddy or unsafe conditions and facilities at minor-league ballparks. Three of them were from two Appalachian League teams: The Kingsport (Tenn.) Mets and Bristol (Va.) Pirates.
Major League Baseball owns the 10-team Appalachian League. Teams effectively lease the franchises, and are responsible for their upkeep and maintenance. In other words, those two MLB franchises allowed those facilities to deteriorate. The 42-team hit list includes nine of the 10 Appalachian League teams.
Said the MiLB: “In many cases, MiLB teams have already worked with their MLB counterpart to address special needs, despite no contractual obligation to do so. As in many cases with MLB's argument, they fail to acknowledge issues are not a matter of non-compliance, but rather a point to be addressed in a new set of standards."
And, said MiLB, it “has offered on multiple occasions to discuss and negotiate reasonable facility standards in the next agreement to address any unmet needs of MLB. Minor League Baseball has never expressed to MLB an unwillingness to address new standards and improvements in facilities."
Manfred professing chagrin about learning minor-leaguers sometimes traveled by school bus was met with derision.
“Despite the Commissioner's repeated misleading statements to the contrary, no minor league player in affiliated baseball is transported on a school bus," MiLB wrote. “The only situation where MLB-contracted players travel by school bus or passenger van occurs in MLB-owned and operated leagues in Florida [Gulf Coast League], Arizona [Arizona Summer League], and the Dominican Republic [Dominican Summer League]."
As for MLB's Dream League, a plan to place unaffiliated players in teams in place of many of the affected cities, MiLB continued to use nightmarish language about the concept, declaring it “nothing more than a shell game designed to conceal . . . the elimination of professional baseball in 42 communities across the country."
Talks began in March. MiLB sounded the alarm in October about MLB's proposal, which would affect mostly Single A and short season clubs, including the Lowell Spinners. Halem said on Tuesday that Lowell is not guaranteed to be on any list.

Tonight, Let It Be Tsingtao; Trump reduces his trade taxes, China says it will discourage IP theft and coercion.

Texto completo: Time will tell whether the Chinese government honors its new trade agreement with the U.S. But today's news of lower taxes on commerce and commitments to reduce theft of U.S. inventions may be reason enough to crack open a cold Tsingtao.
William Mauldin, Lingling Wei and Alex Leary report in the Journal:
U.S. and Chinese officials announced a limited agreement to halt the trade war between the countries, with President Trump removing the threat of new tariffs on China and Beijing agreeing to purchases of American farm goods and other products.
As part of the "phase one" deal, the U.S. canceled plans to impose fresh tariffs on $156 billion in annual imports of Chinese-made goods—including smartphones, toys and consumer electronics—that were set to go into effect Sunday. The U.S. will also slash the tariff rate in half on roughly $120 billion of goods, to 7.5% from 15%.
Beijing has a history of non-compliance and Chinese strongman Xi Jinping is still a communist. This column also understands that the tariff burden isn't the principal reason you're not drinking Tsingtao. But today marks potential progress on the most important issues at stake and perhaps optimism and a willingness to experiment are in order.
The Journal reports that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lightizer "said China made specific commitments on intellectual property, including counterfeiting, patent and trademark issues and pharmaceutical rights. The intellectual-property commitments will be announced in the future, he said."
The Journal adds:
Mr. Lighthizer said China has agreed, through enforceable provisions in the pact, to end the practice of forcing companies to transfer their technology as a condition of entering the Chinese market.
CNBC reports on its interview with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow:
"Regarding intellectual property rights, there's a section in that chapter that would prevent the kind of counterfeiting among tradable goods that has been going on for years. that is clearly an unfair trading practice," Kudlow said.
Mr. Kudlow added, "We will see if the Chinese stay with their word." A report in the South China Morning Post (owned by Chinese tech giant Alibaba) quotes Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen:
Wang said the nations have had in-depth discussions about intellectual property protection, including protecting IP in the pharmaceutical industry, and about cracking down on counterfeiting on e-commerce platforms.
"These measures are in line with our reforms to strengthen IP protection, and this will also help China promote its economic development," Wang said.
Allowing creators to profit from their inventions surely will help China promote its economic development. Here's hoping the regime believes it.

AI Not So Intelligent?
Perhaps people alarmed about the power of facial-recognition technology should instead be concerned about its weakness. Jeff John Roberts writes in Fortune:
Masks and simple photographs are enough to fool some facial recognition technology, highlighting a major shortcoming in what is billed as a more effective security tool.
The test, by artificial intelligence company Kneron, involved visiting public locations and tricking facial recognition terminals into allowing payment or access... More alarming were the tests deployed at transportation hubs. At the self-boarding terminal in Schiphol Airport, the Netherlands' largest airport, the Kneron team tricked the sensor with just a photo on a phone screen. The team also says it was able to gain access in this way to rail stations in China where commuters use facial recognition to pay their fare and board trains.
Other Than That, The Story Was Accurate
"For months, Prime Minister Boris Johnson planned on calling a general election in Britain, figuring he could break the logjam in Parliament by taking his case for Brexit directly to the people. Instead, as he has floundered in the early stages of the campaign, Mr. Johnson has discovered that the people are taking their case to him.
"... in the early stages of the general election, exposed to hostile voices, he has seemed at times unsure, tone deaf and gaffe prone... the charged atmosphere on the campaign trail is a reminder that Brexit has left this country bitter, divided and deeply suspicious of the political establishment. Mr. Johnson and his populist aides set out to exploit those sentiments, framing this election as one of the 'people vs. the Parliament.' Now he is finding that some of that anger is being directed at him."

'Lunch with Cultural Presentation' Scott Greenstone of the Seattle Times reports that the "director of King County's coordinating agency for homelessness is on paid leave following a dancer's strip show at the agency's annual conference on Monday." Mr. Greenstone adds:
Performer Beyoncé Black St. James danced topless in a sheer bodysuit, gave lap dances and kissed attendees, according to a staffer at a local housing nonprofit who attended the conference in South Seattle.
The only note on the agenda was "Lunch with Cultural Presentation," and there was no other warning or announcement about the nature of the performance...

Boies's Firm Names Next Leaders

Texto completo: Since its founding, the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP has largely been associated with one person: litigator David Boies.
Now, the firm Mr. Boies co-founded in the 1990s is implementing a plan to ensure it can survive long past his tenure.
Boies Schiller this week named for the first time managing partners who don't have their names on the door. The two new leaders, New York-based Nicholas Gravante Jr. and London-based Natasha Harrison, have been tapped to guide the firm into its second generation.
The announcement comes after a tumultuous period for Mr. Boies. He was most recently in the news for filing a defamation lawsuit against longtime foe Alan Dershowitz and for his interactions, as reported in the New York Times, with an apparent fraudster who said he had damning materials related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.
He has also come under heat for his representation of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who faces charges of sexual assault, and for his support of defunct blood-testing company Theranos Inc.
The bad press has led some clients to tell partners they are wary of giving new work to the firm, a person familiar with the matter said. The new leaders pushed back against that notion.
The headlines have been "temporary distractions," Mr. Gravante said, but he added that they aren't the driving force behind the transition. Instead, the changes are about preparing the 320-lawyer firm for the eventual retirements of Mr. Boies, 78 years old, and Jonathan Schiller, 73.
"What you need is a willingness from them to hand it over," Ms. Harrison said.
Successfully moving a law firm away from its founders is a challenge that has vexed other partnerships in recent years. Mr. Boies has long been one of the primary sources of revenue for Boies Schiller and his name is well known beyond legal circles.
"I am confident that building on what we as a firm do very well, and learning from our mistakes, mine included, that the next generation of leadership will not only equal but will exceed what we have accomplished to date," Mr. Boies said.
He rose to fame over the decades for assignments, including his successful representation of the Justice Department in an antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp., representing Al Gore in the 2000 Florida presidential election recount and helping win same-sex marriage rights in California. Mr. Boies said he has been working for the past decade on the best way to hand off the litigation firm he founded in 1997.
Mr. Gravante, 59, and Ms. Harrison, 46, said there are no internal calls among the partners to push Mr. Boies aside. Mr. Boies reiterated that point and said he and Mr. Schiller plan to retire over the next several years.

Weinstein settles for $25m with many alleged victims

Texto completo: After two years of legal wrangling, Harvey Weinstein and the board of his bankrupt film studio have reached a tentative $25 million settlement agreement with dozens of his alleged sexual misconduct victims, a deal that would not require the Hollywood producer to admit wrongdoing or pay anything to his accusers himself, according to lawyers involved in the negotiations.
The proposed global legal accord has gotten preliminary approval from all the major parties involved, according to several lawyers.
More than 30 actresses and former Weinstein employees, who have accused Weinstein of offenses ranging from sexual harassment to rape, would share in the payout — along with potential claimants who could join in coming months. The deal would bring to an end nearly every such lawsuit against him and his former company.
The settlement would require court approval and a final signoff by all parties. It would be paid by insurance companies representing the producer's former studio, the Weinstein Company.
Because the business is in bankruptcy proceedings, the women have had to make their claims along with its creditors. The payout to the accusers would be part of an overall $47 million settlement intended to close out the company's obligations, according to a half-dozen lawyers, some of whom spoke about the proposed terms on the condition of anonymity.
Representatives for Weinstein declined to comment. Lawyers did not respond to requests for comment for board members and other parties.
Meanwhile, Weinstein's bail was increased from $1 million to $5 million on Wednesday over allegations he violated his pretrial release conditions by mishandling or disabling his electronic ankle monitor.
Judge James Burke warned the disgraced movie mogul that he'll face jail if other issues crop up. Weinstein, 67, leaned on a walker as he came and went from a New York City courthouse for the bail hearing, looking as frail and pained as he did at a court appearance last week.
Weinstein's lawyer said he is having back surgery Thursday to relieve pain from an August car crash and that he will recover in time for the Jan. 6 start of his trial on rape and sexual assault charges.
Weinstein is scheduled to be tried in New York in early January on charges of sexual assault involving two women. While his criminal prosecution has drawn public attention, the largely hidden negotiations over civil claims have been far more consequential for many of his accusers, who include women from the United States, Canada, Britain, and Ireland.
More than $12 million — one-quarter of the overall settlement package — would go toward some, but not all, legal costs for Weinstein; his brother, Bob; and other former members of their company's board, the lawyers said. The board members would be insulated from future liability, and the alleged victims would drop their claims against Weinstein and other executives.
The settlement would resolve lawsuits filed by dozens of women since 2017, when The New York Times exposed allegations of sexual harassment and abuse by Weinstein.
Although the producer's accusers include some of the highest-profile women in the entertainment world, such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Salma Hayek, none have joined the proceedings.
A lawsuit by actress Ashley Judd, who has said she intends to take Weinstein to trial, would not be part of the deal.

Texto completo: The Trump administration is highly selective in how it applies the standard of “self-sufficiency” for programs. To move food stamp beneficiaries toward that goal in all states, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue laid out a plan to strengthen work requirements for federal beneficiaries by April 2020.
The new rule makes it more difficult for states, no matter if they have areas of economic distress, to waive a requirement that able-bodied adults work at least 20 hours a week to maintain their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamp) benefits. The new measure could eliminate benefits for nearly 700,000 adults (it would not affect food stamp recipients with dependents, those over age 50, those with a disability or pregnant women).
“Government dependency has never been the American dream,” Mr. Perdue said. “We need to encourage people by giving them a helping hand but not allowing it to become an indefinitely giving hand.”
But Republican distaste for “government handouts” seems to be strictly on a case-by-case basis. For example, with the Farm Bill, Mr. Perdue and others within the party are quite comfortable turning a blind eye to corporate welfare and crony capitalism. And “handouts” — or if you prefer, “bailouts” — to wealthy agribusinesses are not limited to the Farm Bill. Over the past year, as farmers throughout America were hit hard by President Trump’s trade wars, the administration put together a $28 billion package that, according to some reports, could actually be overpaying some farmers for their losses.
The list goes on. Last year, House Republicans wanted to make it possible for 10 percent or more of the nation’s commodity farms to receive unlimited subsidy payments. They sought to remove payment limitations from marketing assistance loan gains and loan-deficiency payments and tried to make it easier for general partnerships to reorganize as “family farms” and thus qualify for greater subsidy payments. The House version of the Farm Bill also exempted certain business arrangements — partnerships, joint ventures, LLCs and Subchapter S corporations — from the adjusted gross income means-testing provision, a measure that has so far limited commodity and conservation payments to the nation’s wealthiest producers.
To be sure, the struggles of many farmers across the country are real and troubling, but the farm bailout’s aid payments are not getting to some truly struggling farms. The Environmental Working Group found that most bailout money has gone to the nation’s biggest farms. One farm has received $2.8 million in payments. With the aid they’ve received from the Trump administration this year, some farmers will net their highest profits in six years.
In essence, the Trump administration’s measures are aimed at making it easier for wealthy Americans to receive unlimited government handouts — to, in the words of Mr. Perdue, secure for themselves an “indefinitely giving hand.”
Ever since the New Deal, the farm-focused portion of the Farm Bill has been geared toward providing economic aid to farmers — and both farmers and Congress have “clearly moved away from the Jeffersonian ideal that championed minimal government and maximum personal independence,” as R. Douglas Hurt writes in his book “Problems of Plenty.” Farm Bill subsidy recipients are often deeply dependent on the federal government for support.
Yet rather than speaking of this as laziness, or bemoaning the burden this causes for taxpayers, Mr. Perdue and others within the administration bolster supports for the nation’s largest, wealthiest agricultural producers.
This is not to suggest that there is no need in rural America for investment, reform and assistance. Many farm communities are hurting, but very few federal dollars go to the small to midsize farmers who actually need assistance. About 75 percent of total subsidy payments go to the largest 10 percent of farming companies. Agribusiness monopolies eat away at farmers’ profit, from the seeds they grow to the chemicals they buy to the supply chain that gets their product to market. Tens of thousands of farms have gone under in recent years, and farmer suicides are alarmingly high. The opioid crisis is as intense in farm country as it is in other geographic areas, and many parts of rural America are plagued with the same “food deserts” that plague many urban neighborhoods.
Mr. Perdue isn’t wrong when he says that the American dream does not consist of government dependency. But utter self-sufficiency is, if we are honest, impossible for most of us. People will always need a “safety net” of sorts — but ideally, we should want people to find that support in community, family, churches and associations, as well as other local ties, not (or at least not only) through a distant government bureaucracy.
That said, at a time when many local social threads have broken, and our society is increasingly fragmented and frayed, there is a need for the government to provide support where no other support is available.
Mr. Perdue and others in Washington assume that stringent work requirements will push food stamp recipients to find the number of working hours necessary for eligibility. They suggest, without saying so explicitly, that any unemployment currently experienced by these beneficiaries is because of laziness, not lack of opportunity.
But many people in both rural and urban areas of America know that reality is a lot messier than this. Available work is not distributed evenly over every state or region. Threatening to take away someone’s food stamps until they find steady work does nothing to solve the problems of postindustrial collapse, community breakdown, economic inequality, racism, systemic poverty, homelessness or drug addiction that have prompted many to find help in the first place — just as a farm bailout does nothing to repair the economic, cultural and political conditions that are feeding our current farm crisis.
But as farmers’ plight has grown, they’ve been offered the “indefinitely giving hand” that Mr. Perdue does not want food stamp recipients to receive. It seems hypocritical to demand that the poorest Americans pull themselves up by their bootstraps while covering the business risk of the nation’s wealthiest agribusinesses.
So if Mr. Perdue and the Trump administration want to foster fiscal self-sufficiency, perhaps — rather than starting with Americans struggling to put food on their table — they should start at the top of the food chain instead.

Townshend, Daltrey return to The Who's rocking ways

Texto completo: WHO

The Who (Interscope)

While frequently joining forces for tours and other projects, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey have released just two studio albums as The Who since 1982, with 2006's Endless Wire their last such work until now.

WHO sees the pair backed by some of their frequent collaborators since the deaths of drummer Keith Moon in 1979 and bassist John Entwistle in 2002, such as drummer Zak Starkey and bassist Pino Palladino. Others include drummers Joey Waronker and Carla Azar, bassist Gus Seyffert, and keyboard player Benmont Tench.

Still, all the splendid backing notwithstanding - and not forgetting co-producer and multi-instrumentalist D. Sardy, either - it's the high standards of The Who's last remaining trademarks, Townshend's songwriting and guitar playing and Daltrey's superlative singing, that make the album such a joy.

Townshend has written a strong batch of songs full of yearning and confronting the passage of time, many carrying shades and echoes of his past work; he rips power chords and performs slinky riffs; and his vocals, especially in support of Daltrey's leads, are still a highlight.

Daltrey, for his part, with health concerns behind him, sings with power, sensitivity, range and conviction, just as he has done for decades.

While it doesn't have the same of air of finality as Leonard Cohen's You Want It Darker, released just weeks before his death in 2016, based on their recording habits of the past decades, WHO may well be their last studio album.

The catchy, propulsive opener All This Music Must Fade seems like a message about Townshend and Daltrey's difficult relationship, even though that seems to have mellowed: I don't care/I know you're gonna hate this song. And that's it/We never really got along. It may also be a missive to their fans and closes with what will become Townshend's most famous last words since his I saw ya! at the end of Magic Bus.

Ball and Chain, Street Song, and Beads on One String are topical but many other of the 11 tracks (plus three on the deluxe edition) are simultaneously defiant, vulnerable and contemplative, with aging repeatedly rearing its head.

On the rousing Rocking in Rage, like a coda to Quadrophenia, the talk is still about their generation: I thought I'd be calmer/Not rocking in rage, even if I'm too old to fight. It's a shiver-inducing Daltrey performance.

Townshend sings lead on I'll Be Back, a nostalgic tune with strings and harmonica, that seems lifted from his All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes 1982 solo album.

On I Don't Wanna Get Wise, Daltrey seems to have changed some of the lyric sheet's I pronouns into he, we and us, as if making space for himself in the rocking mini-biography of a song - He was drunk/I was blind/Though we tried to be kind - and belting out a We got wise at the end.

Thankfully, it's much too late for Daltrey and Townshend to die before they get old, so with WHO they show that even in rock 'n' roll, it's possible to age both with grace and vigor and without abandoning purpose. Or lose the talent to make stirring, highly gratifying music.

MUNICH 2016

Keith Jarrett (ECM)

He's played with many of the greatest musicians in jazz history, starting with trumpeter Miles Davis. But when master jazz piano improvisationist Keith Jarrett gives a solo performance, there's something to behold.

Few, if any, pianists of the jazz-classical genres can match his intensity, creativity, and unstoppable ideas. Hardly any pianist has ever improvised like him. Munich 2016 is a must-have for Jarrett fans like me. Recorded at Munich's Philharmonic Hall on July 16, 2016, Munich 2016 was the final show of his European tour back then.

It's a bit of a mix between high-octane, almost frenetic scoots along the keyboard and warm, soothing, and thought-provoking numbers that awaken your soul. On my first listen, I actually found some of the early parts of this two-disc album to be a little more dour than I had expected, but was pleased by what happened after that. I'm a particular sucker for his gorgeous, jazz-classical rendition of Over the Rainbow, which many artists - including Jarrett - have performed before, but his offers an intense beauty of that classic song that sticks to your bones and stands on its own.

Jarrett, like a lot of great jazz improvisers, is a bit of an acquired taste. I fell in love with his music in high school upon discovering The Koln Concert after it took the world by storm following its release in 1975, lauded by the New York Times and others as the best album released that year, bar none. The Koln Concert went on to become the best-selling piano recording in history, and it opened my ears to the power that solo jazz improvisationists have at achieving interpersonal communication with listeners, especially behind a piano.

I've continued to follow Jarrett, who - now 74 - rarely performs. He was afflicted so deeply by chronic fatigue syndrome two decades ago that he took two years off and it was unclear if he would perform again. Then, in March of 2018, he canceled all remaining concerts of his worldwide tour that year because of unexplained health issues, including a much-anticipated solo concert at New York's Carnegie Hall. He's in a class of his own and I'm pulling for him.

David Boies's Law Firm Names Likely Successors; After lengthy transition, Boies Schiller Flexner LLP elevates two leaders to guide the firm beyond Boies's retirement

Texto completo: Since its founding, the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP has largely been associated with one person: famed litigator David Boies.
Now, the firm Mr. Boies co-founded in the 1990s is implementing a plan to ensure it can survive long past his tenure.
Boies Schiller this week named for the first time managing partners who don't have their names on the door. The two new leaders, New York-based Nicholas Gravante Jr. and London-based Natasha Harrison, have been tapped to guide the firm into its second generation.
The announcement comes after a tumultuous period for Mr. Boies. He's most recently been in the news for filing a defamation lawsuit against longtime foe Alan Dershowitz and for his interactions , as reported in the New York Times, with an apparent fraudster who said he had damning materials related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.
He has also come under heat for his representation of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who faces charges of sexual assault, and for his support of now-defunct blood-testing company Theranos Inc.
The bad press has led some clients to tell partners they are wary of giving new work to the firm, a person familiar with the matter said. The new leaders pushed back against that notion.
The headlines have been "temporary distractions," Mr. Gravante said, but he added that they aren't the driving force behind the transition. Instead, the changes are about preparing the 320-lawyer firm for the eventual retirements of Mr. Boies, 78, and fellow name partner Jonathan Schiller, 73.
"What you need is a willingness from them to hand it over," Ms. Harrison said.
Successfully moving a law firm away from its founders is a challenge that has vexed other partnerships in recent years . Mr. Boies has long been one of the primary sources of revenue for Boies Schiller and his name is well known beyond legal circles.
"I am confident that building on what we as a firm do very well, and learning from our mistakes, mine included, that the next generation of leadership will not only equal but will exceed what we have accomplished to date," Mr. Boies said.
He rose to fame over the decades for assignments including his successful representation of the Justice Department in an antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp., representing Al Gore in the 2000 Florida presidential election recount and helping win same-sex marriage rights in California.
Mr. Boies said he has been working for the past decade on the best way to hand off the litigation firm he founded in 1997. Last year, he and Mr. Schiller ceded some power to a new four-person management committee that took on many day-to-day operations.
The slow-moving transition, spearheaded by Messrs. Boies and Schiller, has frustrated some partners internally, according to a person familiar with the matter.

* Being a Law Firm Partner Was Once a Job for Life. That Culture Is All but Dead.
But both Mr. Gravante, 59, and Ms. Harrison, 46, say there are no internal calls among the partners to push Mr. Boies aside. Mr. Boies reiterated that point in an interview and said he and Mr. Schiller plan to retire over the next several years.
"I don't see any indication of any turmoil in the firm," Mr. Boies said.
Boies Schiller's partners will vote on the appointment of the new managing partners this weekend at the firm's annual meeting in Key Biscayne, Fla., a lavish affair open to all lawyers at the firm and their families. The vote isn't expected to be contentious, as partners usually fall in line with recommendations from the 11-person executive committee, which has blessed the new leaders.
Mr. Gravante, who first began working with Mr. Boies in 1985 when the two were at Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, has represented a host of high-profile clients, including former American International Group Inc. head Hank Greenberg, the family of former Vice President Joe Biden and the Andy Warhol Foundation.
He has inspired some of his own colorful headlines. In 2016 he sued his mother in a dispute related to assets of his father, Nicholas Gravante Sr., who was longtime counsel to Brooklyn mafia families.
Ms. Harrison, meanwhile, joined the firm six years ago to start a London office, its first international venture. She represents investment banks, private equity and hedge funds and corporations in international disputes.
In his new role, Mr. Gravante said he would be focused on what needs to change to make the firm relevant going forward. When he joined in 2000, he says, "We were a very different firm. It was David Boies responsible for the lion's share of the work." The firm's system of compensating partners still reflects that, he said, focusing too much on the number of hours worked and not enough on making sure partners are hustling for new business.
Since 2013, the percentage of the firm's business generated by the named partners has declined from slightly over 40% to just over 20%. But Mr. Gravante said the firm's system of compensating partners still focuses too much on the number of hours worked and not enough on making sure partners are hustling for new business.
The firm continues to be a lucrative place to work, particularly for those who succeed in court for their clients. One associate found out this week they are in line for a $950,000 bonus tied to a contingency-fee case, Mr. Boies said. Partners with equity in the firm made an average $3.3 million last year, according to legal trade publication the American Lawyer.

Texto completo: The anguish spread across the country, as strangers, neighbors, friends and family shared in the shock and grief at the tragedy that had taken the lives of three hopeful men at the dawn of their careers.
ST. PETERSBURG — They came to the cream-colored house in south St. Petersburg this week with flowers, cards and aching hearts.
First came U.S. Navy chief recruiter Michael Martin, who signed "Mo" Mohammed Haitham up for the military over a year before. Haitham is the long-legged track and field star at Lakewood High School in St. Petersburg who has been in the news all week about last Friday's shooting at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola.
Martin came in full uniform with a bundle of flowers. He removed his cap as he approached the empty driveway. He knocked. No one was home.
"When you join the military, you join a family," Martin told a stranger from his car window. "He was someone you could tell had a heart, and I wanted to let his family know what we saw in him."
Martin's car disappeared down the empty road. It wasn't long before Ashley Williams pulled up. Williams has also been in the news all week, talking about her cousin.
Williams is the one who told the radio reporters about her cousin's smile, his sense of humor — how, after graduating last year, Haitham joined the military. She's the one who told newspaper reporters about how he went through boot camp in Illinois and was assigned to a flight crew training in Pensacola. How on Thanksgiving, he surprised his family in St. Petersburg. He didn't look the same.
"He looked grown up," said Ashley Williams, who was more like a sibling than a cousin. "He looked happy. Jumping out of airplanes is something he dreamed of doing."
Haitham is dead now, one of three victims of Friday's shooting at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola.
"We're a big family," said Williams. "He left a huge hole."
Haitham was the middle child of three children of Evelyn Brady, a 20-year Navy veteran. His family moved to St. Petersburg from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.
In many ways, he was following in his mother's footsteps and "wanted to help people," said Linda Davis, who lives next door.
"He was the sweet one," Davis said.
The anguish spread across the country, as strangers, neighbors, friends and family shared in the shock and grief at the tragedy that had taken the lives of three hopeful men at the dawn of their careers.
Joshua Kaled Watson. Watson was a 23-year-old graduate of the U.S. Navy Academy. Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, of Richmond Hill, Georgia, was also killed. He was 21.
The shooting began Friday morning when an aviation student from Saudi Arabia opened fire in a classroom, wounding another eight people. The shooting prompted a massive law enforcement response and base lockdown. It ended when a sheriff's deputy killed the shooter.
St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman tweeted that he hopes Haitham's family finds "peace in knowing that Mo made our community and world better."
Lakewood High School's football team took to Facebook to commend Haitman for his courage and heroism.
Principal Erin Savage said at a press conference on Monday that Haitham was nicknamed "the perfect one" and was beloved by students and faculty.
Haitham was a good student, a track and cross country star and a basketball player who also helped manage the girls' basketball team.
"When you picture Mohammed, you picture a smile," said Savage, who learned of the shooting on Saturday. "I just kept picturing his face, with a gunman pointing a gun at him and that initial shock and fear. As a mother, that is what took my breath away."
Tobias Ryckis, 18, a friend and fellow trackmate, said Haitham "had this personality — big smile. People would always gravitate toward him. But he was also a stick-up-for-the-little-guy kinda guy."
Ryckis' was bullied during freshman year at Lakewood High School. It didn't take long for Haitham to take notice — and intervene.
"Mo stuck up for me," Ryckis said. "He talked to them and they stopped. That was the kind of guy he was."
After leaving Lakewood High School, Ryckis found himself in Panama City, two hours from where Haitham was stationed. They promised to see each other after he finished basic training.
Airman Haitham's commanding officer told his father, Sameh Haitham, that his son had also tried to take down the gunman, the New York Times reported Monday.
"That was the type of person Mo was," Ryckis said of Haitham. "When things got tough, he always wanted to be sure that he put other people's interests ahead of his own."
The anguish spread across the country, as strangers, neighbors, friends and family shared in the shock and grief at the tragedy that had taken the lives of three hopeful men at the dawn of their careers.

Attack leaves Jewish community terrified

Texto completo: Orthodox Jews are horrified and fearful in the wake of Tuesday's attack on a Jersey City kosher store.
The fierce gun battle through the city streets left six people dead, including a police detective, the store's owner, and the two suspects.
In response, state and local leaders said they will increase police patrols in vulnerable areas, as fears of copycat attacks rise.
Jewish leaders and others have warned that months of physical and verbal assaults on Hasidic and other ultra-Orthodox Jews in the New York-New Jersey region could lead to killings.
"The latest reports that a suspect involved in the Jersey City attack had published anti-Semitic posts online and that investigators believe the attack was motivated by these sentiments are frightening," said Allen Fagin, the executive vice president of the Orthodox Union.
"Anti-Semitism has always been a torment that Jews have been forced to reckon with for centuries," he continued. "However, its resurgence both in the United States and abroad is alarming for a new reason: the degree to which the mainstream of civil society has seemingly tolerated, without loud and sustained outcry, the most blatant acts of intolerance."
Jersey City has seen a migration from Brooklyn of Chabad Lubavitch Jews and Satmar Hasidim. The families moved into what's viewed as a predominantly non-white neighborhood, establishing businesses, schools and synagogues.
Rivkie Feiner, a lifelong Monsey resident, said the expanding Jersey City Orthodox community was well-known.
"I've heard about them," she said. "That it is a really lovely community."
Authorities continue to probe Tuesday's killing spree that saw hundreds of shots fired along the streets. Police have said that after killing 15-year-veteran Jersey City police officer Joe Seals at a local cemetery, two shooters attacked a kosher market, located near a synagogue with a private school. The New York Times has reported that one of the two suspects was tied to the extremist Black Hebrew Israelites group and had published anti-Semitic and anti-police writings.
Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said the gunmen targeted the Jewish community.
Feiner called on Rockland government and law enforcement officials to ramp up security in Jewish spaces.
"Even though we are in a state over, we are horrified and frightened," she said. "I call on them to do whatever they can to make use feel safe because right now we don't feel that."
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called on state police to increase patrols at synagogues and Jewish establishments.
Rockland Sheriff Louis Falco said communities will see increased police presence as he is working with Ramapo, Spring Valley, and Clarkstown police departments. Rockland features a large Jewish population, including Orthodox and Hasidic communities in Ramapo and Spring Valley, as well as more cultural institutions like the JCC and Jewish Federation.
Across the border and north of Jersey City, Bergen County Sheriff Anthony Cureton said he is ordering increased patrol at synagogues and surrounding population centers.
While there is no specific or credible threat at this time, the office is operating on heightened alert and is working cooperatively with local law enforcement to ensure the safety of Bergen County residents. The Sheriff's Office reminds residents to report any and all suspicious activity to law enforcement.
Copycat fears mount Falco said he's concerned about copycat attacks and he's been in contract with law enforcement in New York City and New Jersey.
"We're monitoring everything closely," he said. "I've been getting intel briefings. We do have some concerns and we will be putting out extra patrols along with the Ramapo, Spring Valley and Clarkstown police for the foreseeable future."
Rockland has been a hotbed of strong rhetoric against Hasidic Jews and Ramapo politics, including exchanges of videos citing anti-Semitism and claims the communities are looking to take control of the county, violating zoning and ripping off social services and other government programs.
Bassie Friedman said her family's synagogue, Cheder Chabad of Monsey, had previously stepped up security, as had her daughter's school. She said she talks to her children about safety, "but not excessively. We talk more about, what are we going to do positive, how are we going to make someone smile."
The fears that this was yet another anti-Semitic attack shook Friedman, but the Pomona resident said that education and interaction are key.
"You light a candle it illuminates the entire room," she said. "We'll always have people who hate. For the rest of us who don't want to live in a world like that, just bring more light. I don't think you can ever go wrong focusing on the positive."
Rabbi Shmuel Gancz of the Chabad Jewish Center of Suffern said he knows the rabbi, Moshe Schapiro, who is the Chabad leader in Jersey City and Hoboken. Chabad practices outreach with others in the Jewish and non-Jewish communities.
Gancz said his biggest fear is that such violence could happen in Rockland, where the Jewish community is much stronger and influential than in Jersey City.
He said the gentrification of Jersey City, started decades ago, has continued with the influx of Orthodox Jews. He said he sees and hears the argument that there's a loss of housing and rents have increased, angering people.
"Seems, if you are not happy with your neighbor and can't fight in town hall, you fight with a gun," Gancz said.
Gancz said self-interest by all sides is a problem, it's about voting blocs, taxes, housing or business. But he said the answer is for all community members to work together.
"All people have selfish lifestyles, he said. "The over-arching idea as human beings is we need to find ways to unify and connect with our neighbors. We are all sharing the same universe and have to respect each other."
Ramapo Supervisor Michael Specht said the attacks and killings highlight "the tremendous sacrifice and commitment our men and women in the law enforcement community make every single day and we stand in solidarity with the department and their families."
He said Ramapo police will increase patrols.

5 essential pieces of gear for runners

Texto completo: Sometimes a little help goes a long way.
I learned this in running after making a lot of mistakes. For instance, I thought at one time it would be fine if I ran in shoes with hundreds, if not thousands, of miles on them.
I also convinced myself it was OK to not pack a snack while running for a couple hours. Hunger, it seemed, was a distraction not worth feeding.
But in the last two years, I've realized that running without any gear or aid doesn't lead one to success. Now I won't leave my apartment to run without taking a few essential items with me.
From good running shoes to a belt, there are several pieces of gear that I find essential when running alone or with friends.
If you're running for the first time or getting back into the sport, here are five things worth having.
Good shoes One of the most important things a runner can do is to use a good pair of shoes that aren't worn out or damaged.
Running shoes, according to Livestrong, can provide midsole foot cushioning and arch support.
Proper foot cushioning can reduce the physical stresses on the heel, ankle and toes, in addition to alleviating or preventing knee, hip and back pain, according to the site.
There are numerous other benefits with running shoes, but the main point is that it can help your body avoid some injuries.
Since the only thing between you and the road is your shoes, consider investing in a good pair.
Headlamp, reflectors Running in an area away from cars like a park or trail is an extraordinarily fun and freeing experience.
But for many runners, sometimes the best and easiest option is to run in more congested areas or while it's dark.
For those running in the early morning or at night, it's worth investing in a headlamp or reflective visit to increase one's visibility.
Many headlamps can be programmed to shine a bright light or blink every few seconds. There are also reflective and LED vests.
Whether it's necessary or you simply want to be extra cautious, investing in a device to make you more visible to cars and pedestrians isn't a bad idea.
Belt It's hard to fit everything into the pocket of your running shorts.
Belts are a great way to keep your favorite items out of your pockets and hands. Many hide beneath one's shirt and have ample storage.
They're also great trash receptacles when a trash bin isn't to be found.
Identification Whether it's an ID bracelet or driver's license tucked into your belt, it's important to have some form of ID in case of an accident.
This is especially important for those running alone. In the event of a medical emergency or collision with a vehicle, it's vital that those who find you are aware of who you are and the best emergency contact info.
Food Runners who prefer short distances rarely need to eat while exercising.
But for those running long distances, eating on the run is crucial.
In a massive New York Times series on running and eating, author Jen A. Miller says runners should eat and drink every four miles.
"If this leaves you feeling sapped, sick or both, try eating more often or try to eat a little more each time," she writes.
Bananas or pre-packaged sports gels or energy chews are great options that can easily be stored in a pocket or belt.

Harvey Weinstein, Ex-Associates, Accusers Reach Tentative $47 Million Settlement; About $25 million will compensate women who accused the Hollywood producer of sexual misconduct

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein, his former associates, insurers and accusers have reached a nearly $47 million tentative settlement of almost all the civil cases pending against him, about $25 million of which will compensate women who have accused the Hollywood producer of sexual misconduct, according to people familiar with the matter.
Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Weinstein and his former associates, including board members of his former studio, didn't admit wrongdoing, the people said. The deal still needs to be approved by a bankruptcy judge and a judge overseeing a proposed class-action lawsuit. The bulk of the settlement money will be paid by insurance policies, including those held by his former studio, Weinstein Co., some of the people said.
The deal resolves all but two of the civil sexual-misconduct lawsuits and other legal claims filed against Mr. Weinstein, the people said.
The tentative settlement won't affect the criminal case brought by Manhattan prosecutors, which is set to go to trial on Jan. 6. Mr. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.
The settlement is the culmination of more than a year of negotiations , which involved lawyers for Mr. Weinstein, his former film studio, the New York attorney general's office, insurers and Mr. Weinstein's accusers. The negotiations also included the former associates of Mr. Weinstein who some women claimed had enabled Mr. Weinstein's alleged abuse. It also resolves a suit filed by the New York attorney general that accused his former studio's executives and board of failing to protect women from his alleged misconduct.
Under the terms of the deal, about $6 million will go to women who have filed lawsuits and legal claims and their attorneys, the people said. An additional $18.6 million will be set aside to create a settlement fund for additional alleged victims, including those covered by the attorney general's suit, they said.
About $7 million will go to some creditors of the film studio. About $12 million will cover the costs of lawyers who defended Mr. Weinstein's former associates against the suits.
The tentative deal was reported earlier by the New York Times.

A spokeswoman for the New York attorney general and a spokesman for Mr. Weinstein declined to comment.
Elizabeth Fegan, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the proposed class-action suit, said because the settlement wasn't final she couldn't discuss specifics. "We've fought to forge a meaningful settlement against strong headwinds," Ms. Fegan said in a statement. "And no matter what amount of money the survivors ultimately receive, the civil settlement will do little to reverse the damage Weinstein caused to so many."
Of the total settlement, $1 million will fund Mr. Weinstein's defense costs to fight the lawsuits against two alleged victims who aren't participating in the settlement, the people said.
Lawyers for those women have portrayed the settlement as unfair. Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for one of those women, said in a statement that he didn't believe the deal was the best possible settlement. "It is shameful that $12 million of the settlement is going to the lawyers for the directors who we alleged enabled Harvey Weinstein," he said.
Thomas Giuffra, a lawyer for the second woman who rejected the deal, objected to settlement funds paying the legal bills of Mr. Weinstein's former associates.
"Victims will receive only a small fraction of what the settlement was expected to yield," he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump plans to sign an executive order to combat anti-Semitism on college campuses by threatening to cut off federal funds to schools that don't curb discrimination against Jewish students, according to a senior administration official.
The order, to be signed Wednesday, is designed to target the Boycott, Divest and Sanction Israel movement, popular on college campuses. The Trump administration -- along with critics on the left and the right -- have long argued BDS is a pernicious form of anti-Semitism akin to discrimination against racial minorities or women.
The order, earlier reported by the New York Times, would define discrimination against Jewish students as a form of bias against their shared national identity -- Israel -- rather than just a form of religious discrimination. Defining Judaism effectively as a form of national identity allows the Education Department to open civil-rights investigations into schools that it deems not to be fostering an open climate for Jewish students. Under federal civil rights law, the Education Department doesn't have authority to crack down on direct forms of religious bias.
Critics of a tougher federal approach against BDS say the government is infringing on the free-speech rights of the movement's supporters and essentially favoring Jewish students over Muslim students.
"It is designed to chill any kind of speech that is critical of Israel," said Joe Cohn, legislative and policy director at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. "This would be unconstitutional."
At least 27 states have passed laws attempting to curb the BDS movement, in part by requiring state contractors to sign pledges not to support it. Several of those laws have been struck down in federal courts as a violation of the First Amendment.
The president's executive order is intended to achieve through administrative action what a long-stalled bill in Congress, the Anti-Semitism Awareness act, would have written into law.
The executive order also adopts a definition of anti-Semitism from the State Department, which defines one form of it as "denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination" and cites opposition to Israel as an example of that behavior. Free-speech advocates fear that definition could allow the administration to go after any criticism of Israel as a form of discrimination, with millions of dollars in federal funding at stake.
Expanding the Education Department's purview to oversee the BDS movement on college campuses has been the goal of the top civil-rights official at the department, Ken Marcus, who was formerly president of the Louis D. Brandeis Center. In that role, Mr. Marcus filed civil-rights complaints with the Education Department against universities with prominent Palestinian-solidarity organizations, which promoted activities the complaints said amounted to "harassment" of Jewish students.

Texto completo: The $ 21 million musical will be hoping for a new home after the Shubert Organization made way for Hugh Jackman and 'The Music Man.'
"Beetlejuice," which overcame a sluggish start to become a fan favorite on Broadway, is being evicted from its theater to make room for another musical that promises to be more lucrative.
The Shubert Organization, which is the largest landlord on Broadway, has ordered "Beetlejuice" to vacate the Winter Garden Theater, where its last performance will be on June 6. The musical is being edged out to make way for next fall's revival of "The Music Man," a heavily promoted project from the powerful producer Scott Rudin that stars one of Broadway's most reliable audience draws: Hugh Jackman.
The ouster of a show that is doing well -- "Beetlejuice" grossed nearly $ 1.6 million over Thanksgiving week, setting a record for the Winter Garden -- is unusual, reflecting the high demand for limited theater space at a time when Broadway is booming.
"It's sad and a shame, and also, in its own way, historic," said Hal Luftig, a "Beetlejuice" co-producer who has been working on Broadway for 30 years. "I don't think there's ever been a case when a show has turned itself around in such a fashion and then has to leave its theater."
It is not clear what will happen next. The producers of "Beetlejuice," led by the theatrical arm of Warner Bros., are hoping to find another New York theater, but the show's elaborate set would make such a move expensive. They are also planning a North American tour starting in 2021, and exploring productions in Britain and Australia.
The development is a blow to the show's investors, who had until now been heartened by the musical's unexpected (but very on brand) return from death's door. The show was capitalized for $ 21 million, and it would be nearly impossible to recoup those costs by June.
"It's disappointing," said Mark Kaufman, the executive vice president of Warner Bros. Theater Ventures. "We took the time and we built a hit, and now we're going to have our life at this theater cut short."
The stage musical, written by Scott Brown, Anthony King and Eddie Perfect and directed by Alex Timbers, is adapted from the 1988 Warner Bros. release, directed by Tim Burton, about a Goth girl and a pushy poltergeist warring within a haunted house.
In setting a deadline for the musical to leave the theater, the Shubert Organization is invoking a "stop clause" that allows it to oust a show whose grosses fall below an agreed upon level for two weeks in a row.
Invoking such a clause is not unprecedented, but what makes this situation unusual is that although "Beetlejuice" fell below the specified level last May, since then its grosses have rebounded.
The Shubert Organization notified "Beetlejuice" in June -- after the Tony Awards -- that it had hit the stop clause.
By the time the show rebounded, however, the Winter Garden was already committed to its next tenant: The theater owners had reached an agreement with Rudin that would allow him, more than a year later, to run "The Music Man" there.
The Shuberts sent "Beetlejuice" a formal letter on Oct. 1 informing them that they needed to vacate next spring; "Beetlejuice" is now making its plight public as it puts a final block of tickets on sale.
The announcement will also clear the way for "The Music Man" to announce its plans, which it expects to do next month; until now, the production has taken the unusual step of selling tickets for seats at an unnamed theater, and even on Monday it declined to comment or confirm its venue.
Warner Bros. unsuccessfully broached the idea of a compromise that could satisfy both shows. Among other proposals, the company offered to pay to relocate "To Kill a Mockingbird," a box office hit also produced by Rudin, from the Shubert Theater to a smaller house, so "The Music Man" could be staged at the Shubert while "Beetlejuice" remained at the Winter Garden.
But the two production teams could not agree on a price tag.
"It's no secret that the producer of 'Music Man' wanted that theater," Luftig said. "If I had one wish, I wish they could have all sat down to think of a Plan B, because we're in a precarious situation now."
The Shubert Organization declined to comment for this article, other than to say: "If an appropriate theater becomes available, we would certainly talk about moving the show."
"Beetlejuice" has already overcome several obstacles. The show's 2018 pre-Broadway tryout in Washington was panned by the Washington Post critic Peter Marks. It was revised before opening on Broadway in April, but was greeted in New York with mixed reviews (in The New York Times, an unimpressed Ben Brantley called it "absolutely exhausting"); it was then nominated for eight Tony Awards but won none.
The show brought in $ 818,904 in its first full week after opening, which was below its stop clause. But, after a boffo and much-viewed performance on the Tony Awards broadcast, it began to rebound midsummer, and has grossed over $ 1 million most weeks since mid-July.

The show's advance -- the value of tickets sold for future performances -- has doubled over the last six months, to $ 7.6 million, during a period when most see their advances drop. Just last week, the show sold 16,586 advance tickets worth $ 1.7 million, according to Matt Polk, a spokesman for the production.
In fact, every financial indicator has been pointing up: The advance has risen in 16 of the last 17 weeks; the average ticket price has grown; and group sales are way up, Polk said.
The reversal of fortune has been fueled by strong word of mouth, particularly among first-time theatergoers, and a shift in marketing strategy, which pivoted from emphasizing the show's irreverence to celebrating its sense of fun.
The "Beetlejuice" cast recording has been streamed 100 million times, and the performers have worked hard to promote the musical, whose opening number, "The Whole 'Being Dead' Thing," has been given lyrics tailored for television appearances, most recently on "The View" and at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
The production has also courted ardent enthusiasts (and repeat attenders) dubbed "Netherlings." There have been costume contests, and fan art is displayed backstage. And the show is among the first on Broadway to thrive on TikTok, a popular mobile app used to make and share short videos.
"I sit in all these Broadway League meetings where they talk about building a new audience for Broadway," said an obviously frustrated Kaufman. "Once we started building that audience, it started to take off -- we are the textbook definition of word of mouth."
Kaufman said that, over the next seven months, he would try to sustain the show's momentum in hopes of keeping it alive. "We'd be foolish to give up," he said. "You don't work this hard to not power on."

Lori Loughlin spends holidays prepping for next big role: Testifying at her own trial

Texto completo: When her daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella, were younger, Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli loved to give them a white Christmas by packing the family up and flying — presumably by private jet — to Colorado so they could all play in the snow and ski.
More recently, though, the Giannulli family has stayed in Los Angeles in their Bel Air mansion, as the former Hallmark Channel star told Parade magazine in 2017. But Loughlin said they still enjoyed other holiday traditions: picking out a tree and decorating it. She said she and her fashion-savvy, social media influencer daughters also loved to go shopping.
“It’s really about getting together with family,” Loughlin said.
This year, the former “Full House” star and her family again will be in Los Angeles, but things will be far less jolly. That’s because Loughlin, 55, is facing the possibility of years in prison for her alleged role in the college admissions scandal and has been hunkering down in rooms with lawyers to prepare her defense, Us Weekly is reporting in its new issue.
The actress best known as wholesome Aunt Becky is participating in “grueling” mock trials, essentially rehearsals for what could be the biggest, most consequential performance of her life: defending herself in federal court against bribery, fraud and money laundering charges.
According to Us Weekly, Loughlin, 55, is “adamant” that she wants to testify, even though it’s never a requirement for defendants to take the stand and defense attorneys often advise against it.
“Lori has no choice at this point but to take this to trial and hope for an acquittal or a hung jury,” a source told Us Weekly.
Loughlin apparently believes she can convince a jury that she’s a sympathetic figure, another insider said. She and her husband are charged with paying $500,000 in bribes to get Olivia Jade, 20, and Isabella, 21, fraudulently admitted to the University of Southern California.
Perhaps the veteran TV actress and media personality hopes she can use her star power and comfort in the spotlight to present herself as a loving mom who thought she was doing right by her daughters. Loughlin and her fashion designer husband also are expected to argue that they were duped into engaging in a bribery scheme concocted by college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer.
“She feels they’ll believe that the accusations against her don’t merit criminal prosecution, that she truly thought she was making a legal contribution to charity,” the insider told Us Weekly.
Loughlin and Giannulli reportedly will argue that they believed the money they paid to Singer and to his alleged accomplices at USC were legitimate donations to Singer’s education nonprofit and to the school’s athletic programs.
“Mossimo strongly believes they were victims of a con and did nothing wrong,” an insider previously told Us Weekly.
But as much as Loughlin and Giannulli agree on some issues related to their “united front” defense, they disagree on others. That includes Loughlin’s reported earlier desire to strike a plea deal with prosecutors. Now, Loughlin wants to testify, and her husband doesn’t think it’s a good idea at all, Us Weekly reported.
“Mossimo doesn’t want to testify, but will be forced to if Lori does,” the insider told the outlet.
Another worry for the couple is that Olivia Jade and Isabella may be called as prosecution witnesses to testify against their parents. The indictment alleges that Olivia Jade and Isabella participated in the bribery scheme by posing for photos on rowing machines. The photos were used for fake athletic profiles that Singer and his accomplices created in order to present the sisters to admissions officers as crew team recruits.
The prospect of Olivia Jade and Isabella testifying terrifies Loughlin, Us Weekly reported.
“Lori’s bereft when she talks about the girls being forced to testify at their trial,” the insider said. “She doesn’t understand how it got to this point.”
Legal experts say that the decision to testify is always up to a defendant. Juries are instructed to not hold it against defendants when they don’t take the stand.
“There are so many risks to testifying that every attorney worth his salt thinks long and hard about recommending it,” according to a post on AbovetheLaw.com. “No matter what the prosecutor’s evidence, if a defendant testifies that is what will determine the verdict.”
When a defendant testifies, she loses her right to remain silent. It also shifts the burden of proof, which normally is on the prosecution, the legal site said in its post. After a defendant testifies, juries must now look at two “stories” of the case.
“Whether the prosecution made its case or not, if they don’t like how the defendant came off, either because they don’t believe him or just don’t like him, they’ll generally convict,” the post said.
Defense attorneys may see an advantage to putting certain defendants on the stand, notably professional, educated defendants in white-collar cases who have no prior criminal history, the New York Times said. Attorneys may believe they can adequately prepare these defendants to put their cases in the best light.
“The problem in calling the defendant to testify is the second act: cross-examination,” the New York Times said. “Prosecutors often can hardly contain themselves at the thought of getting a shot at the defendant.”
The prosecutor’s strategy usually involves making the defendant uncomfortable and forcing her to respond to questions she may not want to answer, which puts her credibility on the line, the Times added.
For an attorney to decide whether to put a client on the stand, “it comes down to figuring out how well the defendant can perform on the witness stand, particularly cross-examination, as measured against the strength of the government’s case.”
If it’s a matter of “performing,” Loughlin may have an advantage, since performing in TV and in films has been her livelihood for several decades.
In that sense, Loughlin has begun to treat her trial preparation like a “full-time job,” doing the mock trials, meeting with her lawyers or discussing strategy over email,” Us Weekly reported.
Still, the actress also realizes that this could be her last Christmas at home, if the trial doesn’t go her way. For that reason, Loughlin also is trying to spend as much time with her husband and daughters as possible, Us Weekly said. After all, she also once said, “It’s important to make the effort to see your family around the holidays.”

Charles M. Blow: Oh, Nikki. You’re So Wrong.

Texto completo: There was a moment in which people thought — and many liberals feared — that Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor and former United States ambassador to the United Nations, would be the post-Donald Trump face of the Republican Party as a political candidate.
She was somewhat respected, had crafted an image of competence and seemed to have more of a moral center than many Republicans now toeing the line in support of Trump. Also, she would solve, or at least challenge, two of the issues that continue to dog Republicans: racism and misogyny. She is an Indian American woman.
But, Haley burned all that to the ground when she engaged in an astounding bit of revisionist racial history about the Confederate battle flag and its relationship to Dylann Roof, the then 21-year-old white supremacist who in 2015 gunned down nine black worshippers in the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.
In an interview for Glenn Beck’s podcast, Haley said:
“Here is this guy that comes out with his manifesto, holding the Confederate flag and had just hijacked everything that people thought of. We don’t have hateful people in South Carolina. There’s always the small minority that’s always going to be there, but people saw it as service and sacrifice and heritage. But once he did that, there was no way to overcome it.”
This is such an astonishing statement for the very brazenness of its erasure of history and its bowing to a racist narrative. Any image of morality and unity Haley had cultivated vanished when those words left her lips.
Even the idea that Haley is a heroine of the taking down of the flag in South Carolina is a myth, like the idea that Roof suddenly altered the reality and meaning of the flag.
So, I reached out to Bree Newsome Bass, the young activist who scaled a flagpole in the wake of the shooting and removed the Confederate battle flag by hand. Bass is a true heroine of the flag’s removal.
Bass quite correctly saw Haley’s response “as part of the ongoing revisionist history that people continue to engage in around Confederate symbology.”
The NAACP had been boycotting the state for 15 years, including under Haley’s tenure as governor, before the state finally took it down. In 2011, Ben Jealous, then the NAACP president, issued this scathing assessment of Haley on the flag: “Perhaps one of the most perplexing examples of the contradictions of this moment in history is that Nikki Haley, South Carolina’s first governor of color, continues to fly the Confederate flag in front of her state’s Capitol.”
Indeed, just eight months before Dylann Roof executed his horrific act of white-supremacist terror, she deflected from the issue of removing the flag in a gubernatorial debate, instead saying of the “sensitive issue” surrounding it, “We really kind of fixed all that when we elected the first Indian American female governor.”
Be clear, Haley: The Indian American journey in this country is special and important, but that journey has absolutely nothing to do with adjusting or erasing the journey of enslaved Africans and their descendants in this country.
Haley used her status as a racial minority to shield her party’s racial animus.
The people who want to recast this racist emblem of a flag as “Southern pride” are the white Republicans in the South that Haley had to court to win her seat. A CNN poll conducted in 2015 found that 75% of Southern whites describe the flag as a symbol of pride.
Let’s be clear: The Confederate battle flag we know today is an emblem of oppression, white supremacy and the fight to maintain slavery. That is its heritage.
William T. Thompson wrote in an 1863 editorial about the “Stainless Banner,” the second national flag of the Confederacy, “Our idea is simply to combine the present battle flag with a pure white standard sheet.” He continued, “As a people, we are fighting to maintain the heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematic of our cause.”
In South Carolina, the Confederate battle flag made a slow march to greater prominence as civil rights for black people were asserted or attained, beginning by being displayed in the State House in 1938 “after angry Southerners in Congress managed to defeat a bill that would have made lynching a federal crime” and reaching the top of the dome on the Capitol in 1962 “after President John F. Kennedy called on Congress to end poll taxes and literacy tests for voting and the Supreme Court struck down segregation in public transportation,” as The New York Times wrote in 2015.
Whereas Roof’s killings had shocked the state, and President Barack Obama’s eulogy at the funeral of one of the slain had moved it, Bass’ radical action had embarrassed it.
As she put it, when Dylann Roof displayed the Confederate flag, “He was coming in the tradition of that racism and that violence.”
Bass makes a piercing point: The NAACP and the Ku Klux Klan “are in agreement about what the Confederate flag is.” There is no true ambiguity.

Texto completo: Nike Inc. employees staged a protest over the company's treatment of women on the same day the sportswear company reopened a headquarters building named after the disgraced running coach Alberto Salazar.
A flier circulating among employees read, "Join us for a campus walk to celebrate what women bring to sport and to raise awareness of how Nike can support our female athletes and employees."
Employees marched Monday morning at the company's Beaverton, Ore., headquarters in an event not sanctioned by the company. Some held up placards saying, "Empower Women." Several senior executives joined the employees and engaged them in a dialogue, said people familiar with the event.
"We respect and welcome employees' feedback on matters that are important to them," a Nike spokesman said. "The flier prepared by some employees was not officially distributed by Nike."
Buildings on the sprawling Nike headquarters are named after famous athletes with Nike connections, including the golf great Tiger Woods and soccer star Mia Hamm. Mr. Salazar, a track coach whose name is on a large office building, has been suspended from the sport for four years on doping charges. Mr. Salazar has said he planned to appeal the doping ban. He has disputed allegations from some former female athletes that he has mistreated them.
Nike has been dealing with concerns about its workplace culture for more than a year. In early 2018, a group of women circulated a survey to protest inappropriate behavior by men at the sneaker company as well as pay disparity and gender imbalance in the top ranks. Later that year, Nike replaced several senior executives, and Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker apologized at an all-hands meeting, pledging to improve the workplace culture.
More recently, Mr. Salazar received a four-year suspension for orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct following an investigation by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.
The running prodigy Mary Cain told the New York Times recently that during her time with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr. Salazar's now-defunct elite training group, she missed her period for three years after coaches pressured her to lose weight.

Main Street: The 'Vindication' of James Comey

Texto completo: Will James Comey demand another apology?
The former Federal Bureau of Investigation director has always been at his most natural when most aggrieved. Within hours of the release of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report Monday, Mr. Comey had an op-ed up at the Washington Post.
In a tweet touting his piece, Mr. Comey put it this way: "So it was all lies. No treason. No spying on the campaign. No tapping Trumps wires. It was just good people trying to protect America."
This comes as no surprise to anyone who remembers when an earlier inspector general report called him "insubordinate" for having "intentionally concealed" from his Justice Department bosses his plans for a press conference exonerating Hillary Clinton of criminal wrongdoing over her use of a private email server to send classified material.
Mr. Comey's answer that time? An op-ed in the New York Times under the headline, "This Report Says I Was Wrong. But That's Good for the F.B.I."
Then, in August 2019, Mr. Horowitz's office released still another report, this one dealing with Mr. Comey's leaking of memos detailing confidential conversations he'd had with President Trump. In addition to highlighting Mr. Comey's dishonesty toward the FBI agents dispatched to his home to retrieve the memos, the inspector general scored Mr. Comey for setting "a dangerous example" for the bureau. Later Mr. Horowitz testified that he'd recommended Mr. Comey be prosecuted.
How did Mr. Comey respond? By ignoring the larger indictment of his FBI leadership and focusing only on Mr. Horowitz's finding that they'd unearthed no evidence Mr. Comey had leaked classified information. "I don't need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a 'sorry we lied about you' would be nice," Mr. Comey tweeted.
So another Comey tweet demanding yet another apology is entirely likely. And it points to the low bar Mr. Comey has now set for America's most prestigious law enforcement agency: Unless the conduct is criminal, anything goes.
In practice this means overlooking a great deal of ugly behavior. The following, culled from Mr. Horowitz's new report, is long but by no means exhaustive:
-- Even though Christopher Steele's dossier was full of material Mr. Comey himself characterized as "salacious and unverified," it played a "central and essential role" in the bureau's decision to seek a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
-- The FBI failed to inform Justice of "significant information that was available" but "was inconsistent with, or undercut," claims in the FISA applications that Mr. Page was "an agent of a foreign power."
-- The FBI ignored various warnings about Mr. Steele's political bias, and it took him at his word when he falsely told agents he wasn't the source for a Yahoo News article the FBI would cite in its application to the court.
-- Overall, the report identifies "at least 17 significant errors or omissions in the Carter Page FISA applications" -- for which investigators received no "satisfactory answers."
-- The FBI also didn't inform the FISA court that Mr. Page had served as a Central Intelligence Agency source and received a "positive assessment" for candor from the agency.
-- Mr. Comey pushed to include Mr. Steele's dossier in the Intelligence Community Assessment even though the CIA "expressed concern about the lack of vetting."
-- An FBI lawyer altered an email he'd received confirming Mr. Page had been a CIA source. After he changed it to read "not a source," the email was then used to help renew the FISA warrant on Mr. Page.
Mr. Horowitz lays the blame at the top: "We are deeply concerned that so many basic and fundamental errors were made by three separate, hand-picked investigative teams; on one of the most sensitive FBI investigations; after the matter had been briefed to the highest levels within the FBI; even though the information sought through use of FISA authority related so closely to an ongoing presidential campaign; and even though those involved with the investigation knew that their actions were likely to be subjected to close scrutiny. We believe this circumstance reflects a failure not just by those who prepared the FISA applications, but also by the managers and supervisors in the [investigation's] chain of command, including FBI senior officials who were briefed as the investigation progressed."
Mr. Comey's memoir, "A Higher Loyalty," relates how as FBI director he kept on his desk a copy of the October 1963 memo from J. Edgar Hoover asking for permission to wiretap Martin Luther King. He claims he did so to help ensure the bureau would never forget how a "legitimate counterintelligence mission . . . morphed into an unchecked, vicious campaign of harassment and extralegal attack."
Mr. Horowitz's findings about what was done under Mr. Comey's leadership suggest there's still a need for such a reminder. But maybe it should be a copy of the FISA applications for Carter Page the FBI sent to the court with false, misleading and incomplete information -- and Mr. Comey's signature.

We believe this circumstance reflects a failure not just by those who prepared the FISA applications, but also by the managers and supervisors in the [investigation's] chain of command, including FBI senior officials who were briefed as the investigation progressed."
Mr. Comey's memoir, "A Higher Loyalty," relates how as FBI director he kept on his desk a copy of the October 1963 memo from J. Edgar Hoover asking for permission to wiretap Martin Luther King. He claims he did so to help ensure the bureau would never forget how a "legitimate counterintelligence mission . . . morphed into an unchecked, vicious campaign of harassment and extralegal attack."
Mr. Horowitz's findings about what was done under Mr. Comey's leadership suggest there's still a need for such a reminder. But maybe it should be a copy of the FISA applications for Carter Page the FBI sent to the court with false, misleading and incomplete information—and Mr. Comey's signature.

Stop helping Vladimir Putin

Texto completo: Pretty much everyone acknowledges Russia’s malicious interference in the 2016 election. While we’re not convinced the interference swayed the election in any meaningful way, we should all be concerned about what happened and about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s plans for 2020. Our government, and even our media, will need to be on high alert to counter and deter future Russian interference in our elections.
But battling Putin’s disinformation is harder than it should be, and that's in part thanks to Democratic spin and media malpractice.
When Democrats pretend Putin’s only goal was and is to elect President Trump, or when they angrily deny that Ukraine’s leaders made any efforts on behalf of Hillary Clinton, they are weakening our ability to battle Putin.
Rep. Will Hurd, a Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, is a rare sober voice in Washington on this topic. Speaking with the Washington Examiner editorial board on Monday, Hurd stressed that the House Intelligence Committee hasn’t put enough focus on preventing 2020 election interference because it has been consumed with political charades.
“What were the Russians trying to do? They were trying to erode trust in our democratic institutions," he said. "They wanted the American public to question the media, to question whether anyone in government is worth anything. And they’re going to do it again. We haven’t focused on disinformation.”
Here we need to address the campaign of disinformation, or at least misinformation, by Democrats and the national media regarding Ukrainian efforts in 2016. Former presidential adviser Fiona Hill participated in this campaign when she alleged, finger pointed at Republicans, that “some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country, and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did.”
The first part of this isn’t true. Not a single Republican on the Intelligence Committee denies that Russia conducted such a campaign. But the second part is a rhetorical trick — a game of pretend, that anyone who says Ukraine tried to influence the 2016 election is thereby denying Russia’s role or are equating Ukraine’s interference with Russia’s much more extensive and elaborate interference.
The New York Times echoed this same carefully parsed line, setting fire to an assertion that literally no one is making, “that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election.”
Another example: When Clinton suggests her political rivals are Russian assets, this actually furthers Putin’s aims. “That kind of narrative feeds into what the Russians are trying to do,” Hurd said. “I guarantee you there was a [Russian officer] in Moscow that got a raise when Hillary Clinton said those things about Tulsi [Gabbard] and Bernie Sanders. It continues to perpetuate this lack of trust, and that is the ultimate goal of the Russian government.”
Although Putin must have preferred a Trump victory to the widely expected Clinton victory, he was surely even more thrilled by the Democrats' reaction, which was to begin working for impeachment even before Trump had taken the inaugural stage. "The campaign to impeach President Trump has begun" was the headline of a Washington Post story that published at 12:19 p.m. on Inauguration Day.
Putin is working hard to make Americans more cynical and skeptical about their government, their institutions, their political parties, and their leaders. When the media and politicians mislead the public about Russia's aims for political gain, they are only helping Putin achieve his ends.

Texto completo: The Saudi national who opened fire at a Navy base in Florida was outraged at his peers who slapped him with the nickname “Porn Stash.”
Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, 21, opened fire, killing three and wounding seven, at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida. Alshamrani was named as the presumed terrorist on Friday, but he was known by a different name on the base: "Porn Stash."
The accused terrorist sported a thick mustache similar to the facial hair of many adult film stars.
Alshamrani was “infuriated” after a meteorology instructor, James Day, called him “Porn Stash” during class in front of nearly a dozen other students. The Saudi national filed a complaint with his superior officer about the public mockery.
“I was infuriated as to why he would say that in front of the class,” Alshamrani said in the complaint obtained by the New York Times. “Laughing, he continued to ask, ‘What? Have you not seen a porn star before? After I did not respond, he just let go of the subject.”
The incident took place more than seven months ago, and the FBI does not believe the nickname was the basis for the shooting. Day’s employer noted that they had no updates related to the situation because it had been handled and closed in April. Day had offered to apologize to Alshamrani, but the gunman declined and requested to be reassigned to a different instructor, which he was.
Authorities have presumed that the shooting as an “act of terror” and Saudi officials have been retracing Alshamrani’s steps to see if he had been radicalized during a visit to the Middle East in February.

Checking Trump on libel law, prison

Texto completo: At a NATO summit in London, President Donald Trump took aim at one of his adversaries back across the pond: House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a key figure in the inquiry into impeaching the president.
Trump has repeatedly referred back to the time when Schiff paraphrased Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — an event at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.
Trump has portrayed Schiff’s words as a fabrication that twisted what he said and in a press conference at the NATO summit, Trump once again attacked Schiff over his remarks, suggesting that Schiff could be arrested for what he said.
“This guy (Schiff) is sick,” Trump said. “He made up the conversation. He lied. If he didn’t do that in the halls of Congress, he’d be thrown in jail. He did it in the halls of Congress, he’s given immunity. This is a sick person. He’s a liar.”
We found it hard to believe that, outside of the walls of Congress, someone who fabricated and lied would be “thrown in jail.” Experts said there is something to what Trump is saying that deserves explanation, but ultimately he’s still wrong that Schiff could be subject to prosecution, even if he wasn’t in Congress. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.)
The Speech or Debate Clause
Trump has a point that members of Congress have special speech protections that members of the general public do not.
The Constitution’s “Speech or Debate Clause” says that “for any Speech or Debate in either House, (Senators and Representatives) shall not be questioned in any other Place.”
“The Speech or Debate Clause protects legislators from all criminal prosecutions or civil lawsuits for legislative conduct, broadly understood as anything within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity and necessary to the deliberative process,” said Howard M. Wasserman, a law professor at Florida International University. “This includes the sort of legislative oversight and investigation in which Schiff is engaged when discussing that phone call.”
Can fabrication or libel be punished criminally?
The vast majority of libel or slander cases are civil rather than criminal, said Leonard Niehoff, a University of Michigan law professor. This means the speaker’s money could be at risk if they lose a libel or slander case, but they would not be imprisoned.
However, criminal libel laws of one kind or another do exist on the books in almost half the states. According to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Committee to Protect Journalists, two dozen states have criminal libel laws.
The Supreme Court ruled in the 1964 case Garrison vs. Louisiana that the standard for criminal conviction is the same as in the landmark case from the same year, New York Times vs. Sullivan, that addresses civil libel cases. “The prosecution must prove falsity and actual malice, beyond a reasonable doubt,” Wasserman said.
Some of today’s 24 state laws wouldn’t be relevant to the Schiff example. The laws in Illinois and Texas only cover slanders against financial institutions, while the one in Massachusetts concerns hate speech based on race or other classifications. Three others specifically exclude imprisonment as a possible sentence.
In addition, the Committee to Protect Journalists cites court cases in seven of these states that would seem to make these laws unconstitutional today, meaning that their existence on the books is archaic.
In addition, such laws “would likely be deemed unconstitutional under the First Amendment if they were applied,” said Roy S. Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.
Importantly for Schiff’s case, there’s no criminal libel statute for the District of Columbia, or an equivalent federal statute. Nor is there one in Schiff’s home state of California.
“So even if Schiff’s summaries of the conversations were knowingly false and he were not immune, I am not sure what law he could be prosecuted under,” Wasserman said.
Our ruling
Trump said Schiff “made up the conversation. He lied. If he didn’t do that in the halls of Congress, he’d be thrown in jail. He did it in the halls of Congress, he’s given immunity.”
We rate the statement False.

China's Claim That Detainees in Xinjiang Have 'Graduated' Draws Skepticism; Rights activists are dubious about the assertion made by a top regional official, delivered in a rare Beijing news conference

Texto completo: BEIJING—A top official in China's heavily policed majority-Muslim northwest region of Xinjiang said those detained in a controversial deradicalization program have graduated, drawing broad skepticism from human-rights activists.
The rare news conference in the nation's capital on Monday by senior officials of Xinjiang was a response to growing international pressure on the Chinese government to defend its policies in the region. Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to sanction officials involved in the crackdown, spurred in part by the publication of purported leaked government documents.
Scholars estimate that more than one million Turkic Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities have been detained in extrajudicial re-education centers in Xinjiang over the past few years, where deaths and torture have been reported. The government says the program is necessary to counter violent extremism, while Western government officials largely condemn it as a human-rights abuse.
Shohrat Zakir, who as governor of Xinjiang is the region's No. 2 official behind Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, said all students in the centers studying Mandarin, law, vocational skills and deradicalization have graduated. The suggestion that the re-education-camp system had been shut down was disputed by scholars and activists, who cautioned that the government has many other mechanisms for extrajudicial detention, and that it is unlikely to mean all Xinjiang's detainees have been released.
Maya Wang, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, called Mr. Zakir's announcement ambiguous because it included no details on the number of centers and how many people had been in them, and to where they were released.
"Without any of that information, it's really difficult to evaluate the claim that they have all been released," she said. "The government had repeatedly denied that these camps existed, so what it says now is not very credible."
Mr. Zakir said a voluntary skills-training program would be launched for officials, villagers and unemployed residents across Xinjiang, which he said would offer independent choices of fields of study and allow people to come and go freely.
Adrian Zenz, a German researcher who has been critical of China's governance in Xinjiang, said that although the official line that all detainees had graduated was questionable, it showed that officials are feeling the heat. "What we've known all along is they do care about their reputation," he said, referring to the central government.
Beijing has reacted furiously since the House passed its bill last week calling for sanctions against Xinjiang officials. In its highest-level response, China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday that the U.S. had seriously violated international relations and demanded that it correct its mistakes.
Compounding the pressure are two caches of leaked Chinese-government documents that purport to outline details of the detention program, which were published separately last month by the New York Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists . Mr. Pompeo described the documents as confirmation of "very significant" human-rights abuses by the Chinese government.
Asked at the news conference about the documents, Xu Hairong, the party chief of Xinjiang's capital city of Urumqi, declined to confirm the authenticity of the papers, instead deriding the accompanying news reports as being malicious in nature.
Discussion among multinationals about whether to continue doing business in Xinjiang has been growing , and some have dropped suppliers in the region in the past year.
"The companies, like my own, we are very concerned," said Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China and the chief representative in China of German chemical giant BASF SE. BASF has a chemical plant that it set up with a local partner in Korla, a city in Xinjiang.
European companies should better monitor suppliers and customers, he said at an event on Monday in Beijing.
In recent days, the Chinese government has sought to remind the public of violent terrorist attacks over the years in Xinjiang, arguing that the harsh crackdown was necessary to fight terrorism. This push has included the release of graphic footage of car bombings and knife attacks, which are otherwise rarely shown publicly in China.

Free show lifting spirits of veterans Opera Orlando offering special performance

Texto completo: Free tickets for veterans to Opera Orlando's production of the Christmas musical "All Is Calm" sounded like a good idea to Gabriel Preisser.
"We wanted to do something for veterans," said Preisser, the opera's executive and artistic director - and, after all, "All Is Calm" is about real soldiers' experiences. "We thought it would be nice if 200 people came."
Instead, 1,700 veterans responded to the invitation - prompting Opera Orlando to add a special vet-only performance and make plans to squeeze the special guests into rehearsals leading up to the show's debut at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
"I just didn't want to turn all those people away," Preisser said.
Written by Peter Rothstein, "All Is Calm" tells the story of the Christmas Truce of 1914. During World War I, Allied and German soldiers put down their weapons and climbed out of their battle trenches on Christmas Eve to briefly celebrate the holiday.
"The heroes of this story are the lowest of the ranks - the young, the hungry, the cold, and the optimistic - those who acted with great courage to put down their guns, overcoming a fear that placed a gun in their hands in the first place," Rothstein writes on the show's official website. "Their story puts a human face on war, and that's the story I hope to tell."
Letters home from actual soldiers provide the show's dialogue. And a cappella singing provides a haunting soundtrack to the effects of war. Critics raved after the show made its off-Broadway debut in 2018. The New York Times named it a Critic's Pick, and described it as "a beautiful musical recounting of a World War I cease-fire of gifts, poetry and melody."
Preisser has a theory on why the show has struck a chord.
"There's something really special about a male a cappella singing" - singing without any instrumental accompaniment, he said. "And obviously, there's something very special about the Christmas truce itself."
Although the play's soldiers are from a hundred years ago, today's veterans should find them relatable.
"The show was just eye-opening to me, thinking about how those young men got in that situation," Preisser said. "Think about being a 19-year-old boy, putting on a uniform, experiencing the pageantry and thinking you'd come home in three weeks as a hero. It was all glory and honor - it was all romanticized."
In reality, the bloody war would drag on for four years. The overwhelming response also surprised Andrea N. Madrazo, a public-affairs specialist for the Orlando VA Medical Center. Preisser had enlisted her help to reach veterans.
"I didn't think it would be that high," Madrazo said. "They've been coming in to get their tickets. We are very appreciative."
Those with experience in the armed forces often enjoy entertainment with a military theme, Madrazo said: "It really draws veterans in."
"Opera Orlando has lifted my spirits and gets me more in the mood for the holidays - and shows they care," said Robert Hughes, an Air Force veteran. "Thank you for spreading cheer and joy for us."
Opera Orlando has a history of offering free tickets during the holiday season. Its touring production of "Amahl and the Night Visitors" - a short opera about the journey of the Three Kings to see baby Jesus - gives free tickets to children at many locations. The city of Clermont sponsored a completely free performance of the show at its performing-arts center this month.
Adding the extra performance of "All Is Calm" for veterans will cost Opera Orlando about $7,000, Preisser said, but he's not focused on the expense.
"During the holiday season, given that we're a nonprofit and we're part of this community, we wanted to find a way to give back," he said. "We're going to lose a little money on this, but it's worth it."

BIDEN'S ACE IN THE HOLE VOTERS HAVE A THIRST FOR NOSTALGIA

Texto completo: I like the word malarkey, consarn it. It's the bee's knees. Sure, the youngsters might say, "OK, Boomer" on hearing Joe Biden utter the word, but if you think he's all wet for using it, you can take your phonus bolonus and tell it to Sweeney.
Mr. Biden has never really been my cup of tea. There's always seemed to be a bit of flimflam behind that gigglemug of his. And for a guy who uses the word malarkey more than any politician since the 19th century - and has now emblazoned the slogan "No Malarkey" on his campaign bus - he's peddled a lot of it over the years. But he remains popular among a lot of Democrats for the same reason people like the word malarkey: nostalgia, which can be a powerful force in an election.
While I'm prone to nostalgia myself, I'm fairly immune to Biden nostalgia. So are the hep cats of Twitter and Instagram, who have an outsize role in the Democratic primary process. Most of the Twitterati weren't even twinkles in their father's eye when Mr. Biden first ran for the Senate, and it's no surprise they don't get his appeal.
But if Donald Trump taught us anything, it should be that the opinions of smarty pants don't amount to a hill of beans compared with the opinions of voters. Mr. Trump's "Make America Great Again" campaign was soaked with balderdash. He promised to balance the budget, cut taxes, spend wildly and save money in the process. He promised to fix the economy by putting China in its place and bringing back manufacturing. For nostalgic Republican voters, though, Mr. Trump's vision evoked just the sort of mythical past they aspired to inhabit one day. And it was a plus that Mr. Trump caused the self-righteous press to huff and puff their outrage as they declared him incapable of victory.
Mr. Biden benefits from a similar dynamic. The handicappers keep fitting him for a pine overcoat, but the voters haven't gotten the memo.
As Bloomberg columnist Ramesh Ponnuru writes, "The only thing Joe Biden has had going for him in this race is Democratic primary voters." Mr. Biden has flubbed debates and failed to convince wealthy members of his party to open their wallets. But despite a barrage of negative press, he remains popular with a lot of voters, particularly older ones.
Nostalgia is Mr. Biden's trump card. For some voters, it's not nostalgia for the good old days of the 1950s or the 1920s but for the Obama years - which is why Mr. Biden mentions Barack Obama like a verbal punctuation mark. But the former vice president also appeals to a deeper nostalgia.
For moderate voters who think things have gone haywire under Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden represents a kind of return to normalcy, to a time when partisan politics weren't quite as lethal. He may be as prone to malapropisms and misstatements as Mr. Trump, but his folksy fumbling is a known quantity, a relic from a more predictable time.
Mr. Biden is also reassuring to Democratic voters who still think they're good liberals in the tradition of FDR, LBJ and Bill Clinton, and who honestly think their party is veering off the rails. They're the voters who aren't interested in who's tweeting what or what's trending in search engines, and there are a lot of them. A recent pre-obituary of the Kamala Harris campaign in The New York Times noted that many of the younger members of her team thought Twitter was the best place to figure out what voters really care about.
This doesn't mean everything is copacetic for Mr. Biden. But he's doing better than the wiseacres seem to think. He's up 11 points over the field nationally, nine in Nevada and 19 in South Carolina. In New Hampshire and Iowa, he's slipped considerably and is now running in fourth place. But it's still easy to imagine he could win in those states or pull off a close second. Bill Clinton came in second in New Hampshire in 1992 and, thanks to his gift for tooting his own horn, was dubbed "The Comeback Kid."
If Hoosier moppet Pete Buttigieg wins in Iowa and Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins in New Hampshire as a "favorite daughter" from neighboring Massachusetts, that wouldn't be ideal for Mr. Biden. But if he were to come in second in both places, which doesn't seem unlikely, he could still be rolling in clover, and that's no malarkey.

The weak case for impeachment and why it might backfire

Texto completo: It was Gerald R. Ford who said, “an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.”
Ford said that in 1970, and he wasn’t talking about President Richard Nixon. He was proposing the impeachment of a Supreme Court justice.
Then-Congressman Ford, the House Republican leader, “touched off an angry floor debate,” according to a New York Times report, “by suggesting that Justice William O. Douglas might have had ties with gambling and underworld figures.” Ford said the 71-year-old justice was “unfit and should be removed.” He accused Douglas of espousing “hippie-yippie style revolution” in his writings.
The House Judiciary Committee investigated for six months, but there never was a trial in the Senate. Justice Douglas served on the Court until his retirement in 1975. Then it was Gerald R. Ford who appointed his successor, having become president in 1974 when Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment.
Although it may seem that impeachment is a rare occurrence, the subject comes up often in American political history.
“The Framers foresaw that impeachment might be subject to superheated partisanship,” wrote Harvard Law School professor Raoul Berger in his 1973 book, “Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems.” Berger noted that the impeachment of President Harry Truman was suggested during the Korean War, there were repeated demands for Nixon’s impeachment over the war in Vietnam and John F. Kennedy believed that “if he had not moved to expel Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba at the time of the confrontation with Khrushchev, he ‘would have been impeached.’”
Dive into the scholarly research or take Jerry Ford’s word for it: An impeachable offense is whatever the House says it is, and conviction is whatever two-thirds of the Senate “considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office.”
The House of Representatives can impeach President Donald Trump, even if he didn’t commit any crime. Impeachment trials are nothing like criminal trials. After an impeachment trial, the prosecutors and the jury have to stand trial themselves—in their next election.
One-third of the United States Senate and every member of the House of Representatives will be on the ballot in November 2020, unless they’ve chosen not to run for re-election or somebody knocks them out in a primary.
Impeachment is politically risky, yet House Democrats are pursuing it at the frantic pace of a Keystone Kops chase. The Intelligence Committee’s 300-page impeachment report is a rush job that draws heavily on the opinions and impressions of bureaucratic specialists who clearly are appalled that the president isn’t relying on their advice.
This type of conflict between bureaucratic experts and elected leaders isn’t new. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan sent a handwritten letter to Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, which is on display at the Reagan Library. A sign next to the letter reads, “Despite the State Department’s many attempts to change it, the President finally demanded that his own personal draft be sent to Brezhnev accompanied by the State Department’s thoughts in a separate document.”
Imagine the news headlines that House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff’s leaky crew could have made from that.
They certainly puffed up the importance of government workers who were never elected by anybody. “NSC staff had prepared a standard package of talking points for the President based on official U.S. policy,” the Intelligence Committee report states in a section titled, “The President’s Misconduct.” The talking points “included recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine,” which was “a pillar of American foreign policy in the country” going all the way back to “the 1990s” but — cue the dramatic music — “this call would deviate significantly from that script.”
Of course, the president has a perfect right to deviate from the staff’s script and to make changes in the policy, but House Democrats, most of them, contend that Trump was motivated by the desire for personal political advantage.
Here’s what Trump said to the president of Ukraine: “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”
And also, “I would like [Rudy Giuliani] to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.”
And also, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.”
In all three of those excerpts, Trump is asking Zelensky to work with the attorney general of the United States, William Barr. The AG is heading up an investigation into the suspicious origins of the Trump-Russia story that was used to justify a secret counter-intelligence investigation, then a secret warrant to spy on an American who was an adviser to the Trump campaign and then a two-year investigation by a special prosecutor that ultimately found nothing that linked Trump to Russia.
Barr’s investigation follows a narrower investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. The IG has jurisdiction to investigate current employees of the government, but lacks wider authority. Still, Horowitz’s report is expected to shed light on the actions of FBI employees and others who made questionable decisions to investigate Trump during the 2016 campaign.
The report is set for release on Monday, Dec. 9.
Is it possible that the Democrats’ noisy rush to impeachment is a massive misdirection to neutralize the damage from coming reports about the actions of officials during the Obama administration?
We’ll see. Meanwhile, the signs of political damage are beginning to appear.
On Thursday evening, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a one-hour televised town-hall meeting on CNN. Thirty-four minutes in, she was pleading with the audience, “Could we not have any more questions about impeachment?”
By November, that may be the Democrats’ campaign slogan.

As the number of abortions continues to fall, support for abortion rights is soaring

Texto completo: Abortion is in decline.
In a report issued last month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the number of abortions among women ages 15-44 dropped by 24% in the most recent 10-year window for which they have data (2007 through 2016 ), and the abortion rate -- the number of abortions per 1,000 women -- fell 26%.
These results track closely with the results of research conducted by the Guttmacher Institute, an organization that advocates for abortion rights and surveys a different set of providers. Guttmacher's figures show the abortion rate trending steadily downward from 1981, when it peaked at 29.3 per 1,000 women, to 13.5 in 2017. That's a 54% drop in 36 years.
That's good.
Even those of us who are ardent supporters of abortion rights recognize that unintended, unwanted or medically fraught pregnancies are distressing, and that terminating them is emotionally complicated.
Better still is evidence that suggests the reason abortion is in decline is because unintended pregnancy is in decline -- better and more responsible use of improved contraceptive methods -- and not because of the spread of state laws designed to make legal abortions more difficult to nearly impossible to obtain.
If the drop in the number of abortions was the result of laws that coerced women to carry their pregnancies to term against their will or even of successful proselytizing by foes of abortion rights, you'd expect to see a rise in the overall birthrate. But in fact, a National Vital Statistics System report issued last month shows U.S. birthrates have been trending downward since the late 1990s, and in 2018, birthrates among supposedly sexually irresponsible teens hit a record low of recent decades, down 72% from their peak in 1991.
My thought was that these positive developments might be having the unintended effect of diminishing political support for abortion rights. I know that part of the reason I have always backed abortion rights is that, coming into young adulthood in the late '70s and early '80s, I knew many young women who had abortions -- women who believed that carrying an unintended pregnancy to term would derail their lives; women of great character who did not choose abortion lightly but who generally went on later to have children and careers.
Conventional wisdom is that familiarity breeds support. It's widely thought that the gay rights movement advanced as rapidly as it did because as more and more LGBTQ people publicly acknowledged their sexuality, more and more straight people realized that gay people were their co-workers, neighbors, friends, relatives and siblings, not "the other," and deserved rights and respect.
So as abortion rates continue to decline, fewer and fewer people will have a personal connection to the issue and it seems logical that support will wane.
I found only two polls to shed light on this supposition. One was a 1989 New York Times/CBS News survey that found a 19 percentage point gap (58% to 39%) between support for legal abortion among those who knew a woman who'd had an abortion and those who didn't. The other was a Pew Research Center poll in August that found a 7 percentage point gap (64% to 57%).
"We have heaps of anecdotal evidence that knowing someone who has had an abortion -- especially a close relative like a mother, sister, girlfriend or aunt -- tends to make people more pro-choice," said Eric Scheidler, executive director of the Chicago-based Pro-Life Action League, when I asked him about this. Though he said he had no other survey data on the point, "the pro-life movement acts on the belief that this is the case."
But for whatever reason, polls taken this year show political support for abortion rights has not fallen along with abortion rates.
An ABC News/Washington Post poll released in July found 27% support for the idea that abortion should be "legal in all cases " -- the highest in the history of the poll dating back to 1996. Add in the "legal in most cases" responses and the total favorability number was 60%, again the highest in the history of the poll. Support for "illegal in all cases" was at 14%, a 12-year low.
A Pew Research Center poll released in August found even slightly higher support -- 61% total support for legal abortion in all (27%) or most (34%) cases. Pew also found 70% opposition to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that established abortion as a constitutional right in most cases, up from 63% opposition in 2013.
An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released in June found 34% support for the idea that abortion should be "legal in all cases" and another 22% of respondents saying the procedure should be "legal most of the time," a 56% level of support that marked "a record high for the survey," according to NBC.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released in May found 58% support for allowing abortion in most or all cases, up from 50% when Reuters/Ipsos asked the same question just 10 months earlier.
A Gallup poll released in June found 52% of respondents identifying as "pro-choice" (in favor of abortion rights) and 43% identifying as "pro-life" (opposed to abortion rights). It was the highest number since 2006, though "similar to the findings when the question has been asked this way since 2001," Gallup reported.
Who knows all the reasons why. But a solid majority of Americans seem to be standing up for abortion rights, even in the abstract, against the legal onslaught from the minority that would deny women those rights.
That's also good.

Re: Tweets
The winner of this week's reader poll to select the funniest tweet was, "You think Putin ever wishes we would put up more of a fight, to make it more challenging? I mean, wrecking America shouldn't be a Monday crossword puzzle," by Peter Sagal (@petersagal), host of NPR's "Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me." Shortly after I posted the poll, Sagal appealed to his nearly 228,000 followers, "Longtime readers will know how much I desperately care about this silly contest. Vote as if my fragile ego depended on it." And they did!
The poll appears midweek at chicagotribune.com/zorn, and you can receive an alert when it's posted by signing up for the Change of Subject email newsletter at chicagotribune.com/newsletters.

Texto completo: Working out on an empty stomach could amplify the health benefits of the activity, according to a well-timed new study of the interplay of meal timing, metabolic health and moving. The study, which involved sedentary men and moderate cycling, suggests that whether and when we eat may affect how exercise affects us.
In general, any exercise improves our health. But a wealth of recent science and personal experience indicates that different people can respond to similar exercise routines in different ways. Even if everyone completes the same amount of exercise, some people become more fit than others, or lose more weight, or gain greater control of their blood sugar.
Most exercise scientists say that our genetics, diets, physiques, temperaments and other subtle aspects of our lives act in concert to shape how our bodies react to exercise.
But some researchers suspect meal timing matters as well. Working muscles need fuel during exercise, mostly in the form of sugar (glucose) or fat. That fuel can come from our most recent meal, once its component sugars and fats reach our bloodstreams, or from our bodies’ stores of fats and sugars. We all have such stores, especially of fat, some of it residing in our muscles and marbling them like pricey sirloin.
This muscle fat becomes problematic if we accumulate too much of it. Fatty muscles do not respond well to the hormone insulin, which directs sugar from the blood into the muscles. As a result, excess fat can contribute to insulin resistance, high blood sugar levels and increased risks for Type 2 diabetes and other metabolic conditions.
So, researchers at the University of Bath in England and other institutions began to wonder whether meal timing might influence how much muscle fat we burn during exercise, which would then affect the long-term metabolic consequences of exercise and help to explain, in part, why some people get more out of exercise than others.
To look into those issues, they recruited 30 overweight, sedentary men. (They plan to do a follow-up study with women.) The researchers tested the men’s fitness and insulin sensitivity and then divided them into three groups.
One, as a control, continued their usual lives. The other two groups started supervised exercise in the morning three times a week, riding stationary bicycles at a moderate pace while wearing monitors and masks that tracked their heart rates and the amount of fat and sugar they burned. The researchers also asked them periodically how they felt while riding.
One exercise group also downed a vanilla-flavored shake two hours before the ride (with no other breakfast) while the other group swallowed a similar-tasting placebo drink, containing water, flavoring and no calories. In other words, the placebo group rode on an empty stomach, but did not know it.
After exercise, each rider received the drink he had not previously swallowed. The riders who had fasted got the shake and the other group the placebo.
This routine continued for six weeks. Afterward, the scientists crunched numbers and turned up some telling differences between the groups. As expected, the control group’s fitness and insulin sensitivity remained the same, while the men in both exercise groups had improved their fitness and narrowed their waistlines, although few had lost weight.
The riders who had pedaled on an empty stomach, however, had incinerated about twice as much fat during each ride as the men who consumed the shake first. The riders all had burned about the same number of calories while pedaling, but more of those calories came from fat when the men did not eat first.
Those riders also showed greater improvements in insulin sensitivity at the end of the study and had developed higher levels of certain proteins in their muscles that influence how well muscle cells respond to insulin and use blood sugar.
On the whole, these findings suggest that “you can probably get more out of your workout without increasing its intensity or duration by exercising before breakfast,” said Javier Gonzalez, a professor of physiology and nutrition at the University of Bath, who oversaw the new study, which appeared in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.
The reasons for this extra metabolic boost are complex but most likely involve slimming of muscle fat, he said. The fasted riders’ bodies had to turn to internal energy stores for fuel, including fat from their muscles. (Interestingly, the fasted riders did not feel as if their workouts were more draining than the other group, according to subjective ratings of their exertions.)
This study looked primarily at insulin sensitivity, though, and not other aspects of exercise and metabolism, including weight loss. (Other research by some of the same investigators have looked at how eating before exercise may affect appetite.) The researchers also could not tell whether skipping lunch before an early-evening workout would have the same effects, although it seemed likely, Gonzalez said.
“We believe that the key is the fasting period, rather than the time of day,” he said.
So, if you hope to use exercise to keep you healthy in the coming holiday period, you might try to get up and out early or after not eating for hours. But, Gonzalez said, if your schedule or preferences prevent you from exercising in the morning or on an empty stomach, do not sweat it.
“Any physical activity,” he said, whenever you can fit it in, “is better than none.”

Texto completo: We'll always have Paris. But please spare us the wealth tax.
The past three years have been hard ones for the United States, especially for anyone who cares about good governance, democratic decency and the fate of open societies.
But there's been one bright spot: an economy that defies expert predictions by continuing to deliver jobs, growth, dividends and higher wages. We were reminded of this again on Friday, with news that the economy added 266,000 new jobs last month, bringing unemployment to a 50-year low.
That being so, maybe now is not the best time for Democratic candidates to suggest we turn ourselves into an economic facsimile of France.
That's my way of reading a useful report from The Times's Jim Tankersley, who on Thursday described the ways in which Elizabeth Warren and other progressives are trying to upend decades of economic thinking by insisting that sharp tax hikes on businesses and the wealthy would accelerate growth, not depress it. Under a Warren presidency, those hikes would be accompanied by monumental increases in government spending and fundamental alterations to the structures of the private economy.
Tankersley's piece coincided with a fresh round of nationwide strikes in France, where at least 800,000 people took to the streets to protest Emmanuel Macron's attempts to modernize the country's byzantine public pension systems. At least one of these plans -- there are 42 in all -- dates to the reign of Louis XIV, and some kick in when workers retire in their fifties, costing the state an ever-mounting fortune as average lifespans get longer.
Successive French administrations of both the left and right have been trying to reform this and other aspects of the country's statist economy for decades, with limited results. Social benefits, once given, are hard to pare, much less withdraw. Hence the frequent strikes: Since 1789, French governments have been acutely sensitive to mass protests, and too often have capitulated to them.
Hence also France's perennial economic crisis.
The country's unemployment rate has not fallen below 7 percent since 1983 and is now at 8.6 percent. Long-term unemployment exceeds 40 percent, compared with 13.3 percent in the U.S. The country's annual growth rate has barely exceeded an average of 1 percent per year since the 21st century began. It's expected to come in at 1.3 percent for this year.
As of last year, the median monthly take-home pay was just $ 1,930, meaning half of all French workers make even less. It's why the country erupted in protest when Macron proposed raising fuel taxes a few cents per liter.
How much of this is a matter of the French making different, arguably better, choices when it comes to balancing work and leisure? Surely some. And how much of it is made up for by quality public services, strong worker protections, and fewer economic inequalities? Some, too.
Then again, the health service that used to be the toast of Francophiles is overwhelmed, understaffed, and "on the brink of collapse," according to a report in The Guardian. French universities, while cheap, are overcrowded, underfunded, and notoriously mediocre: "Too easy to get in and too easy to get out," as one local observer put it. French workers exercise their right to strike roughly seven times more frequently than German workers do, and 125 times more than Swiss ones.
As for income inequality, France is certainly much less unequal than the U.S. But France's top 1 percent still held 22 percent of the country's wealth at the beginning of 2018. That was despite a draconian effort by the previous Socialist government to impose a super-tax on high earners. It raised scant revenue while accelerating the exodus of the rich. Like many European attempts at imposing a wealth tax, it was quickly repealed.
All of this should stand as a stark warning to Democrats. France has the highest overall tax take among O.E.C.D. countries (46.9 percent of G.D.P.), the highest rate of government spending, (56.38 percent of G.D.P.), the highest rate of safety-net spending, and the third highest rate of pension spending.
Whatever else all this taxing and spending might be doing, it's clearly not creating jobs or prosperity. As for making people happy, France doesn't break the top 20 in this year's World Happiness Report. Even Mexico ranks higher.
I don't mean this column to be relentlessly negative about France, a great nation with an almost unsurpassed depth of culture and capacity for excellence. If anything, it's a tribute to the French that they continue to punch above their weight in so many fields, when the weight of the state lies so heavily on their backs.
But as far as models go, the story of France's economy in the past 40 years is mostly one of bad turns, thwarted hopes, and forgone opportunities. Americans should not imagine that we can walk down that same familiar cul-de-sac and not hit the same dismal dead end.

Lawsuit Objects to a Rule Aimed at Visa Applicants

Texto completo: Visa applicants must disclose their social media user names, a rule that grew out of Trump's vow of "extreme vetting" of foreign visitors. A new lawsuit objects.
WASHINGTON -- A pair of documentary film organizations sued the Trump administration on Thursday over its requirement that foreigners disclose their social media accounts -- including pseudonymous ones -- when they apply for visas.
The lawsuit, which raises novel issues about privacy and surveillance in the social-media era, challenged a rule the State Department put into effect this year. The requirement grew out of President Trump's campaign promise of "extreme vetting" and his early executive orders that barred travel into the United States from several Muslim-majority nations.
In particular, the lawsuit argues, forcing people from authoritarian countries to disclose the pseudonyms they use to discuss politically sensitive matters could endanger them by creating a risk that the information gets back to their own governments. As a result, it said, they will be less likely either to express themselves on social media or to apply for visas.
"Many people use pseudonyms on social media so that they can speak anonymously about sensitive or controversial issues, and so that they can shield themselves or their families or associates from possible reprisals by state or private actors," the plaintiffs wrote. "The registration requirement effectively conditions their eligibility for U.S. visas on their readiness to surrender their online anonymity."
The Trump administration announced the rule in 2018 and started enforcing it this year. The State Department changed its visa application forms to require applicants to disclose all identifiers they have used on any of 20 social media platforms for the past five years, including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The rule covers about 14.7 million people who apply for a visa each year.
The complaint, filed in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, challenged both the State Department, which administers visa applications, and the Department of Homeland Security, which it says uses visa application data for other purposes, including administering immigration law.
The Trump administration did not immediately comment on the lawsuit. But in a pair of postings, Twitter expressed opposition to the State Department rule, saying it chilled free speech.
The complaint maintains that administration officials improperly developed the rule -- arguing that they failed to point to evidence that it would be effective and necessary -- and that it violates the Constitution by chilling rights of free speech and association.
Visa applicants "must consider the risk that a U.S. official will misinterpret their speech on social media, impute others' speech to them, or subject them to additional scrutiny or delayed processing because of the views they or their contacts have expressed," the lawsuit said.
Demanding the data also creates the risk that authoritarian and other rights-abusing governments, "including some U.S. allies," may use it to unmask anonymous dissidents, it said.
"Those who use pseudonymous identifiers must take into account that they will have to relinquish their online anonymity to U.S. officials when they submit their visa applications, and they must also consider the risk that U.S. officials will disclose their social media identifiers to foreign governments, reveal the identifiers inadvertently, or fail to protect the identifiers from third parties who might access them unlawfully."
The lawsuit was jointly developed by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. They are representing the two documentary film organizations -- Doc Society, based in Brooklyn, and the International Documentary Association, based in Los Angeles -- that host conferences and workshops that bring foreign filmmakers and social activists to American soil.
While most of the people affected by the new rule are foreigners abroad, who generally do not have constitutional rights, the lawsuit noted that the requirement also covers people with substantial ties to the United States, including people already residing on domestic soil -- like foreign students and foreigners with work permits -- who renew their visas while abroad.
Since the change took effect, visa applicants from abroad have been compelled to disclose to American consular officials all social-media handles or user names they have used on major platforms, 12 of which are based in the United States: Facebook, Flickr, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Myspace, Pinterest, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Vine and YouTube.
The forms also ask about a Russian service, VK; a Belgian one, Twoo; a Latvian one, Ask.fm; and five Chinese sites: Douban, QQ, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo and Youku.
The forms do not require applicants to turn over their passwords to see nonpublic information. But the complaint stresses the risk created by forcing people to turn over pseudonymous accounts, citing partners of the plaintiffs who have used them to "conduct sensitive research for a film about Nazis online, including joining discussion groups and contacting members of known Nazis' families" and a member from Syria who "uses pseudonymous accounts as a safety measure against political persecution."
The lawsuit said some partners and members of the plaintiffs are now self-censoring, including deleting old posts that criticized the Trump administration's policies. Others "are no longer applying for U.S. visas -- and are forgoing personal, educational, and professional opportunities" because they fear the consequences of disclosing their social media accounts.
"The government simply has no legitimate interest in collecting this kind of sensitive information on this immense scale, and the First Amendment doesn't permit it to do so," said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight Institute.

Texto completo: “Get back to business!” With this tweet, President Trump directed his secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer, to stop the naval officers charged with oversight of the SEALs from disciplining one of their own. That order was confirmed the next Monday by Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and over the following weekend, Mr. Spencer was fired.
There are three problems with Mr. Trump’s action. The first is that it is very much the Navy’s business — and every military’s business — to maintain, as the military so often recites and Mr. Spencer put it in his final letter to the president, “good order and discipline.” In conducting their “business,” our military services are not and must not be commanded in support of political ends, as Mr. Trump was apparently doing here.
How the president chooses to value order and discipline in his White House, and if at all, is of real concern to all Americans. But the military is not an extension of his White House. Some may argue that all actions by a president may have some political component, yet instead of constraining that component, this action by this president celebrates and encourages it.
The second problem intensifies the first. Contamination from the president’s approach is amplified when his judgment is largely shaped by television commentators and his decision announced by tweet. The military has well-established procedures for assuring good order and discipline. They begin by eliciting a judgment by peers. No one is as well positioned to balance the exigencies of combat and the demands of law and ethics as a panel of fellow sailors, Marines, airmen or soldiers.
Wise presidents let those who have made the sacrifices of combat — and who depend upon one another in combat — state first what they conclude. Such presidents provide opportunity for senior military officers and relevant civilians to add perspectives. They may not, in the end, agree. But to say at the beginning that the president mandates one and only one outcome deprecates the value of the SEALs’ judgment.
Finally, there is the judgment itself. An American service member shared a photograph of himself with a corpse along with the message: “I have got a cool story for you when I get back. I have got my knife skills on.” Our president’s endorsement of the perpetrator will be taken as a representation of our values. Our own troops, many of them teenagers, will be misled by the president’s sense, or lack of sense, of honor.
Our military engages over 1.3 million young men and women on active duty. Many will be thrust into situations of extreme risk. They, and hundreds of thousands of reservists, look to their commanders, their comrades and their training to find the proper course in the face of great challenges. All officials, and most of all presidents, should respect senior officers, the judgment of peers and the values articulated in training.
In his final letter, Mr. Spencer, a Trump appointee, put it well: “As secretary of the Navy, one of the most important responsibilities I have to our people is to maintain good order and discipline throughout the ranks. I regard this as deadly serious business.” He added, “The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries.”
Our president should aspire to the same view. His values are not those of our military. It will do grievous damage to our armed services if they become so.

A concert to match the 'mystical quality' in famous work by John Cage

Texto completo: In February 1948, John Cage gave a lecture at an arts conference at Vassar College in which he detailed his artistic development. Somewhere in the midst of the address, he casually mentioned that, on the suggestion of a friend, he had “two years ago start[ed] writing 20 short Sonatas and Interludes which I have not yet finished."
The pieces, he added, “have all been written in my new apartment on the East River in Lower Manhattan which turns its back to the city and looks to the water and the sky."
It was a remarkably succinct precis of what would become one of Cage's most venerated works, the Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano. The image of Cage's composing space as a refuge from the tumult and commotion of New York, allowing the composer to seek a deeper and more private beauty, perfectly captures the music's mysterious aura. That rarefied character made it perhaps the closest to a canonical work in Cage's oeuvre, admired even by those who find Cage's later, chance-based music something akin to a sham. It is, in the words of Cage scholar James Pritchett, “a big piece with a quiet voice."
Last year, pianist Conor Hanick and director Zack Winokur found an innovative way to present the Sonatas and Interludes at the American Modern Opera Company's Run AMOC! Festival. Seated at a lidless piano in The Ex, the American Repertory Theater's small black box venue, with the audience surrounding him, Hanick played Cage's music while a subtle play of lighting (designed by Winokur, AMOC's co-artistic director) unfolded in the room. Choreographer Julia Eichten added an energetic dance component to the first interlude, performed largely in shadows. It was, according to the New York Times critic David Allen, “probably the best instrumental concert I have seen all year by virtue of its rethinking of the basics of what a recital might be."
“We all felt there was a mystical quality about the piece we wanted to explore in different ways," said Hanick, who will reprise “Cage" at this year's Run AMOC! “It's such a unique listening experience that I wanted the actual concertgoing act to be similar."
The Sonatas and Interludes are of central importance to Hanick, who first performed them in 2013 and has done so almost every season since. “It feels like a piece I've always known," he said via phone recently from his home in New York City. “The whole thing sounds like a whisper. There are these more resonant and clangorous moments, but I think at its heart, it's soliloquy, or a monologue, really, that is delivered in undertones."
The irony of the piece, Hanick pointed out, is that music of such otherworldly delicacy is created using the crudest of materials — screws, nuts, and bolts made of metal and rubber, all lodged in the piano strings in an arrangement that Cage lays out in the score with almost obsessive detail. (Preparing a piano for performance in this way takes around two to three hours.)
Yet Hanick found in earlier performances that following Cage's directions to the letter produced notably unsatisfying results. “You're measuring out three-and-a-half inches, you're using a furniture bolt between the first and second strings on [the note] A, you screw in the bolt, and it just sounds like a dead nothing," he said. “The note has no profile, it doesn't have a color, it just sounds like metal in a piano.
“It can't be that's what he meant," Hanick continued. “It's just inconceivable to me that he wanted the piece to sound that way." Once Hanick gave himself permission to slightly alter Cage's preparation instructions, “you just start creating these overtones and this other level of harmonicity with the instrument. And I think once that kind of becomes what you're looking for, you're getting more to the beauty of the piece."
Last year's AMOC production opened new dimensions of the Sonatas and Interludes for Hanick as well as for the audience. On one level, it allowed him to illuminate musical relationships and connections among the pieces in an unobtrusive way. But it also deepened the entire performative experience. “It draws the listener in when that's what's required, and allows the listener to pan out when that's required," he explained. “When you're sitting playing two or three sonatas in a row and the only light in the entire space is a very dim spotlight on the keyboard, it puts you in a different zone. There's no escaping what is going on in that very small space.
“The way that it's presented partly makes me play better," he added, “but it also creates this really intense cocoon for listening intently, which this piece really deserves."

Texto completo: For the Valley News
In the beginning, pressed to feed their families on a cavewoman’s budget, our foremothers caught chickens and learned to make soup. Civilization was born, as far as I’m concerned.
And now that we’re finally able to get a chicken into just about every pot, the bird’s missing its most interesting parts.
The joys of a fresh whole chicken once included the wonderful little treasure bag of giblets tucked into its abdominal cavity. In my childhood (not all that long ago), a store-bought chicken came with its heart, lungs (fun to inflate with a straw before they got cooked), gizzard, liver, and — first among equal delights — the neck still clothed in its skin. And nice tasty soon-to-be-succulent feet were properly attached to the drumsticks.
Now our money buys an empty bird. I suspect that everything we’re not getting to enjoy ends up in manufactured food for Fluffy and Fido, and I call that a high crime with no misdemeanor about it. (Notice that processors haven’t the, uh, guts to do that to our Thanksgiving turkeys, though, because there’d be an insurrection if we Americans were deprived of some of the fixin’s for gravy.)
But chicken soup, minus the richness of organ meats and without a traditional helzel, is practically a desecration, and don’t let The New York Times (per Julia Moskin’s “A Superior Chicken Soup;” Nov. 29, 2016) try to convince you otherwise.
Helzel (Yiddish for “little throat”) is sort of a fowl-based, Ashkenazi Jewish version of haggis. Wikipedia says it’s “sometimes called ‘false’ kishke,” which seems harsh but is the literal translation of an alternate Yiddish name. Kishke is stuffed cow intestine, which I was relieved to learn is common to all Central and Eastern European cuisines and can’t be blamed on my people.
My mother, a daughter of immigrants, was more inclined to torture us with ravishing descriptions of what she ate in her own childhood than to cook such mythic meals for us, but she did, thank God, make that soup, including the poor slandered falsa kishke. Mom herself called it a gargeleh, which is another way of saying “little throat” in Yiddish.
Should you find yourself fortunately in possession of all the required components to make yourself the very best soup, do this:
Carefully remove the skin from the chicken neck, and set aside, along with some chicken fat and the liver. Put the chicken, its neck, feet, cleaned gizzard and heart into a large pot, cover with cold water, add salt (see note) to taste and vegetables of your choosing. Bring to a simmer.
Meanwhile, take the reserved neck skin and sew it into a little bag with all-cotton thread. Fry some sliced onion in a bit of chicken fat and season to taste with garlic and black pepper. Mix a couple of spoonfuls of matzoh meal into a thick batter with a bit of cold water and add the fried onions. Stuff the little chicken-skin bag with the mixture, stitch the top closed and add to the simmering soup. Cook until the meat is tender, 45 minutes to an hour.
Take the liver, sprinkle with a little kosher salt, broil quickly and enjoy while you’re waiting for the soup. You can of course give it to your favorite child instead.
If you just have a craving for chicken soup, and no access to giblets, try this:
For the soup:
Chicken thighs and drumsticks, bone-in with skin
Garlic (minced, chopped or whole peeled cloves)
Fresh whole peeled ginger
Coarse salt
Turmeric
Whole coriander seeds
For serving:
Thinly-sliced bok choi (leaves and stalks)
Thinly-sliced hot peppers, seeds removed (they’re bad for your liver)
Directions: Add chicken to a large heavy-bottomed pot, skin down, and cook over very low heat until fat begins to render and there’s a fair bit of liquid in the bottom of the pot. Increase heat to medium and cook until skin is golden. Stir occasionally to ensure that the pieces don’t stick to the pot.
Add garlic and a whole piece of ginger to taste, a teaspoonful of turmeric and a teaspoonful of whole coriander seeds. Stir well and let spices become fragrant in the chicken fat and juices. Add cold water to cover and salt to taste; bring to simmer, lower heat and cook until meat is tender and the soup has a beautiful glazed appearance.
Put some sliced bok choi and hot peppers into each individual bowl, and add broth and chicken meat that you’ve pulled off the bones. Eat in good health!
Note: I’m generally not over-precious about ingredients, but I can’t cook or bake with anything except Diamond Kosher Salt. Morton’s is not equivalent. I now order that most basic of all pantry essentials via the internet.

Texto completo: OLIVESBURG - For Sam Donohue, philanthropy started early.
The son of Crestview graduates Sean and Molly Donohue, the 5-year-old came up with the idea to have a drive for socks for needy children.
His idea blew up more than his parents could have imagined. The drive led to the donation of 619 pairs of socks, 80 hats and 121 pairs of gloves. People also contributed three earmuffs, three headbands, a pair of shoes, a fleece jacket and a scarf.
"It kind of spread, which was really awesome," Molly Donohue said. "It got exciting for us as parents."
The idea came from the children's book "What Do You Do with an Idea," a New York Times bestseller.
"You change the world," Donohue said. "It's kind of a lot for a 5-year-old. We tried to make it make more sense to him.
"We could help other people. Socks and warm things are not something everybody has. It started very small."
It grew very big.
Donohue's mother, Joyce Brennan, shared the idea with her garden club.
"They did a huge collection," Donohue said.
A neighbor — the Donohues live in Akron — donated 200 pairs of socks. Sean Donohue mentioned the drive at his workplace.
Because of the huge haul, the Donohues divided the donations between Crestview and Akron City Schools, where Sam is in preschool.
"It was all going to be for Crestview," Molly Donohue said. "I wanted to give back. Our roots go back to Crestview."
Molly graduated in 1999, while her husband graduated in 1998.
She and Sam took the items to Crestview Elementary School early last week, coordinating with school counselor Taylor White.
"We have a lot of students that come in without gloves or hats," she said.
White gave socks to a boy whose family had recently moved. She said she was impressed with Sam's initiative.
"It was very unexpected that a 5-year-old had the idea," White said. "It was very much appreciated."
Donohue also has a niece who is in the first grade at Crestview.
One of the family's neighbors bought the book "What Do You Do with an Idea?" for Sam and asked him to pick another child he thought would have good ideas to change the world.
"Pretty cool," Donohue said.
According to amazon.com, "What Do You Do With an Idea?" is for anyone who's ever had a big idea.
It's the story of one brilliant idea and the child who helps to bring it into the world. As the child's confidence grows, so does the idea itself. And then, one day, something amazing happens.
Amazon.com says it is a story for anyone, at any age, who's ever had an idea that seemed a little too big, too odd, too difficult. It's a story to inspire you to welcome that idea, to give it some space to grow and to see what happens next. Because your idea isn't going anywhere. In fact, it's just getting started.
Donohue said she and her husband try to give back, noting the Ronald McDonald House is one of their favorite charities.
She is challenging News Journal readers to keep the idea going on their own. She wants the same for Sam.
"I'm hoping that this continues his whole life," Donohue said.

Trump and the Reagan Standard; Maybe this is why the White House is optimistic about re-election.

Texto completo: Ronald Reagan got elected President in 1980 by posing a simple question to American voters: "Are you better off than you were four years ago?" The answers doomed incumbent Jimmy Carter, who struggled to address a sagging economy at home and an expanding communist threat abroad. In 1984, U.S. voters answered Reagan's question again by handing him a 49-state landslide re-election victory.
In less than a year, Americans will once again have an opportunity to entrust someone with the job of protecting their security and the liberty that enables their prosperity. Polls show that our current President, Donald Trump, is receiving his typically mediocre approval ratings (essentially unchanged by Washington's impeachment circus). But if there's a sense of optimism around Team Trump about the 2020 campaign, it's probably because their candidate seems prepared to be judged on the Reagan standard.
A new Economist/YouGov poll out today asks Americans the question: "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" Among registered voters, 50% say yes and just 32% say no, while 17% say they're not sure. Even among the President's opponents there is some acknowledgment of progress in the Trump era. While 52% of Democratic primary voters say they are not better off since year seven of the Obama presidency, 26% say they are and 22% say they're not sure. Among self-described moderates, a plurality say they are better off, as do large majorities of conservatives and Republicans. The cautionary note for Mr. Trump is that registered voters are essentially split on the question of whether the country is better off.
Looking at various polls, the President continues to enjoy strong approval ratings when it comes to the economy. Maintaining this strength may depend on some resolution of trade disputes. Dan Clifton of Strategas Research reports today, "Trump's approval rating is positively correlated with a higher probability of a US-China trade deal."
While the results of this and many of Mr. Trump's other foreign policy efforts remain to be determined, he seems to have succeeded in persuading European countries to bolster their defenses. At a lunch today in the United Kingdom, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg directed the following remarks to Mr. Trump, according to the official White House transcript:
...thank you so much for hosting this lunch with nine countries... that are spending 2 percent of GDP on defense... a few years ago, there were only three countries. And so this is actually more than twice as many countries just since a few years ago.
... your leadership on defense spending, Mr. President, is having an impact, because more Allies meet the 2 percent guideline. All Allies have started to increase. The majority of Allies have plans in place to meet the 2 percent guideline by 2024. And the European Allies and Canada have added $130 billion to the defense budget since 2016. And this number will be $400 billion by 2024... This is making NATO stronger.
At a similar point in Reagan's first term, as he prepared for his re-election campaign, America's 40th President could take comfort in an economy which would grow at 4.6% in 1983 and a stunning 7.2% in the year of his landslide re-election. Today the U.S. economy is growing much more slowly, but jobs have never been more plentiful.
As for his foreign policy agenda, President Reagan faced great skepticism. On this date in 1983, a New York Times editorial lambasted Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposed system to shoot down Soviet missiles in flight before they could ever reach the United States. The Times opined:
The best time to stop any phase of the arms race is before it begins. Now is the time, therefore, to head off a dangerous, expensive and futile new competition in space. But President Reagan has been struck, like Icarus, by the dream of mastering space. He appears to be pressing the quest for an elaborate Star Wars ''defense'' that might, next century, render Soviet missiles obsolete... The way to stop this madness is to join the Russians in an effective agreement to keep all weapons out of space.
Fortunately for humanity, Reagan ignored the New York Times. Within a decade, after the collapse of the Soviet empire, it became clear to all that the Reagan plan had been critical in persuading the Soviet dictatorship that it could no longer compete with American technology and was better off trying to open its closed society to new ideas.
In 1993 the Washington Post reported that former Soviet officials were acknowledging the importance of the Reagan project:
Speaking at a Princeton University conference on the end of the Cold War, the officials said former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev was convinced any attempt to match Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, which was launched in 1983 to build a space-based defense against missiles, would do irreparable harm to the Soviet economy.

Senate Republicans Warm to Theory of Ukrainian Election Interference; Some GOP senators are embracing the idea, advanced by President Trump, that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 race, despite contradictory findings

Texto completo: Some Republican lawmakers are warming to the allegation that Ukraine's government meddled in the 2016 U.S. elections, even though a bipartisan Senate investigation found no evidence of any systematic effort by Ukraine to interfere.
The Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee has spent nearly three years investigating Russia's interference in 2016, and has released public reports that emphatically support the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community that Moscow carried out an influence operation intended to boost President Trump.
That same Senate probe also examined whether Ukraine interfered in 2016, but found such claims—specifically that the government in Kyiv had ordered a top-down effort to hamper Mr. Trump's campaign—without merit, according to a person familiar with the matter. The panel's look at the Ukraine allegations were first reported Monday by Politico.
But Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that he saw no difference between what Russia did early on to meddle in U.S. elections and what Ukrainian officials did.
"It's still meddling," Mr. Burr said, without elaborating on the nature of the meddling.
After publication of this article, Mr. Burr's office shared a statement with the Journal: "I don't believe anyone conducted the type of sophisticated election interference campaign Russia did in 2016," Mr. Burr said.
If the House impeaches Mr. Trump over his interactions with Ukraine, the Senate will serve as jury in a trial, so GOP senators' views on Ukraine's actions in 2016 could be crucial to deciding whether the president remains in office.
At a Tuesday afternoon press conference, a reporter asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell if he could set the record straight about whether Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, since there appeared to be a debate going on within his party.
"This whole issue as far as I'm concerned, is a House issue," Mr. McConnell responded. When pressed on whether he thought Ukrainian meddling was equivalent to Russian meddling, Mr. McConnell demurred.
"My view is that's something for the Senate Intelligence Committee to take a look at if they choose to," he said. "And I don't have any particular reaction to it."
Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) a member of the Senate intelligence committee, said the difference was in the scope of Russia's effort.
"I don't think anybody meddled like the Russians did but, you know, there were other countries that did things: the Iranians, the Chinese, the Ukrainians," he said.
Asked to explain the standard for meddling, Mr. Blunt said, "There's a lot of internet meddling. There's a lot of false information that comes from lots of countries. Hard to say how much of it is country-sponsored and how much of it is just done within a country."
To support the allegation of Ukrainian meddling, Republicans have pointed to a 2017 Politico article about work in 2016 by a Democratic operative and individual Ukrainian officials to investigate ties between Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and an ousted former Ukrainian president. Mr. Manafort was convicted last year of dodging taxes and committing bank fraud, stemming in part from money earned from his political work in Ukraine.
At a hearing on Tuesday, David Hale, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he hadn't seen any credible evidence that Ukraine interfered in the U.S. election in 2016.
Democratic lawmakers pressed him on whether there was evidence to support Mr. Trump's claims, and whether the president's repeated allegations about Ukraine were distracting the State Department from the task of preventing Russian interference in 2020.
"It's a free country, people can debate any ideas that they want. But our focus at the State Department has been and as it should be, on the proven Russian interference in the 2016 elections and plans to do so in 2020," Mr. Hale said.
Mr. Hale added that he's seen "no credible evidence about allegations of Ukraine."
Mr. Hale's testimony aligns with the position of current and former U.S. intelligence officials, who have said they are aware of no evidence that Ukraine tried to meddle in the 2016 election in any systemic, government-backed way.
Representatives from the U.S. intelligence community told senators in a recent classified briefing that Russia for years had been engaging in a disinformation campaign intended to seed the narrative that it was Ukraine, and not Russia, that was responsible for the hack of Democratic emails in 2016, according to the person familiar with the matter. The contours of that private briefing was reported by the New York Times.
Sen. John Kennedy (R., LA.), didn't attend the session, but said he doesn't see a need for such a briefing.
"I don't need to be briefed to be able to read," Mr. Kennedy said. He read to reporters from print-outs of articles in Politico, The New York Times and other news outlets that he said documented Ukrainian efforts to meddle in the U.S. election.
"They meddled and Russia meddled," Mr. Kennedy said.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), said he had seen media reports that Ukrainian officials allegedly met somebody from the Democratic National Committee. "If there's credible evidence that people inside the Ukraine were meeting with the DNC, I'd like to know about that," he said.
But Mr. Graham said he was convinced that Russia hacked the DNC server and stole Democrats' emails, not Ukraine. The theory that some of his GOP colleagues are advancing that Ukrainians hacked the DNC is hurting Mr. Trump's defense, Mr. Graham said.
"I'm 1,000% confident that the hack of the DNC was by Russian operatives, no one else," he said, adding: "I think it's always wrong to say things that can't be proven. And it can be proven it was the Russians."
Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said he hadn't had a chance to speak to Mr. Burr about his comments, but he hoped that his colleagues could stay focused on where the real threat lies.
"The only people who are advancing the discredited theory about Ukraine intervention are part of the continuing Russian disinformation campaign," said Mr. Warner. "I stand by what our committee has already said. Russia has been the sole source of this."

Texto completo: California Sen. Kamala Harris said she is dropping out of the Democratic presidential race, completing a surprising fall for a once-promising contender who drew 20,000 people to her campaign launch early this year.
Ms. Harris decided to exit from the race Monday after a discussion with her family and senior aides and after doing an audit of the campaign's finances, according to a senior aide. She was one of only seven candidates to qualify for the party's December debate, but she still didn't see a path forward.
In an email to supporters that was also posted online , Ms. Harris said she "simply doesn't have the financial resources we need to continue."
"I'm not a billionaire," she said in the email. "I can't fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete. In good faith, I can't tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don't believe I do."
Ms. Harris also canceled a major fundraiser in New York City Tuesday. Her campaign burned through millions of dollars more than it raised during the three-month period that ended Sept. 30, her Federal Election Commission reports showed.
Before she launched her campaign, Ms. Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants who was elected to the Senate in 2016, had been seen as a rising star in the party who in a presidential race could bring together the coalition that twice elected former President Obama. She also became well-known for her tough questioning of Trump administration nominees who came before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which Democratic candidate(s) do you think will benefit from Kamala Harris's dropping out of the race, and why? Join the conversation below.
But even after a surge of attention and a fundraising boost stemming from a strong debate performance in June, Ms. Harris struggled to settle on a strategy for where to compete and how to frame her campaign message. She initially focused on speaking truth to power and taking on President Trump, before switching to what she called kitchen-table issues—raising teacher salaries, pay equity between men and women, taxes—during the summer.
She also failed to catch fire with African-American voters and wrestled with how to sell her background as a former prosecutor. As her standing in the race dipped, her campaign grappled with disagreements between powerful figures at the top of her team.
For several weeks she failed to articulate a clear position on health care, the top issue for Democratic primary voters. After signing on as a co-sponsor to Sen. Bernie Sanders's Medicare for All plan, Ms. Harris backtracked. She eventually released her own proposal that sought to appease those who wanted a complete government-provided health system and those who were reluctant to eliminate private insurers.
Once House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, Ms. Harris began to lean on her record as a prosecutor . She had been reluctant to do that earlier in the campaign, after criminal-justice advocates said she hadn't done enough as state attorney general to make California's laws more progressive, especially for minority communities.
"In a race this big, it's really important to have clarity about your strategy and message," said Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic strategist who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. "And I'm not sure the Harris campaign was able to do that."
Ms. Harris's campaign also tweaked its strategy regarding which states to compete in, starting out with a plan to invest heavily in South Carolina, given the state's majority black Democratic electorate. But her aides and supporters, according to people familiar with her campaign, were surprised by the resiliency of former Vice President Joe Biden's support among black voters in the state.
Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of the progressive BlackPAC, said Ms. Harris had relatively low name ID among African-Americans despite being the only black woman in the Democratic field. Ms. Shropshire also said that some of those who did know Ms. Harris found her record as a California prosecutor to be "a big deal."
"Her challenge from the beginning really was reaching enough voters so that people know who she is, and that includes black voters," Ms. Shropshire said. "She didn't really have a lot of attention from black voters until she got in but I think she was running out of room in some ways in terms of increasing her support among those voters."
Ms. Harris later diverted resources to Iowa , where her campaign planned to zero in on the first nominating contest, after unexpectedly announcing layoffs and closing offices in New Hampshire. But recent polls in Iowa showed her well behind the likes of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden.
Different campaign power centers—the California Democrat's sister, Maya Harris, served as chairwoman, while she also had longtime consultants and her campaign manager—exacerbated the muddled messaging, according to people familiar with the situation. Other people also said it became hard to hire experienced staffers, who didn't want to report to such a complicated leadership structure.
It even led to a resignation. The New York Times published a resignation letter from a top staffer who left to go work for billionaire Michael Bloomberg's campaign. Kelly Mehlenbacher, the state operations director, criticized the campaign for a lack of strategy and leadership, saying she had "never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly."
Unlike candidates such as Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, and Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, who are relying mostly on small donations, Ms. Harris hadn't been as successful with online fundraising and had to spend time and resources maintaining support among wealthy donors. She was largely absent from the campaign trail between mid-August and mid-September to fundraise.
With a lack of financial resources to air ads, Ms. Harris's team began focusing on creating digital videos with the goal of making them go viral on social media. Some featured her cooking, including one with actress and comedian Mindy Kaling. The campaign tried and failed in recent days to raise enough money to air a video that portrayed her as the "anti-Trump" on TV.
The fundraising crunch became particularly pressing in recent days, when it became clear that Ms. Harris—along with other senators in the race—would likely have to spend time off the campaign trail in Washington for an impeachment trial ahead of the Iowa caucuses and would have to rely on ads to stay in front of voters.
Her inability to go on the airwaves played a role in her decision to drop out, the senior aide said, pointing out that by the end of this week, Mr. Bloomberg's presidential campaign would have spent on advertising about twice what Ms. Harris raised in her entire campaign.
Ms. Harris's exit means December's debate stage could feature no non-white candidates. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are on the bubble for qualifying, while New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker hasn't reached the required polling threshold.

Iran Admits Firing on Demonstrators

Texto completo: The government said security forces had fought back against "enemy cells" as demonstrations swept the country, but it said the death toll had been exaggerated.
Two weeks after protests gripped Iran -- and quickly turned deadly -- the government has acknowledged that security officers used firearms to quell the widespread demonstrations but it has denied unofficial accounts that hundreds were killed.
Iran's state television confirmed on Monday night that security forces had shot and killed protesters who had taken refuge in marshes in the southern city of Mahshahr. It described them as "armed terrorists" and praised the tactics of security forces for having crushed the unrest.
"Enemy cells were hiding in the marshes and shooting at security forces," Col. Reza Papi, a police commander in Mahshahr, told the state television broadcast.
The comments were among the first admissions by the Iranian authorities that security officers had responded to the demonstrations with lethal force.
Iranian officials on Tuesday also denounced accounts of the death toll that have emerged since the protests began, saying that the number of victims was much lower but not specifying how many.
Witnesses and residents in Mahshahr, in southern Iran's Khuzestan province, earlier had told The New York Times that dozens of men had been gunned down in the marshes and that most of them had been unarmed, except for one who did fire a shot at the security forces after they had opened fire on the men at a nearby checkpoint.
Between 180 and 450 people are believed to have been killed in the four days of violence that convulsed cities around the country when demonstrators gathered on the streets to protest a gasoline price increase announced on Nov. 15. In that same period, at least 2,000 others were injured and another 7,000 detained, according to international rights organizations, opposition groups and local journalists.
Press TV, one of Iran's state-run news outlets, on Tuesday quoted Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, a spokesman for Iran's judiciary, as saying that the estimated casualty figures were false.
"The numbers and figures that are being provided by hostile groups are utter fabrication, and the actual figures are fewer than what these sources claim," Mr. Esmaili said, according to the news outlet. He did not offer any official figures.
At the same time, reports also surfaced of new strife -- an indication that the government's earlier assertion that the protests had ended was premature.
Press TV reported that dozens of arrests had been made in Khuzestan Province on Tuesday, citing intelligence officials. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported what appeared to have been a revenge killing of a security officer by an ethnic Arab resident of Shayegan, a working class city in Khuzestan.
There were also reports of protests and clashes in the city of Sarbaz in southeast Iran's Sistan and Baluchistan Province, one of the largest in the country. Sistan and Baluchistan, populated by mostly ethnic Baluch Iranians, borders Pakistan and has a history of popular armed uprisings against the central government. It also is home to Chahbahar port, a major shipping point developed by Indian contractors.
Social media videos and accounts in Persian media like BBC Persian showed protesters blocking a major access road to the port and security forces armed with guns and tear gas opening fire at them.
The Iranian authorities have provided little information about the extent of the protests since they began, and officials imposed a dayslong internet blackout during the crackdown that further limited the distribution of information on the violence.
They also have accused the Trump administration of encouraging the protests, singling out Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for inviting Iranians to share videos and other material purporting to document the crackdown.
President Trump, during a visit to Britain for a NATO meeting, on Tuesday weighed in on the protests, suggesting without evidence that thousands had been killed.
"Iran is killing perhaps thousands and thousands of people right now as we speak," he said, a statement vastly different from other estimates. "That is why they cut off the internet, so people can't see what is going on."
Political analysts said evidence of a continuing repression of protesters in Khuzestan, Sistan and Baluchistan and in the western province of Kurdistan -- all with ethnic minorities and separatist movements -- could lead to a cycle of reprisals and more violence.
Some said they also had no doubt that the central authorities in Tehran would respond with overwhelming firepower if necessary to send a message to the United States and Iran's regional adversaries, particularly Saudi Arabia and Israel.
"The rapid resort to brute force was aimed at demonstrating to the U.S. that the leadership in Tehran will nip any social upheaval in the bud at any cost," said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran program at the International Crisis Group. "They now believe they have successfully proven to Washington that not only they are powerful in the region, but they are also in total control at home." The remains of a building burned during recent protests in Shahriar in northern Iran. Authorities denied killing hundreds. (PHOTOGRAPH BY VAHID SALEMI/ASSOCIATED PRESS)

Senate Republicans Warm to Theory of Ukrainian Election Interference; Some GOP senators are embracing the idea, advanced by President Trump, that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 race, despite contradictory findings

Texto completo: Some Republican lawmakers are warming to the allegation that Ukraine's government meddled in the 2016 U.S. elections, even though a bipartisan Senate investigation found no evidence of any systematic effort by Ukraine to interfere.
The Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee has spent nearly three years investigating Russia's interference in 2016, and has released public reports that emphatically support the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community that Moscow carried out an influence operation intended to boost President Trump.
That same Senate probe also examined whether Ukraine interfered in 2016, but found such claims—specifically that the government in Kyiv had ordered a top-down effort to hamper Mr. Trump's campaign—without merit, according to a person familiar with the matter. The panel's look at the Ukraine allegations were first reported Monday by Politico.
But Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that he saw no difference between what Russia did early on to meddle in U.S. elections and what Ukrainian officials did.
"It's still meddling," Mr. Burr said, without elaborating on the nature of the meddling.
If the House impeaches Mr. Trump over his interactions with Ukraine, the Senate will serve as jury in a trial, so GOP senators' views on Ukraine's actions in 2016 could be crucial to deciding whether the president remains in office.
At a Tuesday afternoon press conference, a reporter asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell if he could set the record straight about whether Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, since there appeared to be a debate going on within his party.
"This whole issue as far as I'm concerned, is a House issue," Mr. McConnell responded. When pressed on whether he thought Ukrainian meddling was equivalent to Russian meddling, Mr. McConnell demurred.
"My view is that's something for the Senate Intelligence Committee to take a look at if they choose to," he said. "And I don't have any particular reaction to it."
Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) a member of the Senate intelligence committee, said the difference was in the scope of Russia's effort.
"I don't think anybody meddled like the Russians did but, you know, there were other countries that did things: the Iranians, the Chinese, the Ukrainians," he said.
Asked to explain the standard for meddling, Mr. Blunt said, "There's a lot of internet meddling. There's a lot of false information that comes from lots of countries. Hard to say how much of it is country-sponsored and how much of it is just done within a country."
To support the allegation of Ukrainian meddling, Republicans have pointed to a 2017 Politico article about work in 2016 by a Democratic operative and individual Ukrainian officials to investigate ties between Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and an ousted former Ukrainian president. Mr. Manafort was convicted last year of dodging taxes and committing bank fraud, stemming in part from money earned from his political work in Ukraine.
At a hearing on Tuesday, David Hale, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he hadn't seen any credible evidence that Ukraine interfered in the U.S. election in 2016.
Democratic lawmakers pressed him on whether there was evidence to support Mr. Trump's claims, and whether the president's repeated allegations about Ukraine were distracting the State Department from the task of preventing Russian interference in 2020.
"It's a free country, people can debate any ideas that they want. But our focus at the State Department has been and as it should be, on the proven Russian interference in the 2016 elections and plans to do so in 2020," Mr. Hale said.
Mr. Hale added that he's seen "no credible evidence about allegations of Ukraine."
Mr. Hale's testimony aligns with the position of current and former U.S. intelligence officials, who have said they are aware of no evidence that Ukraine tried to meddle in the 2016 election in any systemic, government-backed way.
Representatives from the U.S. intelligence community told senators in a recent classified briefing that Russia for years had been engaging in a disinformation campaign intended to seed the narrative that it was Ukraine, and not Russia, that was responsible for the hack of Democratic emails in 2016, according to the person familiar with the matter. The contours of that private briefing was reported by the New York Times.
Sen. John Kennedy (R., LA.), didn't attend the session, but said he doesn't see a need for such a briefing.
"I don't need to be briefed to be able to read," Mr. Kennedy said. He read to reporters from print-outs of articles in Politico, The New York Times and other news outlets that he said documented Ukrainian efforts to meddle in the U.S. election.
"They meddled and Russia meddled," Mr. Kennedy said.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), said he had seen media reports that Ukrainian officials allegedly met somebody from the Democratic National Committee. "If there's credible evidence that people inside the Ukraine were meeting with the DNC I'd like to know about that," he said.
But Mr. Graham said he was convinced that Russia hacked the DNC server and stole Democrats' emails, not Ukraine. The theory that some of his GOP colleagues are advancing that Ukrainians hacked the DNC is hurting Mr. Trump's defense, Mr. Graham said.
"I'm 1,000% confident that the hack of the DNC was by Russian operatives, no one else," he said, adding: "I think it's always wrong to say things that can't be proven. And it can be proven it was the Russians."
Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said he hadn't had a chance to speak to Mr. Burr about his comments, but he hoped that his colleagues could stay focused on where the real threat lies.
"The only people who are advancing the discredited theory about Ukraine intervention are part of the continuing Russian disinformation campaign," said Mr. Warner. "I stand by what our committee has already said. Russia has been the sole source of this."

Texto completo: “Children of Virtue and Vengeance” (Henry Holt and Co. , 416 pp. , ½ out of four stars) is the highly anticipated sequel to "Children of Blood and Bone," the first book of Tomi Adeyemi’s West African-inspired fantasy trilogy, Legacy of Orïsha. Famously, “Children of Blood and Bone” netted the now 26-year-old Adeyemi a seven-figure advance, one of the biggest in the history of young adult fiction. Quickly after that, Fox 2000 picked up the film rights. As of now, “Children of Blood and Bone” has been on The New York Times best-seller list for over 34 weeks, and has spent 20 weeks on the USA TODAY best-seller list.
The dynamics of power, corruption and identity are further explored in "Virtue and Vengeance. " Where “Blood and Bone” explores how persecuted minorities find ways to retain their culture, “Virtue and Vengeance” places that minority on an equal playing field with their oppressors overnight. The characters are forced to rethink what they know about their culture and exactly who gets to own it.

The first book follows Zélie, her brother Tzain and runaway princess Amari in a quest to return magic to the land of Orïsha, where the maji people who formerly had powers are being ruthlessly persecuted by the monarchy. The monarchy chases after the trio as well as Amari’s brother, Prince Inan, who also discovers he has powers and a special bound to Zélie. Unlike Zélie, Inan sees his magic as curse rather than a blessing, especially under the rule of his father, who sees the maji only as “maggots. ”
At the end of “Blood and Bone,” Zeilie, Tzain and Amari return magic to the lands of Orïsha, and the once-powerless majis now have the magic they had lost, and with it a desire to reclaim their culture that had nearly been wiped out.
Yet, the majis are not the only ones who wake up with powers. The ruling class also discover they have new powers and even more reason to wipe out the majis for good. And that includes the genocidal queen of Orïsha, Nehanda, who now takes her husband’s place on the throne after being killed by his daughter Amari at the end of “Blood and Bone. ”
Peace has never been more fragile. The book grapples with the idea of compromise when unspeakable violence has been committed against a group of people who are now returning such violence with a vengeance. The central conflict of the story is the war between the monarchy and the newly empowered maji, but the discord starts in the intimate bonds between the main characters, with characters' actions rippling out from the personal to acts of war.

Adeyemi expands on the strengths of the first book and raises the stakes in both friendships and in war, challenging the loyalties that were strongly cemented in "Blood and Bone. " (though some relationships, especially the romances, feel underdeveloped and rushed). "Virtue and Vengeance" also introduces new characters and revives old ones, revealing more difficult questions about redemption, power and reparations. Adeyemi does not pull any punches relating the horrors of genocide and war, yet her books still maintain a spirit of fantasy and adventure without her message losing its impact.
It builds to an ending that leaves the reader with a feeling that can only be described as dread. The dread is not a negative point, but adds scope to the series and more complexity to the theme of identity. Adeyemi writes a mean cliffhanger and successfully upends expectations.
The last chapter will undoubtedly leave fans shaking with questions until the final installment of the trilogy is published.

Texto completo: Sen. Cory Booker said he was "a little angry" that his friend Sen. Kamala Harris dropped out the 2020 Democratic presidential race.
"We started with one of the most diverse fields in our history," the New Jersey Democrat said Tuesday on MSNBC. "It's a damn shame now that the only African American woman in this race, who has been speaking to issues that need to be brought up, is now no longer in it."
He added the Democratic field is "spiraling towards" a point where there would be "no diversity" on the December debate stage. Neither Booker, who is black, nor Julian Castro, who is Hispanic, have qualified for the next debate.
Castro, 45, slammed media coverage of Harris as being unfair during her run. "I will say that the way that the media have treated Sen. Harris in this campaign has been something else," he said. "The way they've held her to a different standard, a double standard, has been grossly unfair and unfortunate."
Harris's campaign came under criticism from campaign aides who dished dirt anonymously to Politico and the New York Times in the days leading up to her withdrawal.

Billy Dee Williams And the Gender Binary

Texto completo: "I say 'himself' and 'herself,' because I also see myself as feminine as well as masculine," the actor told Esquire magazine.
The actor Billy Dee Williams has been the very embodiment of cool charisma for decades -- in real life and as the smooth-talking, cape-wearing smuggler Lando Calrissian in the "Star Wars" universe (a role he's reprising for the first time since 1983 in the upcoming "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker").
And while Williams's brand of cool has been synonymous with masculinity -- who can forget the slightly cringey machismo in those 1980s Colt 45 ads? -- in reality, Williams straddles the gender binary, according to a recent profile in Esquire magazine.
"You see, I say 'himself' and 'herself,' because I also see myself as feminine as well as masculine," Williams, 82, told Esquire. "I'm a very soft person. I'm not afraid to show that side of myself."
"I think of myself as a relatively colorful character who doesn't take himself or herself too seriously," Williams said.
When Esquire points out that Donald Glover, who played a young Calrissian in the "Solo" released in 2018, talked about the character's sexual and gender fluidity, "Williams lights up" and responds: "Really? That kid is brilliant."
Last year, shortly after Jonathan Kasdan, a writer on "Solo," confirmed that Calrissian was pansexual (being attracted to people regardless of gender or sex), Glover said: "How can you not be pansexual in space?"
While Williams, who has been married to Teruko Nakagami since the 1970s, did not outright claim to be gender fluid or otherwise, his/her embrace of gender-fluid pronouns is part of a greater revelation in Hollywood and beyond -- though among celebrities who have recently opened up about their pronouns and gender, Williams is among the oldest.
In September, the Grammy-winning singer Sam Smith, 27, who identifies as genderqueer and nonbinary, publicly announced their pronouns.
"Today is a good day so here goes," Smith wrote in an Instagram post. "I've decided I am changing my pronouns to they/them after a lifetime of being at war with my gender I've decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out."
The nonbinary actor Asia Kate Dillon, 35, a star on Showtime's "Billions," talked to The New York Times earlier this year about their pronouns: they/them. "I can release she/her pronouns, I can use they/them," Dillon said. "This is who I am."
And in an interview with Out Magazine in June, the "Queer Eye" star Jonathan Van Ness said that he identifies as nonbinary while retaining he/him pronouns.
"I'm gender nonconforming," he said. "Like, some days I feel like a man, but then other days I feel like a woman."

Did an Ethics Commission Leak Private Information to Cuomo?

Texto completo: An alleged leak to Mr. Cuomo, a phone call from a top legislative aide and a prolonged investigation are at the heart of Albany's latest ethics dispute.
The text messages arrived on a snowy January afternoon, a few hours after New York's state ethics commission privately debated whether to investigate a disgraced former aide to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. They were from a high-ranking government lawyer, sent to one of the commission members.
Was the meeting over? the lawyer asked. He had a question.
The conversation that followed is now at the heart of a brewing ethics controversy in Albany, involving an alleged leak, cover-up and pressure on supposedly independent investigative bodies. According to Julie Garcia, the commissioner who received the text, the lawyer told her that her vote during the meeting might have been leaked to Mr. Cuomo -- a possible misdemeanor.
But when the state inspector general's office investigated the matter, the office, whose head is appointed by Mr. Cuomo, decided that there was no evidence of a leak -- even though it never interviewed Mr. Cuomo, several commissioners, or Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie, whose lawyer called Ms. Garcia.
In the weeks since, the allegations, many of which were first reported by The Times Union of Albany, have placed Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Heastie under intense scrutiny. They have also reignited doubts about the independence of the ethics panel, known as the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, and the inspector general's office.
Both bodies have been accused of weak oversight, and activists, lawmakers and even commission members themselves have called for their overhaul.
"I strongly urge the governor to conduct an in-depth review of the operation of both JCOPE generally and the inspector general, and to use this as a lessons learned exercise," said Gary Lavine, one of the two commissioners who told The New York Times that they were not interviewed. "We've seen in this whole situation, the current setup is not working very well."
At the heart of the controversy is the conversation between Mr. Heastie's executive counsel, Howard Vargas, and Ms. Garcia, whom Mr. Heastie appointed to the ethics commission in 2018.
Ms. Garcia was driving home on Jan. 29, less than two hours after the close of the commission's monthly meeting, when Mr. Vargas texted her to ask if the meeting was over.
The two spoke on the phone shortly after. That was when Mr. Vargas told Ms. Garcia that the governor had suggested, in a conversation with the Assembly speaker, that she had voted against him during that meeting, Ms. Garcia said in an interview.
State law requires almost all of the commission's votes to be kept secret, and Ms. Garcia declined to say what the vote was about or how she had voted. But JCOPE officials have disclosed separately that the meeting included a vote on whether to investigate Joseph Percoco, a former top aide and confidante to Mr. Cuomo who was convicted last year of soliciting and accepting bribes. (Mr. Cuomo has denied knowledge of Mr. Percoco's actions, and prosecutors did not accuse him of wrongdoing.)
The phone call, and the notion of a leak, left Ms. Garcia reeling.
"Of course it was upsetting," Ms. Garcia said. "I was taken aback."
A spokesman for Mr. Heastie said last week that Mr. Vargas acted without instruction from the speaker. Mr. Heastie, through the spokesman, also offered condemnation of the action for the first time since the allegations became public last month.
"He does not think it was appropriate for his counsel to make this call," the spokesman, Michael Whyland, said of Mr. Heastie, adding that the speaker had instructed a lawyer for the Assembly to "conduct a review in order to outline other steps that could be taken to address this matter."
Mr. Vargas did not return a request for comment.
The day after the phone call, Ms. Garcia told JCOPE's executive director at the time, Seth Agata, about the possible leak. Mr. Agata, as required by law, reported the allegation to the inspector general's office.
The ensuing inquiry was not conducted by the chief inspector general, Letizia Tagliafierro, who previously served as executive director for JCOPE and also worked for Mr. Cuomo. Ms. Tagliafierro recused herself, and the inquiry was handled by a deputy.
In the following months, the probe seemed to leave holes.
Ms. Garcia gave a recorded interview under oath to the inspector general's office in February. But the office did not request her phone records between herself and Mr. Vargas, Ms. Garcia said, nor the text messages, which The Times reviewed.
Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Heastie were never interviewed, spokesmen for the two leaders confirmed. Mr. Cuomo, at an unrelated news conference on Tuesday, defended the omission, suggesting that there was no reason for the inspector general to interview him.
"We've never had an inappropriate conversation about JCOPE," the governor said, referring to himself and Mr. Heastie.
"Remember, legally, the only legal obligation is on the commissioners not to disclose," he added. "If a commissioner called you or someone else and told you something, you could tell whoever you want. The I.G. talked to the people who have the legal obligation."
But two commissioners -- Mr. Lavine and George Weissman -- told The Times that the inspector general's office never interviewed them either. The remaining commissioners declined or did not return requests for comment.
Mr. Lavine was recused from the JCOPE matter discussed in the alleged leak, and was not privy to any related confidential information, the inspector general's office said. But Mr. Weissman did participate in the January discussions.
"I expected the I.G. would do a thorough investigation," Ms. Garcia said. "It appears I was wrong."
Lee Park, a spokesman for the inspector general's office, declined to say how many people were interviewed or how interview subjects were chosen. But in a letter laying out its investigative findings -- which the inspector general released on Wednesday, only after several reporters requested it through freedom of information laws -- the office said it had conducted "interviews, document review and analyses."
Mr. Park also said that the office obtained 30 "signed affirmations under penalty of perjury" from JCOPE commissioners and staff members at the January meeting, who swore that they "did not disclose information regarding any matter discussed in the executive session."
Ultimately, the inspector general's letter said, "no individual was able to provide firsthand knowledge of any leak or potential perpetrator; and any information provided was admittedly based on supposition and speculation."
Asked why the office did not interview Mr. Heastie or Mr. Cuomo, who might have had that firsthand knowledge, Mr. Park repeated Mr. Cuomo's argument about legal liability lying only with commissioners.
The inspector general's letter was sent to JCOPE commissioners in October. Four days later, Ms. Garcia sent a text message to Mr. Vargas -- their first communication since the January phone call. "Resigning from JCOPE today. Where should I send the letter?" she wrote.
Mr. Vargas did not ask any questions, merely sending Ms. Garcia a fax number and his email address.

Texto completo: Holly Black's Folk of the Air trilogy has been one of the most buzzed about fantasy series of recent years, and with good reason. Over the course of three books, Black has crafted a twisted, unpredictable saga of court intrigue, family drama and romantic angst. The series' final installment, The Queen of The Nothing, brings The Folk of the Air to an immensely satisfying conclusion with plenty of shocking surprises.
Jude Duarte, a mortal raised in Faerieland by her parents' murderers, is not in a good place when The Queen of Nothing begins. Exiled from the realm of Faerie, Jude schemes and plots to take back power from the wicked King Cardan, who has finally managed to get the best of her. When her twin sister Taryn appears asking for help, Jude may finally have the opportunity for revenge she craves. But a war is brewing between King Cardan and Jude's foster father, General Madoc, and Jude is soon caught up in the bloody conflict, forced to choose between protecting those she loves and satisfying her own boundless ambition.
A standout element of the Folk of the Air series is the high-stakes, love-hate tug-of-war for power between Jude and Cardan, and The Queen of Nothing takes their dynamic in a fascinating new direction as the two must join forces against Madoc. Can Jude and Cardan possibly trust one another after all the betrayals they've inflicted upon each other? And what about their undeniable mutual attraction- is it just a destructive infatuation, or something more?
None of the relationships in The Queen of Nothing are simple or easy. Jude, Taryn and their half-Faerie older sister, Vivi, were all raised by Madoc, after he killed their mother and Jude and Taryn's father, making for an extremely complicated family dynamic. Black is brilliant at writing complex, flawed characters, who, no matter how terrible their actions may be, still contain glimmers of sympathy and humanity. Madoc may be The Queen of Nothing's antagonist or may be the murderer of Jude's parents, but he's also the only father she and her sisters have ever known. Black's skillful depiction of their fraught relationship is genuinely heart-wrenching.
At its core, The Queen of Nothing is about whether people are destined to be defined by the trauma and abuse they have been subjected to, or if they are capable of rising above it. As a mortal amongst Faeries, Jude has learned to harden her heart as a matter of survival. Across the three books of Folk of the Air, readers have watched her transform into a ruthless anti-heroine willing to lie, cheat and even kill to accomplish her goals.
The Queen of Nothing is a fast-paced, addictive read with fascinating characters, immersive world-building and some truly gasp-worthy twists and turns. But it is also a hopeful, surprisingly heart-warming conclusion to the deservedly-acclaimed Folk of the Air trilogy.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Reading Susan Rice’s new memoir, “Tough Love,” is a reminder of two things: what a remarkably gifted, subtle but maddeningly distant man President Obama was; and how people like Rice who served him endured ceaseless public attacks in a country that was already on the ragged edge, though we didn’t yet know it.
Washington memoirs are most valuable for the parts that aren’t about what the author did at the office. That’s especially true of this account by the former national security adviser. The riveting passages are where Rice tells the private story that was hidden: her parents’ brutal divorce, her mother’s death, her children’s struggles with their mother’s public vilification.
Good memoirs always have a quality the Germans define as a bildungsroman, a novel of the principal character’s education in the world. That’s true with Rice’s tale: She was an African American who triumphed in the elite world of prep schools, Ivy League colleges and Rhodes Scholarships. She embodied the intellect and ambition these institutions aspired to produce, even as she masked a shattered family where her parents “fought ugly and often,” she writes, and her home life was “like a civil war battlefield.”
David Brooks, the New York Times columnist, describes the distinction between “résumé virtues,” the tokens of meritocratic success, and “eulogy virtues” that truly define someone’s character. Rice’s story and, indeed, Obama’s combine both in a compelling but sometimes unstable mix.
For all her privilege, Rice was famously pugnacious. In 1999, as a young assistant secretary of State in Bill Clinton’s administration, she gave the finger, literally, to foreign policy mandarin Richard Holbrooke, in a roomful of diplomats. In 2008, campaigning as a surrogate for Obama, she threw roundhouse rhetorical punches at his rival, Sen. John McCain (creating a feud about which she repeatedly expresses regret).
But she learned from these mistakes, partly after she began taking some heavy punches herself. She quotes (approvingly) the withering critique offered then by her Clinton administration colleague, Ambassador Howard Wolpe: “You are overly directive and intimidate others so much that you quell dissent and stifle contrary advice.”
People who’ve worked with Rice in recent years would say she had to keep re-learning that lesson of humility, and she’s still one of the few senior foreign-policy officials who regularly drops the “F-bomb.” Obama advises her at one point in the White House that her problem is that she lacks a poker face. That’s a telling criticism from Obama, who could be Mr. Cool to a fault.
Rice was battered during what should have been the zenith of her career because of the Benghazi “scandal,” which, as she re-tells it, seems an even more bizarre piece of Republican character assassination than it did at the time. She went on five network Sunday shows to explain the tragedy that had happened there, using “talking points” that had been prepared by the CIA, and was so intensely demonized that her mother and daughter both were badly traumatized.
The Benghazi fallout changed Rice’s life, probably for the better. She withdrew from consideration as secretary of state in Obama’s second term and instead became national security adviser. And she learned to subordinate her own public persona. She describes her role overseeing the National Security Council staff as playing “point guard,” a player that “is rarely the showboat or the high scorer ... but is essential to the cohesion and efficacy of the team.”
Rice acknowledges that the Obama administration’s foreign policy record was “mixed.” The flaws were perhaps most evident in the inability to find a policy that would avert the slaughter in Syria. “My heart and my conscience will forever ache over Syria,” she writes. The larger problem, she explains, is that “we suffered from a mismatch between our stated objectives and the means we were prepared to employ to achieve them — in Libya, Syria, Ukraine and, arguably, Afghanistan.” She has that right.
Behind Rice is the extraordinary figure of Obama, whom she acknowledges was “consistently the smartest guy in the room” whenever the NSC met. It’s impossible not to feel nostalgic for his intelligence and personal reticence these days, as the country is buffeted by a president whose personal qualities are a reverse image of his predecessor.
Obama, lean, austere, almost professorial in his demeanor, was a man who despised flattery and liked to pass the time playing cards, watching sports on television, and thinking about how best to make a difference in the world. How far away that moment seems.

Texto completo: The Justice Department released hundreds of pages of FBI interview notes on Monday featuring a cast of characters from President Trump’s inner circle in the latest batch of documents from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.
The 295 pages of heavily redacted records, focusing on topics spanning from Trump’s frustrations with the Russia investigation and Attorney General Jeff Session’s recusal to the firing of FBI Director James Comey and national security adviser Michael Flynn, are the second such tranche released through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by BuzzFeed.

Mueller’s report concluded the Kremlin interfered during the 2016 election but didn't establish any criminal conspiracy between Russia and Trump's campaign.

Rick Gates, the former business partner of Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, spoke with the FBI on April 18, 2018, about Flynn’s firing and Trump’s anger over Sessions. Gates said he overheard conversations that current Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani wouldn’t have recused, and the agents noted, “Gates knew Giuliani had been the first choice for Attorney General, but turned it down because he wanted to be Secretary of State instead.”

Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer currently serving a prison sentence related to lying to Congress about the timing of the proposed Trump Tower Moscow, spoke with investigators about the guidance given to him by Trump legal team member Jay Sekulow about how to respond to congressional inquiries. Cohen also responded to claims made about him in Christopher Steele’s dossier, with agents writing that “Cohen did not have any concern about the dossier allegations” and “Cohen had never been to Prague,” despite the British ex-spy’s claims.

John Kelly, Trump’s former chief of staff, told the bureau on Aug. 2, 2018, about Trump’s anger with a New York Times story that claimed Trump told then-White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller, which McGahn declined to do. Kelly recounted Trump’s denials about giving such an order to McGahn and his request that McGahn “correct the record,” but Kelly told investigators McGahn told him that he and Trump “did have that conversation.”

Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director, told agents about Trump’s annoyance with Flynn during a Dec. 8, 2017, interview. Investigators noted, “Trump told Hicks that Obama told him to watch out for Flynn” and “Hicks thought the comment sat with Trump more then she expected.” Trump “thought Flynn had bad judgment” and “it bothered Trump that both Flynn and his son sent bad tweets,” according to investigators. An FBI interview on March 13, 2018, included Hicks discussing the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting involving Manafort, Donald Trump Jr., Trump son-in law Jared Kushner, and Russians that included Natalia Veselnitskaya. The agents said Hicks thought the emails setting up the meeting “looked really bad.”

Rod Rosenstein, Trump’s former deputy attorney general, spoke with investigators on May 23, 2017, one week after appointing Mueller special counsel. Rosenstein detailed the May 8, 2017, Oval Office meeting involving himself, Trump, McGahn, Sessions, Sessions’s chief of staff Jody Hunt, and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus centered around Comey, telling investigators, “I knew when I left, Director Comey would be fired.” Rosenstein was tasked with writing a memo detailing his concerns with the bureau’s leader. When Comey was fired on May 9, 2017, Rosenstein told investigators he was “angry, ashamed, horrified, and embarrassed.” Rosenstein contacted Mueller the next day.

Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor and Trump campaign surrogate, told investigators on Feb. 13, 2019, about discussions he’d had with Trump in early 2017. Christie said Trump claimed, “Now that we fired Flynn, the Russia thing is over,” with Christie responding with laughter, saying, “No way.” Christie also said Trump wanted him to call Comey and tell him, “I [Trump] really like him,” but Christie thought it was a bad idea. Christie further claimed he urged Trump not to fire Mueller.

Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager, spoke with bureau agents on April 6, 2018, about a mid-June 2017 meeting where Trump dictated a speech about Mueller and Russia he wanted Lewandowski to give to Sessions to deliver, the crux of which was that his attorney general should declare Trump “didn’t do anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history.” Lewandowski didn’t give the speech to Sessions, instead placing it in a safe at his home, though he passed a typed copy of it to White House deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn on July 19, 2017. Lewandowski provided his handwritten notes from the meeting to the FBI.

The FBI documents also included almost entirely redacted August 2018 interview notes with former Trump aide Omarosa Manigault Newman; a July 17, 2017, interview with former acting Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord about Flynn; FBI special agent Peter Strzok’s interview notes with Flynn from Jan. 24, 2017; the FBI’s June 2017 evidence log about four Comey memos; former Trump campaign executive Steve Bannon’s letter from Mueller about his Jan. 18, 2019, grand jury appearance; a Think Progress article on Russia and the NRA; and 12 FBI interview notes with DOJ top official Bruce Ohr about interactions with Fusion GPS and Steele.

These Reporters Rely on Public Data, Rather Than Sources

Texto completo: LONDON -- Leaked documents and interviews with whistle-blowing sources will always be a part of investigative journalism. But thanks to the rise of digital technology, and the easy availability of data that has gone with it, reporters have more ways to get stories than ever before.
"You can be on your couch in front of your computer and solve a mystery of a missile system downing a plane," said Aliaume Leroy, a journalist who is part of the BBC's Africa Eye team.
Internet sleuths who piece together stories from available data, a practice known as open-source journalism, have helped identify the white nationalists who assaulted counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va.; unmask the Russian intelligence officers who the British government said tried to kill a fellow Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, England; and show that the suspects in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul included associates of Saudi Arabia's crown prince.
With its emphasis on raw facts, open-source journalism has an immediacy that is effective at a time when readers all along the ideological spectrum have become skeptical of the news media.
"If the BBC tells you they've got a source that proves this, the BBC is the middleman and the source is behind it -- you can't see it," Mr. Leroy said. "But if you've got the visual evidence, there is no middleman. You connect directly to the evidence."
The craft of building a story on publicly available data was part of journalism in the analog era, but it has come of age in recent years, with the ubiquity of smartphones and the expansion of social media.
The blogger Eliot Higgins made waves early in the decade by covering the war in Syria from a laptop in his apartment in Leicester, England, while caring for his infant daughter. In 2014, he founded Bellingcat, an open-source news outlet that has grown to include roughly a dozen staff members, with an office in The Hague. Mr. Higgins attributed his skill not to any special knowledge of international conflicts or digital data, but to the hours he had spent playing video games, which, he said, gave him the idea that any mystery can be cracked.
"It's imagination and perseverance," he said. "You look at a problem and say, 'I know I need to do this thing. I know I have this range of tools I can apply to this."'
Thanks to social media and camera-equipped smartphones, a great number of the world's seven billion people cannot help documenting newsworthy events. Open-source journalists at Bellingcat and elsewhere try to track down that evidence and place it in context.
"It's what humans do," said Nick Waters, a Bellingcat investigator. "They are gregarious. They are addicted to social media, because social media platforms are designed to be addictive. And they like sharing their experiences."
The site made a name for itself with its investigation of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014, when the war between Russia-backed separatists and the Ukraine government was raging.
At the time, Bellingcat was a group of volunteers who collaborated mainly over a Slack channel. Relying on photographs of the crash site and Facebook updates, they identified the launcher used in the attack, reporting that it had been moved from Russia to rebel-held territory in Ukraine days before the missile was fired, killing all 298 passengers on board the jet.
In June of this year, a Dutch-led international team of prosecutors indicted three men with ties to Russian military and intelligence agencies in the attack. Moscow has denied any involvement. The site produced a podcast this year detailing the story behind the story.
Hans Pool, a Dutch film director, was inspired to make a documentary about Bellingcat after its reporting on the crash. "It was about a house father in his spare time doing research on the internet," Mr. Pool said. "I was wondering, 'What is this?"' His documentary, "Truth in a Post-Truth World," recently won an International Emmy Award.
Bellingcat alumni, as well as formerly amateur open-source investigators, have found jobs at established news organizations including The New York Times, whose Visual Investigations unit incorporates open-source analysis in its reporting, and the BBC. Open-source analysis also has homes at the University of California, Berkeley, Law School; Amnesty International; the University of London's Forensic Architecture; and Storyful, a news agency bought by News Corporation in 2013.
Bellingcat journalists have spread the word about their techniques in seminars attended by journalists and law-enforcement officials. Along with grants from groups like the Open Society Foundations, founded by George Soros, the seminars are a significant source of revenue for Bellingcat, a nonprofit organization.
The melding of open-source journalism with more traditional methods can be glimpsed in the work of BBC Africa Eye. "It was obvious in 2011 and 2012 that Eliot Higgins was by some margin ahead of established media organizations in discerning from a distance what was going on in Syria," said Daniel Adamson, a BBC producer who helped introduce open-source reporting to the unit.
Africa Eye's 2018 documentary short, "Anatomy of a Killing," a winner of a Peabody Award, shows how the news unit investigated an atrocity. The group started with a viral video of soldiers shooting two women, a young girl and a baby on a dusty rural path. Tipped by an anonymous source -- a favorite tool of the old-school reporter -- Africa Eye's journalists used photos from the satellite imager DigitalGlobe to connect the silhouette of a distant mountain range seen in the video with a region of Cameroon. From there, they nailed down the coordinates to locate the murder site.
They also came up with an estimate of when the crime happened by using Google Earth photographs and treating the soldiers as walking sundials. Further, the soldiers' weaponry indicated that they were part of Cameroon's army, and Africa Eye closed in on the shooters' identities through an overheard nickname and a soldier's Facebook profile. The seven suspects are now awaiting trial.
Open-source journalism has the same vulnerabilities as traditional journalism. A biased reporter or a reliance on sources with an agenda can lead to skewed stories. Some journalists and activists hostile to what they characterize as Bellingcat's pro-Western narratives have criticized some of its coverage of the war in Syria.
At issue is an April 7, 2018, attack on Douma, Syria. Bellingcat reported, based on an analysis of six open-source videos, that it was "highly likely" that Douma civilians had died because of chemical weapons. In March, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons reported that there were "reasonable grounds" to say that chemical weapons had been used in the attack.
Critics of Bellingcat have pointed to an email from an investigator with the organization, saying that it raised questions about the findings. WikiLeaks published the email on Nov. 23. In a response, Bellingcat defended its reporting, saying the final report on Douma from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons reflected the concerns of the investigator whose email was published by WikiLeaks.
Open-source journalism often takes the form of the authors showing their work, a transparency that tends to make their brand of journalism more believable. The documentary "Anatomy of a Killing," for instance, is as much about how the investigators reported on the roadside shootings as the incident itself. The effect is like a magician walking you through each step of a trick.
For champions of open-source journalism, narrative transparency is crucial to the form's credibility. It has also proved useful when its practitioners are attacked by the governments they investigate.
"I've seen some very sane people tell me there weren't chemical attacks in Syria, in the same way I've seen very sane people tell me the Saudis aren't bombing civilians in Yemen -- they're just bombing military targets," said Rawan Shaif, who until recently worked on a Bellingcat project tracking Yemen's civil war. "All you need is that doubt in order for people not to believe facts."
For her, open-source journalism is an antidote to spin.
"You can show people how much information you know and how you know it," Ms. Shaif said, "and they can make their own decisions."

Texto completo: Thanksgiving is over and, predictably, impeachment couldn't be kept off the table. We tried to avoid the dish, we really did. But in my family of Philadelphia-area suburbanites, the very demographic that may decide the 2020 presidential election, the hunger to see where everybody stood couldn't be denied. We are all college-educated, a few of us inclined to wokeness, some members of white-collar unions and therefore left of center, others more concerned with our stock portfolios. Only one beloved aunt was willing to declare her full support for President Trump. The rest had more or less been successfully fed the New York Times' version of events.
There was a widespread belief that the phrase quid pro quo was the name of a type of felony. Roughly the same family members believed this who last Thanksgiving had believed "collusion" was a criminal act. None except the family Trumpist had at all considered how the information they possessed had been packaged for their consumption. Four or five of us were willing to admit that the hearings were "too partisan" and unfair, though the overriding concern wasn't so much devotion to abstract justice as fear that the nation wouldn't swallow the impeachers' conclusions.
Most of my family had concluded from the little they had heard about the impeachment proceedings—even the retirees hadn't watched more than video highlights—that Mr. Trump had done something uniquely bad, even shocking. My family has had little direct experience with politicians. Almost everyone believed that Mr. Trump had tried to pressure the Ukrainian prime minister for his own political gain. No one had read the rough transcript of the call between the two leaders.
We discussed what crime might have been committed, and the most popular option was "extortion." No one present had studied criminal law. Almost everyone thought that Mr. Trump was unpresidential—the epithet "jackass" elicited vigorous nods of agreement—and should be "removed," like a gravy stain from a baby's bib, as soon as possible.
These opinions were asserted with considerable passion, leaving the family Trumpist to stew in her juices. Something approaching rational debate arose only on the question of whether impeachment would benefit the Democrats. No one thought the Democrats had a candidate who could beat Mr. Trump. No one thought the Senate would convict him. Most couldn't comprehend why the hearings so far had failed to move public opinion. The two most woke family members hoped that Mr. Trump would be damaged enough to allow a more radical Democrat to win, but this was generally dismissed as wishful thinking. The moderate Democrats in the family felt that their party's efforts would have been better spent on finding a candidate who didn't want to take away their generous private insurance. No one thought Michael Bloomberg was an appetizing alternative to the current flock of turkeys.
As for me, I had taken the precaution of bringing some decent claret to the festivities, and several of the dishes on the table merited close attention, so I managed to keep my private thoughts to myself—a course of action I have always found to improve digestion after family feasts. Pragmatic soul that I am, when some juvenile inquisitor insists I take sides, demanding, "You're not for Trump, are you?" my standard response is "Compared to whom?" But fortunately the only Manichaean choice imposed on me was between the pecan and spicy pumpkin pie.
I was tempted to opine that if Mr. Trump were impeached and then acquitted by the Senate, he could—and no doubt would—claim loudly during the election to have been exonerated a second time of all wrongdoing, going 2-0 against Democratic "witch hunts." I yielded instead to the safer temptation to lob another scoop of ice cream on my pie. My other unspoken thought was that the Democrats' current impeachment tirade was payback for the Republican's dubious attempt to impeach President Clinton in 1998, and that the Republicans would undoubtedly repeat the whole useless exercise the next time they won the House during a Democratic presidency.
Only one generation of Americans experienced an impeachment proceeding between 1783 and 1973; my generation has witnessed three, and a pattern is beginning to form. One can only hope that the country will eventually learn why regular constitutional order is more productive than engineered political upheavals, or at least that what goes around, comes around. After all, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.

Texto completo: Once upon a time in New York City, two young talents set off on a near-impossible quest: a successful Broadway career. Since childhood, Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell had focused on their quest with a ferocious drive -- and learned to avoid the trolls.
In Long Island, Menzel, the daughter of a pajama salesman, spent her weekends singing at weddings and bar mitzvahs, and otherwise kept her big voice a secret. "No one knew how good I was at school because I didn't want kids to know," admits Menzel today. "I didn't want to be the one to show off."
Meanwhile in Michigan, Bell signed up for every community play and helped support her single mother by modeling underwear and karaoke machines for Kmart catalogs. Classmates would brandish shots of her in a training bra. Bell didn't care. That money would get her to Manhattan.
Both Menzel and Bell arrived at New York U.'s Tisch School of the Arts and began to audition. Menzel got to town a little earlier, and the very first gig she landed was the original Broadway production of "Rent." Her full-throated performance as the sexually fluid performance artist Maureen earned her a Tony nomination -- in part thanks to her cocky delivery of the line, "There's always going to be women in rubber flirting with me!" -- and icon status among theater fans who obsessed over the soundtrack. One of whom was Bell.
"She was such a young queen," Bell says. "She was so powerfully inspiring when I was studying music and theater at NYU."
Menzel made success seem easy. After "Rent," she inaugurated the role of the resentful green-skinned Elphaba in "Wicked," which won her that Tony, and spun her Broadway smashes into thematically adjacent roles in movies including "Kissing Jessica Stein," "Enchanted," the film version of "Rent," and, of course, "Frozen."
Even Menzel's disasters were spun into gold, as when she fell through a trapdoor during the melting scene of her next-to-last performance of "Wicked" and cracked a rib, forcing her to cancel her final show. That night, Menzel put on a track suit and swallowed enough pain medicine to walk onstage during the closing bows. Her show of strength made national headlines, including a farewell salute in The New York Times.
"You have no choice! That's just what you do!" says Menzel. As for that time John Travolta flubbed her name during the Oscars, that, too, became a blessing. "It ended up being this really wonderful mistake that helped ingratiate me to people. Anyone that didn't know me knew me now, and anyone that did know me was more supportive."
"It's hard to go unnoticed when you sing like Idina," Bell says. To most people, Menzel's career seems a string of mega-hits, as though, like her fantastic characters Elphaba and snow queen Elsa, she was born with a superpower she simply had to harness. To her, however, the fairytale story has crumpled pages.
"If you look at the time in between those jobs, they're close to a decade," Menzel says. "In those off-times, I have gotten very insecure and felt that I couldn't get a job, and was dropped from record labels, and had to go on many an auditions that I didn't get. Having a career that goes up and down has made me really appreciate when I do have success. I know the real deal -- the days where nobody is calling and you feel like crap."
As for Bell, she, too, found success fast. Bell scored her first Broadway gig as Becky Thatcher in "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" before she could graduate college. A year later, she was onstage alongside Liam Neeson and Laura Linney in a revival of "The Crucible."
"I have always been a hustler," says Bell. "I've been really, really, really lucky that at the times I was available and ready to audition, someone was in need of a 5'1" blonde with a little bit of quirk."
Bell had always planned to spend her career on the stage. Yet, now that she was a 22-year-old Broadway veteran, Bell began to think about a trip she'd taken to Los Angeles when she was 14. Though money was tight, her mother had agreed to fly her precocious daughter to meet a Hollywood agent. She and her mother walked down Hollywood Boulevard to look at the stars, and Bell was struck by how many names she didn't recognize.
"I was taken aback by the sheer number of people that have contributed to the arts here," Bell says. "It made me realize how many artists there are in the world."
She chose to stay committed to finishing high school and studying theater in New York. But when her LA-based co-stars in the Off Broadway production of "Reefer Madness" urged her to join them in California, on a whim, Bell decided to see if her happily-ever-after was on the other coast.
"I definitely heard from numerous adults in my life that cared about me, 'Have a backup plan, have a backup plan, have a backup plan.' But I also heard from some other artists, 'If you have a plan to fall back on, you'll fall back,'" says Bell.
"So I just decided to go for broke -- I've always been an optimist." Within a week, Bell booked a guest spot on "The Shield." Within a year, she was cast as the lead on "Veronica Mars."
Still, even after proving she could charm audiences in every genre from crime-fighting teenagers to bitter comedies ("Forgetting Sarah Marshall," "Bad Moms") and cerebral sitcoms ("The Good Place"), Bell was nervous when she finally met Menzel.
"I'd always looked up to her," Bell says. "You could never have convinced me that the first time I would meet her would be at her house to practice a duet to present to Disney executives after the 'Frozen' reading."
The two spent an afternoon perfecting a duet of "The Wind Beneath My Wings," the ultimate ode to sisterly love. Finally, Bell admitted that it felt surreal to sing in person alongside a voice she'd known so intimately on tape.
"She was incredibly gracious," says Bell, "but also looked at me in a way that was like, 'OK, you can be excited, but also, we're trying to get this job, so let's do the work.'"
On audition day, they sang the Bette Midler mega-hit while staring deeply into each other's eyes. At the end, according to "Frozen" director Jennifer Lee, the entire room was misty-eyed. Yet Bell says she and Menzel burst into giggles at the absurdity of sharing this big moment in a generic boardroom. "And then," says Bell, "we went on this crazy eight-year adventure together."
"Frozen" became the highest-grossing film of 2013, raking in more than $1.2 billion worldwide, and it won Oscars for animated film and original song, thanks to Menzel's showcase "Let It Go." In the past six years, the property has snowballed into books, costumes, toys, theme-park rides, Norwegian tours, holiday specials, ice skating shows, and, of course, live musical theater. And on Nov. 22, Disney released "Frozen 2," the same week that Bell and Menzel received stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in a joint ceremony. That's harmony.
The two girls who dreamed of making it on Broadway will now have their names engraved into Los Angeles' Hollywood Boulevard. It's a little ironic, but the timing is apt -- particularly for Menzel, whose dramatic turn as a jilted wife in the Adam Sandler thriller "Uncut Gems" is one of the year's best surprises -- and one in which she doesn't sing a note.
"I want to push myself in all different directions. It'd be fun to let people see the other side of the Disney princess -- or queen," she corrects herself. "There is a more raw, quote-unquote, uglier side that I would not be afraid to show."
In that spirit, Bell has a pitch for Menzel when the two are octogenarians: a musical version of "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane." "That would be a nice way to go out, right?!"
"I love that she's got us booked when we're 80!" laughs Menzel when she hears of Bell's plans. "I'd like to figure out what we can do two years from now, but that's cool!"

"Queer Eye" star Van Ness grooms "furious but joyful" stand-up act

Texto completo: On his stand-up comedy tour, Jonathan Van Ness briefly discusses starring in Netflix’s reboot of “Queer Eye.”
“I talk about punctuality, my relationship with the boys a little bit. It’s not a heavy part of my act,” Van Ness, 32, said in an interview.
Being the “Queer Eye” grooming expert has presented new career paths, including the “Road to Beijing” comedy tour.
The tour offers “just flat-out some of the most incredible opportunities and most incredible nights of my life,” Van Ness said. He rhapsodizes rapidly about getting onstage to “explore my voice and my stand-up comedy style and create a night for people to come together and laugh and just be really joyful and happy, but also mad as hell, too, about our political climate.”
When he gets political, he stresses, he does so in a “furious but joyful way. My style of comedy is storytelling with a lot of setup and punchlines. It’s storytelling, it’s very languid. I will go off the rails sometimes.”
The tour’s name, “Road to Beijing,” signifies his interest in getting to the Olympics.
“I started figure skating right around when I got to book this tour,” he says. “I was like ‘if I start figure skating now, I could maybe get to the Beijing Olympics in 2022,’ which is the next Winter Games. When I got a quarter of the way through the tour, I was like, ‘Oh, my God, I could do gymnastics onstage and no one could leave in the middle of the show.’ I’m just so happy to be doing gymnastics within my stand-up set.”
He notes the Summer Games will take place next year. “I just want to go to the Olympics somehow. Maybe comedy will get me there.”
In his act, Van Ness talks about his memoir, “Over the Top,” a bit more since the book was released in September. He worked on it for nearly two years, and he writes about his HIV-positive status, being a sexual abuse survivor and his addictions to drugs and sex. The book’s subtitle is “A Raw Journey to Self-Love,” and the writing is raw.
“I felt like I needed to be very frank to gain that understanding that I was looking for,” he said.
In an interview with The New York Times, he revealed having nightmares before the book’s release.
“The anxiety has definitely gone away, but I’m just excited to continue to work,” he said. “The book was a jumping-off point to continue my work in terms of advocacy.”
Response to the book has been “overwhelmingly positive,” he said. “It was a nerve-racking project, but I was eager to do it, and I’m glad I did. It shows there’s a lot of suffering and misunderstanding around living with HIV still. There’s a lot of work still to be done. My personal support, I feel like people were supportive and I felt a lot of love, but for people living with HIV generally, there’s still so much discrimination and stigmatizing and misunderstanding that I’m still eager to work on.”
He told The Times, “I want people to realize you’re never too broken to be fixed.”
That message is for anyone, he says. “Talking about addiction, I think there are lot of people who feel they’ve been damaged beyond repair,” he says. “I don’t think that is the case. Whether it’s anxiety, depression, addiction, whatever your compulsivity is, if you have a will to heal, you are healable, you are lovable.”
On tour, comedy is the main topic. He cites his series “Gay of Thrones,” which recaps “Game of Thrones,” in helping shape his timing, delivery, improv skills and ability to stick to a script. His approach to stand-up was influenced, he said, by “female comedians I grew up loving and watching,” notably Margaret Cho, Lisa Lampanelli, Ellen DeGeneres and Janeane Garofalo.
He credits “Queer Eye” for making his career more expansive – including the “Getting Curious” podcast – and changing his life. “Queer Eye,” which arrived last year, took him from full-time hairdresser to author, stand-up comedian and TV star.
“Before ‘Queer Eye, I was doing great, and I’m so grateful I still feel that way,” he said. “It’s opened up a lot of doors for me. It also has given me a lot more pleasure because I want to do right by this platform and by the opportunity and by my community.”

Texto completo: The holiday season is typically an indulgent time, especially when it comes to food and drink consumption. For people who struggle with body-image issues, food and weight-related health problems, including and especially eating disorders, this time of year can be stressful. We spoke with experts to offer tips that can help you navigate the season and its attendant anxieties: the meals, the parties and the people.
Be honest about who’s safe for you and who isn’t
The holiday season is one in which we find ourselves reconnecting with family and old friends we don’t often see. Gravitate toward those who are grateful and happy to see you, and away from the people who are apt to make cutting comments.
“In general, we know who’s going to be emotionally more safe for us,” said Leslie Connor, a private-practice psychologist in Wilmington, Delaware. She recommends keeping interactions with “toxic” people as brief as possible.
How can you identify toxic people? Pay attention to how conversations make you feel: Do you feel drained, or do you feel energized? Do you feel bad about yourself - or empowered?
“When we’re at a family gathering, you kind of know who’s uncensored and just going to say what they think, whether it’s kind or not,” Connor said.
Help others by creating
a welcoming environment
“I encourage people to be supportive and not to ask probing questions or give unnecessary advice,” said Ed Abramson, a professor emeritus at California State University. Comments about weight will only serve to make someone with an eating disorder or issue more defensive and create barriers to communication. “If you do want to say something,” Abramson said, “basically what you want to communicate is: ‘How can I help you?’ ”
Connor agrees. “Your job is to be welcoming, warm and accepting of the people you’re with,” she said, “and that goes a long way.” If you do have a gaffe and comment on someone’s weight, “you can always apologize,” Abramson said. “But if that’s not appropriate or it doesn’t seem to work very well, gracefully focus on something else.”
Set boundaries
ahead of time
Whitney Catalano, a registered dietitian who works with clients to improve their relationships with food and their bodies, recommends telling the people you trust about your recovery before holiday gatherings, so you can set expectations and conditions for socializing. She suggests saying something like: “Just so you know, I don’t want to get into it more than this, but I’ve been healing my relationship with food and I’m particularly sensitive to diet talk or body talk right now.” Ask them to refrain from conversations about dieting or body image. You may have to wait to have this conversation in person, but try to do it right off the bat so you don’t have to think about it.
Friends could be more amenable to your requests than family members, who may feel entitled to comment on your body and weight. Catalano said it’s important to be direct and honest with your relatives, even if they’re the ones who taught you to hate your body or fear food in the first place.
“Pick a time to have this conversation when everyone’s defenses are low,” she said. “Set boundaries for what they can and cannot talk about in front of you, and then make sure to enforce those boundaries if they cross any.”
You don’t have
to please anyone
When someone comments on your food choices, you don’t have to engage. You can respond with a slightly disinterested “Oh?” and then either turn away or ask a question - “Have you watched ‘Succession’?” - to change the topic. “You don’t have to attend every conversation you’re invited to,” said Sophie Carter-Kahn, a writer and the host of the podcast “She’s All Fat.”
It’s also important to remember that it is the other person’s choice to create the situation. “It’s not your job to smooth everything over, to make yourself smaller to accommodate someone else’s ideas of how the world should be,” she said.
Food anxiety doesn’t have to turn into food panic
Between Thanksgiving, Friendsgiving and winter holiday parties, this season can be overwhelming for anyone whose relationship with food is fraught. “The holidays are a perfect storm of food and body anxiety,” Catalano said. “Don’t be surprised if your relationship with food feels particularly out of control during this time.”
She suggests two ways to weather the storm: First make a list of people, foods and situations that are likely to trigger disordered eating patterns or negative thoughts. Second, in the moment, name the experience by acknowledging that the negative diet and body image thoughts are happening, but that they do not have to dictate your actions. “Allow it to be a challenge,” Catalano said, “while also making a promise to yourself to not make any body or lifestyle decisions from a place of panic.”
No food is ‘bad’ food
“Certain foods get demonized,” like starches or gluten or fat, Abramson said, “and that gets exacerbated when someone has an eating disorder. But a balanced diet can include occasional foods that are problematic.”
If you’re struggling with allowing yourself to enjoy “bad” foods during the holidays, try to redirect your thoughts to the benefits of the meal. “Food is not just fuel, it’s cultural, celebratory and delicious. You are allowed to eat foods just because they are delicious or emotionally nourishing,” Catalano said.
Abramson suggests a dual approach to managing food anxiety. One is the more cognitive method of telling yourself: “I can allow myself modest amounts of it and be OK.”
The other is to use anxiety-reduction techniques like deep breathing, alternating between muscle tension and muscle relaxation, meditating or praying. “Whatever an individual can learn to do to decrease anxiety would be helpful when they’re confronted with the food,” Abramson said.
Go ahead and be the judge
Catalano warns against setting strict limits on food consumption during the holidays. “The best thing you can do to prepare for holiday dinners is to eat full meals leading up to the meal and center yourself right before eating so you don’t go into it anxious. It’s normal in diet culture to restrict or starve as a way of ‘earning’ the big holiday meal, but this will only cause you to overeat and feel way worse,” she said.
One piece of advice Catalano gives her clients to help them calm down from food anxiety is to “treat your meal like you’re a judge on ‘Chopped’ or any other Food Network show. How’s the presentation? What does it smell like? How’s the texture? Do the flavors go well together? Is the food lacking any flavor? What would you rate this meal if it were presented to you on a cooking show?” This exercise, she said, can “redirect the conversation away from diet talk because you’re focusing instead on the actual experience of eating.”
Bear in mind that the only way you can maintain balance is to say no to certain things, so if you have to pass on your brother-in-law’s best friend’s ugly sweater party in order to make it to a yoga class, catch up on “Real Housewives of New Jersey” or sleep, so be it.

Texto completo: Over his career Mr. Biondi was chief executive at HBO, Viacom, Universal Studios and the television and movie division of Coca-Cola.
Frank Biondi Jr., whose financial and managerial expertise helped earn him the chief executive jobs at three entertainment giants -- HBO, Viacom and Universal Studios -- died on Monday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 74.
His daughter Anne Simonds said the cause was bladder cancer.
Unlike some of the men he worked for, Mr. Biondi was not flashy. He was a quiet deal maker known for giving savvy financial presentations and allowing executives beneath him the freedom to do their work without his interference.
"My basic job is to enhance the value of the assets and get some of the debt down," he said in an interview with The New York Times in 1987, when he took over at Viacom. "It plays on the financial skills that I have had."
During his nine years with Viacom. the company acquired Paramount Pictures and Blockbuster Entertainment, the video chain. But Mr. Biondi operated in the all-enveloping shadow of Sumner Redstone, the impulsive billionaire who acquired Viacom in early 1987 and became its chairman.
"I'm C.E.O., but if you read the press, I don't exist," Mr. Biondi told The New Yorker when it profiled him in 1995. "Sumner is the embodiment of this place." Asked if his relative anonymity frustrated him, he added: "Sure. It's not his fault. It just works out that way."
But Mr. Biondi's enthusiasm about the entertainment colossus he was helping to build ended less than a year later, when Mr. Redstone fired him, reportedly over Paramount's faltering box-office performance. Mr. Biondi said his relationship with the mercurial Mr. Redstone had soured as Mr. Redstone took an increasingly hands-on role.
"We weren't having as much fun as we did eight years ago," Mr. Biondi told The Times after his dismissal.
A few months later, he was hired to run Universal Studios. Again he was at the mercy of another wealthy owner-investor, Edgar Bronfman Jr., a scion of the family that owned the Seagram distillery company; he had acquired MCA, Universal's parent company, in 1995.
But Universal's motion picture division had financial problems, and Mr. Biondi was forced out after two years in a corporate restructuring. He said at the time that Mr. Bronfman, like Mr. Redstone, had wanted to be more hands-on.
"Is it shocking? No," Mr. Biondi told The Los Angeles Times. "Is it a bit of a surprise? Sure."
Universal would be his last corporate job.
Frank Joseph Biondi Jr. was born on Jan. 9, 1945, in Manhattan and raised in Livingston, N.J. His father was a chemical engineer who had worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II and later for Bell Laboratories. His mother, Virginia (Willis) Biondi, was a homemaker.
At Princeton University, where he played center field on the baseball team, Mr. Biondi graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology. He earned an M.B.A. at Harvard Business School.
Mr. Biondi worked at several Wall Street brokerages and set up a financial consulting firm before he went to work in 1972 for TelePrompTer, an early cable television franchise in New York City. He left in 1973 to join the nonprofit Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) as assistant treasurer. The company was producing groundbreaking shows like "Sesame Street" and "The Electric Company."
"They've done something remarkable in the programming business," Mr. Biondi told the Cable Center, a nonprofit educational organization, in 2000, "and here we were trying to make sure it was institutionalized."
He moved to HBO in 1978 for a programming job, and after five years was named president and chief executive. He was part of the team -- which also included Michael Fuchs, who ha brought him to the company -- that turned HBO into a television powerhouse. The close friendship between Mr. Biondi and Mr. Fuchs ended when Mr. Biondi, not Mr. Fuchs, was named chief executive.
During his time at HBO, the company, then a part of Time Inc., acquired exclusive rights to show films made by Columbia Pictures and Orion Pictures; started a new studio, Tri-Star Pictures, with Columbia and CBS; and built a new satellite uplink facility on Long Island.
Mr. Fuchs recalled in a phone interview that Mr. Biondi had not ruffled feathers and had not been a difficult outsize character, as many executives in the entertainment business were.
"He was like a unicorn," Mr. Fuchs said. "At his level he was a singular exception. At HBO, I used him as my other half; he was more conservative and financial than I am. I'm all instinct."
In October 1984, amid concerns at Time Inc. about the slowing of HBO's once dramatic subscriber growth, Mr. Biondi left over what were called "policy differences." He was replaced by Mr. Fuchs.
Soon after, Mr. Biondi resurfaced as the executive vice president of Coca-Cola's entertainment business sector, which included Columbia Pictures. He later became chairman of Coca-Cola Television. While there, his biggest deals were the acquisitions of Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio's Embassy Communications and Merv Griffin's production company.
He wasn't there long before Mr. Redstone hired him to run Viacom.
In the Cable Center interview, Mr. Biondi recalled his last encounter with Mr. Redstone.
"He said, 'I want to make a change,"' Mr. Biondi said. "'I always wanted to run my own company. It's been great. I'll be great.' It hit the tape about 4:00 right after the market closed, and about 4:05 I got a call from Edgar Bronfman."
In addition to his daughter Anne, Mr. Biondi is survived by his wife, Carol (Oughton) Biondi; another daughter, Jane Biondi Munna; six grandchildren; and a brother, Robert.
In recent years, Mr. Biondi ran a fund that invested in new media and other companies, like Tennis Channel -- an outgrowth of his devotion to playing the sport -- and sat on numerous corporate boards. In a text, Ken Solomon, the channel's president, said, "There would be no Tennis Channel without Frank Biondi."
Sherry Lansing, the former chairwoman of Paramount Pictures, remembered Mr. Biondi as a widely liked figure.
"Whether he said yes or no to you, he was beloved because he did it with such balance and respect," Ms. Lansing said by phone. "He was calm in good times and bad."

NBA clears remaining salary of Mozgov

Texto completo: The NBA has removed Timofey Mozgov's $16.7 million salary from the Orlando Magic's books after approving the career-ending injury/illness waiver request the team filed last month.
Magic president of basketball operations Jeff Weltman confirmed the league's ruling, but he declined to comment further. The league's decision will remove roughly $5.6 million from Orlando's cap this season, as well as $5.6 million from each of the next two seasons.
Shams Charania of Stadium and The Athletic first reported the NBA had approved Orlando's application on Wednesday.
The Magic waived Mozgov in July and stretched his $16.7 million salary, meaning the team would take a cap hit of nearly $5.6 million over three consecutive seasons starting with 2019-20. Mozgov, who helped the Cavaliers win the NBA title in 2016, was entering the final year of a four-year contract he originally signed as a free agent with the Lakers before the 2016-17 season.
Orlando acquired Mozgov from Charlotte, which got Bismack Biyombo in return, prior to the 2018-19 season as part of a three-team trade that also included Chicago. Mozgov, however, did not appear in a game for the Magic last season as he dealt with a knee injury. He had an arthroscopic procedure on the knee in January.
Not knowing if or when Mozgov was going to be able to play, Orlando decided to reduce the cap hit of his $16.7 million salary by waiving Mozgov in July and stretching his contract. Part of the money they freed up was used to sign free-agent forward Al-Farouq Aminu.
About a month later, Mozgov, 33, signed a one-year contract with Russian club Khimki Moscow but he continued to be hampered by the knee injury, according to reports. As of Wednesday, he still had not appeared in any of Khimki's 10 EuroLeague games.
The injury prompted the Magic to consider using the league's career-ending injury/illness provisions and they officially filed their application in October. Marc Stein of The New York Times was among the first to report that Orlando was seeking the waiver.
If a player is diagnosed with what is believed to be a career-ending injury or illness, his team can apply for salary cap relief one year after he last appeared in a game, according to NBA rules and the league's Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Heat recently used the provision with Chris Bosh (blood clots).
If Mozgov were to return and play for Khimki, his salary would be put back on the Magic's cap sheet, according to Keith Smith of Yahoo! Sports.
Mozgov, who averaged 6.8 points and 4.9 rebounds per contest in 454 career NBA games, still will receive his remaining salary, according to reports.
Orlando, meanwhile, now sits roughly $7.8 million under the luxury tax, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks. He also reports the Magic now have a $10.7 million buffer on the hard cap.
Marks also tweeted that Mozgov joins Bosh, Omer Asik, Mirza Teletovic, Nikola Pekovic and Aaron Gray as players whose salary has been removed in the past three years because of a long-term injury waiver.
The Magic could utilize the money on several fronts: to help facilitate a trade or sign a free agent this season, or use it toward future signings. It's important to keep in mind that the $5.6 million comes off the Magic's books each of the next two seasons. Third-year players Jonathan Isaac and Markelle Fultz will be eligible for rookie-scale extensions next season.
Mozgov, meanwhile, told Russian news agency TASS in August that he felt doctors in the U.S. had misdiagnosed his injury.
"There is some progress in my knee injury recovery, although not as speedy as it should be since it is an old-time trauma," Mozgov said. "I don't want to make wrongful accusations in regard to American doctors, but their treatment of my injury was not quite correct.
"It seems to me at the moment that they have been treating me based on a wrong diagnosis. Nothing terrible has happened, but the injury has aggravated as the time went by."

Texto completo: As she took a morning stroll on the beach in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, last week while attending Slugfest, a three-day conference featuring top Major League Baseball hitting coaches, Rachel Balkovec paused to greet a fellow early riser.
Was she attending the conference? the woman asked.
Yes.
"Oh?"the woman replied. "Who are you married to?"
It was the kind of stereotypical response that Balkovec, 32, has been battling for years in baseball, and one that she hopes to continue to break down when she reports to Tampa on Feb.1 to become a minor league hitting coach for the Yankees.She is believed to be the first woman hired as a full-time hitting coach by a big-league team.
Club officials said they hired Balkovec based on qualifications --including two master's degrees in the science of human movement and experience at several minor league clubs-- that were a natural fit with the coaching crew being assembled for next season. "It's an easy answer to why we chose Rachel for this role,"said Yankees hitting coordinator Dillon Lawson. "She's a good hitting coach, and a good coach, period."
Lawson met Balkovec while they were both working for the Houston Astros in 2016,he as a minor league hitting coach and she as the team's Latin American strength and conditioning coordinator.She had taught herself Spanish to be a more effective coach.
In 2018,she became the strength and conditioning coach for the Astros'Double-A Corpus Christi Hooks.

A little nostalgia for the Obama years

Texto completo: Reading Susan Rice's new memoir, 'Tough Love,' is a reminder of two things: what a remarkably gifted, subtle but maddeningly distant man President Barack Obama was; and how people such as Rice who served him endured ceaseless public attacks in a country that was already on the ragged edge, though we didn't yet know it.
Washington memoirs are most valuable for the parts that aren't about what the author did at the office. That's especially true of this account by the former national security adviser. The riveting passages are where Rice tells the private story that was hidden: her parents' brutal divorce, her mother's death, her children's struggles with their mother's public vilification.
Good memoirs always have a quality the Germans define as a bildungsroman, a novel of the principal character's education in the world. That's true with Rice's tale: She was an African American who triumphed in the elite world of prep schools, Ivy League colleges and Rhodes scholarships. She embodied the intellect and ambition these institutions aspired to produce, even as she masked a shattered family where her parents 'fought ugly and often,' she writes, and her home life was 'like a civil war battlefield.'
David Brooks, the New York Times columnist, describes the distinction between 'résumé virtues,' the tokens of meritocratic success, and 'eulogy virtues' that truly define someone's character. Rice's story and, indeed, Obama's combine both in a compelling but sometimes unstable mix.
For all her privilege, Rice was famously pugnacious. In 1999, as a young assistant secretary of state in Bill Clinton's administration, she gave the finger, literally, to foreign policy mandarin Richard Holbrooke, in a roomful of diplomats. In 2008, campaigning as a surrogate for Obama, she threw roundhouse rhetorical punches at his rival, Sen. John McCain (creating a feud about which she repeatedly expresses regret).
But she learned from these mistakes, partly after she began taking some heavy punches herself. She quotes (approvingly) the withering critique offered then by her Clinton administration colleague, Ambassador Howard Wolpe: 'You are overly directive and intimidate others so much that you quell dissent and stifle contrary advice.'
People who've worked with Rice in recent years would say she had to keep relearning that lesson of humility, and she's still one of the few senior foreign-policy officials who regularly drops the f-bomb. Obama advised her at one point in the White House that her problem was that she lacked a poker face. That's a telling criticism from Obama, who could be Mr. Cool to a fault.
Rice was battered during what should have been the zenith of her career because of the Benghazi 'scandal,' which, as she retells it, seems an even more bizarre piece of Republican character assassination than it did at the time. She went on five network Sunday shows to explain the tragedy that had happened there, using 'talking points' that had been prepared by the CIA, and was so intensely demonized that her mother and daughter both were badly traumatized.
The Benghazi fallout changed Rice's life, probably for the better. She withdrew from consideration as secretary of state in Obama's second term and instead became national security adviser. And she learned to subordinate her own public persona. She describes her role overseeing the National Security Council staff as playing 'point guard,' a player that 'is rarely the showboat or the high scorer . . . but is essential to the cohesion and efficacy of the team.'
Rice acknowledges that the Obama administration's foreign policy record was 'mixed.' The flaws were perhaps most evident in the inability to find a policy that would avert the slaughter in Syria. 'My heart and my conscience will forever ache over Syria,' she writes. The larger problem, she explains, is that 'we suffered from a mismatch between our stated objectives and the means we were prepared to employ to achieve them " in Libya, Syria, Ukraine and, arguably, Afghanistan.' She has that right.
Behind Rice is the extraordinary figure of Obama, whom she acknowledges was 'consistently the smartest guy in the room' whenever the NSC met. It's impossible not to feel nostalgic for his intelligence and personal reticence these days, as the country is buffeted by a president whose personal qualities are a reverse image of his predecessor.
Obama, lean, austere, almost professorial in his demeanor, was a man who despised flattery and liked to pass the time playing cards, watching sports on television and thinking about how best to make a difference in the world. How far away that moment seems this Thanksgiving week.

Texto completo: When filmmakers Bruce Johnson and Christine Toy Johnson first embarked on their journey to document the life of Wataru (Wat) Misaka in their 2009 documentary, “Transcending: The Wat Misaka Story,” one of their first stops was the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass. Wat was nowhere to be found in the hall and they were particularly surprised to see Wat absent from the NBA Diversity display. They asked to meet with the director who declined by saying, “Wat is really no more than an interesting trivia question.”
Wat passed away on Nov. 20, 2019, at the age of 95. His basketball accomplishments were well memorialized by the Salt Lake Tribune’s Kurt Kragthorpe and by The New York Times.
It was in New York where Wat helped lead the University of Utah to their only two national championships. It is now widely known that Wat, a Japanese American, was the first person of color to play in the Basketball Association of America, better known today as the National Basketball Association, and lesser known that he is the first collegiate player ever drafted into professional basketball.
I have always wondered why the university never retired Wat’s number, considering his historical significance on and off the court. Utah state Sen. Jani Iwamoto was once told that Wat’s basketball resume, “doesn’t make it through the required hoops.”
The “required hoops” are criteria drawn up several decades ago which include playing for one’s country in an international tournament; being a first team all-American and a two-time all-conference player or conference player of the year and playing four years.
Indeed, Wat does not meet any of these criteria. But context is everything.
Wat played at the University of Utah during and after World War II, winning the NCAA and NIT Championships in 1944 and 1947, respectively. While the 1944 Olympics were cancelled due to the war, it is difficult to imagine a non-white, let alone an American of Japanese descent, being named to a national team when the war in the Pacific was at its height and Japanese Americans all along the West Coast were being interned in camps including at Topaz in Delta, Utah.
Upon returning from his army service in 1946, he had to try out for the team again, even though his 1944 championship teammates, Arnie Ferrin and Dick Smuin, automatically got their roster spots back. To add Great Salt Lake salt to the wound, Coach Vadal Peterson had already re-assigned Wat’s jersey number, 21.
Wat told me that he faced relentless racial taunts at opposing gyms. Peterson ended up not starting Wat to help avoid the anti-Japanese sentiment but when he did sub Wat in, Wat would stay in for the rest of the game. If Wat wasn’t even a starter on his own team, how could he ever have been considered for first team all-American, all-conference or conference player of the year?
An Ogden native and a barber’s son, Wat, attended Weber College to save on housing and work to help pay for tuition. He ended up playing for Weber for two years, where he won MVP at a regional tournament before transferring to Utah.
The only player whose number retired by the University of Utah but did not meet all criteria is Andrew Bogut, who did not play all four years but received an exemption as for being named National Player of the Year.
Wat did hold National Player of the Year, Ralph Beard, to just one point in Utah’s 49-45 victory over the Goliath Kentucky Wildcats in the 1948 NIT Championship Game. Cal Lundquist of the United Press wrote:
“It was hard to pick the hero of the victory that they fought hardest of all to grab, but in the final analysis, little old Wat Misaka, an American-born Japanese who served with U.S. intelligence units during the war, stood out like a handful of very sore thumbs.”
Wat “Kilowatt” Misaka was more than a spark off the bench, more than a NCAA and NIT championship player and most definitely more than “an interesting answer to a trivia question.”
Wat remains a beacon for Utah basketball’s glorious and unduplicated championship seasons. He was a beacon of hope and pride for Japanese Americans, many who were unjustly incarcerated by their own government. Wat is also overwhelmingly deserving of an exception. May his beacon No. 21 permanently hang in the rafters of the University of Utah’s Huntsman Center.

Texto completo: The journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault discusses a "worrisome development" in our democracy. Also: Child labor and chocolate; the suffering in Venezuela; Virginia's energy policy.
To the Editor:
Re "Finding the Tools to Spot, and Fight, Intolerance in Schools" (news article, Nov. 24):
Having examined this disturbing phenomenon in my "PBS News Hour" series looking at solutions to racism, let me hasten to say that intolerance is a worrisome development that is germinating in the underbelly of our democracy. And like so many other troubling challenges, it needs to be called out every bit as much as interference in our electoral processes, if not more.
Our children are our future, and while in my reporting I have found that our history -- that is, the history of all our people -- is not being taught in most schools these days, the need to combat malicious memes that are trying to fill that gap needs all the attention it can get.
Our union may never be perfect, but we owe it to our children to educate them perfectly.

The Child Labor Behind the Chocolate You Eat
To the Editor:
In "Can a Company Be Virtuous and Profitable?" (Sunday Business, Nov. 17), The Times examines how Nestlé, the world's largest food company, is attempting to prove environmental sustainability and boost revenues at the same time. But the article has a major blind spot -- overlooking Nestlé's repeated failure to eradicate exploitation in its production of chocolate.
Approximately two-thirds of the world's cocoa supply comes from West Africa, where, according to the Department of Labor, over two million children are exploited as child laborers and slaves. The world's biggest chocolate companies have repeatedly missed deadlines to eliminate child labor from their cocoa supply chains, a report this past summer found.
Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights is teaching students how to take action -- by writing letters to company chief executives, urging them to protect their fellow children, and by educating their friends and neighbors by handing out fair trade chocolates and fact sheets about labor practices. The students have learned that injustice often envelops the chocolate bars and treats that they eat.
When we focus on sustainability, we need to care as much about the labor force.

Sanctions and Venezuela
To the Editor:
"Venezuelan Kids Are Dying. Are We to Blame?," by Nicholas Kristof (column, Nov. 24), describes my country's very sad reality.
Sanctions have not worked (and will not). But they give the government an excuse to blame someone other than itself.
If sanctions are here to stay, they need to be restructured in a way that will not cause suffering among ordinary citizens, like malnutrition and other medical conditions.
As Mr. Kristof reports, "the suffering is incalculable." The humanitarian catastrophe that started in Venezuela many years ago may well spread to the rest of our continent if the proper measures are not taken.

Fossil Fuels in Virginia
To the Editor:
Re "After Outcry Over Blackface, Virginia's Governor Rebounds" (front page, Nov. 12):
Virginia Democrats, having won control of the Legislature for the first time in a generation, are eager to advance their agenda by working with Gov. Ralph Northam. But viewing Virginia's off-year election in purely partisan colors obscures significant voter concerns that both parties' establishments have yet to address.
Consider this: In a bid to salvage its influence over Virginia's energy policy, Dominion Energy -- the state's biggest corporate campaign donor by far -- increased its political giving by more than 35 percent over any past election cycle this decade.
Yet this largess failed to prevent the election of nearly 50 candidates -- including all eight who flipped seats to Democrats -- who pointedly refused its money.
Until recently, taking Dominion's money and supporting its self-serving legislative proposals were widely considered de rigueur by both parties. Virginians know that Dominion has amassed hundreds of millions in excess profits as Virginia families struggle to afford their electric bills.
Rural landowners and environmental justice advocates have united in opposition to Dominion's proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline. And the fact that sinking billions of captive customer dollars into that fossil fuel project flies in the face of Governor Northam's well-received call for 100 percent zero-carbon electricity by 2050 has not gone unnoticed.
The next General Assembly, and the governor, have a clear mandate to put an end to the special favors that enrich monopoly utilities at great cost to Virginians.

Texto completo: Washington • President Donald Trump had already been briefed on a whistleblower’s complaint about his dealings with Ukraine when he unfroze military aid for the country in September, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Lawyers from the White House counsel’s office told Trump in late August about the complaint, explaining that they were trying to determine whether they were legally required to give it to Congress, the people said.
The revelation could shed light on Trump’s thinking at two critical points under scrutiny by impeachment investigators: his decision in early September to release $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine and his denial to a key ambassador around the same time that there was a “quid pro quo” with Kyiv. Trump used the phrase before it had entered the public lexicon in the Ukraine affair.
Trump faced bipartisan pressure from Congress when he released the aid. But the new timing detail shows that he was also aware at the time that the whistleblower had accused him of wrongdoing in withholding the aid and in his broader campaign to pressure Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to conduct investigations that could benefit Trump’s reelection chances.
The complaint from the whistleblower, a CIA officer who submitted it to the inspector general for the intelligence community in mid-August, put at the center of that pressure campaign a July 25 phone call between the presidents, which came at a time when Trump had already frozen the aid to the Ukrainian government. Trump asked that Zelenskiy “do us a favor,” then brought up the investigations he sought, alarming White House aides who conveyed their concerns to the whistleblower.

The White House declined to comment.
The whistleblower complaint, which would typically be submitted to lawmakers who have oversight of the intelligence agencies, first came to light as the subject of an administration tug of war. In late August, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, concluded that the administration needed to send it to Congress.
But the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his deputy John Eisenberg disagreed. They decided that the administration could withhold from Congress the whistleblower’s accusations because they were protected by executive privilege. The lawyers told Trump they planned to ask the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel to determine whether they had to disclose the complaint to lawmakers.
A week later, the Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the administration did not have to hand over the complaint.
It is unclear how much detail the lawyers provided Trump about the complaint. The New York Times reported in September that White House advisers — namely, Cipollone and Eisenberg — knew about the whistleblower complaint in August. But the specifics of when and how Trump learned of it have not previously been reported.
The whistleblower, whose identity has not been made public, accused Trump of abusing his power by inviting a foreign power to interfere on his behalf in the 2020 election. He described the pressure campaign to get Zelenskiy to publicly commit to investigations of Democrats that could potentially benefit Trump and suggested that a temporary hold that the administration had placed on assistance to Ukraine, which is fighting a war against Russian proxy forces, might be related to the effort.
New details also emerged Tuesday about that decision to freeze the security assistance to Ukraine. An official from the White House budget office, Mark Sandy, testified that on July 12, he received an email from the office of the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, notifying him that Trump had directed that administration officials freeze Ukraine’s military aid.
Trump had enthusiastically sought the investigations for much of the summer. But in early September, he told one of his top diplomats — Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who helped carry out the shadow policy toward Ukraine — that he was not seeking “a quid pro quo” with the Ukrainian government by withholding the aid.
Sondland said that when he called Trump to inquire about why the aid had been withheld, an irritated Trump insisted he was not seeking anything from the Ukrainians. But the president said that he wanted Zelenskiy “to do the right thing,” Sondland testified to Congress last week, suggesting that he was still seeking the investigations into Democrats that could help his political fortunes.
There are discrepancies about whether Sondland spoke to the president on Sept. 7 or 9. The administration lifted the freeze on aid to Ukraine on Sept. 11, as lawmakers’ demands grew. Two days earlier, three Democratic-led House committees had opened an investigation into Trump’s dealings with Ukraine.
Only days after the president learned of the whistleblower complaint, he spoke with Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., about the aid holdup. Johnson sought permission to tell Zelenskiy at an upcoming meeting in Ukraine that Trump had decided to release the security assistance, according to Johnson.
Trump replied that he was not ready, Johnson said. He said he asked later on the call whether the aid was linked to some action that the president wanted the Ukrainians to take.
“Without hesitation, President Trump immediately denied such an arrangement existed,” Johnson wrote in a letter this month to House Republicans.
Trump erupted in anger and began cursing, he wrote.
“‘No way,’” Trump said, according to Johnson. “‘I would never do that. Who told you that?’”
The White House has kept a tight hold on details about the actions of Trump and his senior aides in the Ukraine affair.
The president has refused to let top advisers testify in the impeachment inquiry, leaving a void that Republicans have exploited. They argue that the evidence that Democrats have gathered is insufficient because it contains few firsthand accounts linking the president to wrongdoing.
But Democrats have not only the transcript of Trump’s July 25 call but also the testimony of Sondland, who said Trump directed him and other top administration officials to maintain pressure on Ukraine.
Both Cipollone and Eisenberg, who briefed Trump in late August about the whistleblower complaint, had been following up on other complaints by administration officials about the Ukraine matter since early July.
Cipollone had suggested to Eisenberg in July that he tell Trump that White House staff members had raised concerns about a shadow Ukraine policy. Eisenberg, who does not typically brief Trump, never followed up on the suggestion.

Mom influencers have sway over brands through social media

Texto completo: As a mom with influence, Caitlin Houston felt the need to act.
Houston, of Wallingford, Connecticut, read a post on Instagram this summer by Karen Feldman, founder of the Striped Sheep, a mommy-and-me clothing company, claiming that one of her designs had been ripped off by Tuckernuck, a high-end women’s clothing retailer.
So Houston did what comes naturally to her: She posted stories about the Striped Sheep’s predicament on Instagram and encouraged friends who are mom influencers to do the same. Members of her audience — she gets roughly 34,000 views a month through her website and social media — commented on Tuckernuck’s various online platforms, demanding the company not only apologize but also explain itself. Soon Tuckernuck removed the disputed items from its website and apologized via a comment on Feldman’s Instagram page, offering her a share of profits from the products. The company also called Feldman directly to apologize.
The Striped Sheep gained thousands of new followers and sold out of its inventory. “Now I’m making six new colors in the same style, as well as a new style,” Feldman said. “It was a huge boost for me, the best thing that could have happened. It was tons of free PR.”
Tuckernuck, started by three friends who also happen to be mothers, was not as pleased.
“I think it told her story, but we were very misrepresented,” Jocelyn Gailliot, chief executive and a founder of Tuckernuck, said of the situation. She declined to provide details, adding: “But we are a positive brand, a happy brand, and we are women who have children. We don’t feel social media is the right place to engage over this, and it’s a bad precedent to set for future generations.”
There are 4.5 million mom influencers in the United States, according to Mom 2.0, a conference that brings them together. They use websites and social media to record seemingly every detail of their lives: the sweater they bought for the fall, their child’s favorite new toy, which coffee helps them wake up. What began, for many, as a creative outlet or a way to build community has morphed over the years into big business with a more direct link to brands and companies.
Their followers spend money on the items they endorse and boycott the ones they pan. (Some influencers receive money if people buy products after clicking on the links they provide, and they sometimes have sponsorship deals with brands.) Millennial mothers are 18% more likely than those from Generation X to rely on advice from their fellow moms, according to research done by Mom 2.0.
“People think: ‘This woman also drives around four kids and gets crumbs in her seat. She is just like me, so I am going to listen to her,’ ” said Elisa Camahort Page, a co-founder and former chief operating officer of BlogHer, a media company that put on events and acted as a publisher for female content creators.
Influential moms have been using their power to pressure brands for at least a decade. Heather B. Armstrong, who lives in Salt Lake City and runs a website that receives 250,000 views a month, discovered her power in 2009 after buying a $1,300 Maytag washing machine that kept breaking. After her interactions with customer service and corporate headquarters frustrated her, she posted five tweets that other mom influencers picked up.
“Within 12 hours, someone from headquarters called me, and then they flew someone out to fix my washing machine,” said Armstrong, who is known as Dooce to her followers. “I got their attention.”
But with influence comes responsibility, and some have raised questions about when and how mom influencers should use their power. How much research should be done before discussing a brand? What constitutes an experience worth sharing? What is, in other words, proper mom influencer etiquette?
“We have to look out for each other,” Houston said. “If I see a mom who has started a business and is now getting squashed by a bigger person, I want to use the influence I have.”
She acknowledged that in the Striped Sheep situation her research did not extend beyond reading the blog post by Feldman and talking to other mom influencers. “I had to take her word for it,” Houston said.
For Armstrong, keeping companies in check is a positive use of her influence. “It’s like we have these tools; we have power against these companies who want to take advantage of us,” she said. Her rule is if she can’t resolve something through regular customer service channels, she can engage on social media.
Other influencers feel that endorsing or deflating a brand, regardless of how much interaction they have had with it, is their responsibility to their audience. It’s part of portraying their day-to-day lives authentically.
Kermilia White, a full-time influencer who lives in Birmingham, Alabama, has 75,000 followers across her social media platforms, including on Instagram, where she posts as themillennialsahm. She often writes about products meeting her expectations or disappointing her. (Her position is complicated by the fact that these brands often give her free products or sponsorships. She says her reviews represent her honest opinion, whether she gets the product free or not.)
“There was a startup company I worked with in January that had a stroller attachment,” she said. “I felt there was a good return on investment for that brand, so I made sure they could get some eyes on it as soon as they launched. I have a huge new-mom following.”
She added: “I always make it clear this is my experience. I say, ‘It won’t necessarily be the same for you, but for me, this is what happened.’ ”
Some influencers aim to be more journalistic. Liz Gumbinner’s website, Cool Mom Picks, gets millions of readers and hundreds of thousands of social followers. She also runs Cool Mom Tech, Cool Mom Eats and social media communities for mothers. Part of what the sites do is review products, especially startup brands owned by women and mothers.
Gumbinner has a team of writers, whom she pays, and she encourages them to do thorough research before posting a review.
“Our writers may try a new cosmetic product for a month, for example, before recommending it,” she said in an email. “With every product we write about, we need to earn our readers’ trust.”
Companies clearly like positive coverage. But when they are on the receiving end of negative chatter, they often feel at a disadvantage. Once a criticism goes viral, the damage is hard to undo.
Mom 2.0 and Dad 2.0, a conference for father content creators, hold training sessions that help participants communicate more effectively with brands and share their experiences with audiences. Keynote speakers and members of panels discuss the topic, and there are small-group workshops and round-table meetings.
At this year’s Mom 2.0 Summit session topics included “How to Connect and Work With Global Brands” and “Activism as an Influencer: How to Be the Driver of Change in Your Community.”
“I’ve seen somebody go after a hotel when they could have called the front desk to fix the problem,” said John Pacini, a co-founder of the conference. “We are trying to apply the same standards to our industry that work in normal face-to-face culture.”
Sometimes, Houston said, it is best to just back away from the internet. She recounted what she told to a friend, a new influencer popular with mothers, who asked Houston whether she should talk publicly about a bad experience at her neighborhood’s new coffee shop.
“I said: ‘No! They are brand-new. Why would you want to ruin them?’ ” Houston said. “It’s good she even asked us, though. A lot of people, that thought, to check, doesn’t even cross their mind.”

Resumen: Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said that racism in America is "foundational" and that people of color were under "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House." According to leftist rhetoric, whites pose a severe, if not mortal, threat to blacks. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting for 2018, of the homicide victims for whom race was known, 53.3% were black, 43.8% were white and 2.8% were of other races.

Texto completo: Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said that racism in America is "foundational" and that people of color were under "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House." Pete Buttigieg chimed in to explain that "systemic racism" will "be with us" no matter who is in the White House. Sen. Cory Booker called for "attacking systemic racism" in the "racially biased" criminal justice system.
Let’s follow up by examining Booker’s concern about a "racially biased" criminal justice system. To do that, we can turn to a recent article by Heather Mac Donald, who is a senior fellow at the New York-based Manhattan Institute. She is a contributing editor of City Journal, and a New York Times bestselling author. Her most recent article, "A Platform of Urban Decline," which appeared in Manhattan Institute’s publication Eye On The News, addresses race and crime. She reveals government statistics you’ve never read before.
According to leftist rhetoric, whites pose a severe, if not mortal, threat to blacks. Mac Donald says that may have once been true, but it is no longer so today. To make her case, she uses the latest Bureau of Justice Statistics 2018 survey of criminal victimization. Mac Donald writes: "According to the study, there were 593,598 interracial violent victimizations (excluding homicide) between blacks and whites last year, including white-on-black and black-on-white attacks. Blacks committed 537,204 of those interracial felonies, or 90 percent, and whites committed 56,394 of them, or less than 10 percent. That ratio is becoming more skewed, despite the Democratic claim of Trump-inspired white violence. In 2012-13, blacks committed 85 percent of all interracial victimizations between blacks and whites; whites committed 15 percent. From 2015 to 2018, the total number of white victims and the incidence of white victimization have grown as well."
There are other stark figures not talked about often. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting for 2018, of the homicide victims for whom race was known, 53.3% were black, 43.8% were white and 2.8% were of other races. In cases where the race of the offender was known, 54.9% were black, 42.4% were white, and 2.7% were of other races.
White and black liberals, who claim that blacks face a "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House" are perpetuating a cruel hoax. The primary victims of that hoax are black people. We face the difficult, and sometimes embarrassing, task of confronting reality.
Mac Donald says that Barack Obama’s 2008 Father’s Day speech in Chicago would be seen today as an "unforgivable outburst of white supremacy." Here’s what Obama told his predominantly black audience in a South Side church: "If we are honest with ourselves," too many fathers are "missing — missing from too many lives and too many homes. They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men." Then-Sen. Obama went on to say, "Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."
White liberals deem that any speaker’s references to personal responsibility brands the speaker as bigoted. Black people cannot afford to buy into the white liberal agenda. White liberals don’t pay the same price. They don’t live in neighborhoods where their children can get shot simply sitting on their porches. White liberals don’t go to bed with the sounds of gunshots. White liberals don’t live in neighborhoods that have become economic wastelands. Their children don’t attend violent schools where they have to enter through metal detectors. White liberals help the Democratic Party maintain political control over cities, where many black residents live in despair, such as Baltimore, St. Louis, Detroit, Chicago.
Black people cannot afford to remain fodder for the liberal agenda. With that in mind, we should not be a one-party people in a two-party system.

Texto completo: White House lawyers briefed President Trump in late August about the complaint, people familiar with the matter said.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump had already been briefed on a whistle-blower's complaint about his dealings with Ukraine when he unfroze military aid for the country in September, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Lawyers from the White House counsel's office told Mr. Trump in late August about the complaint, explaining that they were trying to determine whether they were legally required to give it to Congress, the people said.
The revelation could shed light on Mr. Trump's thinking at two critical points under scrutiny by impeachment investigators: his decision in early September to release $ 391 million in security assistance to Ukraine and his denial to a key ambassador around the same time that there was a "quid pro quo" with Kyiv. Mr. Trump used the phrase before it had entered the public lexicon in the Ukraine affair.
Mr. Trump faced bipartisan pressure from Congress when he released the aid. But the new timing detail shows that he was also aware at the time that the whistle-blower had accused him of wrongdoing in withholding the aid and in his broader campaign to pressure Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to conduct investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump's re-election chances.
The complaint from the whistle-blower, a C.I.A. officer who submitted it to the inspector general for the intelligence community in mid-August, put at the center of that pressure campaign a July 25 phone call between the presidents, which came at a time when Mr. Trump had already frozen the aid to the Ukrainian government. Mr. Trump asked that Mr. Zelensky "do us a favor," then brought up the investigations he sought, alarming White House aides who conveyed their concerns to the whistle-blower.
The White House declined to comment.
The whistle-blower complaint, which would typically be submitted to lawmakers who have oversight of the intelligence agencies, first came to light as the subject of an administration tug of war. In late August, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, concluded that the administration needed to send it to Congress.
But the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, and his deputy John A. Eisenberg disagreed. They decided that the administration could withhold from Congress the whistle-blower's accusations because they were protected by executive privilege. The lawyers told Mr. Trump they planned to ask the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel to determine whether they had to disclose the complaint to lawmakers.
A week later, the Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the administration did not have to hand over the complaint.
It is unclear how much detail the lawyers provided Mr. Trump about the complaint. The New York Times reported in September that White House advisers -- namely, Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Eisenberg -- knew about the whistle-blower complaint in August. But the specifics of when and how Mr. Trump learned of it have not previously been reported.
The whistle-blower, whose identity has not been made public, accused Mr. Trump of abusing his power by inviting a foreign power to interfere on his behalf in the 2020 election. He described the pressure campaign to get Mr. Zelensky to publicly commit to investigations of Democrats that could potentially benefit Mr. Trump and suggested that a temporary hold that the administration had placed on assistance to Ukraine, which is fighting a war against Russian proxy forces, might be related to the effort.
New details also emerged on Tuesday about that decision to freeze the security assistance to Ukraine. An official from the White House budget office, Mark Sandy, testified that on July 12, he received an email from the office of the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, notifying him that Mr. Trump had directed that administration officials freeze Ukraine's military aid.
Mr. Trump had enthusiastically sought the investigations for much of the summer. But in early September, he told one of his top diplomats -- Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, who helped carry out the shadow policy toward Ukraine -- that he was not seeking "a quid pro quo" with the Ukrainian government by withholding the aid.
Mr. Sondland said that when he called Mr. Trump to inquire about why the aid had been withheld, an irritated Mr. Trump insisted he was not seeking anything from the Ukrainians. But the president said that he wanted Mr. Zelensky "to do the right thing," Mr. Sondland testified to Congress last week, suggesting that he was still seeking the investigations into Democrats that could help his political fortunes.
There are discrepancies about whether Mr. Sondland spoke to the president on Sept. 7 or 9. The administration lifted the freeze on aid to Ukraine on Sept. 11, as lawmakers' demands grew. Two days earlier, three Democratic-led House committees had opened an investigation into Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
Only days after the president learned of the whistle-blower complaint, he spoke with Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, about the aid holdup. Mr. Johnson sought permission to tell Mr. Zelensky at an upcoming meeting in Ukraine that Mr. Trump had decided to release the security assistance, according to Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Trump replied that he was not ready, Mr. Johnson said. He said he asked later on the call whether the aid was linked to some action that the president wanted the Ukrainians to take.
"Without hesitation, President Trump immediately denied such an arrangement existed," Mr. Johnson wrote in a letter this month to House Republicans.
Mr. Trump erupted in anger and began cursing, he wrote.
"'No way,"' Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Johnson. "'I would never do that. Who told you that?"'
The White House has kept a tight hold on details about the actions of Mr. Trump and his senior aides in the Ukraine affair.
The president has refused to let top advisers testify in the impeachment inquiry, leaving a void that Republicans have exploited. They argue that the evidence that Democrats have gathered is insufficient because it contains few firsthand accounts linking the president to wrongdoing.
But Democrats have not only the transcript of Mr. Trump's July 25 call but also the testimony of Mr. Sondland, who said Mr. Trump directed him and other top administration officials to maintain pressure on Ukraine.
Both Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Eisenberg, who briefed Mr. Trump in late August about the whistle-blower complaint, had been following up on other complaints by administration officials about the Ukraine matter since early July.
Mr. Cipollone had suggested to Mr. Eisenberg in July that he tell Mr. Trump that White House staff members had raised concerns about a shadow Ukraine policy. Mr. Eisenberg, who does not typically brief Mr. Trump, never followed up on the suggestion.
Michael S. Schmidt and Julian E. Barnes reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Katie Benner contributed reporting from Washington.

Texto completo: The streaming site's long-term lease will keep the lights on at the once-shuttered, 71-year-old movie house.
When the Paris Theater, New York City's last surviving single-screen movie house, shut its doors in August, it wasn't just a heart-wrenching loss for film lovers: It was a physical symbol of the ways streaming services are fundamentally changing the film industry.
Now, a streaming platform is coming to its rescue.
Netflix, whose theatrical run of Noah Baumbach's "Marriage Story" reopened the Paris earlier this month, on Monday announced its agreement to lease the space.
The long-term deal gives the company a New York venue for screenings, premieres and special events as the platform continues to expand beyond laptops and into theaters.
Netflix will lease the space from the New York real estate developer Sheldon Solow, who still owns the theater. The company, which will continue to screen its films in other New York theaters, did not disclose the specifics of the deal.
For 71 years, the Paris was a lush haven for fans of prestige films. The art-house experience filled a niche for cinema aficionados that can be harder to find among the bigger movie theater chains -- perhaps a draw for Netflix, which hasn't had much luck with chains as of late.
Theatrical releases -- a requirement for Oscar eligibility -- are still a recent venture for the company. One of the first was Alfonso Cuarón's "Roma," a big Oscar winner for Netflix that ran in theaters in the United States for three weeks before streaming online.
And "The Irishman," Martin Scorsese's gangster epic, is still being shown on Broadway at the Belasco Theater ahead of its streaming release Wednesday.
With the new lease, the "Marriage Story" run at the Paris is getting a two-week extension, with no set end date. The film is to start streaming on Dec. 6.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump was briefed about the whistleblower complaint prompted by his dealings with Kyiv before the White House lifted a hold on more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter.
The president was briefed about the complaint in August by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, the people said. The complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House, which Mr. Trump has dismissed as a hoax.
The inquiry alleges that Mr. Trump abused the power of his office by pressing Ukraine to open investigations that could benefit him politically at a time when he had ordered congressionally approved Ukraine aid put on hold . The White House has defended the president's actions, in part by saying there was no link between suspending the aid and the president's request for investigations because the hold on the money was lifted in September.
The August briefing Mr. Trump received from the White House lawyers, which was earlier reported by the New York Times, indicates Mr. Trump was aware of the whistleblower complaint before he ordered the hold on aid lifted.
A White House spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.
Messrs. Cipollone and Eisenberg had known in early July about concerns from White House officials about Mr. Trump's request to Ukraine but didn't relay those concerns to the president, The Wall Street Journal has reported .
Mr. Trump said at an Oct. 2 news conference that he lifted the aid after a request from Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio).
The whistleblower complaint followed a July 25 call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Mr. Trump asked his counterpart to work with Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr on investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump, including into former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful. Mr. Trump has termed the call "perfect."
Several former and current administration officials have testified that they understood the Trump administration wouldn't release the aid until Ukraine announced it was opening the investigations. Ukraine made no such announcement.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly posted quotes on social media from allies , including from Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), defending the president's actions by pointing out that the hold on Ukraine aid was lifted without Kyiv opening any investigations.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, said in an Oct. 20 interview on Fox News that there was no quid pro quo in Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine "and I can prove it to you: the aid flowed."

Texto completo: Walter Minton: 1923-2019

Walter J. Minton, a risk-taking publisher who goaded censors and put out a slew of bestsellers during his 23-year run at the helm of G.P. Putnam's Sons, releasing Vladimir Nabokov's "Lolita," Mario Puzo's "The Godfather" and works by authors including Norman Mailer and John le CarrÃ©, died Nov. 19 at his home in Ponte Vedra Beach.

His wife, Marion Minton, confirmed the death but did not give a precise cause.

Mr. Minton was 31 when he became president of Putnam's in 1955, succeeding his father as head of the company. He once planned to pursue a legal career and found himself immersed -- not altogether unhappily -- in a world of legal threats and occasional obscenity trials, while publishing many of his era's most acclaimed and controversial writers.

Through Putnam's and its imprints (including Berkley Books and Coward, McCann & Geoghegan), Mr. Minton published authors including Simone de Beauvoir, Scott Turow, Philip K. Dick, Thomas Harris and Robert A. Heinlein, whose science-fiction novel "Stranger in a Strange Land" (1961) was a personal favorite.

His publishing house was the first to release U.S. editions of novels including William Golding's "Lord of the Flies," in 1955, and le CarrÃ©'s "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold," in 1964. It also

published a pair of major 1973 nonfiction books: "Plain Speaking," an "oral biography" of President Harry S. Truman by Merle Miller, and "An Untold Story: The Roosevelts of Hyde Park," by Elliott Roosevelt and James Brough.

But Mr. Minton was perhaps best known for taking a chance on novels that, because of their sexual content, no other publisher would touch. The year he became Putnam's president, his firm published Mailer's "The Deer Park," which included a passage involving oral sex. Mr. Minton told the New Yorker last year that he had admired Mailer's 1948 debut, "The Naked and the Dead," and pursued the author's new novel after receiving a call from Bennett Cerf, a co-founder of Random House.

"Cerf said, ‘Walter, I know you're young, but if you publish this book, you'll bring down the great veil of censorship,' " Mr. Minton recalled. "We published it and ran ads: ‘The Book Six Publishers Refused to Bring You!' "

Mr. Minton acquired the novel without making any changes, later telling Mailer that he had been prepared to take the book without reading it, fully confident that its sales would more than make up for the author's advance. "He is the only publisher I ever met who would make a good general," Mailer wrote.

In 1958, Mr. Minton took an even bigger gamble in publishing the first U.S. edition of "Lolita," Nabokov's novel about a literature professor's obsession with a 12-year-old girl. Although it is now considered one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, the book had been spurned by editors -- one recommended "that it be buried under a stone for a thousand years" -- and faced bans in Europe after being published by Olympia Press, a small Paris-based firm run by Maurice Girodias.

Mr. Minton told the New Yorker that he first came across "Lolita" after falling asleep in the living room of Rosemary Ridgewell, a former showgirl: "I woke in the middle of the night and there was this story on the table. I started reading. By morning, I knew I had to publish it."

"It had a reputation of being very sexy, though it really wasn't," he added, "and a lot of publishers who wouldn't bring it to you, because it was too ‘dirty.' To me, that was an opportunity." So he wrote an introductory letter to Nabokov: "Being a rather backward example of that rather backward species, the American publisher, it was only recently that I began to hear about a book called ‘Lolita.' . . . I am wondering if the book is available for publication."

Mr. Minton cut a deal with Girodias and released the novel to a flurry of negative reviews but no major lawsuits. Nabokov's agent announced that "Lolita" was the first book since "Gone With the Wind" to sell 100,000 copies in its first three weeks; years later, according to the New Yorker, the author would refer to Mr. Minton's home in Saddle River, N.J., as "the house ‘Lolita' built."

Over the next few years, Mr. Minton presided over American editions of "Candy," a 1958 sex satire by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg, and "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure," an 18th-century erotic novel by John Cleland.

Popularly known as "Fanny Hill," the latter chronicled a country girl who becomes a London prostitute, and was banned for obscenity in Massachusetts after its release in 1963. The ban was overturned three years later in a landmark Supreme Court decision, Memoirs v. Massachusetts, in which Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote that even a "modicum of social value" was enough to protect a book under the First Amendment, regardless of how prurient or "patently offensive" it might be.

The legal saga proved gratifying and lucrative for Mr. Minton. "We've sold 10 times as many copies as we would have," he told the New York Times, "if there hadn't been this censorship proceeding."

Walter Joseph Minton was born in the Bronx on Nov. 13, 1923. His mother, the former Ida Harris, was once a chorus line dancer; his father, Melville, entered the publishing business at 15, partly as a result of a transit mishap.

According to family lore, Melville had been offered a job at Standard Oil's headquarters in Lower Manhattan, but took the wrong ferry from New Jersey and found himself in Midtown, near Charles Scribner's Sons. A family friend there helped him to a job in the sales department, and in 1924 he co-founded his own firm, Minton, Balch & Co., which merged with Putnam's six years later.

Melville Minton was made president in 1932, and by the time his son was 11 he had already mapped out a career plan for him: six months in the stock and shipping room, followed by a couple years in manufacturing, three or four more in sales, a stint in advertising, several months in accounting and finally a stay in the editorial division.

After graduating from the Lawrenceville preparatory school in New Jersey, Walter Minton studied at Williams College in Massachusetts and received a bachelor's degree from Harvard in 1947. (His education was interrupted for several years by Army service, with Mr. Minton working as an X-ray technician at a prisoner-of-war camp in Belle Mead, N.J.)

e was enrolled at Harvard Law when his father said, ‘Just come work this summer,' " Marion Minton recalled. "And of course he never left," with jobs in sales, advertising and publicity before rising to become president.

Mr. Minton sold Putnam's to the entertainment conglomerate MCA in 1975, at a time when independent publishing houses were being swept up by larger companies. He was replaced as president three years later by Peter Israel, an editor and novelist, and finally made his way to law school, graduating from Columbia in 1982 at the age of 58.

He worked for several years at a firm in New Jersey before retiring to Florida, and his former company is now part of Penguin Random House. He was a Ponte Vedra Beach resident for 30 years.

Mr. Minton's first marriage, to Pauline Ehst, ended in divorce. In 1970, he married Marion Whitehorn. In addition to his wife, survivors include three children from his first marriage; three children from his second; 17 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

One of Putnam's biggest successes under Mr. Minton emerged out of a contest he launched in the early 1960s to find "the best unpublished novel in the English language," according to a blog post by Israel, his successor at the company.

Mr. Minton offered a six-figure advance, with predictable results. "Every fiction manuscript on every dusty shelf in the English-speaking world," Israel wrote, "ended up in the floor-to-ceiling piles that adorned our corridors and offices."

The contest ended without a winner. But among the novels signed during the hunt, using "seed money" given out to promising writers, was a pulpy Mafia epic titled "The Godfather." Dismissed by some critics as a "trash novel," it sold more than 20 million copies and inspired Francis Ford Coppola's Oscar-winning film trilogy.

Texto completo: Bloomberg News
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is preparing to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into Florida for his 2020 campaign after changes in demographics and voting laws put the linchpin swing state up for grabs.
Democrats have made potentially major inroads since Trump won the state handily in 2016. They pushed through an amendment to the state’s constitution restoring the right to vote for more than 1 million convicted felons. And as many as 40,000 Puerto Ricans migrated to Florida after Hurricane Maria — a disaster that all but shattered Trump’s standing with the island’s residents because of the botched government response.
But if Democrats want to flip Florida’s 29 electoral votes to their column in 2020, Trump and the Republican Party plan to make them pay dearly. His campaign intends to spend more than $200 million in Florida alone, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump’s campaign manager moved there, and the president even changed his permanent residence to Palm Beach.
“The Trump campaign says they need Florida, no ifs, ands or buts,” said Dan Eberhart, a GOP fundraiser active in the state’s politics. “They think without Florida there’s no path.”
Trump officially kicked off his re-election campaign with a rally in Orlando in June, and he’ll hold another one on Tuesday in Sunrise, Fla. — not far from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, his new home address, where he’ll spend the Thanksgiving holiday.
Trump won Florida in 2016 by about 1.2 percentage points, and Republicans retained the governor’s mansion in 2018 despite voter backlash against Trump elsewhere in the country that put the U.S. House under Democratic control. Smarting from the losses, Florida Democrats say they’ve autopsied their missteps and won’t repeat them.
Trump intends to devote a huge percentage of his war chest to the state. In his first run for the White House in 2008, Barack Obama’s campaign raised $779 million, still the largest amount for any presidential committee. If Trump manages to raise $1 billion, he’d still be devoting one of every five dollars to winning Florida.
“The president and the president’s campaign understand” Florida’s importance, Andrew Gillum, who narrowly lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to Republican Ron DeSantis, said in an interview. “Hell, it’s now why the president has changed his ZIP code and is now domiciled in the state.”
An October New York Times/Siena College poll of 3,766 registered voters showed Trump trailing Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in Florida by 2 points in a hypothetical 2020 matchup. He held a 1-point lead on Senator Bernie Sanders and a 4-point advantage over Senator Elizabeth Warren, both of whom are challenging Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination.
But since the poll was conducted, Trump has faced withering scrutiny as the U.S. House conducted two weeks of impeachment hearings featuring a parade of current and former members of the administration laying out in detail the president’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to open investigations that could help him politically.
If Trump loses Florida, he’d have to win Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the three Rust Belt states he narrowly won in 2016, along with the rest of the red and swing states he carried that year.
Gillum, formerly the mayor of Tallahassee, now volunteers as the chair of Forward Florida Action, a voter registration organization. He said Democrats are focusing on registering new voters, educating them and energizing them to show up to the polls “much further out from election day” than in the past.
A particular focus is Latinos as well as convicted felons now eligible to vote. “I think we change the arithmetic,” Gillum said.
Of the approximately 1.4 million convicted felons who can now vote, Democrats have used publicly available data to identify about 800,000 that are likely to vote in the next election, regardless of their party affiliation, says Juan Peñalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party.
In June, DeSantis signed Republican-written legislation that would require felons to first pay off overdue criminal fines before they can vote. But in October, a U.S. District Court granted a preliminary injunction preventing the measure from being enforced. DeSantis filed an appeal on Nov. 15.
In addition, between 20,000 and 40,000 Puerto Ricans migrated to Florida following Maria, according to an analysis based on flight data by Stefan Rayer, population program director at the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research department. According to 2018 census data, Florida has more than 1.1 million citizens that identify as Puerto Rican — up 11% from 2016.
The Trump campaign is responding to the demographic threat with cash.
America First, the primary Super-PAC working on Trump’s re-election, has a goal to raise $300 million nationally for the 2020 campaign. It plans to spend a significant amount of that money in Florida, said Kelly Sadler, the group’s spokeswoman.
America First also already has staffers in Florida registering voters, she said. It recently concluded focus groups with Hispanic men in Orlando and Miami, testing strategies that seek to tie Democrats to socialism and struggling Latin American autocracies such as Venezuela and Cuba, she said.
Florida is an expensive state to campaign in because it has so many media markets, according to Advertising Analytics, which studies political commercials. Miami, which skews heavily Democratic, has the highest prices. Orlando and Tampa, which are more competitive, see most of the spending and are also expensive. There are four TV markets in the conservative Panhandle region that are individually cheaper than other parts of the state but collectively expensive if a campaign wants to run ads in all of them.
The state saw the most expensive Senate race in U.S. history in 2018 when Republican Rick Scott, previously the governor, defeated incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson. The candidates, their parties and outside groups combined to spend $213 million, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington.
“It’s his home state, now,” Rick Gorka, deputy communications director for the Republican National Committee, said in an interview. “There’s a lot of reasons to make sure Florida stays red.”
(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)
Trump has been joined as a Florida resident by Brad Parscale, his campaign manager, who relocated from San Antonio earlier this year.
Trump’s campaign and the RNC together have raised $308 million through the end of the third quarter, $110 million more than President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party had raised at the same point in 2011. Obama’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee eventually spent $1 billion to secure his re-election, a figure Trump is likely to comfortably eclipse.
Gorka declined to comment on how much Trump’s campaign plans to spend in Florida. Republicans will blanket Florida with TV and digital ads and on-the-ground outreach to voters, aiming to compete in every part of the state, he said.

Texto completo: She championed Jackson Pollock and Georgia O'Keeffe and helped shape public opinion about the 20th century's foremost avant-garde artists.
Dorothy Seiberling, an influential magazine editor who championed modern artists, died on Saturday in Wilmington, Del. She was 97.
Her death was confirmed by her niece Mary Huhn.
As Life magazine's art editor, Ms. Seiberling helped shape public opinion about the 20th century's foremost avant-gardist artists, encouraging open-minded consideration of their importance.
Jackson Pollock and Georgia O'Keeffe were already renowned by the time she produced feature articles on them, but their legacies were in question. Some art critics had written off Pollock's Abstract Expressionist work, particularly his celebrated "drip paintings," as chaotic and unintentional, and O'Keeffe's as explicitly feminine -- "a woman on paper," as her husband, the photographer and gallerist Alfred Stieglitz, said. (She didn't see it that way.)
Ms. Seiberling's articles and interviews instead posed questions and illuminated their painting processes in vivid photo essays. Rather than defaulting to statements about gender, Ms. Seiberling referred to O'Keeffe, who granted her a rare interview at her studio in Abiquiu, N.M., as "one of the most distinguished pioneers of modern American art."
With her first husband, Leo Steinberg, regarded as one of the most important art critics of the 20th century, Ms. Seiberling amassed countless art prints, a handful of which the couple donated to the University of Iowa Museum of Art.
Decades later, Ms. Seiberling gave dozens of pieces from her personal collection -- including works by Picasso, Robert Rauschenberg, Christo and Claes Oldenburg -- to the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College. Papers from her editorship at Life are in the archives of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.
Dorothy Seiberling was born on March 7, 1922, in Akron, Ohio. Her mother, Henrietta Buckler Seiberling, helped found Alcoholics Anonymous; the first meeting reportedly took place when she invited two men into her home to talk. Her father, J. Frederick Seiberling, was the son of Frank Seiberling, a founder of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and the Seiberling Rubber Company, for which he worked.
Dorothy was the youngest of three children. Her brother, John F. Seiberling, was a congressman from Ohio who sat on the House Judiciary Committee during President Richard M. Nixon's impeachment hearings in 1974; her sister, Mary, was a social justice activist. They grew up at Stan Hywet Hall and Gardens, their grandfather's 70-acre estate in Akron.
Ms. Seiberling attended Vassar, where her mother and sister also studied, and graduated in 1943 as an English major. In the 1960s, when the presidents of Yale and Vassar were considering a merger of the two schools, Ms. Seiberling joined a resistance movement to keep the institutions separate; she published an essay in Life urging their autonomy.
"A Vassar in New Haven would have as much relation to the original as Athens, Ohio, to Athens, Greece," she wrote.
After graduation, Ms. Seiberling was accepted into a training program for researchers and fact checkers at Time Inc. She rotated among departments before landing at Life as a researcher. Within a decade she had worked her way up to editing and writing for the magazine.
Her articles sought to make Abstract Expressionists like Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline accessible to a somewhat perplexed public. She was especially proud of a special double issue, "The Bible," published during the Christmas season of 1964, examining the book's influence on history.
She married Mr. Steinberg in 1962. The marriage ended in divorce, and he died in 2011. They had no children. Ms. Seiberling is survived by seven nieces and nephews, who knew her as Aunt Babe.
Ms. Seiberling became Life's senior art editor in 1965. When the magazine ceased weekly publication in 1972, she was out of a job.
She was hired by Clay Felker, who had left Life a few years earlier to establish New York magazine. After a few years, she joined The New York Times Magazine, where she was appointed deputy editor.
In 1977, Ms. Seiberling reconnected with a friend, Sidney Stiber, whose job titles included director, producer, restaurateur and aviator; they soon married.
Not long after, Ms. Seiberling quit her magazine job and moved to Shelter Island, N.Y., where she became involved with the Shelter Island Friends of Music, a nonprofit group dedicated to bringing classical music to Long Island's East End. She was its president for 22 years.
Mr. Stiber died in 2013. That year, Ms. Seiberling sold her apartment at the Beresford, on Central Park West, for a reported $ 3.8 million.
Until October, Ms. Seiberling lived on Shelter Island, where she remained committed to bringing art to the public, even after stepping down as the Friends of Music president.
"She's already preparing copy for the next SIFM concert," a 2012 article in The Shelter Island Reporter said, after announcing her retirement.

Texto completo: Readers are disturbed by the president's intervention in war crimes cases.
To the Editor:
Re "Naval Secretary Is Told to Resign by Defense Chief" (front page, Nov. 25):
Imagine that an authoritarian president in a country in Eastern Europe, Africa or South America pardons military operatives accused of murderous war crimes. What would be your reaction?
President Trump's norm-breaking interference in the military chain of command hits a new level of dangerousness. For if military discipline can be overthrown at the whim of the commander in chief, it is no longer subject to the rule of law.
We're on the cusp of a situation in which the president could directly order a war crime, foreign or domestic, and then pardon the perpetrators. This would be true tyranny.

To the Editor:
I'm a Marine who was on active duty from 1966 to 1968. To me the worst thing President Trump has done, worse than his constant lying, lawbreaking and advocacy of cruelty and exclusion, is intervening on behalf of a Navy SEAL convicted of exulting over a dead prisoner whom he may have killed. Our military, like most in the West, has committed war crimes, but hitherto it has tried to own up to it, to try servicemen and women accused of war crimes and punish those convicted, as it did those who waterboarded Filipinos during the Philippine-American War early in the 20th century and those who massacred civilians in Vietnam.
Now the man in overall command of the forces helps a convicted war criminal, saves his rank and has the secretary of the Navy fired for defending our Uniform Code of Military Justice. To me that's inexcusable.
William R. Everdell

To the Editor:
Re "The Moral Injury of Pardoning War Crimes" (editorial, Nov. 24):
The obvious way to avoid war-induced moral injury is not to engage in immoral wars in the first place, nor to glorify militarism run amok. But go to war we do, and President Trump is not the first to excuse inexcusable killing. The moral injury that results, however, is not so much a bruise on the soul, as a scar on the soul, which doesn't go away. Nor should it.
Painful as it is, soldiers need to come to terms with their actions, as do the nations that send them to war, and more than treatment, what's required is atonement.
In researching soldiers who came to oppose war, I've talked with scores of veterans of wars from Vietnam to the present, most of whom have some form of a moral injury. They atone by working to end wars.
Though I have no idea about the state of the souls of the veterans in Congress, if they too feel a moral injury, cutting the bloated military budget and putting a stop to our endless rounds of war would be good places to start atoning.

No, Ukraine's interference in 2016 hasn't been 'debunked,' 'discredited,' or 'dismantled'

Texto completo: The national media are working in concert to deny that Ukraine's government tried to take President Trump down in the 2016 election.
A lot of journalists are — without evidence! — asserting that Ukraine's interference has been "debunked," as if Politico and the New York Times were reporting conspiracy theories when they exposed, in very clear terms, Ukraine's election meddling in the first place.
In truth, it hasn't been "debunked" at all, but they figure if they repeat over and over again that Ukraine's meddling is a "conspiracy theory" that's been completely "dismantled," people will just have to accept that as what it is.
CNN, on Monday, ran a graphic on-screen blaring, "Republicans push debunked Ukraine conspiracy theory." New York Times columnist Charles Blow, on Sunday, referred to "the debunked conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine that interfered in the 2016 election."
ABC News: "Trump continues to push debunked Ukraine conspiracy theory."
MSNBC: "Trump continues pushing debunked Ukraine conspiracy theories."
Associated Press: "Debunked Ukraine conspiracy theory is knocked down - again."
The "debunked" crew got a special boost during last week's impeachment hearings when former National Security Council official Fiona Hill testified that Ukraine's interference was nothing more than a "fictional narrative" that originated with — where else? — Russia.
CNN was beside itself, reporting that Hill's testimony "deflated right-wing conspiracy theories that Ukraine, and not necessarily Russia, meddled in the 2016 election." CNN lauded Hill for having "[taken] apart the idea that Ukraine was responsible for the real election meddling in 2016."
No, she didn't. She may have doubted that Ukraine interfered. She may have rebutted the idea of Ukrainian interference. She may have disputed it. She may also be correct that Russian interference was much more extensive. But nothing was "taken apart" or debunked.
Hill said she believed that Russia interfered in our election, and seemed to imply (although it wasn't completely clear) that Ukraine had not. Okay, that's a fine opinion to have, but it ignores all of the evidence that Ukraine did also interfere.
To contradict something isn't the same as to "debunk" it. If that were the case, Trump would have "debunked" the media's insistence that there was no emergency at the border, Brett Kavanaugh would have "debunked" Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he tried to rape her, and I would have "debunked" the theory that Charles Blow knows how to write.
Ukraine did interfere in the 2016 election. Journalists are free to deny it, and so are career government bureaucrats. That doesn't change the facts.

Texto completo: Los demócratas ganaron este lunes una batalla legal contra la negativa de Donald Trump a dejar participar a sus principales asesores en las audiencias para su juicio político. Un juez falló que el antiguo asesor del presidente Donald F. McGahn II deberá declarar ante los investigadores del ‘impeachment’ sobre si Trump obstruyó la investigación Mueller .
El juez Ketanji Brown Jackson, del Tribunal de Distrito Federal para el Distrito de Columbia, rechazó el bloqueo de la administración Trump al proceso de juicio político contra el presidente . El gobierno había afirmado que los principales asesores de Trump estaban exentos de hablar sobre sus deberes oficiales y que, por tanto, ni siquiera acudirían a una citación.
Sin embargo, esto no garantiza que McGahn testifique pronto ya que lo más seguro es que el Departamento de Justicia presentará una apelación para que se suspenda el fallo del juez. El afectado y su abogado, William A. Burck, defienden que la batalla se libra entre el Congreso y la administración Trump para que los abogados del gobierno sean los que manejen el caso.
“Don McGahn acatará la decisión del juez Jackson a menos que se suspenda mientras se espera apelación”, dijo Burck a The New York Times por correo electrónico. “El Departamento de Justicia está manejando este caso, por lo que deberá preguntarles si tienen la intención de solicitar una suspensión”, añadió.
Aunque el Departamento de Justicia pida la suspensión para hacer apelaciones, el fallo también alcanza a la inmunidad que la Casa Blanca ha invocado sobre otros testigos para no colaborar con la investigación de los demócratas en el Congreso . Varios de ellos ya se han acogido a la teoría de la administración para negarse a declarar por el escándalo ucraniano.
Si McGahn se niega a testificar hasta que el caso llegue a la Corte Suprema y esta emita un fallo, es posible que el asunto no se resuelva a tiempo para que la declaración del exasesor del presidente tenga un peso importante en la investigación.

Crowdfunding can’t solve this dilemma

Texto completo: When Citrus County commissioners signaled their opposition to a digital subscription to the New York Times for local library cardholders, some outraged readers responded with their wallets.

Multiple online fundraisers sprung up to foot the $2,700 bill for digital access to the Times. At least 15 GoFundMe pages were active Thursday, having raised more than $7,000.

One problem: The Citrus library system says it cannot use the money after the commissioners, in a 3-2 vote Tuesday, rejected signing onto the digital subscription for the countys 70,000 library cardholders.

The money has to go back to the people that donated it, said Sandy Price, the chair of both the local Friends of the Library and the Library Advisory Board.

By Friday morning, most of the GoFundMe pages had been taken down.

I can confirm that in light of the commissioners recent vote,

we have refunded all donors who gave to campaigns related to the Citrus County Libraries, a GoFundMe spokeswoman wrote in an email. Its important to know that the platform is backed by the GoFundMe Guarantee, which means funds are guaranteed to go to the right place or donors will get a refund.

Citrus Library Director Eric Head, speaking through a county spokeswoman amid the brouhaha, explained simply that officials cannot pay for what they do not have. County spokeswoman Cynthia Oswald said the digital subscription would have required a contract agreement, which in Citrus needs to be approved by the commission and signed by the commission chair.

Library leaders said they are stuck, even if the private money is there now to cover the cost.

Price said she has not personally spoken to any of the various online fundraising organizers, who had listed hometowns all around the country, from Massachusetts to Texas. If its money thats given for the specific digital subscription, we cannot take that, she said.

A few people early during the controversy made checks out directly to the libraries, Head said, for an amount under $200. They will be contacted to see if they would like their donation to be just a general donation or returned, he wrote in an email.

The debate was ignited when Commissioner Scott Carnahan spoke out against the subscription at a meeting Oct. 24, saying, Fake news, I agree with President Trump.

Those words resounded far beyond Citrus, a conservative county in West Central Florida known as a destination for its natural springs and manatees.

Dozens of people showed up at the meeting Tuesday before the board voted. Commissioner Jimmie Smith said he would support private funds paying for the subscription, but others said the county had no policy for such a funding model.

Several opponents said they would like to see the county use $2,700 elsewhere, to feed the hungry or house homeless veterans. But Price said those people misunderstood.

You cant take money out of the library budget and give it to some other faction of the county, she said.

Whats next?

Were going to regroup, and were going to go forward because our library needs to get in the digital age, Price said. She doesnt know yet how the libraries will gain commissioners approval. She has not spoken to them.

The two commissioners who voted in favor of the subscription wanted the digital access to replace the countys current print plan, which costs $2,900. Citrus libraries receive hard copies of several newspapers, including the Citrus County Chronicle, the Wall Street Journal and USA Today.

Price said the Friends of the Library is a fundraising group that each year makes about $60,000 through two book sales to help the libraries. That money goes toward expanding the collection and renovating parts of the branch buildings.

The Friends will still accept donations, she said, but not any earmarked for the Times subscription.

Kevin Leahy, from Cincinnati, Ohio, ran one GoFundMe page that took in about $2,100 before being shut down. He said his mother was a librarian.

I dont know their legal constraints, and I want to be respectful of that, he said of Citrus. But on the face of it, it feels like an absurd position.

Another fundraiser, Kevin Gallagher of Boston, updated the more than 150 donors to his page, which had raised $3,400, about the commissions vote.

Im not comfortable changing this campaigns mission when those who have contributed, contributed to a specific cause, he wrote. However, one suggestion has stood out: change the mission to donate these funds to those running against the county commissioners. Seems like a great cause, the root of the problem. Thoughts?

By Friday, he switched course.

Ive decided to just have GoFundMe refund everyone, he wrote. Changing the focus is way too much for me to do and the suggestions of what else can be done is overwhelming. So thanks again, its very unfortunate this didnt work out the way we wanted.

Texto completo: Australia The governing body for the country’s soccer will close the pay gap between the men’s and women’s national teams. The Football Federation Australia reached an agreement Nov. 5 to assure equal resources for the two teams. However, FIFA World Cup payouts are still vastly unequal. The prize money for the 2019 Women’s World Cup was $30 million, while the men’s payout for the year before was $400 million. The Australian women’s team is ranked eighth in the world by FIFA. The men’s team is ranked 44th. The announcement comes as the U.S. women’s national team, which won the Women’s World Cup in France this year, is involved in litigation seeking parity in pay and resources with the U.S. men’s national team. The case is scheduled to go to trial in May. (The New York Times) 
South Africa The rooibos tea industry will pay indigenous people 1.5% of the value that farmers get when they sell the tea to processors.  This could amount to more than half a million dollars a year. The transactions recognize that the indigenous Khoisan people were the first to cultivate the product. South Africa’s oldest inhabitants, the Khoisan are made up of several communities: the Cape Khoi, the Nama, the Koranna, the Griqua, and the San – who also refer to themselves as bushmen. Rooibos only grows in the Suid Bokkeveld region of the country, where the Khoisan have used the tea for centuries. (BBC)
Uganda and Congo The two countries reached an agreement to work on key road networks, which will connect the nations and foster trade. Announced at a meeting between the nations in early November, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi agreed to build a road network that will cover more than 730 miles. One road will go from Goli, Uganda, to Mahagi and Bunia in Congo. Violent militias, one of which has been linked to the Islamic State, have troubled the region. The infrastructure project, according to Mr. Museveni, should improve the region’s security. (MedAfricaTimes, The Defense Post)
Lewiston, Maine Safiya Khalid was elected to the Lewiston City Council in Maine in November. Ms. Khalid, who lived in a Somali refugee camp as a child before coming to the United States, won the seat with 70% of the vote. The Monitor’s Oct. 28 cover story, “How refugees transformed a town,” detailed the story of Lewiston, which became home to 6,000 African refugees and asylum-seekers. Ms. Khalid, who persisted with her campaign despite harassment, has secured a spot at the table to represent her community, said Lewiston Mayor Kristen Cloutier. In January, Ms. Khalid will become the council’s youngest member. She wants to champion public schools. “When I came here, I didn’t know how to write my name or speak any word of English,” said Ms. Khalid. “I am who I am because of public education.” (The Associated Press)
Bangladesh About 192,000 Rohingya children are being educated by UNICEF and its partners in 2,167 learning centers spread across the country. When more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees fled to Bangladesh from persecution in Myanmar in 2017, thousands of Rohingya children were cut off from schooling. While 25,000 children are still not attending any educational program, UNICEF estimates 89% of Rohingya children under age 14 now have access to learning from the centers. But 640 learning centers are still needed, UNICEF says. Rohingya educators are hoping to have more of their history integrated into the curriculum. (The New Humanitarian, UNICEF)

Orlando filmmaker making 'Waves' with movie

Texto completo: One of the year's best films, the searing family drama "Waves," comes from a director living in Orlando. Rolling Stone dubs Trey Edward Shults "one major young filmmaker."
Shults, 31, is also writer, co-editor, a producer and a music editor on "Waves," which opens Wednesday at Enzian Theater in Maitland.
Rich in color, sound and swirling camera movements, "Waves" limits the dialogue as it follows teen siblings Tyler (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) and Emily (Taylor Russell in a breakout performance).
"Hopefully it feels immersive, that you're living it with the characters' perspective, with Tyler and then Emily," Shults said in an interview. "If I can tell a story visually and put that over dialogue, I get really excited."
Reviewers are excited by Shults. Michael Phillips, of the Chicago Tribune, said "Waves" is "both unpredictable and powerful in its impact." Manohla Dargis in The New York Times writes: "'Waves' is the story of a Florida family nearly undone by a shocking tragedy. It's also a spectacular testament to the talents of the writer-director Trey Edward Shults, making just his third feature-length movie."
Shults' earlier "Krisha" (2015) and "It Comes at Night" (2017) dealt with family. He met Harrison on the latter film and wrote Tyler for him. The role, Shults said, fuses his own experiences with those of Harrison. Shults, raised by his mother and stepfather, reunited with his biological father shortly before the man died in 2013.
In "Waves," Emmy winner Sterling K. Brown ("This Is Us") plays the teens' stern father, and Tony winner Renée Elise Goldsberry ("Hamilton") portrays their concerned stepmother.
"I'm a lucky man," Shults says of his cast. "We built it together to where at the end it felt like a beautiful, collaborative family."
When the film pauses for dialogue, the results can be shattering. Phillips called attention to a scene between the father and Emily, saying it's "just about perfect."
"To me, that's the heartbeat scene of the film, and the whole film is leading to that scene," Shults said. "We just got out of the way, and just wanted to let the actors act. You're dealing with two amazing actors."
The focus on family sets "Waves" apart from many year-end movies. "Family is very important for me, man, trying to explore the good and bad of family and the gray and everything in between because we're complex human beings," he said. "It can be a powerful thing seeing how a family can fall apart but also come back together after the worst tragedy."
"Waves" filmed mostly in Broward County in South Florida. But there is a scene at Weeki Wachee, "one of my favorite places on Earth," Shults said.
Shults said he has been in Orlando a few years and listed what he and his girlfriend enjoy, including their house, their neighborhood, the restaurants, Disney and the kayaking.
Would he film here?
"Who knows? Maybe. I love Orlando," Shults said.
He said he had no idea about his next film. "I'm a blank slate. I put it all in this movie," he said.
Enzian hopes that he will attend some screenings, and Shults said he admired the Maitland theater.
Matthew Curtis, programming director at Enzian, said "Waves" is "incredibly bold filmmaking, powerful and heartbreaking, bursting with extraordinarily vivid performances that are hard to shake."
It's very unusual for Enzian to present a main feature by a local filmmaker. " 'The Blair Witch Project' 20 years ago may be the last time this has happened," Curtis said.
As for awards talk, Shults said, "It's humbling, it's great to hear it, you never know how any of that stuff will go. I'm just trying to get this movie out there and just trying to get word of mouth." He added, "There's a ton of great movies right now. I just hope ours can break through."
So spread the word: We have a major filmmaker living in our community.

Texto completo: The Northwest Cultural Council is excited to announce its current exhibit that honors one of America’s outstanding modern poets, Mary Oliver.
The exhibit at Arlington Green Executive Center is comprised of single works by 17 of the council’s artists. Each artist has selected one of Oliver’s poems as inspiration for their piece. The poem is displayed adjacent to each work and will be read aloud during a reception for the artists Dec. 7.
In addition to Oliver’s work, two original poems by council artists are on display. The exhibit will run through Jan. 4.
Mary Oliver was born in Ohio in 1935 and spent her adult life in New England, then in Florida, where she died in January of this year.
From a young age, she immersed herself in nature and was quoted as saying, "When it’s over, I want to say: ‘All my life/I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.’" Her first collection of poems was published in 1963, when she was 28. Oliver received numerous awards and recognition throughout her life. In 2007, The New York Times described her as "far and away, this country’s best-selling poet."
This exhibit contains photography, stained glass, watercolor, oil and acrylic painting, as well as bas-relief sculpture. Participating artists include Mary Blinn, Steve Bogaerts, Joe Burlini, Cheryl Calderon, Dean Caminiti, Robert R. Cobb, Roger Gates, John Green, James Hojnacki, Karen Meadows, Moon Ja Park, Linda Nye, Lynnea Semasko, Gary Swiontek, Tom Warnke, Nancy Wedow and Tiffany Whisler.
Through the generosity of one of the council’s ongoing sponsors, RF Wittmeyer, Ltd., the public is invited to a reception with refreshments from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 7. Some of the artists will have gift items for sale.
There is ample free parking at Arlington Green Executive Center, 2101 S. Arlington Heights Road, Arlington Heights.

JOHNSON HAS 'NO SENSE OF DECENCY' MOMENT; VIEWS OF THE CAPITAL TIMES

Texto completo: Wisconsin's U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is a robotic defender of Donald Trump. Unbothered by evidence that the president lied to him during a phone conversation about the Ukraine scandal that has sparked an impeachment inquiry, Johnson has championed the president so ardently that he sparks disbelief. During an interview last month on NBC's "Meet the Press," host Chuck Todd interrupted the Wisconsinite to say, "Sen. Johnson, please! Can we please answer the question that I asked you, instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you're not criticizing him?"
Yet, Johnson has kept at it. Even after evidence emerged that he was part of an "irregular channel" of administration aides, appointees and allies who were involved in wrangling over the withholding of aid to Ukraine as part of a scheme to force the country's president to do Trump's domestic political bidding, Johnson kept making excuses. Even after The New York Times headlined an article about Johnson: "?He's in Deeper Water Than Most': G.O.P. Senator at Center of Impeachment Inquiry," he has remained obscenely loyal to Trump.
That was painfully obvious last week, a few hours before Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman delivered damning testimony about Trump's wrongdoing to the House Intelligence Committee, at the beginning of an extraordinary week of impeachment hearings. As the decorated military veteran who has served as a top National Security Council staffer was preparing to testify, he was the subject of a crude and dishonest attack by Johnson.
"A significant number of bureaucrats and staff members within the executive branch have never accepted President Trump as legitimate and resent his unorthodox style and his intrusion onto their 'turf,'" Johnson wrote in a letter to committee Republicans. "They react by leaking to the press and participating in the ongoing effort to sabotage his policies and, if possible, remove him from office. It is entirely possible that Vindman fits this profile."
Johnson the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a fierce partisan who recently declared that he does not trust the FBI and the CIA was not dealing in facts. He was seeking to prop up the desperate Republican effort to defend an embattled president.
The attack on Vindman revealed that Johnson's moral compass is broken. And U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Town of Vermont, called him out for it. "Sen. Ron Johnson's unsubstantiated attacks on Lt. Col. Vindman a decorated, Purple Heart veteran is what's wrong with Congressional Republicans," declared the congressman. "Attempting to discredit an American hero solely on behalf of an angry House GOP is unacceptable."
True enough. But there is another way to denounce Johnson by recalling the words of attorney Joseph Welch when he confronted one of the senator's predecessors.
"Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator," Welch told Joseph McCarthy. "You've done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?"

Texto completo: The Sheraton Portland Hotel restaurant has a confused decor and cocktail menu, but some more than decent entrees.
City Farmhouse Kitchen & Bar is a decent South Portland restaurant whose success or failure does not depend on your business. That's because you're probably not its target customer.
I say "probably" because there is a vanishingly tiny chance that you are a business traveler, a member of a flight crew on an overnight stopover from the Jetport, or someone who lives or works near the Sheraton Portland Hotel on Sable Oaks Drive.
"Let me get this right," my Lyft driver asked me last week. "You live in Portland, but you're going to a hotel near the Maine Mall for dinner?" When I confirmed, he shook his head and gently tried to talk me down from what he clearly considered to be a disastrous choice. "Listen, there's a lot of good stuff in Portland. Are you sure?" Then, as we pulled up to the newly renovated former Marriott hotel, he backtracked, but just a bit. "Oooh," he exclaimed. "It looks nicer than I expected in there."
Once a generically corporate hotel restaurant/bar called Fire & Water, City Farmhouse has been renovated to evoke what executive chef Chris Merriam calls "a barn feel," with an enormous colorized photo of a tractor, reclaimed wood, mixed-texture panels of dried moss and grasses, and a host station made from a gnarly tangle of barbed stump roots. These rustic elements are offset by the linearity and edges of manufactured materials like poured concrete, tempered glass and steel.
"The thought behind it is a fusion," Merriam said. "It's city girl meets farm boy, then (she) goes back to the farm and brings that city appeal with her."
But often, the two ideas run parallel without ever connecting. Much of the dining room, with its juxtaposition of plaid tweed upholstery and rough boards against clinical white subway tile, feels mismatched - like a Rocky Mountain ski chalet built inside a hospital bathroom.
Cocktails on the rambling beverage menu are also a bit haphazard. Some, like the Dirty Rotten Scoundrel ($11), a savory, caper-sprinkled riff on a dirty martini, and the incendiary (both in terms of spice and flammability) Maine-Ga-Rita Shine ($11), showcase the bar staff's skills with a Boston shaker. On the other hand, a trio of ginger-based cocktails - the Daisy Duke Mai Tai ($11), floral Farmhouse Elders ($11) and Asian pear martini ($13) - barely qualify as alcoholic and seem to have nothing to do with the menu or setting. They, like the syrupy Smoked Old Fashioned ($12), are also far too sweet.
Food at the casual, New American restaurant often does a better job of bridging contemporary and traditional rural foodways, despite a couple of outright bombs like the distributor-sourced chocolate "popover" that turns out to be nothing more than a misidentified lava cake baked until stodgy and plated with a scoop of sticky vanilla gelato and a smear of torched marshmallow. Or deep-fried Brussels sprouts ($11) tossed with roasted root vegetables, crunchy candied walnuts and drowned in enough maple syrup to qualify them for a spot on the dessert menu.
Italian-inspired dishes are, by and large, much stronger. While the dough for the stone-hearth pizzas isn't made in-house, pies are rolled out and baked to-order, producing light, blistered crusts that work well with the kitchen's homemade pomodoro sauce. That's especially true of the roasted-tomato-topped smoky tomato pie ($13), which on my second visit to City Farmhouse, my server set down with a flourish as she proclaimed, "You're lucky you ordered this. This and the pasta are my favorite things on the menu."
I had been lucky enough on my prior visit to sample the pasta and knew she was onto something. My guest and I devoured our half-order of the fresh (from frozen) garganelli tossed in a cream-fortified, veal-and-beef ragu that came topped with a ball of burrata that wept cream and tendrils of cheese as it warmed through ($12 half/$21 full).
The bruschetta-esque triptych of Farmers toasts ($12) are also solid, if portioned a little stingily for the price. Both the roasted red pepper with olive oil and whipped ricotta, and the sautÃ©ed wild mushrooms with burrata, white balsamic and thyme are appealing enough, but the best of the bunch is the tomato with basil, garlic and balsamic vinegar "pearls" created in the kitchen's spherificator. It reminded me of a molecular gastronomy remix of Spanish pan con tomate.
Not all the kitchen's best dishes trace their roots back to Italy. The French-cut chicken ($23) is a classic American dish: juicy, skin-on roasted breast and drumette nestled into a generous mound of frothy, whipped sweet potato puree and plated alongside a tiny hillock of tender carrots and turnips. But the real star of the dish is an apple chutney that whispers in steamy curls of fragrant star anise and cinnamon.
And no modern American menu would be complete without a burger. City Farmhouse offers four, all featuring hefty, beautifully grilled Angus-and-chuck patties and toasted brioche buns. "Go for the Homestead," my enthusiastic server urged, pointing with her pen to its location on my menu. "It has an egg on it. Eggs are the way to my heart." Mine, too.
It, like the pizza before, turns out to have been a wise selection. The runny, sunny-side-up egg (griddled in a ring mold to retain its size and shape) lends the Homestead ($16) a breakfast-like quality that gets a boost from a muscular tranche of applewood-smoked bacon.
On my first visit, at an adjacent table, six prosperous-appearing bachelorette-party attendees in town from suburban New Jersey ordered a few Homesteads of their own, adding several Ketel One-fueled Cosmopolitans ($12) for good measure. "You're such a Carrie Bradshaw," one said to the bride as drinks arrived. "Sure, but she wouldn't eat a burger like that," the bride responded. "Neither would I normally. But I'm in a random hotel, and that guy's (i.e. mine) smells so good. Forget Carrie Bradshaw."
I couldn't help but wonder: In a region with so many restaurants, isn't there room for just one designed mostly for tourists?

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo was shocked.
You see, apart from being an Oscar-nominated actor best known for playing the Hulk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Ruffalo is also an environmental activist; he co-founded Water Defense in 2011 to raise awareness about the impact energy extraction has on water and public health.
And "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare" had hit him hard. Nathaniel Rich's 2016 piece for the New York Times Magazine chronicled attorney Rob Bilott's fight to expose impact of the DuPont chemical company's release of PFOA, or perfluorooctanoic acid, which it had pumped as powder into the Ohio River near a West Virginia facility for decades, according to Rich's reporting. PFOA is a compound used in the manufacture of Teflon.
"If you are a sentient being reading this article in 2016, you already have PFOA in your blood," Rich wrote. "It is in your parents' blood, your children's blood, your lover's blood. How did it get there? Through the air, through your diet, through your use of nonstick cookware, through your umbilical cord. Or you might have drunk tainted water."
Scientists, according to Rich's reporting, found a "probable link" between PFOA and ailments including kidney, testicular and thyroid cancers, as well as high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.
"I was just floored," said Ruffalo. "It's like the biggest corporate criminality, spanning 50 years, no accountability, and no one knew about it."
Ruffalo is working to change that with "Dark Waters." The film — opening in select cinemas Friday, Nov. 22 before expanding on Nov. 29 and playing nationwide on Dec. 6 — was produced by Ruffalo.
He also stars as Bilott, a environmental corporate defense attorney who spent years on the issue of PFOA as the work took its toll on his health and career.
The question of Bilott's motivation compelled Ruffalo, the actor said.
"Was there really a rebellious quality in him? Did he have a chip on his shoulder about something?" Ruffalo wondered. Instead, the actor kept coming back to a much more straightforward answer.
"He believed in people, and he saw the world as a jury of his peers," Ruffalo said of Bilott. "And (he believed that) once he laid out enough evidence and it was compelling enough, that they would decide to do the right thing. That's how he handled everything, and it's that kind of dispassionate, unemotional, empirical sort of one foot in front of the other until we get to where we need to be that was his ethos.
"As an actor, you want the big, dramatic moments. You want the juicy scenes. You want the moment where our hero gets to confront the bad guy and take him down, but that's just not the nature of Rob and that's not the nature of the story."
Oscar-winning actor and activist Tim Robbins co-stars in "Dark Waters" as Tom Terp, Bilott's supervising partner at the Cincinnati law firm of Taft Stettinius and Hollister LLP who provides Bilott with crucial support in contrast to the firm's history of representing chemical companies.
"That's what spoke to me, it was the unexpected nature of it," said Robbins, "the man whose law firm represents chemical companies, to take on a case that is holding a chemical company responsible for polluting the environment. This is not their wheelhouse, right? This is not something they normally do. I find characters like that really inspiring."
DuPont and Chemours, a former DuPont unit that spun off into its own company in 2015, arrived at a $670.7 million settlement to settle 3,550 lawsuits related to the release of PFOA in 2017.
Terp and Bilott could, Robbins said, serve as guides for how more changes could come in the future.
"It's not like they're your liberal reformers or anything, it's people who go outside their own corporate culture to pursue something based on morality, based on right and wrong and not on profit margin," said Robbins. "And quite frankly, it's going to be up to people like Tom Terp to realize that morality in themselves and take risks and perhaps compromise their position of power or their livelihood to do the right thing."
Directed by Oscar nominee Todd Haynes from a screenplay by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, "Dark Waters" is a Focus Features release presented by Participant.
Haynes' film is firmly in the whistleblower cinema tradition that includes "All The President's Men" (1976) and "The Post" (2017), specifically the environmental and legal sub-genre alongside Oscar-winner "Erin Brockovich" (2000) and Oscar nominee "A Civil Action" (1997).
But it also has plenty in common with Ruffalo and Participant's 2015 modern classic "Spotlight," which earned a Best Picture Oscar and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Ruffalo. Both films are non-sensationalist, methodical examination of all of the work — legal in the case of "Dark Waters," journalistic in "Spotlight" — that goes into uncovering the truth.
"Dark Waters," with its exposure of DuPont practices, also serves as an inadvertent companion piece to "Foxcatcher." That 2014 starred an Oscar-nominated Ruffalo as Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz, who was murdered in 1996 by chemical empire heir John du Pont, played by Steve Carrell.
Taken together, "Dark Waters" and "Foxcatcher" chillingly speak to the free reign our society has afforded powerful corporations and families.
"It is a corporate elite in America that basically because of economic reasons are given free hand to pollute, to dominate, to run amok," Ruffalo said. "Whether it's John du Pont in 'Foxcatcher' and his delusions of grandeur that came from a lifetime of privilege and money or it's DuPont as a corporate entity who was a driving economic factor in American business.
"If all we value is the GDP of a country as a value of its health or well-being, then you're going to have a lot more stories like the PFOA story and a lot more companies like DuPont who knowingly and willingly poisoned the world for pure profit and the almighty dollar."
"Dark Waters," 126 minutes, rated PG-13, open in select cinemas before expanding on Friday and playing nationwide on Dec. 6. More info: www.focusfeatures.com/dark-waters.

34 killed amid floods, mudslides NAIROBI — Kenya's interior minister says 29 people have been killed in mudslides, among the 34 people overall who lost their lives Saturday amid flooding in the East Africa nation. Heavy rains unleashed overnight floods in western Kenya. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi said 17 people died in a mudslide in the village of Takmal in the Pokot Central district, while 12 others lost their lives in mudslides in the villages of Parua and Tapach in Pokot South. Five other people died when their car was swept away. Matiangi said the government sent military and police helicopters to help, but the scope of the disaster was not yet clear. (AP)
England
2 sentenced for hiding treasure LONDON — Two men from Wales were sentenced Friday for failing to follow Britain's rules on reporting discoveries of treasure. George Powell, 38, and Layton Davies, 51, dug up a Viking hoard of gold and silver in 2015 in a field in Eye in western England. Instead of reporting it, as required by law, the two hid some of the items, estimated to be worth millions of pounds, and sold others to dealers. Powell received a total term of 10 years, and Davies was sentenced to 8½ years. The judge told Powell and Davies that the “irony in the case" was that if they had followed the correct procedure, they might have been in line to receive up to half the value between them, the BBC reported. “But you wanted more," the judge told them.

Beware the federal “Grinch” during the season of giving

Texto completo: It’s officially the holiday shopping season. But be wary. Your Grinch neighbor, the IRS, is sitting high on the mountain, waiting to pounce. When money or items of value change hands, the IRS often wants a share, and believe it or not, it includes gift-giving.
The basic rules
A recipient of a gift does not pay income taxes on the gift. But the donor may pay gift or estate taxes. These taxes work together but are two different taxes, separate and apart from income taxes. A gift tax applies to gifts made during your lifetime, paid by the donor and not the recipient.
Estate tax applies to transfers at your death, paid by the decedent’s estate, not the recipient. There is one tax exemption for both these taxes. Currently, the exemption is $11.4 million, so you can give that amount away during your life or at your death, or some combination thereof, without gift or estate taxes.
Additionally, anyone can give another person a gift of up to $15,000 a year. That means spouses can together gift $30,000 per year. After that, the gift is subject to gift tax and you’ll need to use part of your exemption.
How it works
If you gift, for example, $25,000 to your adult child, $10,000 is a potentially taxable gift. You would need to file a gift tax return and claim a portion of your lifetime exemption, leaving you with $11,390,000 still to gift during your lifetime or at your death without taxes. An amount beyond that is taxed at 40%, and you or your estate pays that tax, not the recipient.
You may think that with an exemption that high you have nothing to worry about. — gift away! (Please add me to your list.) But beware that the exemption amount is scheduled to drop to about $5.4 million after 2025. Expect to see a lot of serious gifting by the wealthy in 2025 to use up the larger exemption that will disappear the following year.
What could go wrong?
There can be a lot of reasons to gift during your lifetime: your kid needs the money, you need to drop an asset from your estate, you’re downsizing and would like to see your child and grandchildren live in the family home. But beware that besides the potential for a gift tax, there’s an income tax issue, too.
Unlike property inherited due to death, gifted property keeps the same tax basis the donor had. Say you have stock you paid $25,000 for that is now worth $50,000. If the stock is given to your heirs, it would have an income tax basis of $50,000. If they sold the stock, they’d have no taxable gain. If you instead gift that stock during your lifetime, the recipient gets your same tax basis of $25,000. If they sell the stock, they will have a taxable gain of $25,000. This may work fine if the recipient is in a low tax bracket or is a tax-free charity. Just do the analysis with your advisors before making a gift of an appreciated asset. Timing is everything.
Other Gift Tax Exemptions
There are other gifts that can be made without incurring gift tax. Gifts to pay for someone else’s medical expenses or tuition, gifts to a spouse and gifts to charity do not incur gift tax no matter the amount and are not subject to the annual $15,000 limit. But again, be cautious. The Grinch is rubbing his green paws together.
A gift of tuition for all levels of education is not subject to gift tax, but the exemption, known as the Gift Tax Exclusion for Tuition, only applies if you make the payment directly to the institution and not the student and keep documentation. The exemption does not include gifts for housing, books, supplies, or meals. The gift may also affect the student’s eligibility for financial aid.
Payment of medical expenses is excluded from gift tax only if the bill is incurred for “the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease” and is not covered by insurance.
Gifts between spouses are not subject to tax. But a gift from a spouse becomes the separate property of the recipient. You would not get half of it back if you divorce. (This is a Grinch of a different color, but relevant here.) Additional rules apply if your spouse is not a U.S. citizen.
Charitable gifts aren’t subject to gift tax, and you can get an income tax deduction if you itemize. But your deduction for charitable gifts is limited to 60% of your adjusted gross income, 30% in some cases.
Conclusion
Gifting to your loved ones or charity is, of course, a wonderful thing. My gift to you is simply to remind you that sometimes gifts need to be carefully planned out with professional advisors so it makes it to the Whos in your Whoville without the Grinch grabbing a chunk. The IRS is a mean one.

The Trials of Thomas Morton
By Peter C. Mancall
Yale, 278 pages, $30
The debate about the meaning of early American history has become a debate about the meaning of America itself. Over the past few months, for instance, the New York Times's "1619" project has attempted to re-center the American story around the moment when, 400 years ago last August, more than 20 kidnapped Africans were sold to colonists in Virginia.
Great and tragic stories may be hung around these kinds of anniversaries -- and it has been no easy task for historians or for members of the public to come to terms with the beginnings of African-American slavery, the horrors of the "peculiar institution," or the war that was fought at least partly in its defense. But, as a raft of books on the early colonial period illustrate, historical experience doesn't easily lend itself to grand and sometimes simplistic national narratives.
Slavery existed in North America long before the 1619 arrival in Virginia of the ship with the bitterly appropriate name of White Lion -- and the victims of greed and inhumanity whom we have recently remembered arrived before any members of the religious community whose experience would do much to define centuries of colonial experience and the notions of "liberty" with which they have become associated.
One of the unintended consequences of efforts to "decolonize" the curriculum has been to debunk any utopian fantasies about the precolonial past. America has no single origin narrative, and no single moment of temptation and fall. As books by David D. Hall and Peter C. Mancall demonstrate, history is more complicated than the stories we choose to remember or struggle to forget.
In narratives that nod toward the approaching 400th anniversary of the landing of the Mayflower, these two outstanding historians consider the circumstances in which Puritan settlers first encountered indigenous peoples in the regions that became known as New England. In 1620, as Mr. Hall reminds us in "The Puritans: A Transatlantic History," members of a small and vulnerable new religious movement made the difficult journey across the Atlantic to establish homes, communities, habits and cultures in a dangerous and unpredictable New World. Barely surviving their first winter, after forging mutually beneficial friendships with the region's indigenous inhabitants, these pilgrims celebrated their first Thanksgiving in October 1621, providing all those who would join their colonial experiment with a creation story and a sacramental feast that would be used to define a generous and inclusive national community. Of course, this memory is in many ways ironic, for the community that founded the Plymouth Colony had abandoned any hope of inclusion within the established Church of England, and their relationship to the native peoples they encountered would be driven by hope, fear, exploitation and a determined struggle for power.
The Puritans who landed at Plymouth were not the first travelers from England to have to come to terms with a suddenly expanding world. As Mr. Mancall notes in "The Trials of Thomas Morton," his account of how an energetic and determined troublemaker provoked major tensions within this Puritan community, English contacts with North America actually dated from the late 15th century. John Cabot sailed from Bristol to Newfoundland in 1497. From the 1570s, English boats returned to the area to fish for cod. By the early 1600s, some of these sailors had ventured onto land and begun writing up their expeditions in narratives that could be read as travel adventures or as advertising copy for a colonial project, like that established at Jamestown in 1607. This New World was paradise, these publicists beamed, populated by friendly natives who were only too happy to share the bounty of their environment. And, as proof of their claims, the first explorers brought home human cargo -- stolen Americans who in their captivity had been taught to speak English and compelled to facilitate the systemic exploitation of their home.
This fake news of liberty, abundance and prosperity found a ready audience, among them members of the religious communities whose long experience of harassment and persecution is narrated so vividly in "The Puritans." Mr. Hall's magisterial work provides a ground-breaking international history of this controversial religious movement as it emerged in the Old World and evolved to shape the New. In constructing his chronicle, Mr. Hall, an emeritus professor at Harvard Divinity School, builds upon a career of extraordinary achievement in this field. His voluminous endnotes compress many decades of wide reading into what will become one of the definitive histories of its subject.
His narrative focuses on the century following upon the English and Scottish reformations of the 16th century. While the campaign for moral renewal was largely successful in Scotland, it failed in England, where efforts to create a godly society gave way to disputes about what a godly society ought to look like and how it might require a re-organization of the church. When it became clear that the old wineskins could not contain the new wine, a small but growing number of radical voices pushed for a "reformation without tarrying" -- for reforms that could not be achieved within the old structures of the state.
Almost inevitably, these believers began to plan for emigration. The emerging democratic culture of the congregations that they established fed into preferences in local political organization that turned out to be fundamental to the evolution of American political life. But despite their success in the English civil wars and the largely successful republican experiment under Oliver Cromwell, the Puritans made no similar impression in the Old World. This is why, Mr. Hall's work suggests, Puritanism remains so peripheral in accounts of British history while remaining central to the naming -- and claiming -- of New England.
In a brilliant riposte to scholarly conventions, and one that many scholars might want to qualify, Mr. Mancall works to undermine those kinds of claims in "The Trials of Thomas Morton." Picking apart the standard accounts of New England's beginnings, he reconstructs an early colonial experience that is troubled and contested, one that provides a powerful counter-narrative to the traditional accounts that have been institutionalized as cliches in the Thanksgiving tradition. Mr. Mancall, who teaches history and anthropology at the University of Southern California, focuses upon Thomas Morton, an individual who worked hard to disrupt the early colonial experiment.
Mr. Mancall describes New England from the perspective of a lawyer who was banished from the colony on three separate occasions. Morton had fled to the New World to escape complex family tensions, but as the publicist for an alternative colonial adventure, he found himself at the center of escalating political controversy. His only publication, "New English Canaan" (1637), combined his interests in natural history, anthropology, economics and anti-Puritan invective to argue that an alternative New World was possible. His goal was to imagine new ways of combining the expertise of Native Americans and their English friends, promoting a cooperative and environmentally sustainable colonial program that made no concessions to Augustinian reminders that the New World was just as fallen as the Old. Morton had prejudices of his own -- on several occasions he compared the customs of the Native Americans to those of the "wild Irish." But he wrote of the colonial engagements with unusual sympathy and observed the Native American experience of colonialism as the slow unfolding of disaster. As stories circulated of the riotous behavior of his followers on the aptly named colony of Merrymount, Morton ended up as an outcast from his fellow colonists, the "Lord of Misrule" who dissented from the political and territorial ambitions of his English neighbors, as well as from their theology, and one of the few individuals to be banished from New England.
Messrs. Hall and Mancall conclude their complementary works by thinking about the legacy of their subjects. For Mr. Hall, Puritanism provided later Americans with a language of moral reform and social critique. Turning aside from the Calvinist theology of the first settlers, later Americans worked to establish different kinds of "city on a hill" and have regularly pushed for cultural and political change in other kinds of "reformation without tarrying." For Mr. Mancall, Thomas Morton's life and book had "a deep impact on early New England, and a lasting influence on American culture," inspiring environmentalists alongside those who have advocated for racial justice and for indigenous peoples' rights. These contrasting stories point to the competition between ethical systems that lies at the heart of so much of the recurring tragedy of American political, cultural and religious history. For all their differences, both the Puritans and those who made every effort to oppose them were working for a better world.

Texto completo: Herbert Whalen, who worked with Clayton Morris selling investment properties in Indianapolis, was charged with defrauding clients.
The former business partner of Clayton Morris, the Fox News host turned financial guru, was indicted by a federal grand jury and arrested at his home in Indianapolis on Thursday on charges that he defrauded real estate investors recruited by Mr. Morris.
The indictment, by a grand jury in Newark, charged the former partner, Herbert Whalen, with conspiracy and wire fraud in connection with the sale of houses to two investors -- one from New Jersey and one from New York. But the charging document also said Mr. Whalen and "his co-conspirators caused millions of dollars in losses."
According to the 11-page indictment, Mr. Whalen and others enriched themselves by "misrepresenting and concealing the poor condition" of the homes they were selling in Indianapolis and "creating fake leases" to make it appear that the single-family houses had rent-paying tenants in them.
The charges are similar to the claims raised by dozens of former customers of Mr. Morris and his firm, Morris Invest, in lawsuits filed in federal and state court. The litigation and the finger-pointing between Mr. Morris and Mr. Whalen were reported this year by The New York Times and The Indianapolis Star.
Mr. Whalen, 45, who is known as Bert, was held overnight at an Indianapolis jail. He appeared Friday afternoon before a federal magistrate judge in Indianapolis who set conditions for his release pending his arraignment in federal court in Newark.
His lawyer, John Tompkins, said his client "has never committed fraud, and he has never intended to or conspired to commit any fraud."
The investigation by the F.B.I. began over a year ago. Besides the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors in New Jersey, the state attorneys general from Indiana and New Jersey are investigating the claims raised by investors. Mr. Whalen and Mr. Morris's company sold at least 1,000 houses in Indianpolis.
A spokesman for Craig Carpenito, the United States attorney for New Jersey, said he had no information on whether there would be additional charges.
The indictment does not refer to Mr. Morris or his business by name. The charging document refers to a company, based in New Jersey, whose owner is a resident of New Jersey. Until this summer, Mr. Morris and his family lived in Florham Park, N.J., before moving to Portugal.
David Hensel, the lawyer for Mr. Morris and his company, said his clients "commend the government for seeking justice for Bert Whalen's victims."
From Portugal, Mr. Morris has continued to post his popular weekly podcast and offer services that include selling investment homes and financial advice. A few weeks ago, he was scheduled to speak at a real estate conference in Philadelphia, but his appearance was canceled at the last minute.

Michael Bloomberg set to spend more in one week on TV ad blitz than any candidate ever

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg will spend tens of millions of dollars on television ads, which would set a record, in at least 100 media markets across the country starting next week, a sign that he could announce his presidential campaign in the coming days.
The ads, some of which are 60 seconds long, are expected to air from Nov. 25 through Dec. 3. They are expected to cost Bloomberg at least $30 million, the New York Times and ABC reported. The sum is more than half of the about $50 million all the other Democratic presidential candidates combined have spent on television ads this year, according to FiveThirtyEight.
Ad spending tracking group Advertising Analyics said that the ad buy would be the largest-ever sum spent in one week by a candidate. President Barack Obama holds the current record of $24.9 million spent during the last week of his presidential campaign.
The former New York mayor has filed to appear on Democratic primary ballots in some states and, on Thursday, filed statement of candidacy paperwork with the Federal Election Commission. But his team indicated that the steps were formalities while he decides whether to launch a presidential campaign, and he has yet to announce a bid personally.
Bloomberg, who is worth an estimated $54 billion, is expected to self-finance his campaign and skip competing in the first four early nominating contest states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Instead, he will focus on winning delegates from primaries on the March 3 "Super Tuesday" and beyond.
Tom Steyer, a former hedge-fund manager worth about $1.6 billion who is also largely self-financing his campaign, is the only other presidential candidate to spend unusually large sums of money on television ads so far in the 2020 cycle. He has spent about $39 million so far on television ads.
Other Democratic presidential candidates have criticized Bloomberg's expected late entry into the large field of candidates and accused him of trying to buy the election.

Texto completo: According to a new filing with the Federal Election Commission, the Republican National Committee spent almost $100,000 on bulk purchases of Donald Trump, Jr. 's book "Triggered" as part of an incentive scheme for Republican donors.
The filing shows the Republican National Committee spending $94,800 at the bookstore "Books-A-Million" for "donor mementos," on Oct. 29 a few days before Trump's book was released on Nov. 5.
At the Books-A-Million retail price for "Triggered" of $30. 00, that would be about 3,160 copies of the book.
Mike Reed, an RNC spokesman, explained to The New York Times that the expenditure at Books-A-Million had gone toward copies of Trump's book.
"The book has been hugely popular," he said, noting that the RNC had made additional purchases of the book in November.
Last week, another RNC spokesman, Steve Guest, said in a statement to the Associated Press the book had been purchased as a fundraising incentive for donors, but that the book was bought "to keep up with demand" instead of a "large bulk purchase. "
When asked about the single large expenditure on books, Reed told the Times that the RNC stood by its previous statement.

Trump's book has been in the top spot on The New York Times bestseller list for "combined print and e-book nonfiction" for two weeks, a fact that Trump's father, President Donald Trump, has highlighted.
The book's position on the bestseller list had been caveated with a dagger symbol, which meant that some of the book's sales were bulk purchases, according to the Associated Press. Bulk purchases sometimes indicate that the author himself or someone associated with him bought a large number of copies.
Trump retweeted posts from conservative reporter Ryan Saavedra and Trump campaign adviser and partner Kimberly Guilfoyle about the book that argued the book could have been a bestseller even without the RNC's purchases.
"This book and its author are something special," Guilfoyle wrote.

Texto completo: American Cooking
By Dale Brown (1968)
1. "Equal parts of bounty, diversity and ingenuity" is how James Beard cheerfully sums up our national cuisine in the preface to "American Cooking," part of a 27-book Time-Life series called "Foods of the World." The America of this book basks in a golden glow reminiscent of "Oklahoma!" No TV dinners intrude here. Folksy characters enthusiastically relish Rhode Island clambakes and Southern church suppers; Appalachian mules grind sorghum into syrup. The nation in the 1960s may have been rocked by student rebellion and other expressions of social unrest, but in this picture of America, old-fashioned values—the culinary kind, at any rate—still count. Not everyone agreed with this vision. In 1974, National Lampoon published a piece called "The Cooking of Provincial New Jersey," perfectly reproducing the breathless Time-Life style with titles like "The Prepared Food Mixes: From Powder to Perfection" and "Twenty-One Cuisines, One Great Taste." Nevertheless, the rediscovery of farm-to-table over recent decades testifies to the long-term validity of this optimistic snapshot of American taste.
Something From the Oven
By Laura Shapiro (2004)
2. A memorable work about women and food. The 1950s have long been burdened by sneers about huge cars with fins and dishes like tuna-noodle casserole and Jell-O salad. But in defense of postwar cuisine, it can at least be said that Americans cooked their own meals and didn't spend nearly as much money as we do today on food prepared by other people. Women, who did most of the cooking, were regularly confronted with advertising persuading them to try this or that frozen or dehydrated product. But, as Laura Shapiro points out, "straight through the 1950s women kept cooking. . . . And straight through the '50s, the food industry . . . insisted that women weren't cooking; they didn't want to cook, they had no time to cook." There was a reason. Food companies profited more from processed products than from staples. The Pillsbury Co. sponsored a wildly successful contest, the Pillsbury Bake-Off, featuring women skilled at baking and confident of that skill. But there was also the "Can Opener Cookbook" by Poppy Cannon. What did it say that this work, premised on the idea that cooking is a drag, became a best-seller with its "Frizzled Ham With Bananas Haitian" (involving canned ham, bananas and rum) and a floating-island dessert made from lemon Jell-O and Royal instant custard?

Roadfood
By Jane Stern and Michael Stern (1980)
3. "Roadfood" offered a way to discover real food and avoid the numbing, processed sameness of the off ramp. The second edition (1980) describes it as "a survival guide for cross-country travelers or a directory of regional cuisines." Rather than exalting nearly extinct traditions such as Southern beaten biscuits or Boston baked beans, the Sterns featured quirky specialties like the meat and potato pasties of Michigan's Upper Peninsula and mutton barbecue from Owensboro, Ky. The authors reported on diners, stands and restaurants that heroically carried on making their own chili, salad dressing or layer cake despite being endangered by fast food and new fashions. Because roadfooding can be "a dangerous business," the Sterns provided survival tips like "Do not order barbecued pork in Texas and do not order barbecued beef in the Carolinas." They advised staying away from "pre-fab" offerings at a West Virginia restaurant in favor of its homemade pies and honey chicken. To the extent that we now treasure the unpredictable and authentic, it is at least partly thanks to the Sterns.
High on the Hog
By Jessica B. Harris (2011)
4. It's no secret that the most important influence on American cuisine is African-American. As far back as 1895, the New York Times observed that insofar as there is a national cuisine, it is of African origin. Jessica Harris is an unmatched guide to African and American culinary combinations. Products such as yams and black-eyed peas were brought from Africa, but it was the New World that shaped most of the stories recorded here. African-American chefs such as James Hemings, who worked for Thomas Jefferson, became expert in French haute cuisine. Hemings brought back from France techniques for crème brûlée and meringue. He popularized waffles, bread stuffing and vanilla flavoring. Since Emancipation, Southern, "down home" and soul have represented different sides of African-American culinary distinctiveness—a tradition that has never been monolithic.
Grinding It Out: The Making of McDonald's
By Ray Kroc (1977)
5. Ray Kroc was a salesman for the kitchen-equipment company Prince Castle when he came across what Mac and Dick McDonald had created in San Bernardino, Calif.: a stripped-down, assembly-line restaurant offering burgers, fries and beverages with instant service, consistent quality and negligible overhead cost. "When I saw it working that day in 1954, I felt like some latter-day Newton who'd just had an Idaho potato caromed off his skull." It wasn't only the efficiency that mesmerized him, it was the pleasure the customers experienced. A young woman sitting in a yellow convertible was "demolishing a hamburger . . . her appetite magnified by the many people in the cars that filled the parking lot." Kroc is, above all, fanatically curious about kitchens, businesses and innovations. Not all of his ideas worked. Before McDonald's, he tried to get bars to use Multimixer milkshake makers to make alcoholic drinks with ice cream. His breakthrough idea about burgers wasn't completely original, but his drive and ruthlessness made McDonald's a world-wide juggernaut. His story evokes the magical allure of fast food when it was new.

Texto completo: Big tech companies such as Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Google have benefited from enabling users to easily share pictures or videos, but they are now working to stem the spread of maliciously doctored content ahead of next year's presidential election.
So-called deepfakes are images or videos that have been manipulated through the use of sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to make it almost impossible to differentiate between what is real and what isn't. While the technology has benign applications—Walt Disney Co. has used algorithms to insert characters in some of its "Star Wars" movies—it can be used to create nefarious content.
The tools to concoct fake images are improving so rapidly that soon it will be very hard to detect deepfakes with technology, said Dana Rao, executive vice president and general counsel for Adobe Inc., which is best known for its Photoshop image-editing software. The fight will be "an arms race," he said.
The number of deepfakes online nearly doubled from December to August, to 14,678, according to a study by cybersecurity startup Deeptrace. The rise has prompted action by tech giants.
Alphabet Inc.'s Google on Wednesday, in an update to its political advertisement policy , said it would prohibit the use of deepfakes in political and other ads.
Twitter earlier this month said it was considering identifying manipulated photos, videos and audio shared on its platform. "The risk is that these types of synthetic media and disinformation undermine the public trust and erode our ability to have productive conversations about critical issues," said Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity.
Facebook, Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. are working with more than a half-dozen universities to run a Deepfake Detection Challenge starting next month. It is intended to accelerate research into new ways of detecting and preventing media manipulated to mislead others, Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer wrote in a September blog post.
Interest in making deepfakes is growing fast, according to Deeptrace. Two years ago the first deepfakes appeared on Reddit, the popular chat forum. Now, at least 20 websites and online forums are devoted to discussions about how to better produce them.
Deeptrace found online services that can generate and sell custom deepfakes in as little as two days and for a cost as low as $2.99 a video, the researchers said.
"It doesn't take a lot of skill," said Matt Turek, a program manager overseeing deepfake-related research and development efforts at the Pentagon's technology incubator, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The Pentagon is studying deepfakes out of concern that military planners could be fooled into making bad decisions if altered images aren't detected.

Darpa has developed a prototype media forensics tool for use by government agencies to detect altered photos and video. It wants to develop additional technology to detect synthetic audio and fake text and identify the source and intent of any manipulated content.
How companies deal with deepfakes is another point of conflict between tech companies and Washington. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) denounced Facebook earlier this year for its refusal to take down a doctored video of her. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, following the incident, said the company was reviewing its policy on deepfakes.
Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas has co-sponsored legislation with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D., Nev.) to boost research to identify such content manipulation. On Wednesday, Mr. Moran called deepfakes "a specific threat to U.S. voters and consumers by way of misinformation that is increasingly difficult to identify."
Several startups have emerged to work on image verification, and now big tech companies, which have been criticized for not doing more to prevent disinformation, are getting more involved in the fight.
For example, Facebook has amassed more than 100,000 videos featuring actors that researchers can use to help develop and test systems to spot deepfakes. Facebook said its users' data isn't part of the research.
Google has similarly built up a catalog to hone deepfake-detection research. This year the company assembled a trove of audio clips to help researchers develop ways to identify fake speech that can be spliced into a video. Google also is drawing on its development of text-to-speech conversion tools to devise new ones that can help authenticate a speaker.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What role should tech companies play in identifying altered media? Join the conversation below.
Adobe is taking a different approach. The company has developed a system that will allow authors and publishers to attach information to content, such as who created it and when and where. It is working with New York Times Co. and Twitter and will share the technology, which it envisions serving as industrywide system for authenticating content.
Adobe said it would offer the authentication tool on its Photoshop editing software starting in 2020. Adobe expects most legitimate authors and creators to opt into the feature, while bad actors wouldn't, Mr. Rao said.
Elsewhere, the nonprofit arm of the AI Foundation, an advocacy group for the safe use of artificial intelligence, has created a website to help election campaigns and journalists analyze photos and videos within minutes of receiving them. The portal, called Reality Defender 2020, uses complex algorithms to detect pixel changes and other anomalies—such as in a candidate's mannerisms, mouth movements, face wrinkles and shadows—to detect alterations. It has drawn on research from dozens of academics.
"There is no one silver bullet," said Rob Meadows, the AI Foundation's founder and chief technology officer.

Political Economics: Inside Beijing's Ministry for Taking Things Away

Texto completo: Last weekend's publication of leaked documents about Beijing's abuses of China's Uighur citizens was so shocking on its face that many subtle points may have been lost. One of the more important is the extent to which China's political economy has shifted from giving-things-out mode to taking-things-away mode.
To recap, the New York Times released a trove of secret Communist Party documents, 403 pages, related to the repression that continues in the far west region of Xinjiang. For several years Beijing, under President Xi Jinping, has been engaged in what can best be described as cultural genocide. As many as a million Uighurs (ethnic Turkic Muslims) are believed to be interned in camps; traditional cultural trappings such as abstention from alcohol or a beard can land one in such a prison.
The secret papers reveal how Beijing justifies this abuse to itself and also some practicalities related to the running of 21st-century concentration camps. Shocking details from the report included a script for police to explain to Uighur students returning from universities elsewhere in China why their families were in the camps (to cure them of the "virus" of radicalism) and threatening those students not to make a fuss (or else your parents will remain captive longer). The papers document secret speeches to party cadres in which Mr. Xi railed against the supposed terrorist threat from the Uighurs.
The documents also illustrate an important shift in the party's approach to its own legitimacy under Mr. Xi. Beijing has long fretted about separatism in Xinjiang. Before Mr. Xi, the main method for addressing this was to purchase affection -- a program of public-works investment and economic opportunities for the Uighurs, with which to buy their acquiescence to Communist rule.
No more. The leaked documents lay bare a purge of Communist Party officials responsible for implementing that policy in and around Xinjiang in recent years. The regime opened more than 12,000 investigations into Party members in Xinjiang in 2017 alone. Mr. Xi has disbanded the informal "Ministry for Handing Things Out," as one might think of the party apparatus previously oriented toward buying hearts and minds. In its place he has created a "Ministry for Taking Things Away" -- a hard-line cohort of officials newly determined to strip Uighurs of cultural identity, economic favors and even their freedom in order to beat them into submission.
This is part of a pattern Mr. Xi is repeating in many other parts of greater China.
In Hong Kong, gone is Beijing's old tolerance for political independence and the hope that the city's partial freedom and rising prosperity would divide and weaken opposition to Beijing's ultimate sovereignty. In its place Mr. Xi proposed an extradition law that would, quite literally, whisk obstreperous Hong Kongers away from their families. This week Beijing doubled down by trying to take away more of Hong Kong's constitutional autonomy with an assault on the independent judiciary.
Beijing wields its Ministry for Taking Things Away against Western companies, threatening to yank their products from the Chinese market. The National Basketball Association is supposed to kowtow to Beijing's demands that even little-known managers not criticize the regime because otherwise the Communist Party will not allow China's middle class to watch American basketball.
Germany is embroiled in a debate over whether to buy 5G wireless-network equipment from Huawei despite security concerns. The fear in some corners of Berlin seems to be that if Germany doesn't buy Huawei equipment, the Ministry for Taking Things Away won't allow Chinese consumers to buy German cars.
In both cases, Chinese citizens are targets as much as the Westerners. The message: We will subordinate your comfort to our power.
What could explain the shift?
One factor is a shortage of things to hand out. The most important economic story of our day is that the Chinese Communist Party has run out of reliable ways to stimulate its economy of 1.4 billion consumers. With the old Ministry for Handing Things Out perilously short of resources, some other means of political control has to be found.
The other is human nature. Good Communists like Mr. Xi are die-hard materialists who chronically fail to grasp any human motivation other than the crassly economic. Imagine his surprise watching young Hong Kongers protest out of a confusing mix of economic frustrations feeding into greater social and even spiritual aspirations that only freedom can satisfy. History could have warned him, as revolutions most often take root not in the poorest societies but in those where prior economic growth has failed to satisfy other civic yearnings.
The job of the Ministry for Taking Things Away is to crush that spirit through a combination of outright violence (Xinjiang and Hong Kong) or at a minimum demoralization (basketball and cars). Can this ministry succeed? That Mr. Xi must ask himself this is a sign of profound regime weakness, no matter how many jackboots his ministry sends into the streets.

AJC GEORGIA FOOTBALL FROM THE FIELD TO THE LOCKER ROOM: It's not so hard to see Fromm staying

Texto completo: Scanning some of the latest 2020 NFL mock drafts -- God, what's happened to my life, it used to hold such promise -- there's one name that stubbornly refuses to show itself as a first-day possibility: Jake Fromm.
The junior Georgia quarterback, who will mull the decision to leave early for the draft once the Bulldogs run out of games, has done nothing this season to make that call automatic and easy. His stock has remained mostly flat as he guides an offense that doesn't feature its quarterback above all others, and he puts up numbers that are really good but fall south of gaudy.
Even a traumatic injury within the quarterbacking fraternity has done little to alter Fromm's rank within it.
Most of these pointless exercises still cling to Tua Tagovailoa as a first-rounder after his tricky hip surgery and an already busy medical history. And there was this from an Alabama website: "Three longtime NFL personnel guys told AL.com that if they had to bet on it, Tagovailoa would still go somewhere in the first half of the first round even after suffering the hip injury. Possibly even still in the top-10."
In all cases, Fromm comes in after LSU's Joe Burrow, Tagovailoa and Oregon's Justin Herbert. And in most cases he'd be taken behind Oklahoma's Jalen Hurts; and in some cases even behind one guy Fromm displaced at Georgia, Washington's Jacob Eason as well as Utah State's Jordan Love.
A couple of sites dare to extend themselves beyond the first round, and only in those does Fromm's name appear.
The quarterback draft order, featuring those select names above, from draftwire.usatoday.com:
1. Burrow; 4. Tagovailoa;
11. Herbert; 45. (second round) Hurts; 48. Eason;
80. (third round) Love; 94. Fromm.
And from draftsite.com:
1. Burrow; 3. Tagovailoa;
6. Herbert; 44. (second round) Fromm; 75. (third round) Hurts; 129. (fourth round) Eason; 165. (fifth round) Love.
Of course, the guesswork involved in such ranking, here before even the draft order is set, is along the lines of a butcher performing open-heart surgery in the dark.
And I'd argue that once NFL personnel people get to actually interview Fromm and come to gauge all those quarterbacking qualities that are immeasurable, somebody's going to get quite smitten.
Still, I'll use these imperfect tools to help fashion the unsolicited advice that Fromm be in no hurry to join the mercenaries at the next level. Right now, sticking around for his senior season at Georgia doesn't seem unfathomable at all.
Fromm, and The Decision (Georgia version) is one of the intriguing puzzles of the coming draft, his future the 5-star Sudoku atop the Saturday New York Times crossword.
Just watching him now, I see a player who might be well-served staying another year. We've seen him limited by the elements to 35 passing yards one game against Kentucky and surgically spay and neuter Florida with 279 yards and a pair of touchdowns the next game. He's thrown three interceptions in a loss against South Carolina and three touchdowns in a big win against Auburn. His two worst games in terms of completion percentage since his freshman season (both under 47 percent) have been his past two. There have been just enough "meh" moments thrown in with the "oh, my" ones to make coming back for his senior season more a possibility than most would have thought.
Don't assign Fromm the faint slander of "game manager;" he is assuredly more than that. Although he does rank 62nd among FBS quarterbacks in completions per game, 60th in yards per attempt, 71st in yards per game and 44th in passing touchdowns per game. Rather managerial numbers at that.
It's just that his job at Georgia doesn't entail him going pass-crazy. In fact, you didn't want him throwing too much -- he was 0-5 in games with 30 or more attempts until the Florida game this year.
Between running a system that values bludgeoning over the big play and trying to get on the same page with a new batch of young receivers, this has not been the kind of season in which Fromm has really shown off. Hey, next year always holds the possibility of doing more.
In terms of "arm talent" Fromm isn't the prettiest quarterback at the prom. That's why he gets passed over in these remote mock drafts; those strangers just don't get to know him the way the Bulldogs fan does.
No one can say for sure what kind of NFL quarterback Fromm will make -- I'd guess that he is going to be quite good, somewhere between Mitchell Trubisky and Aaron Rodgers. How's that for a wide range? Wish I could be more specific, but that is part of the mystery of Jake Fromm.
But I'm in no great hurry to find out exactly where exactly he falls as a pro.
More certain is the fact that Fromm is an extraordinary college quarterback, one who appeals to every selfish motive that he stays at Georgia long enough to get us all through the next election.

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential debate carried live on MSNBC Wednesday night drew 6.6 million viewers, according to Nielsen, which is the smallest audience so far in the race to determine who will take on President Trump in the 2020 election.
Sponsored by Comcast Corp.'s MSNBC and the Washington Post, the debate was the fifth among the Democratic contenders. It came after a long day of impeachment hearings that aired on cable news channels, which may have contributed to political fatigue for viewers.
MSNBC said its online broadcast of the debate notched more than 1.3 million live-streams.
The previous Democratic debate, which was carried by CNN and co-sponsored by the New York Times, averaged 8.5 million viewers.
The next Democratic debate is scheduled for Dec. 19 and will be carried by PBS and CNN.

Texto completo: Last weekend's publication of leaked documents about Beijing's abuses of China's Uighur citizens was so shocking on its face that many subtle points may have been lost. One of the more important is the extent to which China's political economy has shifted from giving-things-out mode to taking-things-away mode.
To recap, the New York Times released a trove of secret Communist Party documents , 403 pages, related to the repression that continues in the far west region of Xinjiang. For several years Beijing, under President Xi Jinping, has been engaged in what can best be described as cultural genocide. As many as a million Uighurs (ethnic Turkic Muslims) are believed to be interned in camps; traditional cultural trappings such as abstention from alcohol or a beard can land one in such a prison.
The secret papers reveal how Beijing justifies this abuse to itself and also some practicalities related to the running of 21st-century concentration camps. Shocking details from the report included a script for police to explain to Uighur students returning from universities elsewhere in China why their families were in the camps (to cure them of the "virus" of radicalism) and threatening those students not to make a fuss (or else your parents will remain captive longer). The papers document secret speeches to party cadres in which Mr. Xi railed against the supposed terrorist threat from the Uighurs.
The documents also illustrate an important shift in the party's approach to its own legitimacy under Mr. Xi. Beijing has long fretted about separatism in Xinjiang. Before Mr. Xi, the main method for addressing this was to purchase affection—a program of public-works investment and economic opportunities for the Uighurs, with which to buy their acquiescence to Communist rule.
No more. The leaked documents lay bare a purge of Communist Party officials responsible for implementing that policy in and around Xinjiang in recent years. The regime opened more than 12,000 investigations into Party members in Xinjiang in 2017 alone. Mr. Xi has disbanded the informal "Ministry for Handing Things Out," as one might think of the party apparatus previously oriented toward buying hearts and minds. In its place he has created a "Ministry for Taking Things Away"—a hard-line cohort of officials newly determined to strip Uighurs of cultural identity, economic favors and even their freedom in order to beat them into submission.
This is part of a pattern Mr. Xi is repeating in many other parts of greater China.
In Hong Kong, gone is Beijing's old tolerance for political independence and the hope that the city's partial freedom and rising prosperity would divide and weaken opposition to Beijing's ultimate sovereignty. In its place Mr. Xi proposed an extradition law that would, quite literally, whisk obstreperous Hong Kongers away from their families. This week Beijing doubled down by trying to take away more of Hong Kong's constitutional autonomy with an assault on the independent judiciary .
Beijing wields its Ministry for Taking Things Away against Western companies, threatening to yank their products from the Chinese market. The National Basketball Association is supposed to kowtow to Beijing's demands that even little-known managers not criticize the regime because otherwise the Communist Party will not allow China's middle class to watch American basketball.
Germany is embroiled in a debate over whether to buy 5G wireless-network equipment from Huawei despite security concerns. The fear in some corners of Berlin seems to be that if Germany doesn't buy Huawei equipment, the Ministry for Taking Things Away won't allow Chinese consumers to buy German cars.
In both cases, Chinese citizens are targets as much as the Westerners. The message: We will subordinate your comfort to our power.
What could explain the shift?
One factor is a shortage of things to hand out. The most important economic story of our day is that the Chinese Communist Party has run out of reliable ways to stimulate its economy of 1.4 billion consumers. With the old Ministry for Handing Things Out perilously short of resources, some other means of political control has to be found.
The other is human nature. Good Communists like Mr. Xi are die-hard materialists who chronically fail to grasp any human motivation other than the crassly economic. Imagine his surprise watching young Hong Kongers protest out of a confusing mix of economic frustrations feeding into greater social and even spiritual aspirations that only freedom can satisfy. History could have warned him, as revolutions most often take root not in the poorest societies but in those where prior economic growth has failed to satisfy other civic yearnings.
The job of the Ministry for Taking Things Away is to crush that spirit through a combination of outright violence (Xinjiang and Hong Kong) or at a minimum demoralization (basketball and cars). Can this ministry succeed? That Mr. Xi must ask himself this is a sign of profound regime weakness, no matter how many jackboots his ministry sends into the streets.

FedEx Delivers Billions to the Taxman

Texto completo: The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution makes clear "the right of the people . . . to petition the government for a redress of grievances," and the FedEx board of directors and senior management takes this very seriously. As a corporate citizen, we decided many years ago to engage openly in four areas of public policy that have strategic implications for our company and the more than half a million people who work for us: energy, the environment, trade and taxes.
Although FedEx is an American company focused mostly on governmental issues in the U.S., we serve 220 countries and territories around the world, and appropriately make our views known on these topics internationally as well. We would never advocate policies that we did not feel benefit society overall.
During the Obama administration, and more recently the Trump administration, we worked consistently to change U.S. corporate tax policies. As one country after another lowered corporate tax rates, the U.S. stood by and allowed wide swaths of this country to be deindustrialized due in large measure to its globally uncompetitive business tax rates. At the same time, the country lost focus on vital trade policies following the financial crisis of 2008-09.
The primary victims of this governmental disregard were blue-collar, high-school-educated wage earners, particularly outside metropolitan areas. President Obama belatedly came to embrace the need for a change in both policy areas and supported lower corporate tax rates, increased infrastructure spending, and new trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. I met with Mr. Obama several times on these issues, and I hope our views were in part responsible for his positions during his second term.
When President Trump took over along with a Republican Congress, we worked very hard through various open communication channels, coalitions, and meetings with members of Congress and the administration to effect passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
While I met with Mr. Trump on a couple of occasions, I never discussed tax reform with him, although we did talk about other public-policy matters. We at FedEx were very pleased when he signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec. 22, 2017. In response, we increased capital expenditures. We placed a major order for 24 Boeing wide-body freighters, funded major facilities modernizations and expansions, put additional funds in our pension plan, and increased wages by more than $200 million.
Had the tax cuts not passed, we would have significantly lowered capital expenditures in 2018. Instead, the expensing provision of the legislation encouraged FedEx to buy new 777F and 767F aircraft. During the debate on tax reform, the chief executive of UPS, David Abney, and I jointly penned an op-ed in these pages urging passage of corporate tax reform.
I know the FedEx aircraft orders created thousands of incremental new jobs for Boeing, General Electric (the engine supplier on freighters), and a multitude of smaller suppliers. In fact, each order of a 777F injects about $540 million into the U.S. economy, supports 1,850 jobs, and generates roughly $45 million in federal, state and local taxes.
While major capital expenditures under the tax-cut legislation can be expensed, thereby initially deferring U.S. corporate tax receipts, these assets should produce significant revenues for the U.S. Treasury in the years to come while also providing great jobs for the thousands of people who will operate, maintain and provision FedEx and UPS aircraft.
There is little doubt the significant increase in U.S. employment and wages since the tax cuts were passed is due to the decrease of corporate tax rates from 35% (which we used to pay) to 21%, which is competitive with the rest of the industrialized world. Over the past five years, we have paid more than $10 billion in U.S. taxes. After the temporary effect of capital expensing wears off, I expect FedEx will pay billions more into the U.S. Treasury from the earnings produced by our investments.
The recent slowdown in U.S. companies' capital expenditures is, in my opinion, due to trade disputes and the attendant global slowdown. We believe re-embracing TPP and TTIP and passing the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement would reverse these trends in short order.
With the above background in mind, I urge readers to review the New York Times's disparaging story from Nov. 17 about FedEx's involvement in corporate tax reform and see a great example of polemics: printing selected facts, connecting unrelated events, and implying nefarious activities when there were none whatever. FedEx takes great pride in being a good corporate citizen -- here and abroad -- at all times.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a great achievement for the American people, and we are proud to have played a small role in passing this important legislation.

Texto completo: The three-day, family-friendly, annual Bluffton Book Festival is back for another year Thursday through Saturday.
The festival, whose mission is to raise literacy levels in the state and Beaufort County, benefits the Literacy Center of Beaufort County as well as the national Book Industry Charitable Foundation.
A highlight event will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday on Calhoun Street when New York Times bestselling children's author and illustrator James Dean will hold a speaking event for 100 ticketed guests.
Dean will discuss his acclaimed "Pete the Cat" series and introduce his latest installment, "Pete the Cat and the Perfect Pizza Party."
The speaking event will be part of the larger street festival planned for Saturday, also from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., along Calhoun Street between Lawton and Green streets.
The free event will feature author readings and signings, performances, crafts, games, giveaways, food and music.
The festival kicks off with four scheduled workshops between Thursday and Friday at the Lowcountry Presbyterian Church fellowship hall. The workshop schedule is:
* 9-10 a.m. Thursday: Self-editing for publication with award-winning author and editor Susan Diamond Riley.
* 10-11 a.m. Thursday: Navigating pathways to publication with Pat Conroy Literary Center executive director Jonathan Haupt.
* 2-3 p.m. Friday: Writing believable crime fiction with award-winning author and former FBI agent Dana Ridenour.
* 3-4 p.m. Friday :
Ghostwriting 101 with celebrity ghostwriter Vickie MacIntyre.
The Taste of Gullah event scheduled for Thursday evening was canceled, according to the festival's website, which states that those who registered will be refunded.
​There will be a pair of Pat Conroy-inspired lectures at the Bluffton Library from 2-4:30 p.m. Thursday.
The first will be led by Nancy Thode, whose lecture will be about her mother Ann Head. The festival website describes Head as "Beaufort's forgotten novelist and Pat Conroy's creative writing mentor."
In part two, author Bernie Schein will share stories from his newly released memoir, "Pat Conroy: Our Lifelong Friendship."
At 11:30 a.m. Friday at the Arts Center of Coastal Carolina, Tina Lifford, star of Oprah Winfrey's and Ava DuVernay's critically acclaimed OWN Network show "Queen Sugar," will speak about her time on the show and introduce her soon-to-be-released book "The Little Book of Big Lies."
"Also learn about the area of Louisiana (much like Mitchelville on Hilton Head Island in that it was left to ancestors of slaves), which is the inspiration for the book and television show Queen Sugar," the festival website states.
From 6-9 p.m. Friday, the festival's featured authors will wine and dine with guests at the Masquerade & Mystery Under the Moonlight dinner at Oak Terrace at Rose Hill.
The dinner will feature a three-course meal, a question-and-answer session with authors, and a book-signing period. The event calls for "southern charm attire" or to come dressed as a favorite book character. There will be prizes for the best book character costumes.

BURLINGTON — The future of the Vermont Lake Monsters is in doubt.
According to a New York Times report, the New-York Penn League franchise is one of 42 minor league teams with which Major League Baseball is proposing to sever ties as part of a consolidation of the minor league system. If approved, the change would occur in 2021.
But officials at Vermont’s minor league baseball team are vowing to fight MLB’s efforts to cut ties.
“This is a pretty drastic idea ... one that this industry has never seen before,” said Kyle Bostwick, vice president of the Vermont Lake Monsters. “And we’re a strong franchise that is economically viable. You know, we have strong local ownership with a huge impact on the local community, so it doesn’t make any sense.”
Bostwick said the MLB proposal is not a done deal and could be rejected by the Minor League Ownership Committee.
More than 100 bipartisan U.S. House members, including U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt, have signed a letter urging MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred to reconsider the proposal.
In a written statement Tuesday, Welch said the plan would be a “devastating blow” to communities around the country. The congressman added that if the league follows through with the plan, he and his House colleagues will “take a close look at the statutory advantages” for Major League Baseball, which Welch said includes the league’s longstanding exemption from anti-trust laws.
News reports have documented MLB’s concerns about antiquated minor league facilities and the distance between some teams and their parent clubs.
The Lake Monsters fair poorly by both measures: They are 3,000 miles away from the Oakland Athletics, their parent club, and the University of Vermont’s Centennial Field, where they are housed, opened in 1906 — it’s one of the oldest in all of professional baseball.
Many of the teams that would lose their affiliations are from the lower rungs of the minor league system, which the Lake Monsters occupy. They are one of seven teams in the 14-team short-season Single A New York-Penn League reportedly on the chopping block.
Under the reported proposal, the clubs would be invited to join a so-called “Dream League.” Comprised of players who were not drafted or have failed to stick in the major leagues, it would likely represent a lower level of baseball.
The New York Times quoted a minor league official as saying the plan would be a “death sentence” for the clubs.
Losing major league affiliation would diminish the cachet of the Lake Monsters and other teams. More significantly, major league teams currently pay for the players and coaches at affiliated clubs, while the teams themselves cover field, travel and other operational costs.
Under the plan reported in the New York Times, MLB, which currently has 160 affiliated minor league teams, would cut 42 teams and add two more for a total of 120 teams.
MLB argues the consolidation would make player development more efficient and allow clubs to pay the remaining minor leaguers higher salaries. Critics have also said the minor leagues are chock-full of players who have no realistic chance of ever being promoted to the big leagues.

Texto completo: The attorney general of Washington, D.C., is suing food-delivery company DoorDash Inc. for pocketing tips on deliveries, the attorney general's office said Tuesday.
DoorDash previously guaranteed workers a minimum amount for each delivery. When customers electronically added a tip to their total bill, the company put that payment toward the guaranteed minimum the worker receives, rather than increasing the payment by the amount of the tip.
The company "misled customers, who reasonably believed that their tips would go to workers," D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in prepared remarks.
The attorney general is seeking a court order to force DoorDash to surrender the tips and pay civil penalties.
The attorney general's office started investigating the company in March and looked at DoorDash's operations over more than two years up to September 2019.
The attorney general's office said its investigation "confirmed that DoorDash used consumer tips to offset the company's payment to workers" and that while the company encouraged tipping, workers were still paid the same most of the time.
"We strongly disagree with and are disappointed by the action taken today," a DoorDash spokesperson said in an email statement. "We believe the assertions made in the complaint are without merit and we look forward to responding to them through the legal process."
The company's payment structure faced criticism following a July story in the New York Times.
Earlier this year, DoorDash said it would change its tipping policy and that the money its delivery people made in tips would be equivalent to what customers tipped on orders and that their profits would rise on average.

Main Street: The Attack on Asian-Americans

Texto completo: Asian-Americans have finally made it in America. How do we know? Not from their wealth or educational achievements, but from the way progressives now target those in the community who believe people shouldn't be judged by skin color. For in so doing, these Asian-Americans have exposed a growing fault line in affirmative-action orthodoxy.
The most recent occasion for progressive grievance comes courtesy of the state of Washington. There, Asian-Americans proved instrumental in killing a law that would have overturned a two-decade-old ban on racial preferences in public education, employment and contracting. To do this, Asian-Americans successfully rallied to force the law onto the ballot -- and then defeated it. It's a staggering achievement in a state that ranks among America's bluest, and in a contest where the pro-affirmative-action side enjoyed more resources plus the support of the political establishment, including an Asian-American former governor.
The ballot referendum in Washington isn't the first time Asian-Americans have rebelled against an attempt to sneak racial discrimination back into the law. Five years ago, when California considered a law that would have reversed its own ban on racial preferences, a backlash by the Asian-American community forced three Asian-American Democrats who had voted yes in the state Senate to switch sides -- dooming the measure. In New York, Asian-Americans are now battling Mayor Bill de Blasio's bid to increase the number of African-American and Latino kids at the city's specialized high schools -- at the expense of Asian-American children. Meanwhile, a high-profile lawsuit brought against Harvard for its race-based admissions preferences is likely to end up before the Supreme Court.
The Asian-American role in these campaigns is not going over well in some parts of the community. Comedian Hasan Minhaj closed out his 2018 Netflix special by calling the Asian-Americans suing Harvard "the worst kind" of Americans. Playwright Young Jean Lee wrote an op-ed in the New York Times calling the Harvard lawsuit "a cynical manipulation that urges Asian-Americans to sell out other people of color." In the Nation, Claire Jean Kim says that what we are seeing is "nascent, conservative Chinese immigrant nationalism" combining with "an older, conservative white nationalism" to inflame anti-affirmative-action politics.
That's one way of looking at it. Another is that increasing numbers of Asian-Americans, rather than unthinkingly embracing identity-politics dogma, have come to recognize that using race discrimination to promote diversity, especially in education, is excluding their children from opportunities they have earned. Some are also struck by a progressive narrative that encourages the celebration of diversity -- the Asian-American community itself spans dozens of nations, ethnicities, religions and languages -- even while insisting all are required to think alike.
One man whose name comes up often in these complaints is Edward Blum. A visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, Mr. Blum is also president of Students for Fair Admissions, which is leading the lawsuit against Harvard. In an earlier day Mr. Blum might have been hailed for reaching out across racial lines to work for a colorblind America. Alas, the demonology of the day holds that Mr. Blum is working cynically, as the American Civil Liberties Union puts it, to "pit people of color against one another." Never mind that Mr. Blum makes an unlikely avatar for white privilege.
"I grew up in a Yiddish-speaking household where we children were taught that racial and religious discrimination were malicious," he says. "My efforts to help end the discrimination that Asian-Americans suffer when applying to elite colleges is part of a long tradition of civil rights advocates."
The champions of affirmative action point out that when Washington's ban originally passed in November 1998, it did so with a robust 58% of the vote. This time, it was sustained very narrowly (50.4% to 49.6%), suggesting public opposition to affirmative action is thinning. But Mr. Blum suggests that the vague wording of the referendum -- which included language guaranteeing opportunity and prohibiting quotas -- may have more to do with the narrow margin.
Compare the wording of Washington ballot measure, he says, with that of a Pew Research Center survey from earlier this year. When asked directly whether "race or ethnicity" should be a "major factor," a "minor factor" or "not a factor" in college admissions, 73% of Americans chose "not a factor." Not only did 78% of whites agree but so did 65% of Hispanics, 62% of blacks, 58% of Asian-Americans -- and 63% of Democrats.
Meanwhile Asian-American leaders who contend that affirmative action is doing their community no favors find themselves denounced as sellouts. Wai Wah Chin, president of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York, says this is no different from how blacks and Latinos who also dissent from the progressive party line on race have been treated.
"For many Asian-Americans who mobilized against the Washington ballot initiative," she says, "it was their first participation in American politics. In the 19th century we had the Chinese Exclusion Acts. In the 21st, we are fighting a modern Asian Exclusion Act."

Texto completo: In May 2017, elite marathon runner Shalane Flanagan tweeted a very personal piece of information. In all her years of training and competing against the best in the world, she wrote, she had never missed a menstrual cycle.
Five months later, she won the New York City Marathon.
Flanagan's tweet was startling because many athletes don't even talk to their coaches about their periods -- much less the world. It was also surprising because of the long-held perception that it's normal, even preferable, for women in distance sports to be so lean that they no longer menstruate.
"I just wanted to reinforce to endurance athletes that, 'Yes, here I am. I run 120, 130 miles a week. I don't miss (my period). So it's not normal,'" Flanagan said in a recent interview. "That doesn't mean I'm not trying or training hard enough."
Flanagan recently retired from competitive running and is transitioning to coaching in the elite Nike-sponsored Bowerman Track Club. She'll be one of the few high-level female coaches in the world, and said she plans to talk to athletes about their cycles.
A combination of mostly-male coaching ranks, a lack of sports-science research on women and public silence about the topic have combined to keep athlete menstruation in the background. But those dynamics are changing. Female athletes are speaking about the importance of getting a period and embracing emerging research about how hormonal fluctuations can affect training and performance.
Running prodigy Mary Cain told the New York Times recently that during her time with the now-defunct elite training group the Nike Oregon Project, she stopped getting her period for three years after coaches pressured her to lose weight. Nike has said it will investigate Cain's allegations.
Cain told her story in the wake of the four-year ban for doping conduct of her coach, Alberto Salazar. Salazar said he was sorry his frank discussions with athletes about the impact of weight on performance caused hurt feelings but disputed that he encouraged female athletes to maintain an unhealthy weight.
Dawn Scott, high-performance coach of the U.S. women's soccer team, talked after the team's World Cup victory about using the period-tracking app FitrWoman to help mitigate hormone-related performance shifts among players through nutrition and sleep.
Flanagan co-wrote the cookbook "Run Fast. Eat Slow," focusing on nourishing recipes for athletes, with Elyse Kopecky, who said she got an irregular period for years while a competitive runner in high school and at North Carolina.
Many female endurance athletes struggle with menstrual dysfunction at some point, often because they're not eating enough, said Kathryn Ackerman, medical director of the Female Athlete Program at Boston Children's Hospital.
"There's certainly a lot of resistance to gaining weight because there's no question that being light is an advantage in running," Dr. Ackerman said. "But when they start to get injured, they start to see that there's a delicate balance between getting normal function and being thin enough to feel like they are racing well."
The International Olympic Committee in recent years published consensus statements on a syndrome called Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport, or RED-S, from which men also can suffer. The syndrome is fueled by an athlete taking in less food than needed for her level of exercise, which results in inadequate energy to support healthy bodily functions -- including a menstrual cycle.
Most girls begin menstruating between ages 11 and 14, and can lose their periods if their weight or body fat are too low.
A common remedy for athletes who lose their periods has been to put them on hormonal birth control. But that approach masks the problem of underfueling, does not correct the multiple hormonal disruptions that can affect health and sports performance, and does not improve bone density, Dr. Ackerman said.
"The best solution is to get their own cycles," she said.
Menstrual cycles make women more complicated research subjects and historically discouraged medical studies on them, particularly in the area of sports science, said Georgie Bruinvels. She's lead scientist in the FitrWoman program, produced by the Ireland-based sports-science and data analytics company Orreco.
Hormone levels rise and fall during a woman's roughly 28-day menstrual cycle, and researchers only in recent years are figuring out exactly how those changes affect female athlete performance.
In the lead-up to last summer's World Cup, Dr. Bruinvels tracked U.S. women's soccer players' cycles. She made sure they consumed anti-inflammatory foods such as berries before their periods, took in enough iron during their periods and maintained healthy habits throughout the month.
"We know that eating a diet that is high is saturated fat, not eating enough anti-inflammatory and antioxidant-rich foods, not sleeping well, consuming too much alcohol, smoking and being psychologically stressed can all exacerbate symptoms," Dr. Bruinvels said. "So getting all of those in check is a really powerful way to help you manage symptoms."
Many athletes have flocked to the 2016 book "Roar," about how to match food and fitness to women's physiology. It was co-written by author and athlete Selene Yeager and Stacy Sims, senior research scientist with the Sports Performance Research Institute New Zealand at Auckland University of Technology.
At a recent TEDx talk, Dr. Sims said silence about periods is among the reasons girls drop out of sports.
In September, U.S. Olympic triathlete Sarah True asked her more than 20,000 Twitter followers: "Random question for female athletes & coaches of female athletes: Do you track menstrual cycles and the effects on performance? Not just menses," she wrote, using a medical word for period. Just over half of respondents said they did.
True said that only in the past year has she started tracking her cycle closely enough to see a pattern.
"My worst training days normally coincide with ovulation," she said. That means feeling sluggish, getting more headaches, having a lower tolerance for heat and performing worse at the highest-intensity exercises.
True said she was relieved to discover that the dip in performance had an explanation. She is 37 years old, and nearly all the coaches in her career have been men. Only with a few of them did she broach the topic of menstruation, she said.
"We've already accepted that high performance, a lot of it is about data," she said. "A potential breakthrough for women's sports is having a highly individualized training program that reflects hormonal fluctuation based on menstrual cycle."

Texto completo: Rights organizations called the decision a positive step but said the fast-food chain should do more.
Chick-fil-A said on Monday that it had stopped making charitable donations to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, groups that have been widely criticized by advocates for lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender rights.
The fast-food chain, a longtime target of L.G.B.T.Q. rights groups because of its stance on gay marriage, has met resistance in recent months as it has looked to expand in the United States and other countries.
Chick-fil-A had to cancel the opening of a restaurant at the Buffalo airport in March after local politicians objected to it, and it cut short its plans for a British expansion last month when activists organized a boycott of its first outlet there. In September, the grand opening of Chick-fil-A's first international location, in Toronto, was met with protesters who chanted, "Shame!"
Equal rights advocates described Chick-fil-A's decision to stop funding the charities as a positive step but called on the chain to do more.
The Fellowship of Christian Athletes, a nonprofit that encourages stronger Christian faith in athletes, requires student leaders to sign a statement banning "any homosexual act." The Salvation Army, a Christian charity, has been accused of discriminating against people based on their sexual orientation. (The Salvation Army maintains that it serves people of all genders and sexual orientations.)
On Monday, Chick-fil-A released a list of organizations to which its foundation has donated this year. The list did not include either organization, even though the groups had received millions of dollars from the foundation over the years.
Chick-fil-A had made "multiyear commitments" to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes that ended in 2018, a company spokeswoman said. Now, she said, the company plans to give to "a smaller number of organizations working exclusively in the areas of hunger, homelessness and education."
In an interview with the news website Bisnow, the president of Chick-fil-A, Tim Tassopoulos, appeared to frame the decision as a response to the company's critics.
"As we go into new markets, we need to be clear about who we are," he said. "There are lots of articles and newscasts about Chick-fil-A, and we thought we needed to be clear about our message."
But Chick-fil-A left open the possibility that it might resume donating to those organizations in the future. "No organization will be excluded from future consideration -- faith based or non-faith based," Mr. Tassopoulos said in a separate statement.
Chick-fil-A has faced widespread criticism from gay rights advocates since 2012, when Dan T. Cathy, the company's chairman and chief executive, was quoted saying Chick-fil-A believed in the "biblical definition of the family unit." Mr. Cathy commented after news reports revealed that the company's foundation had donated millions of dollars to efforts to prevent the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States.
Chick-fil-A ended nearly all its donations to groups opposed to equal rights for people of different sexual orientations in 2012. But since then, it has given money to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Last year, Chick-fil-A gave $ 1.65 million to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and $ 115,000 to the Salvation Army, according to tax filings.
The Fellowship of Christian Athletes did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Salvation Army said the organization was "saddened to learn that a corporate partner has felt it necessary to divert funding."
"We believe we are the largest provider of poverty relief to the L.G.B.T.Q.+ population," said Alex Yap, the Salvation Army spokeswoman. "When misinformation is perpetuated without fact, our ability to serve those in need, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or any other factor, is at risk."
Advocacy groups said Chick-fil-A should do more to support L.G.B.T.Q. rights.
"While this is an important step for Chick-fil-A, the company still does not have workplace protections and policies that are fully inclusive of L.G.B.T.Q. people," said Beck Bailey, the director of workplace equality at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, an arm of the largest L.G.B.T.Q. rights group in the United States.
Just days after Chick-fil-A's first British restaurant opened in October, the chain said it would close the site in six months amid protests led by a group called Reading Pride.
Martin Cooper, the chief executive of Reading Pride, said Chick-fil-A's decision to stop donating to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes had not changed the group's position.
"It is only a step," he said. "It's not an action that allows us to fully forgive."

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg is surging again in presidential campaign polls, and media observers are once again asking whether the mayor of South Bend, Indiana has enough experience to run the U.S. government. Meanwhile, the latest depressing story out of South Bend suggests that what Mr. Buttigieg lacks most of all is achievement.
He has certainly achieved a large measure of popularity among Iowa Democrats. Brianne Pfannenstiel reports in the Des Moines Register:
Pete Buttigieg has rocketed to the top of the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll in the latest reshuffling of the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.
Since September, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa's likely Democratic caucusgoers, with 25% now saying he is their first choice for president. For the first time in the Register's Iowa Poll, he bests rivals Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are now clustered in competition for second place and about 10 percentage points behind the South Bend, Indiana, mayor.
But back home in Indiana, one of the mayor's most distinguished employees has decided he's had enough. Marek Mazurek reports in the South Bend Tribune today:
Last year, Elijah Arias was recognized as the South Bend Police Department's Officer of the Year.
Earlier this month, Arias and two other former South Bend officers were sworn in at the Mishawaka Police Department, leaving South Bend with a shortfall of officers after two recent recruiting cycles yielded no new hires.
Doesn't anybody want to work for Mayor Pete? Mr. Mazurek reports:
The South Bend Police Department has come under increased national scrutiny in connection with Mayor Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign following the fatal shooting of Eric Logan, who is black, by a white officer in June...
Sgt. Harvey Mills, president of the Fraternal Order of Police in South Bend, believes Buttigieg's actions following the incident drove some away from the force.
"There were a lot of officers that left as a result of Mayor Buttigieg's comments and lack of support," Mills said.
In the aftermath of the Logan shooting, Buttigieg wrote in a campaign email "All police work and all of American life takes place in the shadow of racism."
All of South Bend life takes place in the shadow of rising violence. Last month, Christian Sheckler reported in the Tribune:
Through August, the latest month for which full statistics are available, South Bend had seen 10 homicides, an increase from five over the same period last year. The pace of homicides increased in September, with four killings in the city in the past month...
Through the end of August, 79 people had been injured or killed in shootings this year. That's an increase of almost 60 percent compared with the 50 shootings through the same period in 2018.
In another South Bend Tribune story in today's edition, Allie Kirkman notes that South Bend schools have "suffered from reduced enrollment," not exactly a sign of a thriving community. Nevertheless school officials are asking voters to approve another tax increase.
A recent editorial in the Tribune suggested that Mayor Pete's school system is having just as hard a time as the police department in attracting and retaining valuable employees:
In September, South Bend had 16 teaching jobs still open. In contrast, other local school districts, including School City of Mishawaka and Penn-Harris-Madison School Corp., were fully staffed.
Last night Mr. Buttigieg wrote in an email to presidential campaign supporters:
When I announced my campaign for president, I knew it was more than a little bold. Here was a youthful, Midwestern Mayor stepping forward as a candidate for the highest office in the land. We heard things like, "Is this for real?" and "Why now?"
As people study his record as mayor, Mr. Buttigieg may also hear things like, "Why should we apply your South Bend model nationwide?"
***
Elizabeth Warren's Problem
Mr. Buttigieg's rise has been fueled in part by voter concerns about the health plan advanced by presidential campaign rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.). Those concerns may have room to grow. Shane Goldmacher, Sarah Kliff and Thomas Kaplan write in the New York Times that Sen. Warren is still struggling to market government-run health care:
...speaking to reporters the day after unveiling her Medicare for all financing plan, she uncharacteristically stumbled over the specifics, insisting, incorrectly, that only billionaires would see their taxes go up.
Meanwhile the U.K.'s government-run health plan hardly argues for a similar experiment in the U.S. Today Helen Puttick reports in the Times of London on the lengths patients of the National Health Service must go to find a safe operating room:
An NHS operating theatre has been mothballed because of staff shortages and patients having surgery are being taken to a mobile theatre run by a private company.
NHS Scotland is paying to transport people daily almost 40 miles from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to have their operations at the temporary unit. One of the theatres in the hospital's general surgery suite has been shut because the health board cannot find enough trained nurses to safely provide treatment there.

Texto completo: A few words about walls.
Unsurprisingly, the one Donald Trump is trying to build on the southern border - the one he swore Mexico would pay for - has proven, like most things he touches, an embarrassing failure. First came news early this month that smugglers have been able to cut through the barrier with a simple reciprocating saw, available at Home Depot for prices starting at less than $100. Then, TBS' "Full Frontal with Samantha Bee" aired a segment demonstrating that the wall, which Trump has said "can't be climbed," can actually be climbed in as little as 15 seconds and by climbers as young as eight.
Maybe Mexico should demand a refund.
In the meantime, and with much less fanfare, construction continues on a wall of much further-reaching consequences. You see, while the wall on the border is supposed to repel immigrants and smugglers, this one repels something many of us find even more threatening: contradictory opinions. Consider three recent news stories:
In Washington, the White House announces it will cancel government subscriptions to The Washington Post and New York Times. The administration calls it a cost-saving measure, but the truth is obvious. Trump famously hates both newspapers.
In Citrus County, Fla., county commissioners reject the local library's request for a digital subscription to The Times. Says Commissioner Scott Carnahan, "Fake news, OK, I agree with President Trump. I don't want the New York Times in this county."
In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the library reports that an unknown patron has been hiding books critical of Trump and conservatism, deliberately mis-shelving them in other sections of the library. As that person explained in a note, "I am going to continue hiding these books in the most obscure places I can find to keep this propaganda out of the hands of young minds."
The sheer snowflakery of all this cannot, of course, be overstated. And yes, it reeks of anti-intellectualism, that proud, bullyboy ignorance that has too often fed books - and bodies - into bonfires.
But this also speaks to barriers of intellectual - and emotional - separation that now zigzag across America like a scar, splitting towns, colleges, churches, workplaces, friendships and families. Nor is the barrier only being built from one side. As liberal college students demand "safe spaces" and "trigger warnings" so they won't have to confront contradiction of their beliefs, it becomes painfully clear this wall is a bipartisan project. And that should concern us all.
This is no argument for false equivalence, nor even for civility. But it is an argument for intellectual freedom - for honoring people's sacred right to speak and to hear.
The genius of America has always been that it believed in the marketplace of ideas, believed we should have access to the broadest possible range, and that if we did, we would, more often than not, choose the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the intelligent over the stupid.
Yes, that trust has been sorely tested lately, but is the answer to abandon it completely? To do so would be to abandon everything that makes this country worth the trouble. To do so would be craven and un-American. As in commissioners of a podunk Florida county defending its citizens from The New York Times.
One doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. That wall Trump is trying to build against immigrants will go down as an expensive boondoggle. But you know what will cost us more in the long run?
Any wall we build against ourselves.

How to Treat a 'Loneliness Epidemic'

Texto completo: Readers react to Nicholas Kristof's concerns about the dangerous effects of social isolation.
To the Editor:
Re "Let's Wage a War on Loneliness" (column, Nov. 10):
Nicholas Kristof urgently reminds us that these days social isolation is leading, at least in part, to increasing heart disease and death rates. He warns of a "loneliness epidemic," and notes that Britain has taken the lead with the recent appointment of a minister for loneliness. Here in the United States, we seem to be doing nothing about it.
Yet I wonder if the individuals who have committed mass shootings at our schools, temples, bars and Walmarts are also, to a certain degree, a product of this loneliness epidemic. Decades ago the Beatles asked through their song "Eleanor Rigby": "All the lonely people, Where do they all come from? All the lonely people, Where do they all belong?"
Identifying the multiple factors behind the existence of so many lonely people will help us understand that ultimately they belong to all of us. When it comes to the erosion of our society, we're all responsible.
Alejandro Lugo
Las Cruces, N.M.
The writer teaches anthropology at New Mexico State University.
To the Editor:
After describing the serious dangers of loneliness, Nicholas Kristof describes attempts to lessen those dangers. All of those attempts, however, suggest that a lonely person would be less lonely if he or she joined a group of people and participated in a shared event. For some lonely people, however, the idea of participating in a group activity provokes a terrible question: What if they went and felt even more lonely than when they are alone?
Catherine Constantino
New York
To the Editor:
I read with interest Nicholas Kristof's article about loneliness and Britain's treatment of it as a model for the rest of the world. I have to disagree. I am a historian, and my most recent book, "A Biography of Loneliness," explores the modern rise of loneliness in the West.
The word and concept of "loneliness" came into being around 1800 as a direct result of the breakdown of traditional communities and the rise of individualism and consumer capitalism.
Britain's creation of a minister for loneliness is little more than a sound bite. Homelessness and a refugee crisis continue to worsen. Enforced loneliness as a result of need is at its worst ever in Britain.
The problem is that sound bites are effective and deflect attention from the real causes, like the polarizing effects of Brexit and austerity. All around the world, including in the United States, the creation of division acts against the shaping of community.
Don't look to Britain as an example. You can do better.
Fay Bound Alberti
York, England
The writer is a fellow at the University of York.
To the Editor:
The idea for a Secretary of Loneliness has obvious merit, but the title is much too negative. How about Secretary of Friendship, or of Community, or of Human Warmth, Connection and Compassion?
All are in desperately short supply.
Harvey Wasserman
Valley Village, Calif.
To the Editor:
Of course many of us are lonely. I live on a semirural island in Rhode Island. All around us are animals -- birds, turkeys, cows, sheep and goats. In spite of thousands of trees to perch on, and huge meadows for grazing, all of our animals form flocks or herds and spend most of their time within inches of one another.
Not true for the human animals who live here. Although a group of older men meet at a local deli at 4 p.m. every single afternoon, and dozens of volunteers meet often at the local historical society, only at the school are the children and their teachers crowded together for hours at a time, day after day. For the rest, hours and hours are spent alone. A recipe for loneliness, I'd say.

Impeachment probe a tragedy, not a game

Texto completo: On Wednesday the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump took place.
It was a somber moment. The country has not often inched up to this precipice, and for good reason.
The fact that we are here signals that the country got something horribly wrong. It elevated a man of poor character who did not keep faith with the country, but instead did something so egregious and offensive that lawmakers are forced to employ one of the Constitution's greatest powers.
No, this was not a good day. But it was a necessary day.
It is a stress test for the country and its institutions. It will test whether a president with utter contempt for tradition, history, conventions and the rule of law itself can be reprimanded and chastened by the instruments of power as they now exist.
The notion that no one is above the law is being tested.
The thing is that Trump, knowingly or not, has been priming the country for this moment, weakening it for this moment. He has attacked vital institutions like the press. He has corroded the very idea of truth. He has snatched the souls from Republicans in Congress. And he has seeded the courts as much as possible with people who are likely to be more in line with his positions.
This impeachment will test whether the spell Trump cast can indeed be broken.
Setting the bar for success is important here. Ultimate removal from office is an awfully high bar, and it is hard for me to imagine the Senate clearing it. I'm not ruling it out completely. Absolute predictions are dangerous, particularly now.
On the other hand, what I'm most interested in is whether the truth can shine through some of the smoke and mirrors that the president and his enablers have established.
Trump, from the very beginning, has been overwhelming the public with lies and dissembling, while at the same time attacking society's truth-seekers - journalists, investigators and jurists. Republicans in Washington, instead of pushing back and standing on principle, have simply followed suit. God only knows what happened to Lindsey Graham.
And Trump's tactics have been informed and amplified by the misinformation organ that is Fox News and much of conservative talk radio.
At a time of hyper-partisanship, when people treat political parties like sports teams, when it is ever easier to exist in an information silo of like-mindedness, it is now possible to hear information that only affirms you and none that challenges you.
As such, people choosing to live in a Trump/Fox/Limbaugh world are unlikely to be altered by the truth because they are less likely to be exposed to the truth, the fullness of it, the unassailability of it.
But one hopes there are those whose blinders slip. One hopes that there are those somewhere in the middle still in possession of an open mind. One hopes that there are many whose sense of morality is greater than their sense of tribalism.
The bar, then, is whether some of these people reach a point during these hearings where they simply say, "Enough!" And that they do so on the facts and not on the theater of the moment.
Too much of today's political culture, from the delivery of speeches to debate performance to testimony, is caught up in an "America's Got Talent," entertainment-quotient, viral-capacity sensibility. Nothing is genuine; everything is contrived.
But the truth, the cold hard fact, exists on a plane above all that. The truth is not ephemeral or fungible. The truth stands, strong and unyielding.
There was a time in my life when I believed - and thought that most other Americans believed - that the truth was all that mattered. That honesty and bravery were the hallmarks of good character and honorable leadership.
Somehow, somewhere, that got lost, particularly by Republicans in this country. Blind devotion to Trump blinded them to the truth.
On Wednesday, William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, and the State Department official George Kent testified in direct, unvarnished terms, revealing to the public what they had testified to behind closed doors: that Trump had attempted to extort the president of Ukraine into publicly declaring that he was opening an investigation into the Biden family and the 2016 election.
There is no real room to spin their testimony. They seemed to stick only to what they knew and repeatedly resisted being drawn into the politics of the process. These were career diplomats whose lives have been devoted to serving this country trying once more to defend it.
There was no insinuation, not even from the Republicans questioning them, that they were not being honest and forthright. The only criticism was that some of what they testified to they heard from others.
These men seemed to be telling the truth, and that's the way that it reads.
At some point that has to matter again, even to partisans who don't want to admit that they were wrong, even to those who hate the idea of conceding a victory to their political foes, even to those who get a druglike high out of anyone who can "own the libs."
In the end, this is not a game. This is a tragedy. This is a mourning. This is an awakening. This is the moment where truth has to matter more than all else. That is the bar America has to clear.

Texto completo: Watching a child pitch a full-blown tantrum can be a spectacular thing to behold. The flailing limbs and crumpled face, the copious tears and ear-piercing howls.
But imagine if instead of throwing a tantrum, a child expressed extreme agitation by bursting into flames. And what if that child had a twin, and they spontaneously combusted in tandem? That is the premise of Tennessee author Kevin Wilson's engrossing, darkly funny new novel, "Nothing to See Here."
If Anne Tyler ( "The Accidental Tourist") and Chuck Palahniuk ( "Fight Club") had a baby, the result might be Kevin Wilson, who first garnered critical acclaim with his 2011 literary debut, "The Family Fang," a New York Times bestseller that was made into a movie starring Nicole Kidman and Jason Bateman.
Like Palahniuk, Wilson's characters are flawed, edgy, marginalized and borderline misanthropic. But like Tyler, they ultimately redeem themselves by patching together alliances with other assorted misfits to create surrogate families.
In "Nothing to See Here," Lillian is a 28-year-old loner who works a minimum wage job and spends her spare time smoking pot in her mother's attic. But there was a time when she had dreams of escaping her dead-end existence dependent upon a resentful mother and her mother's rotating cast of loser boyfriends.
In her youth, Lillian earned a scholarship to Iron Mountain Girls' Preparatory School. But she was only there long enough to see what the future might have held for her before she was expelled, betrayed by those closest to her and forced to take the fall for someone else's misdeed. The only good thing to come out of the experience was Lillian's unlikely friendship with Madison, her rich and beautiful roommate.
Madison is now married to state Sen. Jasper Roberts, and they have a son "whom she dressed in nautical suits and who looked like an expensive teddy bear that had turned human." When Madison sends Lillian a request for help, Lillian jumps at the opportunity to change her circumstances and to see Madison again after all these years.
Jasper's ex-wife has died and the children from their former marriage, 10-year-old twins Bessie and Roland, are being sent to live with the Roberts in Franklin, Tennessee. Lillian is hired as their full-time caretaker. It's not until Lillian arrives that she learns she and the twins will not be living with the family in their mansion, but in the cottage out back, and that the twins were born with a genetic condition that causes them to burst into flames when they become upset. That last detail is to be guarded with secrecy so it doesn't complicate Jasper's political aspirations.
Lillian is mesmerized the first time she witnesses the children combust. "There were delicate waves of yellow flame moving up and down Bessie's little arms. And then, like a crack of lightning, she burst fully into flames, her body a kind of firework."
Just like parents whose children throw tantrums in public, Lillian goes into crisis mode when Bessie and Roland light up, doing everything she can to keep them calm. A peculiarity of the condition is that the fire doesn't burn the children or even hurt them, but their clothing catches fire and they risk torching their surroundings.
The irony of the situation doesn't escape Lillian. She never liked children or wanted any of her own, and yet here she is, spending her days trying to keep Bessie and Roland safe and entertained just so she can be close to Madison, who is rarely around. But when Madison and Jasper increasingly treat the twins like an unwanted burden that doesn't fit in to their carefully curated lives, Lillian begins to identify with the twins, particularly Bessie, whose defiance burns as brightly as her flames.
"I remembered that feeling, driving down to the valley, no longer welcome at Iron Mountain. It had felt like my life was over. And it kind of was. I wouldn't let that happen to these kids. They were wild, like me. They deserved better, like me."
In the process of protecting the twins -- from their own self-destructive tendencies, as well as whatever nefarious plans the Roberts may be cooking up for them-- Lillian starts to develop feelings for them that confound her. After all, she confesses, "I was no real judge of love, having never experienced it, or even witnessed it a single time in my life."
Tensions begin to mount when Lillian tries to incorporate the twins into the Roberts' lives, just as Jasper's confirmation as secretary of state starts to ramp up. When a surprise twist throws everything into chaos, some painful realities are revealed and everyone goes into damage control in unexpected ways.
It's noteworthy that "Nothing to See Here" is set in 1995, before the dawn of social media, when everything we did wasn't captured on cameras and shared around the world in real time. The concept of keeping secrets still seemed possible back then. Were this story set today, the twins probably would have been trotted out as medical freaks in YouTube videos and ridiculed with memes on Facebook. But in 1995, with Lillian as their caretaker, they get to live in their own little bubble, where they are not only protected from the threat of fire, but they are safe to be their weird, wild selves. And in Wilson's world, that is just as valuable, if not more so, than wealth, beauty and power.

Texto completo: November is National Adoption Awareness Month. Journalist, author and adoptee, Seth Berkman, got a taste of his birth country when the New York Times sent him to report on the United Korean women's hockey team. Consisting of players from North and South Korea, select players trained and competed together as teammates at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Berkman's coverage spurred him to write "A Team of Their Own: How an International Sisterhood Made Olympic History" (Hanover Square Press, $19.99).
An edited version of our conversation follows.

Q: How have your trips for work shaped how you travel?
A: Traveling for work has been one of the privileges of my job. In particular, traveling to smaller cities in America is always intriguing. I often find that it's helpful to capture the ethos of a location, to learn about the subject I'm reporting on. Environment can critically shape who we are. I also enjoy going running in new places. I find that's a great way to explore the intricate nooks of somewhere new.

Q: Where have you been to that you'd like to return to explore further?
A: Seoul. I was born in Seoul, then adopted at a very young age. I didn't go back until February 2018 for the Winter Olympics. I was so busy with work duties on that trip and follow-up reporting trips, I feel like I really haven't had a chance to get to know the city where I was born.

Q: What is your favorite vacation destination?
A: Vienna, Austria. I was lucky enough to live in Vienna for a few months on a fellowship and have immensely enjoyed going back. The city is a wonderful combination of old Europe and new style, which can be seen in their abundance of museums.

Q: What untapped destination should people know about?
A: Fukushima city, Japan. In the fall of 2017, I traveled to Fukushima to report on their preparation for hosting events at the 2020 Olympics (in Tokyo). While many parts of Fukushima are still uninhabitable after the 2011 (nuclear) disaster, the city of Fukushima is a great destination. Not only are there numerous onsens (hot springs) and great local restaurants, there is resonance in the sincerity of the residents and their hopes for more tourism and to change the perception that all of Fukushima is a permanently damaged area.

Q: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?
A: I really like to travel alone, because it gives you the freedom to explore at your own pace. I have cultivated some memorable friendships with people I've randomly met on the road, who I probably wouldn't have talked to or bothered to spend the time to get to know if I encountered them in New York. The city hardens you in a way that is not conducive to the best of human nature, so it's important to remember to let down my guard when I'm traveling.

Q: What is your best vacation memory?
A: On one of my first days in Seoul in February 2018, I randomly met up with a friend of a friend, who showed me around the city and had me run a lot of errands with her. It was a great way to explore. We ended the night in Itaewon until about five in the morning. She's an Olympic athlete and this was like a week before the Games began, so I'll keep her name confidential.

DEMOCRATIC DEBATE User's Guide: Return to Atlanta shows how debates have changed

Texto completo: BALANCED COVERAGE: WE'RE LISTENING TO YOU
The race for the White House is divisive, and these types of controversial stories receive special attention.
We always try present as much information as possible so that readers can use those facts to reach their own conclusions.
This week, the Democrats are in Atlanta for their fifth debate.So naturally you will find a substantial amount of coverage in the AJC.We will not be ignoring the GOP as its race heats up.
The last time Democratic presidential hopefuls held a major debate in Atlanta was in 1992, when four candidates met at the Carter Center as part of an impromptu series of forums held in three states over 24 hours.
It was taped at noon and held before an invitation-only audience of about 200 in a small auditorium. It lasted but 60 minutes, and one participant, U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey, didn't bother to show up: He was beamed in live from satellite, joking to the crowd that he felt "disembodied."
This week's showdown in Atlanta will feel a world apart. It will be a meticulously planned made-for-TV extravaganza that took weeks of preparation to stage and months of lobbying from city and state officials to secure.
All the candidates who are invited -- many others won't meet stiffening qualifications -- will show up with teams of operatives ready to turn their sound bites into carefully crafted moments to boost their campaigns or tear down an opponent.
And unlike 1992, when Democrats dominated every level of politics in Georgia, this week's debate will showcase the party's comeback attempt. Republicans have consolidated power over the past two decades, but Democrats see 2020 as their best chance at a turnaround.
The deal for the debate was sealed with the help of a trio of black women who are among the state party's biggest stars: Stacey Abrams, the 2018 gubernatorial nominee; Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms; and state Sen. Nikema Williams, the party's chairwoman.
Then came an intense and symbolic fight over where to hold the debate. Should it be staged in Atlanta's northern suburbs, to highlight the party's newfound success in once-Republican territory? Or in the city itself, long the beating heart of the Democratic electorate in Georgia?
An unconventional spot won out: the Tyler Perry Studios, a $250 million complex built on a former Army base in southwest Atlanta, not far from the airport.
It's the first major film studio that's owned by an African American, and organizers hope it illustrates Atlanta's role as the epicenter of a booming movie business even as some local Republicans mock Democrats for "going Hollywood."
Each of the 12 soundstages at the gleaming 330-acre development is named after a black actor, producer or executive. The debate will be held on one christened for one of the party's biggest names: Oprah Winfrey, the media icon who campaigned for Abrams in 2018.
The candidates - at least 10 have qualified -- will arrive in Atlanta a bit early or leave later in the week just to squeeze in an extra fundraiser, campaign event or face time with local movers and shakers.
They will have more breathing room than the contenders had during the debate in 1992, held just before a series of primary votes that would be a make-or-break moment.
Then-Gov. Zell Miller had orchestrated a shift to move Georgia's primary earlier to March 3, making it the first state in the South to vote, to help resuscitate Bill Clinton's flailing campaign.
It worked: Two days after the Atlanta debate, the Arkansas governor won Georgia, making it his first primary victory of the campaign. Within a week, he racked up victories in Florida, South Carolina and Texas, demonstrating strength across the region.
There's another reason 1992 looms large in the minds of Georgia Democrats. Clinton went on to win Georgia in November on his march to the White House -- the last time a Democrat carried the state in a presidential race.
(Box)
Each of the 12 soundstages at the gleaming 330-acre development is named after a black actor, producer or executive.
HOW THE DEBATE WILL TRY TO BALANCE THE CANDIDATES'SPEAKING TIME
Candidates will each be asked a balanced number of questions, event hosts MSNBC and The Washington Post said.
The debate will be broken up into four segments and will include three commercial breaks.There will be no opening statements.
Candidates will have 75 seconds to answer questions posed to them and 45 seconds for follow-ups at the moderators' discretion. Candidates should be able to respond if they're referred to by name by another candidate, but that will be at the moderators' discretion, the announcement said.
Candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds for closing arguments.
The effort to balance out speaking time comes after sizable differences in the amount of time the candidates had to talk at the previous debates.
During the fourth debate in October, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden had the most speaking time of the 12 candidates, with Warren logging nearly 23 minutes and Biden a little more than 16 minutes. At the other end was billionaire activist Tom Steyer, who got the least, at just over seven minutes, according to a New York Times review.

Texto completo: In the 17th century, they also suspected that the rules of grammar stood between them and a society of equals.
Pronouns are the most political parts of speech. In English, defaulting to the feminine "she/her" when referring to a person of unspecified gender, instead of the masculine "he/him," has long been a way of thumbing one's nose at the patriarchy. ("When a politician votes, she must consider the public mood.")
More recently, trans, nonbinary and genderqueer activists have promoted the use of gender-inclusive pronouns such as the singular "they/their" and "ze/zir" (instead of "he/him" or "she/her"). The logic here is no less political: If individuals -- not grammarians or society at large -- have the right to determine their own gender, shouldn't they get to choose their own pronouns, too?
As with everything political, the use of gender-inclusive pronouns has been subject to controversy. One side argues that not to respect an individual's choice of pronoun can threaten a vulnerable person's basic equality. The other side dismisses this position as an excess of sensitivity, even a demand for Orwellian "newspeak."
Both sides have dug in. To move the conversation forward, I suggest we look backward for an illuminating, if unexpected, perspective on the politics of pronouns. Consider the 17th-century Quakers, who also suspected that the rules of grammar stood between them and a society of equals.
Today the Quakers are remembered mainly for their pacifism and support for abolition. Yet neither of these commitments defined the Quaker movement as it emerged in the 1650s from the chaos of the English Civil War. What set the Quakers apart from other evangelical sects was their rejection of conventional modes of address -- above all, their peculiar use of pronouns.
In early modern England, the rules of civility dictated that an individual of higher authority or social rank was entitled to refer to himself -- and to be referred to by others -- with plural, not singular, pronouns. (A trace of this practice survives today in the "royal 'we."') The ubiquitous "you" that English speakers now use as the second-person singular pronoun was back then the plural, while "thee" and "thou" were the second-person singulars.
When Quakerism emerged, proper behavior still required this status-based differentiation. As one early Quaker explained, if a man of lower status came to speak to a wealthy man, "he must you the rich man, but the rich man will thou him."
Quakers refused to follow this practice. They also refused to doff their hats to those of higher social standing. The Quakers' founder, George Fox, explained that when God sent him forth, "he forbade me to put off my hat to any, high or low; and I was required to thee and thou all men and women, without any respect to rich or poor, great or small."
The Quakers thus declared themselves to be, like God, "no respecter of persons." So they thee-ed and thou-ed their fellow human beings without distinction as a form of egalitarian social protest. And like today's proponents of gender-inclusive pronouns, they faced ridicule and persecution as a result.
But there is also an important difference between the Quakers and today's pronoun protesters. While modern activists argue that equality demands displays of equal respect toward others, the Quakers demonstrated conscientious disrespect toward everyone. Theirs was an equality of extreme humility and universally low status. Even the famously tolerant founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams, couldn't stand the Quakers and complained of the "familiarity, anger, scorn and contempt" inherent in their use of "thee" and "thou."
Indeed, the trend in pronouns at that time was toward a leveling up, not a leveling down. By the middle of the 17th century, in response to increasing geographic and social mobility, the plural "you" had begun to crowd out the singular "thee" as the standard second-person pronoun, even for those of a lower social station. This meant that everyone would soon become, effectively, entitled -- at least to the honorific second-person plural.
One might expect principled egalitarians like the Quakers to celebrate a linguistic process whereby all social ranks experienced an increase in dignity. But Fox and his followers looked on the universal "you" with horror, as a sign of the sin of pride. Long before he founded Pennsylvania, the Quaker William Penn would argue that when applied to individuals, the plural "you" was a form of idolatry. Other Quakers produced pamphlets citing examples from more than 30 dead and living languages to argue that their use of "thee" and "thou" was grammatically -- as well as theologically and politically -- correct.
The Quaker use of "thee" and "thou" continued as a protest against the sinfulness of English grammar for more than 200 years. (In 1851, in "Moby-Dick," Herman Melville could still marvel at "the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom.") But eventually, in the 20th century, even the Quakers had to admit that their grammatical ship had sailed.
Modern practitioners of pronoun politics can learn a thing or two from the early Quakers. Like today's egalitarians, the Quakers understood that what we say, as well as how we say it, can play a crucial part in creating a more just and equal society. They, too, were sensitive to the humble pronoun's ability to reinforce hierarchies by encoding invidious distinctions into language itself.
Yet unlike the early Quakers, these modern egalitarians want to embrace, rather than resist, pronouns' honorific aspect, and thus to see trans-, nonbinary and genderqueer people as equally entitled to the "title" of their choosing.
To their critics, however, allowing some people to designate their own pronouns and expecting everyone else to oblige feels like a demand for distinction. Yes, some of these critics may be motivated by "transphobic" bigotry. But others genuinely see such demands as special treatment and a violation of equality. They themselves experience "he" and "she" as unchosen designations. Shouldn't everyone, they ask, be equally subject to the laws of grammatical gender?
According to the Quakers, both sides are right: Language reflects, as well as transforms, social realities. But the dual demands of equality and respect aren't always in perfect harmony. Sometimes they are even in conflict. Respect can require treating people unequally, and equality can mean treating everyone with disrespect.
At present, the battle over the third-person singular subject in English seems to be resolving itself in the direction of the singular "they" -- at least when referring to a person of unspecified gender. ("When a politician votes, they must consider the public mood.") Pedants naturally complain. They argue that applying a plural pronoun to a singular subject is simply bad English. But as linguists note, spoken English has been tending that way for many years, long before the issue became politicized.
If the rules of grammar are indeed an obstacle to social justice, then the singular "they" represents a path of least resistance for activists and opponents alike. It may not be the victory that activists want. Still, it goes with the flow of the increasing indifference with which modern English distinguishes subjects on the basis of their social position. More fittingly, if applied to everyone, "they" would complete the leveling-up progress of equal dignity that "you" started centuries ago.
Of course, a 17th-century Quaker would be likely to dismiss the singular "they" as diabolically bad grammar. But hey, who asked them?

Texto completo: You never really know what you are going to need.
Last year I was invited to give a lecture at a college in Vermont. It was to be a quick 36-hour trip -- flight to Burlington, fancy dinner the first night and the lecture and some meetings the next day, then back home to Nashville.
Years ago, I was a light traveler. I had toured Ireland with only a change of clothes and a school backpack. But as I aged, the inner Boy Scout in me gradually took over, and my suitcases grew burdened with things I would almost certainly never need. Who knows, there may be a pool nearby and I would be bereft without my swim goggles. I might actually need both black and brown shoes, right? This time I vowed to return to my roots. No extra stuff. I put on a suit, threw a lightweight backpack over my shoulder and headed for the plane.
What else could I possibly need, I thought, fighting off a hint of anxiety and a faint longing for my swim goggles.
Soon after, I settled into my seat on the plane and we took off. I carefully folded my suit jacket, placed it on the empty seat next to me and began to drift off to sleep. I was jolted awake as a flight attendant walked swiftly past, heading toward the front of the airplane. Soon after came the inevitable announcement asking if there were medical personnel on board.
Two lights came on. Mine and one two rows in front of me, at the seat of a young woman. The flight attendants made it to both of us simultaneously.
"I've got a brain surgeon here," said mine.
"A nurse practitioner here," said the other, perhaps a hint of disappointment in her voice.
All eyes turned to me.
"All hands on deck is my rule," I quickly said to the nurse, who warmly smiled back. We introduced ourselves to one another. I learned that her name was Susan and that she worked in a primary care clinic -- which was excellent news for everyone involved.
We made our way to the back of the half-empty plane. There on the next to last row was a middle-aged man covered in blood. He held a cantaloupe-size wad of tissue under his nose from which blood was pouring out as if a spigot had been opened. He had a deep laceration on the top of his nose but the blood was coming from inside.
I would like to say that I immediately began to assess his medical situation. Instead, my thoughts went to my shirt and suit as the only articles of clothing that I had for the next 36 hours.
I tucked my tie in my shirt. One of the flight attendants handed us latex gloves and I leaned in to pinch the bridge of the man's nose and ask what had happened. He remained silent but the flight attendant spoke up, "He said he hit it on a counter as he bent over to pick up his briefcase this morning."
The man took over: "It had stopped bleeding before I got on the plane but it wasn't coming from the inside until a few minutes ago." I asked him the usual questions about being on aspirin or other blood thinners. Was he a free bleeder or had any problems with bleeding in the past? No, no and no.
Classic first aid teaching says to pinch the cartilage of the bridge of the nose to stop a nosebleed. I did this, but nothing happened. The blood continued to pour out of his nose. I looked to Susan and said, "This may not be so easy." She nodded and began to rifle through her purse.
"He did just have vodka right before it started," the flight attendant volunteered, pointing to the small empty bottle lying on the seat next to him. Susan and I looked at one another knowingly. Alcohol can raise the blood pressure acutely in some people, particularly those with high blood pressure already.
"Do you take blood pressure medicine?" I asked him. "Do you have any on the plane?"
"Yes," he answered, "and no." He turned away, the blood still flowing. Suddenly, I began to piece it all together as a severe disruption of the plexus of blood vessels in the mucosa underneath the bridge of the nose, possibly worsened by elevated blood pressure. I had neurosurgery partners at home who would treat intractable nosebleeds by snaking a tiny microcatheter up from the groin into the arteries of the nose to inject a type of glue directly into the vessels. Invariably, that would stop this type of hemorrhage.
None of that and none of them, however, were with us at 15,000 feet.
"Anyone have any nasal spray?" I asked. "Afrin specifically?" Afrin is basically neosynephrine, a potent vasoconstrictor, and would be ideal to put on a tissue stuffed deeply in the nose.
"And a tampon?" Susan added, holding up a tampon from her purse and smiling. Multiple eyes turned toward her.
"Brilliant," I said, turning to the flight attendant. "Can you make an announcement calling for Afrin nasal spray and a tampon?" Quick enough, the overhead rang out. The man behind us handed up a bottle of Afrin.
"It's used," he said.
"Ooooooo, gross," another passenger added.
I took the bottle and wiped the tip down with what was left of the vodka, trying to make a show of it to all around. I looked up and saw several female hands in the air. Within seconds we had our choice of tampons: small, medium, large, extra-absorbent, all different types were available. There were even some disposable pads, with and without wings.
We settled on medium, extra absorbent. We doused it in Afrin and quickly shoved it up the man's nose as far as we could. By shove I mean that I put my hand behind his head to keep him from pulling away while Susan removed blood-soaked tissue. On the count of three, we put that tampon as far as humanly possible into an orifice entirely different than the one it was designed for.
His bucking during the first insertion was nowhere near as dramatic as it was during the second. By then, he knew what was coming and his eyes widened as we hovered over him a second time and counted. Afterward, to his credit, he calmed down quickly, even mouthing, "thank you" to us and giving a thumbs up.
It was soon evident that this procedure had actually worked. The blood flow had essentially stopped. I did keep up the external pressure, though, switching on and off with Susan the last 30 minutes of the flight. During landing, I stood in the row behind him, pinching his nose from behind. Susan sat next to him monitoring his pulse, calming him. I peered down to see no spattering of blood on my shirt, no bloody tissue sitting on my pants cuff. I breathed a sigh of relief, slightly guilty for being concerned about such a thing.
After landing, the plane went straight to the gate where two emergency medical technicians awaited with a gurney, medical supplies, and a smirk about the "emergency nose bleed." They came on board as soon as the airplane door opened and found the patient in seat 24B with two bloodstained tampons sticking out of both sides of his nose, the strings hanging down toward his shirt. He managed to give another thumbs up to the EMTs and a smile.
As the technicians loaded him up on the gurney, it dawned on me that my proud, newly revisited days of packing light were gone forever. And that a well-placed tampon in an emergency was way more useful on a flight than a pair of swim goggles.

Bloomberg targets Trump in $100 million battleground ad buy

Texto completo: Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman who is taking steps to run for president, has launched a $100 million digital ad campaign attacking President Trump in the battleground states expected to determine next year's election.
The effort will provide a significant boost to Democratic efforts " now totaling at least $325 million in public commitments " to keep the heat on Trump while Democratic candidates battle each other to win the party's presidential nomination.
'Our thinking is that the general election has already begun,' said Jason Schechter, a Bloomberg spokesman.
The outlay, which far exceeds what any Democratic candidate has raised or spent so far in the race, adds to those of several other outside groups who have devoted money to early swing state campaigns.
Priorities USA, an independent Democratic nonprofit and super PAC effort, has already spent about $7 million of a $100 million campaign for swing state anti-Trump advertising during the primaries. American Bridge, a group that typically focuses on opposition research, launched a $3 million campaign this week focused on rural white voters as part of an effort expected to reach $50 million.
A third group, Acronym, which is being advised by former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, has announced plans for $75 million in digital ads against Trump.
The money is intended to challenge the significant advantages of incumbency in presidential campaigns. Trump's campaign announced $156 million in cash on hand at the end of September, after raising $125 million in the previous three months.
By contrast, the top fundraising Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has raised less than $75-million through the first three quarters of the year. former vice president Joe Biden, who has led national nomination polls this year, has raised less than $38-million in the same nine months.
Trump has also dominated Democratic candidates so far on digital spending. On Facebook, the Trump campaign and its affiliates have purchased $14.7 million in ads this year, according to the social network, compared with $5.45 million by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and $4.3-million by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
Much of the early digital spending by candidates is focused on prospecting for more campaign donors, not on persuading swing state voters. An analysis by Priorities USA of recent Trump Facebook ads found that 89 percent of the messages were focused on acquiring new donors and voter information, including spots that ask people to wish Trump a happy birthday or buy campaign gear.
'Sometimes you spell 'desperation' d-e-m-o-c-r-a-t-s,' Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said in response to the news of the new Bloomberg digital effort, which was first reported by the New York Times.
A pro-Trump independent effort, the America First Action super PAC and an affiliated group, has announced a fundraising goal of $300 million for the 2020 cycle to defend Trump in battleground states. That spending is expected to focus on Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.

In one Bloomberg ad provided to The Washington Post, Trump's Twitter feed is highlighted along with the message: 'A tweet shouldn't threaten our country's security.'
The digital campaign began Friday, with plans for spending in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona, according to Bloomberg aides. They said Bloomberg will not appear in the ads, which will nonetheless make clear he paid for them.
'If Mike runs, it is because he believes that Donald Trump is an existential threat, and this demonstrates his commitment to defeating him,' said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Bloomberg.
Bloomberg, one of the world's richest men, has taken several steps to prepare for a bid for the Democratic nomination, including filing paperwork in states with early deadlines to get on the ballot. He has also been calling top party officials to let them know of his plans.
The move marks a major reversal for Bloomberg, who announced in March that he would not run for president. At the time, he said he was 'clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination' and would instead focus on spending his money in an effort to hurt Trump's chances in swing states.
But he and his advisers have since concluded that there is a possible route to the nomination because of lingering divisions in the field and the vulnerabilities of the top-polling candidates.
The decision to reconsider signals, among other things, a public rebuke of Biden's performance so far. The former vice president has attempted to build a coalition of the same moderate Democrats that Bloomberg would court.

Texto completo: The judges’ plan, if there ever was one, was to enjoy a couple of drinks with their colleagues the night before a judicial conference in Indianapolis.
But by 3 the next morning, three Indiana circuit court judges, by way of a failed attempt to enter a strip club, were brawling with two strangers outside a White Castle in a drunken melee that ended with two of the judges shot and in critical condition in a hospital.
In the latest repercussion from that night, the judges, Andrew Adams, Bradley B. Jacobs and Sabrina R. Bell, were this week suspended from the bench by the Indiana Supreme Court for having “gravely undermined public trust in the dignity and decency of Indiana’s judiciary.”
According to police reports and the opinion issued by the Supreme Court, the drinking began early in the evening of April 30 for Jacobs, who had a scotch in the hotel lobby after checking into his room for the conference. At 7 p.m., Bell kicked things off with a couple of Seagram’s Escapes. Sometime after 10 p.m., Adams started drinking beers at an Irish pub. Around 12:30 a.m., all three were drinking with a court magistrate at another bar, throwing darts and playing cornhole.
About 3 a.m. they headed for the strip club, which had just closed for the night. The four officers of the court then walked to a nearby White Castle. The magistrate went inside while the three judges waited in the parking lot.
At that time, two men, Alfredo Vazquez and Brandon Kaiser, drove by in a blue SUV and “shouted something out the window,” according to the Supreme Court opinion. With no gavel to register her displeasure, Bell extended her middle finger instead.
The two men objected, and after they parked their vehicle in the White Castle parking lot, a “heated verbal altercation ensued” — with all parties yelling, using profanity and making “dismissive, mocking, or insolent gestures.”
The dispute quickly escalated into a brawl — at one point Adams kicked Kaiser in the back — but it appeared to have ended when Jacobs had Kaiser pinned down, with his fist raised to strike.
“This is over,” Jacobs said, according to the opinion. “Tell me this is over.”
If only it was: Kaiser pulled out a firearm, shooting Adams once and Jacobs twice, according to the police.
Adams needed two emergency operations, including to repair damage to his colon. Jacobs, who was shot twice in the chest, had two operations during a 14-day hospitalization.
Medical workers also recorded the men’s blood alcohol levels: 0.13 for Jacobs, and 0.157 for Adams. (The legal limit for drivers in Indiana is 0.08.) The report says Bell did not have her blood alcohol level tested, though she later said she had no memory of what would seem to have been a memorable encounter.
“I mean I fully acknowledge that I drink and get mouthy, and I’m fiery and I’m feisty,” Bell said in a recorded statement made at a police station after the brawl. “But if I would have ever thought for a second that they were gonna fight or that that guy had a gun on him, I would never, never. . . .”
The report does not indicate how Bell finished that thought, but it does detail the punishments adjudicated to the three justices.
Adams, a Democrat elected to the Clark County court in 2014, was charged with felony battery and multiple misdemeanors; he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for kicking Kaiser, and was sentenced to a year in jail with all but two days suspended. He was also suspended from his job without pay for 60 days.
Though a grand jury declined to indict Jacobs, a Republican who has also been on the Clark County court for five years, the Indiana Supreme Court suspended him for 30 days without pay. Bell received an identical suspension.
Kaiser, who is accused of firing on the judges, faces eight felony and six misdemeanor charges in a jury trial set to begin on Jan. 13. His lawyer declined to comment on Friday.
Court records show that Vazquez pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor battery charge, and received a yearlong sentence that was mostly suspended. His lawyer could not be reached.
A lawyer representing Jacobs released a statement on Friday saying, “Judge Jacobs acknowledged that his behavior that evening, although not illegal, was unbecoming of a judge and that his actions were injudicious and reflected poorly upon him and his peers on the bench.” A lawyer for Adams declined to comment, though the judge has previously released a statement expressing regret for his actions. Bell, a Republican who began her tenure in Crawford County in 2017, represented herself in the disciplinary proceedings. On Friday, she declined to comment on the case.
As circuit judges, they hear all kinds of cases — small claims, felonies, misdemeanors — though Jacobs’ office said about 90% of the cases his court hears are drug-related.
In its opinion, the Indiana Supreme Court said that the three judges’ behavior “fell far short” of their code of conduct, which directs them to “aspire at all times to conduct that ensures the greatest possible public confidence in their independence, impartiality, integrity, and competence.”

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Has a U.S. College Given Russia Too Friendly a Platform?" (Arts pages, Nov. 9):
The amount of Russophobia in the American media has been unprecedented in recent years. While anti-Russian rhetoric is used for internal political struggles in the United States from time to time, this propaganda campaign has reached absurd levels, spilling over into areas that have little to do with politics.
Russian culture is portrayed as a powerful tool of the Kremlin to manipulate American public opinion and burnish the image of Russia. The allegations have been substantiated by zero evidence.
Our countries can develop stereotype-free perceptions of each other only through frequent and authentic cultural exchanges, and most important, by shaping the common values that are necessary for ensuring a safe and prosperous future for the entire world.
Russia and the United States, as the largest nuclear powers and permanent members of the Security Council, bear a special responsibility for this. The mutual isolation that has gripped politics and economic issues should not affect our cultural relations.
It is important to stop seeking political expediency and consider both countries' long-term interests. Everyone benefits from greater cultural understanding between our two countries now and far into the future.

Texto completo: Just as, when feeling a great urge to see your taxes cut, you don’t turn to the president pro tempore of the California state Senate to get the job done tout de suite, you don’t look for help saving all creatures wise and wonderful, including ourselves, by asking a species denier for help.
You know who I mean when I say species denier. It’s the people who howl bloody human murder whenever environmentalists try to protect some little flora or fauna they have never heard of, or can’t eat.
The delta smelt is the great California example. Who gives a damn, goes the denier logic, about a little fish nobody in their right non-ichthyologic mind has ever heard of, and that even the enviros have a hard time finding one example of?
Yes, the delta smelt is very tiny. And it has held up much transfer of water from north to south in a vast state, as have other ecological considerations. I wouldn’t recognize one if it happened to swim by. But thank all that is good for the people who would, and who understand that by saving the little things, we save the rest of us well.
I was thinking of this plain fact recently when considering the possible loss of the Joshua trees in our desert because of climate change. Unlike the delta smelt, everyone loves a Joshua tree. We have a whole national park that celebrates them. So many of us, including the species deniers — the kind who claim they wouldn’t miss a smelt or two, or, on the flora side, some weed or another, I suppose — would miss them.
And yet, as our staff writer Matt Kristoffersen reported in August: “Because of climate change, however, roughly 80% of the habitat for the famous plants in Joshua Tree National Park might not survive past 2100 — and that’s being optimistic, UC Riverside scientists conclude in a new study. Researchers at UCR’s Center for Conservation Biology, among other institutes, published the study in June in the journal Ecosphere. It confirms what scientists said years ago in previous studies: the trees’ fate is in the hands of humans.”
They are beloved despite what a National Park Service guide given out at the park calls “their grotesque appearance.” Yucca brevifolia is a member of the agave family. As in tequila. It’s very hard to estimate their age: “They’re yucca plants, so they don’t grow with rings, like a tree, so you can’t count their age that way,” a former ranger told The New York Times. “All we can do is make estimates.”
They grow about half an inch inch to three inches annually, so tree people use a Joshua tree’s height to guess its age. The tallest ones in the park are about 40 feet. They may therefore be about 150 years old, though no one knows.
And if climate change continues at the accelerating rate that it is, the 160,000 acres across the park that have supported Joshua trees since before humans lived here could fall to just 37 acres by 2100. Because it’s getting hotter, and drier, and they won’t make it if we keep going as we are.
I grew up camping and climbing and staring at the Joshua trees there, as my parents did before me, as my daughter has done after. I want the great-grandkids to have the same chance.
Told of that news, Kathryn Phillips, the director of Sierra Club California — also a former reporter here — said: “When I hear stuff like that, it motivates me. I’m not the kind of person that wants to roll up into a fetal position and cry. I want to take action and fight back.”
If you are worried that perhaps you are not concerned enough about the big things, find some little plant or critter to worry about. Help protect it. Then we big things can ride on its coattails.

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE — US Representative David Cicilline said Friday his proposal to create a regional economic development commission for Rhode Island, Southeastern Massachusetts, and parts of Connecticut could bring an infusion of federal funds to the area with few restrictions on how the money could be spent.
Cicilline, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, and several other Democratic lawmakers are seeking to create the Southern New England Regional Commission, a federal-state partnership that could obtain significant federal aid in order to enhance infrastructure and transportation projects in the region.
Cicilline said he's particularly interested in supporting renewable energy projects, the maritime economy, and boat and ship building, but he said final decisions would be made by the governors of the three states.
“We don't have earmarks specifically anymore," Cicilline said. “I think, in a lot of ways, these regional commissions have been a creative way to brings funds to states that comes with flexibility" in the ways the money can be used.
Under federal law, regional commissions must include a cochairperson appointed by the president and members include the governors of every state involved in the program. The commissions typically have an executive director and other administrative staff, with costs split between the states.
In 2008, during the Great Recession, the Northern Border Regional Commission was established to support economically distressed communities in northern Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. The commission issued more than $11 million in grants in 2018, according to its annual report.
Some of the projects funded by the Northern Border Regional Commission last year were a food processing and testing facility for the production of mouse food formulas in one Maine community; improved workforce training at a community college in New Hampshire; a sewer line expansion in New York; and a new career academy at a high school in Vermont.
If Congress agrees to create the commission, Cicilline said he doesn't expect funds to be set aside for improved train service between Providence and Boston, in part because Boston would not be included within the communities the commission would serve.
Instead, Cicilline said he'd like fund to benefit communities such as New Bedford and Fall River, and all of Rhode Island. He said improving bridges or transportation between Southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island might be considered.
In a statement, Kennedy, who represents Southeastern Massachusetts, said “invisible borders" have too often forced “competition between friends that ultimately denies partners the opportunity to unify in pursuit of shared interests, federal investments and economic growth."
“By creating this regional commission, we can unite the strengths of our region and build a better future that cannot be restrained by state borders," he said.
While there is no guarantee the commission will win congressional approval, Cicilline and Kennedy found an influential cosponsor before the bill was introduced.
Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat who signed on to support the commission, has said she plans to run to be chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee after New York Representative Nita Lowey retires next year. Democrats would also need to maintain control of the House for DeLauro to have a chance to oversee the committee.
“The biggest economic challenge of our time is that people are in jobs that do not pay them enough to keep up with rising costs," DeLauro said in a statement. “To address this problem, our federal government must work hand-in-hand with state and local authorities, and that is exactly what this bill would set in motion."

Texto completo: Unlike several of his peers in the ranks of great American filmmakers, such as John Ford and George Stevens, Stanley Kubrick never wore a uniform in service to his country. "I slipped through the cracks each time," said Kubrick, who was born in 1928, in an interview with film critic Gene Siskel in 1987. "I was 17 when World War II ended and was married when the Korean war began."
Yet the filmmaker's civilian status did not discourage him from considering war as a subject throughout his career. Among his first four films, two were stirring antiwar jeremiads: his debut, "Fear and Desire" (1953), and the powerfully poetic "Paths of Glory" (1957). By 1987, when he made his Vietnam War drama "Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick had shifted from the spirited outrage of those early efforts to a more nuanced view accounting for the thrill of battle. "'Full Metal Jacket' suggests that there is more to say about war than it is just bad," Kubrick told Siskel.
Fifty-five years ago, however, Kubrick decided that the most pertinent thing to say about war was that it could be funny—very, very funny. In 1964, Kubrick co-wrote, produced and directed "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," which comically repurposed the basic scenario of Peter George's 1958 novel "Red Alert."
With a cast of characters including googly-eyed military officials, feeble politicos and a gluttonous Russian ambassador, "Dr. Strangelove" surely carries the patina of the Cold War, but its scorching satire, in which all sides of the debate are sent up, remains as perennially invigorating as Jonathan Swift's "A Modest Proposal."
Co-scripted by Kubrick, George and Terry Southern, the film unbalances the viewer from the first scene at Burpelson Air Force Base, where Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), in an effort to advance his anti-Communist agenda, has single-handedly set into motion a nuclear strike against the U.S.S.R. Most comedies would present the certifiably cuckoo Gen. Ripper as an outlier, but Kubrick doesn't find too much virtue—or even common sense—in the characters who surround him, including several played by Peter Sellers.
One of Sellers's characters is relatively sympathetic—Royal Air Force Capt. Lionel Mandrake, who fruitlessly endeavors to bring Gen. Ripper back from the brink—but beyond that, the actor was asked to represent the extremes of nuclear-age cluelessness and recklessness.
As President Merkin Muffley, Sellers effortlessly embodies the soft-headed squareness of a generation of left-of-center politicians. Muffley—whose bald-headed, professorial appearance and singsong, schoolmarmish manner are surely meant to recall Democratic presidential contender Adlai Stevenson—makes futile appeals to reason and order in dealing with the crisis. "Gentlemen, you can't fight in here—this is the War Room," he says as he tries to settle the squabbles of his advisers, including Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), a red-blooded chewing-gum fan who carries with him a binder outrageously labeled: "World Targets in Megadeaths."
Meanwhile, as the inconsistently wheelchair-bound title character, Sellers brings to life a scientist even madder than Gen. Ripper in his suggestion that the pending global cataclysm—unstoppable when it's revealed that the U.S.S.R.'s counterattack is automatic—might not be all bad for the survivors who cluster in mine shafts.
In its equitable distribution of satirical targets, the film proved popular in unlikely quarters—including with military brass. In Peter Bogdanovich's 1999 New York Times oral history of Kubrick, John Milius recalled that Kubrick had been approached by higher-ups at the Strategic Air Command after the film was released. "He was afraid they'd be angry with him—that they would do something to him," Milius said. "I said, 'Stanley, how can you have been that paranoid? They wanted to honor you. They loved "Dr. Strangelove."'"
Indeed, Kubrick places a pox on the houses of both the hawks and the doves. Each group founders in failing to halt Gen. Ripper, whose rise to power serves as the sober warning at the heart of the film. As Kubrick said in an interview with Playboy in 1968, "The serious threat remains that a psychotic figure somewhere in the modern command structure could start a war." Cinematographer Gilbert Taylor gives the film a subtle, sometimes documentary-like camera style that belies the jokey character names and one-liners; the film looks authentic even when the story turns preposterous or apocalyptic.
Following the failure to fully nullify the general's order, the final scene presents a wave of presumably earth-annihilating nuclear explosions against Vera Lynn singing "We'll Meet Again." Yet, in declining to back down from the darkest implications of its plot, "Dr. Strangelove" today seems sharper and less mawkish than such earnest antinuclear films as "On the Beach" (1959) and "Fail-Safe" (1964).
Kubrick believed he was doing humanity a service in making a comedy that wraps up with the world as we know it blasted and burned. Speaking with Playboy, the director reflected: "A recognition of insanity doesn't imply a celebration of it—nor a sense of despair and futility about the possibility of curing it."
Mr. Tonguette's book on Peter Bogdanovich will be published next year by the University Press of Kentucky.

Banning e-cigs could do more harm than good

Texto completo: The nation is facing two distinct vaping-related health crises: surging e-cigarette use among teenagers and a lung-injury outbreak that has sickened more than 2,000 people and killed at least 40. Both have exposed gaps in the nation's public health apparatus.
But instead of closing those gaps, policymakers have turned to banning products.
The impulse to remove e-cigarettes from the market is understandable. The Food and Drug Administration's hands-off approach to vaping and e-cigarette regulation has backfired badly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — and state and local health departments around the country — are struggling to pick up the slack.
But prohibition is not a good long-term solution, for several reasons. Such measures are not guaranteed to prevent teenagers from getting e-cigarettes and they would almost certainly force people who already use these products, including about 11 million adults, to choose between traditional cigarettes (which remain widely available) and black-market vaping products.
Because these black market products are a leading suspect in the lung-injury outbreak, product bans are more likely to exacerbate this crisis than to mitigate it.
The better, if more complicated, option would be to build a public health system that's strong enough to combat all nicotine addiction in the long term. That could help drive a cultural shift for e-cigarettes akin to the shift that took place for traditional cigarettes.
With sustained and careful investment, e-cigarettes might become nothing more than a harm-reduction option for adult smokers.
Treat e-cigarettes like cigarettes. Traditional cigarettes and other tobacco products are already bound by rules that helped sharply lower both youth and adult smoking rates in recent decades. E-cigarette makers have evaded similar regulations.
Learn from Britain. So far, the country has managed to make e-cigarettes available for adults who want to quit using regular cigarettes without triggering an epidemic of nicotine dependence among its youth.
Invest in public health. The C.D.C. and state and local health departments across the country are struggling to hold the line on public health gains made over the past century. For tobacco control, that means educating the public about the risks of nicotine addiction.
Invest in research. There remains much we don't know about e-cigarettes. Are these products truly effective at helping people quit smoking, and is there a way to maximize that effectiveness? How safe is long-term e-cigarette use, and are some products safer than others? Health officials need answers.
Maintain pressure. Scientists and universities have refused to take "research" money from companies that make e-cigarettes; advertising agencies and health and wellness companies are pledging to do the same. These movements reflect a growing public wariness that is itself a powerful check on the industry.
The tobacco industry has a terrible track record of self-policing. But the fact that the company even took these steps is proof that even while regulatory efforts falter, public sentiment can still hold sway.

Texto completo: Netflix Inc. Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said "nothing has changed" with the launch of Walt Disney Co.'s new streaming service, expressing optimism that his company is prepared to weather competition from rivals because of its investments in original programming.
"We don't really get that distracted by competition," Mr. Sarandos said Thursday at an event in New York.
Disney this week launched its $6.99-a-month Disney+ service, which features programming from its Star Wars and Marvel brands and a deep catalog of animated films and original programs, among other fare.
Apple Inc. this month launched its own services and next year AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. will join the fray.
Mr. Sarandos said with most of the major Hollywood players emerging as competitors, it is unlikely they will want to keep offering programming to Netflix.
He said he envisions a world where Netflix will have to rely solely on its own content, which is why the company has invested so aggressively in originals.
"We figured at some point everybody would get into this," Mr. Sarandos said. "I was frankly surprised it took Disney and other people this long to go on this path."
Disney said Disney+ had 10 million sign-ups on its first day of service. The company didn't say how many of those people received free service through a partnership with mobile provider Verizon Communications Inc., and Wall Street will be waiting to see how many users stick with Disney+ when free trials end.
Disney, which had been one of Netflix's biggest suppliers of original and library content, has indicated it will no longer sell shows to Netflix, instead focusing on Disney+ and Hulu, which it also controls.
Mr. Sarandos also clarified recent comments that Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings had made about the company's decision to take down an episode of comedian Hasan Minhaj's show "Patriot Act" from the streamer's Saudi Arabia service after that government's complaint.
Asked about that decision at a New York Times conference last week, Mr. Hastings said the company is "not in the truth to power business, we're in the entertainment business."
"All entertainment is truth to power," Mr. Sarandos said Thursday, adding that Mr. Hastings was trying to say Netflix isn't "in the breaking news business."

Texto completo: An internal investigation detailed a smear campaign against a career employee after an article in conservative media questioned why she was working on Iran policy.
WASHINGTON -- An internal State Department investigation released on Thursday described an "improper" campaign to remove a career employee from a high-level policy office for her perceived political disloyalty to President Trump and speculation that she had been born in Iran.
Though the case outlined in the 54-page report by the State Department's inspector general happened in 2017, it bolstered recent concerns that American diplomats are increasingly vulnerable to political interference under Mr. Trump.
An impeachment inquiry by House Democrats is looking into Mr. Trump's demands that Ukraine investigate his political opponents in exchange for $ 391 million in security aid. During the time period being examined by the House, a veteran American ambassador to Ukraine was recalled, contributing to a backlash within the diplomatic corps.
The inspector general's investigation concluded that the career employee's assignment in the State Department's office of policy planning was cut short after an article in conservative news media accused her of undermining the Trump administration's plans to confront Iran.
The March 14, 2017, article on the Conservative Review website accused the employee, Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, of being a "trusted Obama aide" who "burrowed" into the State Department's bureaucracy after working on the Iran nuclear deal that the United States and other world powers brokered with Tehran in 2015. Mr. Trump has withdrawn the United States from the agreement.
The article said it "remains unclear" why Ms. Nowrouzzadeh was allowed to remain working as a chief policy adviser.
State Department officials were alerted to the article both by the White House and Newt Gingrich, the Republican former House speaker and ally of Mr. Trump. Emails described by the inspector general showed rampant speculation among senior State Department appointees about Ms. Nowrouzzadeh's policy expertise, political leanings and even whether she was born in Iran.
Ms. Nowrouzzadeh was not named in the report, and was identified only as "Employee One." But, the investigation concluded, efforts to remove her from the policy planning office began almost immediately.
At one point, Edward Lacey, who was then the office's deputy director, said Ms. Nowrouzzadeh was among career civil servants who "without exception, were Obama/Clinton loyalists not at all supportive of President Trump's foreign policy agenda," according to the report. He also said he "succeeded in ousting five" of them. Mr. Lacey has since retired from the State Department.
Ms. Nowrouzzadeh also sent the article to Brian H. Hook, who at the time was the director of policy planning, to defend herself and ask for his guidance on how to respond. She told investigators that she did not receive an answer, nor from a second email, even though she had reminded Mr. Hook that she began working for the United States government during the George W. Bush administration, and was concerned about her physical and online safety after the article was published.
In a meeting in late March, Ms. Nowrouzzadeh again informed Mr. Hook she was worried about threats against her; investigators reported that Mr. Hook advised her to ignore the article. But by early April, investigators reported, Mr. Hook informed other senior officials that he would not object to removing Ms. Nowrouzzadeh from the office because he did not consider her to be a "go-getter" and did not engage with him on ideas.
Mr. Hook, who is now the State Department's special envoy for Iran policy, declined to comment. But in an eight-page response to the inspector general that was included in the report, he said he had already identified a replacement for Ms. Nowrouzzadeh in February, before the Conservative Review article was published, and had not acted on the recommendations to remove her by Mr. Lacey or Trump administration political appointees.
"I did not know Employee One's political beliefs, her service in the Bush and Obama administrations or her national origin," Mr. Hook wrote in his response. "I did not care. This is true not only for Employee One but for every person I inherited on the policy planning staff and for every person I have ever worked with during 12 years of federal public service."
Ms. Nowrouzzadeh's work in the policy planning office ended in mid-April of 2017 -- nearly three months early, investigators found. She was sent back to the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, where she had worked earlier.
The articles and emails about Ms. Nowrouzzadeh that were "circulated within the Office of the Secretary suggest that improper factors likely influenced the requests to end her detail," the inspector general concluded. The report noted her "perceived political views, association with former administrations, and perceived national origin, which are non-merit factors that may not be considered in assigning career personnel under the department's policies."
In a statement released under her name on Thursday morning, Ms. Nowrouzzadeh said she hoped the inspector general's findings would "help prompt action that will guard against any further such misconduct by members of this or any future administration."
T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a senior counselor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, defended Mr. Hook in a response that was also included in the report, saying the department's leaders disagreed with its conclusions. He said the investigators failed to recognize Mr. Hook's explanation that he had decided to replace Ms. Nowrouzzadeh weeks before the article was published.
Mr. Brechbuhl, a longtime friend and former business partner of Mr. Pompeo, has been called to testify in the House impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump to provide information about the shadow foreign policy in Ukraine that bypassed normal State Department channels. It is not clear if he will comply.
The inspector general's report also examined four other accusations by State Department employees of political interference in personnel decisions. There was no evidence of improper actions in two of the cases; in the other two, investigators found the evidence too inconclusive to determine any fault.
An earlier investigation, in August, found that career employees in the State Department's Bureau of International Organization Affairs were harassed, accused of being disloyal and viewed with hostility by a political appointee. It also concluded that two senior career officials in that bureau were either removed or blocked from advancing to prestigious jobs -- actions that violated State Department policy, the inspector general found.

Republicans and 'Anonymous' Get It Wrong; GOP panelists didn't know what to do at the hearings, and the author seems not to be playing it straight.

Texto completo: A young foreign-affairs professional asked last week if the coming impeachment didn't feel like Watergate. He was a child during that scandal, I in college. I said no, Watergate had the feeling of real drama, it was a reckoning with who we were as a people; it felt grave. This is more like the Clinton impeachment, grubby and small.
But watching the first day of hearings I thought that wasn't quite right. There was something grave in it, and a kind of reckoning. This was due to the dignity and professionalism of the career diplomats who calmly and methodically told what they had seen and experienced. They were believable. It didn't feel embarrassing to have faith in them.
Republicans on the panel didn't know what to do. They know what this story is, and I believe they absolutely know the president muscled an ally, holding public money over its head to get a personal political favor. But they're his party, they didn't want to look weak, they had to show the base they had his back. In their interruptions and chaos-strewing they attempted to do some of what the Democrats did during the Kavanaugh hearings, only without the screaming meemies of Code Pink.
The Democrats were disciplined in their questioning and not bullying and theatrical, which was a surprise and unusual for them.
But the juxtaposition of the witnesses, the men of America's diplomatic class, with the sullen, squirrelly, off-point Republicans, was what gave the hearing shape.
William B. Taylor Jr., acting ambassador to Ukraine, 72, was fifth in his class of 800 at West Point, where he was cadet battalion commander. Bronze Star, Vietnam, 82nd Airborne, 101st Airborne, 506th Infantry, Second Cavalry. After that, government work and diplomacy. He's known for his modesty. You couldn't be more impressive. Testifying along with him George P. Kent, younger and a different sort—studied Russian history and literature at Harvard and Johns Hopkins, speaks Ukrainian and Russian, 27 years in the foreign service.
They seemed to have capability and integrity. They weren't deep state; they were old school, old style, not some big dope of a political donor, as all administrations have among their ambassadors, but the people who make it work, who maintain the standards, who keep it all up and running.
This is what I saw: the old America reasserting itself, under subpoena. They were American diplomats, with stature and command of their subject matter.
And the world was seeing it, and maybe thinking, "I remember them." Older prime ministers and presidents in foreign capitals could be thinking, "I remember those pros, the bland Midwestern tough guys who knew their stuff. Good that they still exist."
Quietly, smoothly, brick by brick, they gave their testimony and painted a picture that supports the charge that yes, Donald Trump muscled Ukraine.
To the week's other attempt to make a case against the president:
I don't like to beat up books, because they're books; you can't have enough data and argumentation and art; if you don't like it, don't read it. But "A Warning," the White House insider exposé by "Anonymous," is a poor piece of work, and something false at its heart shows a deep disrespect for the reader.
What we especially need in the political world now is guts, brains and sincerity. Anonymous does not offer them.
There's nothing here that hasn't already been said in a dozen books and a thousand articles. There is little first-person testimony telling us what the author saw, what was said, what happened, what it meant.
Halfway through I realized: Anonymous isn't really hiding his identity, he's hiding the major fact of that identity, which is that he is not a significant figure. The premise of the original article in the New York Times, of which this book is an expansion, was that he was a major player—a "senior official of the Trump administration"—who's giving you what history needs, eyewitness testimony. But you get the impression the author wasn't actually in the room where it happened, or not often. Not having new, first-person information he relies on high-class padding (thoughts on Cicero, Marcus Aurelius, the role of Congress) and style. The style is midlevel ad agency, clean but with no ballast. It is by the end irritating—shallow yet haughty, common yet pretentious, and full of clichés. His Trump "takes no prisoners" and "behind closed doors" damages "the fabric of our republic." The president is historically and politically uninformed, inattentive in briefings, vengeful and dangerous, gets harebrained ideas, and says stupid things. Yes, we know. But you have to do more than assert.
Anonymous suggests he can't be specific because it would blow his cover. But without specificity the work becomes contentless and devolves into mere rhetoric and polemic. And why not be specific and let people know who you are? It would make the truths you feel demand urgent expression more credible and concrete. There's nothing dishonorable about thinking you are witnessing a catastrophe and telling the American people. But you have to look history in the face and take its punishments.
And in this case what punishments, anyway? You'll be fired? You hate where you work! You'll be insulted in tweets? So what? There are two Trump tweet lists in America, one with the names of those who've been attacked and the other with those who haven't. The first is longer, and they're still alive.
It is all so disguised, self-valorous and creepy.
Why was Anonymous there? He doesn't really say. Since he saw the emptiness and danger early on, why didn't he leave? "God knows," he says, "it would have been easy." He says he stayed because Mr. Trump is "a mess" and he wanted to help. But he gives no examples of how he helped. The fact is it's hard to leave a White House. You're unemployed, your office is gone, your old colleagues cool on you, and the neighbors are no longer impressed. Better to stay and simmer.
He claims "senior advisors and cabinet-level officials pondered a mass resignation, a 'midnight self-massacre' " to draw the public's attention to the White House disarray. But they didn't go through with it. Why? "It would shake public confidence." But diminishing public confidence in the administration was the point, no?
He refers to sensitive conversations that have not been declassified and vows not to speak of them—"such details have been omitted." But it's hard not to suspect he didn't "omit" them, he didn't know them.
"Trump wanted to use a domestic presidential power to do something absurd overseas, which for security reasons I cannot disclose." Oh come on.
This book is as edifying as Omarosa's White House memoir, but without the leavening air of insanity.
At one point Anonymous reports that at a Group of Seven meeting Trump threw some Starburst candies at Angela Merkel and said: "Here, Angela. Don't say I never gave you anything." I'd never heard that. That's news! But I Googled the quote and there it was, rows of citations attributing the anecdote to Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group.
My only advice to Anonymous is for the good of your reputation, stay that way. And if you feel such heavy daily repugnance, leave already.

Texto completo: Veterans Day was a national holiday on Nov. 11, a date that was established by the armistice that ended World War I on Nov. 11, 1918. It was originally called Armistice Day for that reason, but as the sufering from that confict faded into history, the date, Nov. 11, was renamed Veterans Day in 1954.
The purpose of the holiday now is to honor those who served honorably in the military. There was a universal military draft in 1954 of young men who were not aficted with a bone spur. The holiday was in recognition of those who completed their term of service and were honorably discharged.
With the nature of warfare becoming more frequently an urban confict, it seems that it might be fscally efcient for competent soldiers to morph into
metropolitan police ofcers. The army has developed a code of conduct that seems to be more stringent than the requirements for the discipline of urban police ofcers.
A story in the New York Times reports that the district attorney in Brooklyn, New York has blacklisted seven police ofcers whose work is so fawed and so lacking credibility that their testimony is precluded from criminal cases. The story indicates that this is a common practice, but the names of the ofending police ofcers are usually not publicized.
This problem must be resolved if the U.S. is to repair its criminal justice system. Veterans Day suggests the idea that military training might serve as a prep school for the civilian police.

ABOUT 35,000 AMERICANS DIE ANNUALLY OF DRUG-RESISTANT INFECTIONS: Antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause about 2.8 million infections per year and about 35,000 deaths in the U.S., according to a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report — twice as many deaths as estimated in 2013.
The CDC identified 18 of the most troublesome pathogens. One of the most urgently threatening is candida auris, a multi-drug resistant fungus that health professionals have kept an eye on for a few years, but didn’t appear in the U.S. until 2016. It can cause fatal infections if it enters the bloodstream, and there have been 587 cases confirmed in the U.S. since it was first diagnosed in 2009 in a patient in Japan.
On the bright side, efforts to stem the spread of bacterial and fungal infections in hospitals, where they are most likely to spread, have reduced deaths by 30%. CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield was pretty optimistic given the otherwise grim statistics: “Our collective efforts to stop the spread of germs and preventing infections is saving lives… Today’s report demonstrates notable progress, yet the threat is still real.”
Other “urgent” pathogens in the report include a bacteria that causes pneumonia and has already killed 700 people, a bacteria that causes life-threatening diarrhea that has killed 12,800 people, and a class of bacteria nicknamed “nightmare bacteria,” which is resistant to nearly all treatment options and has hospitalized 13,100 patients.
The CDC also added a watchlist for the first time to monitor three specific pathogens — including an antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea infection — that have a high risk of spreading.

ERNST INTRODUCES UPDATED FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE BILL: Republican Joni Ernst unveiled a bill Thursday that would ensure married couples who work for the same employer can each take up to 12 weeks unpaid leave to care for a new child or a sick relative. The Iowa senator calls it a “modernized” version of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which limits the amount of leave a married couple under the same boss can take. The bill already has bipartisan support from Democrats Kyrsten Sinema and Tina Smith as well as Republican Mike Lee.
HOW ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ IS PLAYING IN MICHIGAN: Moderate Democratic voters in Michigan are leery of ‘Medicare for all’ proposals favored by liberal Democratic candidates, the Wall Street Journal reports in the battleground state. “If you start talking to them about Canadian-style health care in my district, people…start to get a little nervous,” Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a freshman lawmaker who beat a Republican incumbent in 2018, said after a town hall Friday in Rochester Hills, a Detroit suburb. “People start saying, ‘Well, can I keep my doctor? And am I going to be forced into something that I don’t want?’”
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS WILL BEGIN ADMINISTERING 23,000 DOSES OF NEW EBOLA VACCINE: Doctors Without Borders will begin administering a new Ebola vaccine Thursday in a northern province of Democratic Republic of Congo, home to 2 million people. Doctors without Borders is working with the DRC’s Ministry of Health to compile a study on the effectiveness of the vaccine, only the second to be introduced to the public. While the latest vaccine has been endorsed by the World Health Organization and lab studies show the vaccine creates an even better immune response than the first Ebola vaccine, which was approved in the European Union just last weekend, the only way to figure out if the vaccine truly works is to use in a real-world setting. The goal is to vaccinate 50,000 people in six sites throughout the province over a four-month period.
HHS TO LAUNCH NOVEL DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGY: The Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to help create new technology that will distinguish between bacterial and viral infections and determine the severity of the infections within 20 minutes. BARDA will support the development of the new diagnostic tool, known as host-response testing, under a $6 million contract with California-based Inflammatix Inc. “Rapid diagnostics are a cornerstone of our strategy to protect Americans from many bacterial and viral infections; earlier diagnosis can empower patients to take action to reduce disease transmission,” said BARDA Director Dr. Rick Bright. “Antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat to public health and the health security of the United States, and diagnostics that can provide rapid results to patients and doctors will support stewardship of antibiotics and save lives.”

Trump asks Supreme Court to bar release of his tax returns

Texto completo: Washington • President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to bar his accounting firm from turning over eight years of his tax returns to Manhattan prosecutors.
The case, the first concerning Trump’s personal conduct and business dealings to reach the court, could yield a major ruling on the scope of presidential immunity from criminal investigations.
Last week, a unanimous three-judge panel of a federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled against Trump, rejecting his argument that he was absolutely immune from criminal investigation while he remains in office. The court, in a focused ruling, said state prosecutors may require third parties to turn over a sitting president’s financial records for use in a grand jury investigation.
Trump has fought vigorously to shield his financial records, and prosecutors in Manhattan have agreed not to seek the tax returns until the case is resolved by the Supreme Court. In exchange, they insisted on a very quick briefing schedule, one that would allow the Supreme Court to announce whether it will hear the case as soon as next month and to issue a decision by June, as the presidential election enters its final stages.
Other cases involving Trump are also in the pipeline. They involve matters as diverse as demands from House Democrats for tax and business records, a request for access to redacted portions of the report prepared by special counsel Robert Mueller, and challenges to Trump’s business arrangements under the Constitution’s emoluments clauses.
On Wednesday, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused to rehear a ruling from a divided three-judge panel that Trump’s accounting firm must comply with the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s demands for eight years of his financial records. A lawyer for Trump said he would appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court, too.
The legal fight in the New York case began in late August after prosecutors in the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, subpoenaed Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, for his tax returns and those of his family business dating to 2011.
The prosecutors are looking into hush-money payments made to two women just before the 2016 presidential election. Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, for payments he made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who claimed she had an affair with Trump.
Cohen was also involved in money paid to Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who also said she had a relationship with Trump. The president has denied the relationships.
Prosecutors say they need the documents to decide whether the payments violated state laws.
Trump’s lawyers sued to block the subpoena, arguing that criminal investigations of presidents are barred by the Constitution. They said sitting presidents are not only protected from being indicted, a proposition that is widely but not universally accepted, but also cannot be subjected to the burdens of criminal investigations, especially from local prosecutors who may use the criminal process for political gain.
When the case was argued last month before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Denny Chin asked about a statement Trump had once made — that he could stand on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone without political fallout.
Chin asked William Consovoy, a lawyer for Trump, about the legal consequences of such a hypothetical crime.
“Local authorities couldn’t investigate?” Chin asked, adding: “Nothing could be done? That’s your position?”
“That is correct,” Consovoy said. “That is correct.”
In a footnote to last week’s decision, Chief Judge Robert Katzmann, writing for the appeals court panel, said allowing a grand jury to inspect tax returns did not seem likely to impose a burden on Trump’s ability to fulfill his constitutional responsibilities.
“We note that the past six presidents, dating back to President Carter, all voluntarily released their tax returns to the public,” Katzmann wrote. “While we do not place dispositive weight on this fact, it reinforces our conclusion that the disclosure of personal financial information, standing alone, is unlikely to impair the president in performing the duties of his office.”
Katzmann noted that Trump had conceded that his immunity would last only as long as he held office.
“There is no obvious reason why a state could not begin to investigate a president during his term and, with the information secured during that search, ultimately determine to prosecute him after he leaves office,” he wrote.

Nicholas Kristof: If Trump were anyone else trying to get away with this

Texto completo: As the impeachment process unfolds, President Donald Trump’s defenders will throw up dust clouds of complexity. But as the first day of open hearings suggested, it’s simple. Forget about Ukraine and diplomacy for a moment.
Suppose that a low-ranking government official, the head of a branch Social Security office, intervened to halt a widow’s long-approved Social Security payments. The widow, alarmed that without that income she might lose her home, would call the branch director to ask for help.
“I’d like you to do me a favor, though,” the director might respond. He would suggest that her Social Security payments could resume, but he’d like the widow to give him her late husband’s collection of rare coins.
Everybody would see that as an outrageous abuse of power. Whether we’re Republicans or Democrats, we would all recognize that it’s inappropriate for a federal official to use his or her power over government resources to extract personal benefits. The Social Security official could say that the payments eventually resumed, or assert that the widow’s son had engaged in skulduggery — but he’d be out of a job in an instant and would face a criminal investigation.
Likewise, imagine that a high school principal expelled the police chief’s son but offered to readmit the boy if the police department would just open a criminal investigation into his ex-wife before their child custody hearing.
Or suppose that the head of a public hospital offered to provide free medical care to employees of a construction company if it remodeled his kitchen?
Or what if I suggested to a university president that I was planning some glowing columns about his great institution and then asked for “a favor,” noting that my child was applying for admission.
In every case, we might disagree about whether to call this bribery, extortion or a quid pro quo, and might disagree about precisely which statute was violated, but there is no doubt this would be a firing offense and perhaps lead to a criminal investigation.
Shouldn’t we hold the president of the United States to as high a standard as the head of a Social Security office, a principal, a hospital director and a journalist?
Indeed, the Ukraine situation is still more insidious. Trump’s bullying of Ukraine and suspension of military assistance benefited our strategic rival, Russia, and it came as Ukrainians were dying in the fight for their country’s survival after a Russian invasion.
My father grew up near Chernivtsi in what is now western Ukraine — then part of Romania — and I’m appalled to think of Ukrainians dying unnecessarily because Trump was playing politics with American assistance. In effect, Trump aided Russia and perhaps killed Ukrainians for political gain.
Remember all this as we hear Trump’s defenders try to divert attention to the whistleblower, to Hunter Biden or to anything else. If the Republicans want to oversee an investigation of how children of American government officials monetize their parents, that’s a worthwhile effort. But I doubt Ivanka Trump agrees.
The first witnesses before the impeachment hearings were two distinguished foreign policy experts with a long commitment to public service and no history of partisanship. One, George Kent, noted that “there has been a George Kent sworn to defend the Constitution continuously for nearly 60 years.” And Ambassador William Taylor, a Vietnam veteran who was appointed acting ambassador to Ukraine by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, emphasized, “I am not here to take one side or the other, or to advocate for any particular outcome of these proceedings.”
Their testimony was blunt. Trump withheld not only desperately needed security assistance to Ukraine but also a White House meeting with the Ukrainian president — unless he committed to investigating the Bidens.
“I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” Taylor recalled advising other ambassadors involved in Ukraine.
Taylor also revealed something new and important. On July 26, another ambassador, Gordon Sondland, telephoned Trump, who asked about “the investigations” by Ukraine. A Taylor staff member asked Sondland what Trump thought about Ukraine, and Sondland replied that Trump cared more about the investigations into the Bidens.
Republicans on Wednesday tried to suggest that perhaps the impeachment investigation was all a misunderstanding based on secondhand accounts. But that July 26 phone call suggests that Trump was directly pushing for the investigations as his top priority with Ukraine.
Trump continues to be strongly backed by House Republicans and Fox News. That’s the biggest difference from the Watergate hearings that ultimately led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation. There was no Fox News then, and Republicans and Democrats alike were loyal primarily to the country and its institutions rather than to an individual.
That may no longer be true. Brace yourself in the coming weeks for smoke screens of obfuscation, but anchor yourself to this thought: What if the wrongdoing simply involved the head of a Social Security office, a principal, a hospital director or a journalist? Why allow a president to get away with what would be a firing offense for anyone else?

Netflix's Content Chief Says 'Nothing Has Changed' With Disney+ Launch; Ted Sarandos said Netflix can weather competition because of its investments in original programming

Texto completo: Netflix Inc. Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said "nothing has changed" with the launch of Walt Disney Co.'s new streaming service, expressing optimism that his company is prepared to weather competition from rivals because of its investments in original programming.
"We don't really get that distracted by competition," Mr. Sarandos said Thursday at an event at New York's Paley Center for Media.
Disney+ this week launched its $6.99-a-month Disney+ service , which features an array of programming from its Star Wars and Marvel brands and a deep catalog of animated films and original programs, among other fare. Apple Inc. earlier this month launched its own services and next year AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. will join the fray in streamed entertainment.
Mr. Sarandos said with most of the major Hollywood players emerging as competitors, it's unlikely they will want to keep offering programming to Netflix. He said he envisions a world where Netflix will have to rely solely on its own content, which is why the company has invested so aggressively in originals.
"We figured at some point everybody would get into this," Mr. Sarandos said. "I was frankly surprised it took Disney and other people this long to go on this path."
Disney said Disney+ had 10 million sign-ups on its first day of service. The company did not say how many of those people received free service through a partnership with mobile provider Verizon Communications Inc., and Wall Street will be waiting to see how many users stick with Disney+ when free trials end.
Disney, which had been one of Netflix's biggest suppliers of both original and library content, has indicated it will no longer sell shows to Netflix, instead focusing on Disney+ and Hulu, which it also controls.
Mr. Sarandos also clarified recent comments that Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings had made about the company's decision to take down an episode of comedian Hasan Minhaj's show "Patriot Act" from the streamer's Saudi Arabia service after that government's complaint.
Asked about that decision at a New York Times conference last week, Mr. Hastings said the company is "not in the 'truth to power' business, we're in the entertainment business."
"All entertainment is truth to power," Mr. Sarandos said Thursday, adding that Mr. Hastings was trying to say Netflix isn't "in the breaking news business."

Texto completo: Irreverent funnyman Jeff Dunham, is bringing his gang of wise-cracking puppets and his international tour "JEFF DUNHAM: SERIOUSLY!?" to Savannah on Nov. 17 at the Johnny Mercer Theatre.
Dunham is crisscrossing 36 cities in North America and Canada splitting sides and ruffling feathers with his topical jokes and flippant puppets. For the past two decades, Dunham has entertained crowds with his ventriloquism and memorable characters including Peanut, a fluffy purple alien; Walter, a cranky elderly veteran; and proud country-boy Bubba J, among others.
On this latest tour, Dunham adds a new personality to the mix with his puppet Larry, billed as the U.S. President's personal advisor who will offer an inside-take on what it's like to work at the White House.
Dunham has been cracking up audiences with his non-stop touring and TV specials, and is fresh off a new Netflix Originals stand-up special, "Jeff Dunham: Beside Himself." The comedy special was filmed in June at the American Airlines Center in his native Dallas, TX. He's also been a featured guest on many hit TV shows including the Emmy-winning series "30 Rock" and such movies as "Dinner for Schmucks" featuring actors Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd.
Dunham also adds best-selling author to his resume after his recent autobiography, "All By My Selves: Walter, Peanut, Achmed and Me" was featured on the New York Times' Best Seller list for three weeks in a row. One of his proudest moments came in 2017 was Dunham was presented with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame recognizing his more than two decades in show business.
A Texas native, Dunham graduated from Baylor University before moving to Los Angeles, CA where he hit the ground running on the comedy club circuit. Dunham's crass and hilarious puppet routines soon caught the attention of TV networks where he has had several comedy specials air on NBC and Comedy Central and more.
The show "JEFF DUNHAM: SERIOUSLY!?" comes Sunday, Nov. 17 to the Johnny Mercer Theatre located at 301 Oglethorpe Ave. Showtime is 3 p.m. Ticket prices start at $55.
For tickets, call 800-745-3000 or visit www.jeffdunham.com.

Texto completo: Childhood trauma more common than we think
Kudos to the Baltimore Sun on an excellent summary on the science of childhood trauma ("We can prevent the health consequences of childhood trauma," Nov. 6).
As you point out, adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, affect us all. We likely all know someone who has experienced an ACE, like family addiction, abuse, divorce, witnessing community violence or experiencing racial discrimination.
One in six Americans have experienced four or more ACEs. Children at our facility, the Baltimore Child Abuse Center, have an average of six to seven ACEs. And yes, thought leaders are starting to pay attention to decades of research showing that addressing childhood trauma can help prevent poor health and social outcomes, addiction, incarceration and even early death.
Baltimore City Councilman Zeke Cohen and the office of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings are on the vanguard of elected officials who are legislating ways to build networks of trauma-responsive institutions and agencies. We are witnessing a paradigm shift in the making. This good news has been slow to spread, but thank you for helping to spread it.

Biden's relationship with Ukraine was no secret
Donald Trump and his Republicans supporters have employed the gamut of logical fallacies to oppose impeachment - lying, hypocrisy, goal post moving, false equivalencies, ad hominem attacks, appeals to ignorance and straw man tactics.
How would they respond to the following set of facts? As we know, in 2016, Vice President Joe Biden, in plain sight, threatened to withhold financial aid to Ukraine unless its leaders dismissed Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin ("Alternative Fact of the Week: Kellyanne Conway, still the champion prevaricator," Nov. 7). His son, Hunter Biden, was on the board of Burisma since 2014. The Biden defense to allegations of corrupt intent are well known. He was acting in concert with Ukrainian domestic and international pressure to oust Mr. Shokin, known to be corrupt. Mr. Shokin's replacement would more likely reopen a dormant investigation into Burisma, putting the gas company and its directors at greater risk.
Here is a different take. We know that Hunter Biden's seat on the Burisma board was not a secret. In fact, President Barack Obama's spokesperson, Josh Earnest, in response to a question about the Mr. Biden's potential conflict of interest given his son's seat on Burisma, referred the reporter to the vice president's office. The New York Times wrote a story about the potential conflict of interest.
Meanwhile, the Republicans, who had control of the House and Senate, were not shy to launching dubious investigations against alleged Obama administration wrongdoing. The Republicans investigated Benghazi (eight times), IRS targeting, Solyndra and Fast and Furious. If the Republicans of today are so certain that Mr. Biden acted corruptly in 2016, why did they not feel that way then and launch an investigation three years ago. Why didn't Rand Paul and others in office then speak out about the so-called travesty of Mr. Biden's actions?
We know the answer. The Republicans of 2016, many of whom are in office today, knew that Mr. Biden's actions were not inappropriate. Hearings would have quickly revealed that Mr. Biden's actions were not only appropriate, but highly successful and lauded.

Education spending requires accountability
The key to ensuring public support for the Kirwan Commission education recommendations to boost public school outcomes is not to demonize the cost of the commission's goals nor to provide a blank check for its implementation, but to assuage taxpayers' understandable concerns by legislatively mandating accountability measures with real teeth ("Former county executives: Maryland governor plays politics with education," Nov. 6).
In 1998, I sponsored amendments that were adopted by the House Ways and Means Committee to require accountability for the expenditure of public school funding.
Unfortunately, the Maryland State Department of Education was woefully lax and ineffective in ensuring that these accountability requirements be enforced. For oversight to be effective, the General Assembly must legislate strict accountability requirements that provide sanctions for non-compliance that include cuts in administrative salaries and withheld appropriations.
Based on its track record for the past 20 years, the legislature should not rely on MSDE to strengthen its own accountability efforts. The legislature must act in the coming session to mandate potent accountability measurements.

Some Fla. voters are unmovable, despite probe President Trump did nothing wrong, they say

Texto completo: Some will watch, some will catch up via Fox News at night, and others will ignore the event entirely. But no matter what comes out at the public impeachment hearings that got underway Wednesday, President Donald Trump's fervent South Florida supporters say they won't waiver.
To them, the impeachment inquiry is a sham - a merit-less attempt by Democrats to damage Trump.
"It's a joke. All they do is make up lies," said Robert Korhonen, of Fort Lauderdale, one of about 100 people who attended the monthly Americans for Trump Broward meeting Tuesday night - in a county that's biggest Democratic stronghold in the state. "It's just a big frigging waste of time and I think most Americans are smart enough to understand what's going on here."
Democrats, Korhonen added, are "trying to throw as much crap against him as they can. Trump is not guilty of anything. He hasn't done anything wrong. They keep throwing crap and trying to trap him in stuff. But he's innocent. They got nothing. They got nothing."
David Lhota of Plantation, a lawyer, said information that's come out in advance of the public hearings shows the president has done nothing wrong.
Democrats see it entirely differently, that there's proof Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to meddle in the 2020 election by coming up with dirt that would make Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden look bad. Lhota thinks Biden's dealings in Ukraine from his time as vice president are what should be investigated.
What's going on now, he said, is "a sham, a lot of propaganda. I think it's just a vehicle to try to persuade the public prior to the elections, throw a lot of mud. See what sticks. It's a complete hoax. It's disgusting. I think it's weakening our country. It's spreading lies."
"The election didn't turn out the way they wanted, and now they're trying to change the results," Lhota said. "The only focus is on smearing the president's good name and I think people will see that. And in fact, I think it will backfire on the Democrats if they carry this out too long and keep trying to promote this propaganda."
Sofia Manolesco of Deerfield Beach, who works in the fitness industry, doesn't see the impeachment inquiry as serious. "I think that most politicians are paid actors, and they just do what they need to do to ramp up public opinion and try to get people excited."
Americans for Trump attracts die-hard supporters of the president from Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties. Raffle prizes between speakers included a "border patrol kit" and a "build the wall kit." And U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the only senator somewhat critical of Trump, was labeled a "rat" and an "enemy." Romney was the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.
The Trump club is something of a refuge for his supporters in overwhelmingly Democratic South Florida. "You feel good among people that think the same way," said Maria Canosa, a retiree from Tamarac.
But Canosa, Korhonen and Lhota have plenty of company among Trump supporters elsewhere in Florida - and their energy is critical to the president's hope for re-election. Florida awards 29 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency - more than any of the half-dozen swing states that will decide the 2020 election.
Polling a month ago from the New York Times Upshot and Siena College found that 49% of Floridians support the impeachment inquiry, with 44% opposed - which shows the deep political divide in a state known for its extremely close elections.
Among Floridians who voted for Trump in 2016, Times/Siena poll found 16% supported the impeachment inquiry, and 81% were opposed. Among Hillary Clinton voters, 87% supported the impeachment inquiry and 8% opposed it.
Korhonen, an artist, said "most of the Democrats live in their own little bubble, their own little world, and they just don't get it. They're just so far off in lunacy world that they just don't get it."
Canosa said the impeachment hearings are simply one more way that Democrats are attempting to undermine Trump.
"They have never given this man a fair shake," she said.
Americans for Trump president Scott Newmark, like most of the club members, expect the Democratic-controlled House to impeach the president and the Republican-controlled Senate to vote against convicting and removing him from office. "It's like we're watching the movie in real time - but we know the ending."

Women presidential candidates: Unlikable?

Texto completo: Cue the misogyny. Again.
The latest example comes from a poll of registered voters in six states expected to play outsize roles in the 2020 presidential race. Nearly four in 10 (38%) of these potentially pivotal voters agreed with this overtly sexist statement: "Sometimes, it feels like most women who run for president just aren't that likable."
The very statement -- posited in a recent New York Times-Siena College poll -- is at once infuriating and comical, blatantly sexist and preposterous. This is, after all, the first time in U.S. history that one might reasonably ask any question involving most women. And while it is not the first time one might credibly ask whether the plethora of men who run for president are likable, the mere thought of that question is, well, not thought of.
Pollsters have long tried to assess whether voters felt comfortable with candidates. Gallup first asked whether each candidate was likable in 1976. Many polls have asked whom you'd prefer to grab a beer with. But those questions addressed each individual candidate (male and, when there was one, female) and didn't conjoin -- much less ridicule -- a minority of them.
This presidential election, which comes during the centennial of women's voting rights, has drawn a record number of women seeking a major-party nomination (now five, after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York ended her campaign). Yet we have one question, framed in the negative, that lumps them all together.
As Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, told me, "This is the thing that plagues and haunts women: Are they likable enough?"
Are 'most men' unlikable?
Why would more than 1,400 of the 3,766 registered voters in the poll agree, either strongly or somewhat, that most of these women are unlikable?
"I'm not sure if it's just these candidates, just these women, or a deep-seated resentment," said Meghann Crawford, a pollster for Siena College.
Let's contemplate that. How well, exactly, do the respondents know most of the women? What traits do they think Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and self-help guru Marianne Williamson share? What could possibly make most of them unlikable? What, really, do they have in common?
And what of the dozen men vying for the Democratic nomination or the three competing on the GOP side, including Donald Trump? Are most of them unlikable? Are any of them? The poll didn't ask.
It has long been a given that women in politics and elsewhere (read: everywhere) are held to different standards than men, particularly when they seek or attain power. They not only have to be overqualified, they also have to be assertive (not aggressive), smart (not haughty) and serious (but not too much). They also should be nurturing (but not smothering), empathetic (but not tearful) and able to laugh (but not cackle) at themselves (and at the sexist jokes that come their way). Oh, and they shouldn't be too ambitious (read: like the men who set the standards).
If they are too (fill in the blank), they definitely will be unlikable.
But to whom? Who are these judgmental folks? The group most likely to agree that most women presidential candidates are unlikable is Republicans, at 53%. For Democrats, it's 26%.
Sinking into stereotypes
The next largest group of women-dislikers is people with a high school education or less, at 47%, followed by white people who either didn't attend or didn't graduate from a four-year college, at 44%. By contrast, 28% of all college graduates and white college graduates agreed that most women presidential candidates are unlikable. Notably, 43% of women said most of the women who run for president are unlikable; only 33% of men agreed.
One woman, Elysha Savarese of Florida, told The Times that Warren is "very cold" and "basically a Hillary Clinton clone."
How fitting. Apparently, there is only one presidential candidate in all of U.S. history to whom we can compare Warren. It is not other Massachusetts senators, like John or Teddy Kennedy, Calvin Coolidge or John Kerry. It is not another academic like Woodrow Wilson, or a law professor like William Howard Taft. It's not eggheads like Adlai Stevenson or Barack Obama. No, Warren either is or is not the new Clinton, the one woman a major party has nominated to the highest office in the land.
Let's be clear: When we compare Warren to Clinton, we're not comparing their policies, which are relatively dissimilar. We're comparing their personas. Or, rather, stereotypes of women's personas. Are they shrill? Are they nasty? Do they grate on you? Do they remind you of your first wife or your mother-in-law (to mention other stereotypically unlikable women)?
Clinton was a lightning rod whom a lot of people liked to dislike. She won the most votes anyway.
Imagine, then, what other women might do.
If only most of them were likable.

Texto completo: Readers urge the House to compel witnesses to testify; one appeals to John Bolton to "do the right thing" and "speak out now."
To the Editor:
Re "What Is the President Hiding?," by Neal K. Katyal (Op-Ed, Nov. 13):
Just shortly before the impeachment hearings even began, an unsettling feeling came over me. I now conclude that the public testimony during the impeachment proceedings, by longstanding devoted public servants, will not make a difference. The average Trump supporter and Republican either will not tune in, or will tune out (and deny facts). And, of course, the Republican-dominated Senate will never vote to convict.
Does that mean that the House shouldn't have pursued impeachment? Certainly not, or more clearly, it has an obligation to do so. However, there should be many more contempt citations issued by the House, more subpoenas issued and much more court activity to compel witnesses to appear and testify. The judiciary, as the third branch of our government, must step up and do its job.
Mr. Katyal is right that the damage to our democratic institutions caused by President Trump's and the executive branch's obstruction of the proceedings may cause as much or even greater damage to our democracy than the Ukraine scandal itself.

To the Editor:
The question to be answered by John Bolton, former national security adviser, is: "What do you know and how do you know it?" The time for answering is now and not at some undefined point in the future. His reputation for honesty and integrity over his entire career is on the line.
Mr. Bolton is a consummate principled professional, yet, so far, he is failing to do the right thing and testify at the impeachment hearings. He doesn't need the White House or the courts' judgment to know what's best for his country and what best underscores the oath he took to support and defend the Constitution -- the same oath that I took when I was commissioned as an officer in the Marines many years ago.
Of course, he wouldn't disclose classified material. But so much of what he heard and took notes about is the unclassified story of abuse of power and obstruction of justice. That knowledge cries out to be shared. Do the right thing, Mr. Bolton: Speak out now.

Re "Ignoring the Real Problem in the White House," by Michelle Cottle (Editorial Observer, Nov. 12):
The criticism of administration members who seek to help the country by quietly undermining Donald Trump's insane or illegal efforts instead of resigning is too simple a solution to a complicated problem. Yes, as Ms. Cottle points out, they are "propping up a president who continues to erode democratic norms and the rule of law." But aren't they also saving us from some disastrous actions? Let's look at a worst-case scenario:
Suppose Mr. Trump, in a fit of pique, decides to use a nuclear weapon against, say, Iran or North Korea. Do we want presidential subordinates who will stymie his demands by undermining such an order, or do we want them to resign until he finds someone who will carry it out?

Texto completo: Fifteen months ago, on a hot August evening, the top executives of Atlanta's four professional sports teams - the Braves, the Hawks, the Falcons and Atlanta United - gathered at the War Horse, a private dining club on Northside Drive.
Over steaks and a bit of paperwork, they agreed to band together and attempt a fundamental change in the politics of legalized gambling at the state Capitol.
"At our core, we're all huge sports fans," Steve Koonin, CEO of the Atlanta Hawks, who was one of the diners. "We got ourselves aligned and have worked together really, really well as a unit, because we all want to do the same thing. We all want an illegal activity to be made legal. And we want it to be taxed."
On Monday, a year and change later, the umbrella organization the Big Four will use to make their case was unveiled: The Georgia Professional Sports Integrity Alliance. Signing onto the cause, in addition to Koonin, was Derek Schiller, president and CEO of the Braves; Rich McKay, president and CEO of the Falcons; and Darren Eales, president of Atlanta United.
The quartet is calling for a new state law -- the initial strategy is aimed at avoiding a constitutional amendment -- to legalize wagering on professional sports via mobile phones and the Internet. Betting on the sacred Southern institution of college football would remain illegal, as would wagering on professional minor league teams.
All would be regulated by the Georgia Lottery Commission. State revenue generated would go to the HOPE program.
Right about now, you're wondering how this is different than any other push we've seen over the past decade -- all unsuccessful -- to expand gambling in Georgia beyond the lottery. The answer is twofold.
First, previous conversations have focused on casinos - er, destination resorts - and horse racing facilities. Those would become, critics have argued, physical magnets for unsavory activities. This sports-wagering proposal would be architecturally invisible and thus, one could argue, more politically digestible. Even betting kiosks would be barred from the three metro Atlanta stadiums involved.
The teams say they will not partake of any proceeds from licensed wagering outlets. "We would not book bets, take bets. I imagine they would be advertisers, but that would be about it," Koonin said. "We're not the house. We're not bookies. It's pure opt in, via the phone."
The larger reason to treat this effort as something different is the fact previous gambling expansion efforts have originated with entities located beyond Georgia's borders. The best example may be that day in 2015 when Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson parked his limousine on the Mitchell Street side of the state Capitol - so that he could have a chat with a few of the more important people inside.
This would be the first gambling initiative instigated by home-grown institutions, which matters - economically and politically. Also note the four franchises offer a bipartisan balance, which could become important in January.
The Braves' move to Cobb County in 2017 has made the team a GOP favorite. National Football League stats say fans of the Falcons list slightly Republican. The Hawks and Atlanta United, meanwhile, cater to a Democratic demographic, if age and race are any guide.
The timing of the four-sport effort is no coincidence. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal ban on commercial sports betting in most, but not all states.
The New York Times quickly offered up this forecast of the coming revolution: "Placing bets will be done on mobile devices, fueled and endorsed by the lawmakers and sports officials who opposed it for so long. A trip to Las Vegas to wager on March Madness or the Super Bowl could soon seem quaint."
The dinner at the War Horse in Atlanta came three months later.
Possibly, you're baffled by the sports quartet's claim they don't intend to make any direct profit off the bets placed on their players. Although they do want some control over what kind of bets are placed - nothing that can be easily "fixed," like who makes the first foul in a basketball game, or whether the first pitch in an inning is a ball or strike.
And they want control of the statistics that might be used by the betting world - batting averages, completion stats and such.
So why do they want this? All four sports now live in a fractured TV universe with declining viewership. Video streaming is the uncertain future. Koonin said the Atlanta teams are taking a lesson from European soccer on the link between sports betting and fan investment in a team.
"How do you raise a generation that loves going to the games but has the attention span of a goldfish?" Koonin asked. "It's about engagement. The economic benefits go to the state. And an illegal activity becomes legal."
Last spring, the Tennessee state legislature passed a bill to permit sports betting. The governor allowed it to become law without his signature. The Atlanta alliance thinks Georgia could see more than the $50 million a year in state revenue the Tennessee initiative is expected to generate, but they're using that figure as a starting point.
Success in Georgia's Legislature next year could depend on whether backers choose to pursue a simple bill that would require majority approval in both chambers, or a constitutional amendment that would require two-thirds passage - and approval in a November referendum.
Last month, the Office of Legislative Counsel, in an opinion written in response to a request by state Sen. Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta, a horse racing advocate, noted our state Constitution isn't as clear on the topic of sports betting as it might be.
It forbids casino gambling and pari-mutuel betting, but sports betting falls into neither category. Which allows for the argument "the regulation of other forms of betting and gambling rests with the General Assembly," wrote Stuart Morelli, deputy legislative counsel.
But that's not a sure thing. "Because there are even odds on whether or not the Georgia Constitution currently prohibits sports betting, the only surefire way to avoid years of protracted litigation over the matter would be a constitutional amendment," he advised.

Texto completo: This story was updated on Nov. 14.
Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan said Tuesday they had agreed to free American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks in a prisoner exchange with the Afghan government. The two professors at American University of Afghanistan were captured in Kabul in 2016.
But the fate of another captive in the region remains unknown. Paul E. Overby Jr., a 76-year-old author from Western Massachusetts, was abducted in May 2014 in eastern Khost Province as he sought to interview the head of a notorious Taliban faction, the Haqqani network.
Before Overby disappeared, he suggested that he was planning to cross into Pakistan, according to the FBI.
While the Taliban militants released two videos showing the professors begging for their lives, they have released no images of Overby. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Overby is believed to be dead.
Overby's wife, Jane Larson, who lives in Goshen, said Thursday in a statement to the Globe that during the last five and a half years, she had not received any definitive information regarding his status or whereabouts.
“I remain eager for information from his captors or the governments of Afghanistan or Pakistan, where he was traveling at the time of his disappearance," she said.
In a 2017 interview, Larson said her husband had traveled to Afghanistan to write about the country and the continuing war. She told The News International in Islamabad that he had health problems that required medical attention.
Larson said her husband cared deeply about Afghanistan and had studied the Koran. In the late 1980s, he had fought alongside Afghans fighting against invading Soviet forces, she said.
The FBI offered a $1 million reward for information about Overby and King. The State Department did not respond to a question about Overby's kidnapping.
The expected release of King and Weeks is a major step in the Taliban's efforts to restart peace talks with the United States. In September, President Trump announced he was canceling negotiations with the Taliban leadership after a US service member was killed in a suicide attack in Kabul.
Insurgent fighters have been battling international and Afghan government forces since they were toppled in 2001 after their government sheltered 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.

How About A Retirement Community That Comes To You?

Texto completo: Carole Ann Basso had spent years tending to her ailing parents and disabled husband. At one point, all three were receiving hospice care in her home in northern New Jersey.
“It was so incredibly stressful,” recalled Basso, a retired high school history teacher. “I didn’t want to give my children that craziness.”
So when she moved to Lewes, Delaware, in 2012, after the deaths of her parents and husband, her own future weighed on her mind. At 69, Basso had a long-term care insurance policy and a modest pension but scant savings, which had prompted her move to a lower-cost region.
She wondered, “How am I going to take care of myself?”
In Lewes, she heard about another option in long-term care offered by a few pioneering continuing care retirement communities: a CCRC without walls.
Typically, a CCRC operates a complex or campus where residents shift from independent living to assisted living, a memory-care unit or a nursing home if their health and mobility decline.
But in continuing care at-home programs, members essentially spend the independent living years in their own houses.
In 2015, Basso joined Springpoint Choice, a program that allows her to stay in her comfortable ranch house with an also-aging English setter named Princess Leia. Diane Willoughby, her “care navigator,” checks in regularly to monitor her needs.
With luck, Basso, now 76, may remain in her home for years - or for good. If she eventually requires help with bathing, dressing or other activities of daily living, the program will provide home aides.
Moving up in care
If she can no longer live safely at home, Basso can move onto the campus of the Moorings at Lewes, the affiliated continuing care retirement community a few blocks away. Her one-time entrance fee and monthly fees will cover her long-term care costs, at home or on campus, while Medicare and her supplemental insurance pay for medical care.
“It gives you a feeling of security,” Basso said.
Though some at-home programs date to the 1990s, there are still very few. Across the country, nearly 2,000 CCRCs, mostly nonprofits, serve about 745,000 residents. Only 32, in about a dozen states, have added at-home programs.
But more senior living organizations are considering this approach, a possible answer to a perpetual conflict: Older Americans are very likely to need long-term care but often loathe the thought of leaving their homes.
“Most people want to age successfully in place; they don’t want to transition to a community,” said Kevin Ahmadi, who heads Senior Choice at Home, connected to Gulf Coast Village, a CCRC in Cape Coral, Florida. “We believe there’s a strong future for at-home programs.”
To enroll, applicants must provide medical records and financial documents. Progressive neurological diseases, like dementia or Parkinson’s disease, will disqualify applicants.
“We assume they won’t be needing any services for at least five years,” said Cecily Laidman, executive director of Springpoint Choice. But that need could arise in 15 years or the next month.
Such programs work financially, Laidman said, because many members enroll in their 70s, instead of waiting to move to a community in their 80s. They’re paying into the program for a longer period than if they had moved into a facility, allowing the programs to invest for members’ later years, when they’re more apt to need care.
Traditional CCRCs operate under an assortment of contractual arrangements. Some have high buy-in fees, refundable to varying degrees after a resident’s death; others function more like rentals. Depending on luxury and geography, they tend to serve seniors who are financially comfortable.
It’s not cheap
Often, residents sell their houses to pay entrance fees that average $107,000 to $427,000, according to a report from LeadingAge, the trade association representing nonprofit senior care providers. (LeadingAge has rebranded these entities “life plan communities.”) Monthly fees are from $2,100 to $4,200.
“It’s a great solution for people who either have means or good retirement plans, some wealth built up,” said Ruth Katz, senior vice president for public policy and advocacy at LeadingAge.
So far, the at-home programs carry lower prices, though members still pay for housing and other living costs. At Senior Choice at Home in Florida, Ahmadi said, a 75-year-old would probably pay $55,000 to $60,000 in entrance fees and about $525 a month.
At Springpoint Choice, which has about 270 members in New Jersey and Delaware, initial fees run $30,000 to $65,000, with monthly charges of $300 to $500. The fees are tax deductible.
“If in a year they have a life-changing event, they could be paying $400 a month for skilled nursing, which on the East Coast typically costs $13,000 a month,” Laidman said.
Basso joined Springpoint Choice at a bargain rate. Because she has good long-term care insurance, her entrance fee was a discounted $25,790. She paid it with the sale of her New Jersey house and her parents’ condo. Her $128 monthly fee has since increased to $146.
Handling the unexpected
She needed help far sooner than anyone had foreseen. Within months after signing her contract, she had open-heart surgery at Johns Hopkins, followed by two weeks in intensive care.
Basso then spent five weeks in rehab at the Moorings, doing physical therapy twice each day, with daily visits from Willoughby, her care navigator. Finally strong enough to go home, Basso still needed an aide for three weeks to help with shopping, laundry and meals.
“They took total care of me, and I never had to pay one cent beyond my monthly fee,” said Basso, who is now back to her independent life. “I’m not as agile as I was, but my goodness, I’m blessed.”
She’s also discovering another advantage to a CCRC without walls: Members are encouraged to join community trips, participate in activities, use the campus gyms and pools and get to know residents and staff.
“They’re connected,” Ahmadi said of at-home members. In his program, one woman changed her mind and, at 86, left her home to move into Gulf Coast Village with her newfound friends.
Though the number of continuing care retirement communities is once again growing, after taking a hit during the recession, it’s unclear whether at-home options will gain popularity. Some state regulations won’t allow them, so advocates are working to amend the laws, as has happened in Florida.
With an aging population, “the bottom line is, we’re going to need lots and lots of long-term care options,” Katz said. “We need to be experimenting and finding new models, and this is one more.”

Should you hire a doula?

Texto completo: Numerous studies have shown that women who receive continuous support in labor from a doula have decreased rates of C sections
and give birth
to healthier babies.
When you're pregnant, joy and anxiety often intertwine. l Unfortunately, fears about something going wrong are not entirely unfounded. New Jersey ranks fifth highest in maternal mortality rates, based on data from 46 states analyzed in a USA TODAY investigation in 2018. That means that out of every 100,000 births in New Jersey, 37 moms die. l The United States, which has the highest maternal death rate among developed countries, is one of only three nations – the others are Afghanistan and Sudan – where the maternal mortality rate is rising, according to the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, an organization aimed at reducing harm to women in health care.
To address these problems, First Lady Tammy Murphy has established Nurture NJ, an awareness campaign committed to reducing infant and maternal mortality and morbidity and ensuring equitable maternal and infant care among women and children of all races and ethnicities.
"The color of your skin," Tammy Murphy said in a video on the website of the office of the governor, "should not impact the quality of the care you get or your chances of surviving maternity or surviving your first year of birth."
How do you continue to tamp down all those concerns? With education.
And, perhaps, with help from a doula.
What is a doula? A doula's job is to help pregnant women navigate the nine months that lead to motherhood.
A bill that passed in the New Jersey state Assembly in March aims to improve access to doula services by expanding Medicaid coverage, but federal approval is needed before the bill can have any lasting impact.
Doulas provide non-medical assistance to women during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period. Sometimes known as "birth sisters," doulas serve as coaches and all-around helpers to the pregnant woman and her birth partner.
They can perform acupressure and other comfort measures during labor. They give encouragement to a laboring woman and her partner. They are trained professionals who give continuous physical and emotional support, as well as up-to-date, evidence-based research and information.
"We don't take away anything from the doctor," said Angela Turner, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey in Camden. "We work with the mothers, in pre-natal care, asking them, 'What plans do you have? What kind of birth do you want?' with the understanding that birth is unpredictable."
Turner recalled the labor experience of a client whose goal was to have a fully natural childbirth. At 41 weeks of pregnancy, however, she agreed to be induced, but, with the backing of Turner as her doula, she was still able to remain in control of the process.
"She requested female doctors and staff. She wanted lights off," Turner said. "She wanted family members in the room, and she wanted to be able to move around. She wanted time to herself for prayer, with nobody in the room."
"Her doctors were on board with what she wanted," Turner said. "They just waited and watched, as her body did what it was supposed to do. And she had a wonderful childbirth experience."
An ancient practice In some cultures, relatives routinely serve as unofficial doulas, with mothers, grandmothers or aunts helping women as they give birth.
"My family is from the Dominican Republic," said Cristina Ramos, a doula based in the Somerset section of Franklin. "My oldest aunt has been attending family births for 50 years, beginning at age 18. She was a lay doula."
Later, after Ramos became a mother, she, too, took up that role for her extended family.
When Ramos learned that a friend was training to become a professional doula through Doulas Of North America (DONA), she said to herself, "That's pretty much what I do," and switched from a career in sales to one as a doula.
Ronsha Dickerson, director of Community Doulas of South Jersey, says the presence of a doula in a hospital's labor and delivery ward serves to validate and empower pregnant women.
"Our goal is that moms feel they have value in that room," Dickerson said.
Hill knows first hand the difference that extra cheerleader can make. She has four daughters, and each birth was different. Hill's mother accompanied her for the first birth, and she credits her mom's company with helping her make it through labor unmedicated.
"For the second one, my mom got caught in traffic," Hill said. "I noticed a difference right away. It was a horrible experience."
Hilll's third and fourth child were born by C section, so she did not labor.
"Doulas provide continuity of care," Ramos said. "It doesn't matter how long it takes, I will be there for the entire birth."
Meeting moms' needs Most importantly, doulas serve as advocates. They make sure that a pregnant woman's needs are met and her wishes are respected.
Ramos said she asks many questions of prospective clients: "What kind of birth do you want?" "What forms of intervention do you want or not want?" And one that may come as a surprise: "Are you confident that your provider is looking out for your best interests?"
Ramos advises clients to shop around for a doctor or midwife, hospital or birthing center, until they find what feels right.
Advocacy can be especially important for women of color.
As reported in June by the USA TODAY Network, the overwhelming majority of women who die or suffer catastrophic injury in birth or post-delivery are African-American women.
Why does this happen? Doulas say the answer is very simple. "People in the medical field," Ramos said, "they just don't listen."
New Jersey Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter told a reporter for lohud.com that New Jersey Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal "hit the nail on the head" when he said, "It's implicit bias."
The phenomenon of "weathering," or the toll that is exacted on African-American women's bodies from the grinding stress of systemic racism, was examined in an influential 2018 article in the New York Times Magazine by Linda Villarosa. "Weathering" cuts across class, education and income levels, and lifestyle factors.
Expanding access to doulas Under the umbrella of Nurture NJ, the state Department of Health's "Healthy Women, Healthy Families" program has provided funding for partners to hire 77 outreach workers – 40 doulas, 29 community health workers and eight community health worker supervisors – to improve the health of African-American women.
Numerous studies have shown that women who receive continuous support in labor from a doula have decreased rates of C sections
and give birth
to healthier babies.

Texto completo: Since Republican incumbent Matt Bevin apparently lost his gubernatorial reelection bid to Democratic challenger Andy Beshear, President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that Bevin was far behind in the polls and that he almost led the governor to victory.
But polling data and political analysts suggest that Bevin and Beshear were neck and neck heading into the election.
Since Nov. 5, Trump has tweeted out varying numbers about the election. On Election Night, the president said Bevin "picked up at least 15 points in last days, but perhaps not enough (Fake News will blame Trump!)." The next day, Trump wrote that his rally in Lexington on Nov. 4 had a major impact on the election, and "the increase in Governors race was at least 15 points, and maybe 20!"
And on Monday, the president once again took to Twitter:
"So with one Rally by me at the end of the campaign, I lift the poll numbers of Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin by 19 points, he just misses, every other Republican in the Commonwealth wins big, and the Fake News blames me for a bad night! OK! By the way, Mississippi won everything!"
However, given public polls, internal polling and general discourse, "the bulk of the data suggested that the race would be really close," said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, which provides nonpartisan analysis on elections through the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.
The race was close: with 100% of counties reporting results, Beshear led Bevin by 5,189 votes out of more than 1.4 million cast.
"When the president cites a specific number, I think you have to be very skeptical of that number," Kondik said. "He's very inaccurate in his public statements much of the time."
Trump might have gotten his data from pollster Targoz Market Research, which had Beshear up by 19% in a poll released on Oct. 23. But that firm received a grade of "C/D" for its reliability from FiveThirtyEight, which is "below average."
Other polling data had different results. A survey from Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy – which received a "B+" from FiveThirtyEight – released on Oct. 26 had Bevin and Beshear tied at 46%. An October-November poll by Trafalgar Group, which received a "C-" from FiveThirtyEight, had Bevin ahead by 6 percentage points.
Even Bevin and his party indicated that they didn't think the incumbent would lose. Voter modeling conducted by the Republican National Committee showed Bevin leading by 3%, according to an October report from Politico. And the governor told The New York Times that he would win by 6 to 10 percentage points: "I think you're going to be shocked at how uncompetitive this actually is."
But it is unclear if Trump's support actually helped Bevin. With the president winning Kentucky by 30 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election, it is possible that Trump's visit to Lexington could have gotten Bevin more votes, Kondik said.
But, as Kondik pointed out, particularly in off-year elections, the party opposite of the president tends to have a historical advantage.
By claiming that Bevin was more behind in the polls than he was in reality, Trump was trying to "save face and to provide a narrative about the president's political abilities and his ability to help his fellow republicans," Kondik said.
"I think there's always going to be a level of spin in politics," he said. "But I do think if the campaign cites a specific number, it's incumbent on them to provide the data. And I don't think the president has in this instance."

Politics &amp; Ideas: The Virginias Move in Opposite Directions

Texto completo: It is a tale of two Virginias -- and a microcosm of America's shifting political landscape.
In 1988 Michael Dukakis lost the national popular vote to George H.W. Bush, 53% to 46%. Bush performed even better in Virginia than he did nationally, taking the Old Dominion by a margin of 60% to 39%. But in West Virginia, the Massachusetts governor -- no one's idea of a populist firebrand -- defeated Bush, 52% to 47%.
The Republican candidate of 1988 exceeded his national average in Virginia by 7 points, while in West Virginia the Democratic candidate surpassed his by 6 points. Twenty-eight years later, in 2016, the Republican presidential candidate lost Virginia by 50% to 44%, 2 points worse than his national performance, while carrying West Virginia by an astounding 43 points, 69% to 26%. As a once comfortably red state turned blue, a traditionally blue state turned deep red.
These changes aren't over. As recently as 2001, Republicans controlled just about everything in Virginia -- both U.S. Senate seats, the top three statewide offices and both chambers of the state legislature. Following last week's legislative elections, which handed Democrats majorities in the state Senate and House of Delegates, Democrats will control all these offices for the first time in almost half a century.
Two overlapping trends -- immigration and suburbanization -- have driven this transformation. Many middle-class immigrants have settled in the suburbs, fueling Democratic gains, especially in Northern Virginia and the Richmond area.
But demography and geography aren't the whole story. Many immigrants are moderate, business-oriented professionals who would have been open to the kind of candidates Republicans once fielded. But Donald Trump is different. As one immigrant tech worker from Virginia told the New York Times last week, "The way he speaks, you get the feeling you are separate. This is not what we signed up for in America."
In many other states Republicans have long controlled, demographic diversity and suburbanization are gradually shifting the balance of power. Republicans increasingly focus their appeal on rural and small-town voters. In Arizona, the state Republican chairwoman recently opined that rural areas should be given disproportionate voting weight to prevent an emerging metropolitan-based majority from taking power.
Republicans are learning that the populist takeover of their party, which began with the tea-party revolt and culminated in Mr. Trump's nomination, is a double-edged sword. As the GOP's appeal to working-class white voters intensifies, middle-class voters -- native-born as well as immigrant -- are backing away. These voters oppose the administration's harsh immigration policies, protectionism and skepticism about longstanding international alliances. They also reject the hard-edged partisanship that has yielded endless gridlock and recriminations in the nation's capital.
These voters find Mr. Trump's demeanor and conduct deeply troubling. As numerous surveys have shown, college-educated voters -- white and nonwhite -- regard the president as dishonest, impulsive, uncaring and lacking leadership skills. They don't think he shares their values, and they believe he has damaged the dignity of the presidency.
It is these educated suburban voters who returned the Democratic Party to majority status in the U.S. House last year. Their enthusiasm has opened the door to a new national Democratic majority. The question now is whether Democrats will seize this opportunity -- or blow it.
A recent New York Times/Siena College survey of six key swing states offers some clues about their thinking. Sixty-two percent of Democrats in these states prefer a candidate who promises to seek common ground with Republicans over one who promises to fight for a "bold progressive agenda." Fifty-five percent favor a candidate who is more moderate than most Democrats over one who is more liberal. Forty-nine percent want a candidate who promises "to bring politics in Washington back to normal," rather than "to bring fundamental systemic change to American society."
Among Democrats in these six states, there's limited appetite for continuing partisan strife, let alone revolution. Unfortunately for them, none of these states will conduct primary contests in February, and only one -- North Carolina -- will be among the Super Tuesday states that vote March 3. By the time these swing-state voters cast their ballots, the Democratic nomination could be a fait accompli -- and the presumptive nominee may not share their moderate views.
Republicans who are going along with Mr. Trump -- that's most of them -- are betting that enough states will remain enough like West Virginia to allow them to hold the presidency and Senate. Democrats are betting that enough states will become enough like Virginia to allow them to wrest back control.
In the long run, Democrats will win the bet -- if their candidates remain attuned to the beliefs of the new majority.

AJC EXCLUSIVE: Pro sports alliance tries to alter politics of gambling

Texto completo: Fifteen months ago, on a hot August evening, the top executives of Atlanta's four professional sports teams - the Braves, the Hawks, the Falcons and Atlanta United - gathered at the War Horse, a private dining club on Northside Drive.
Over steaks and a bit of paperwork, they agreed to band together and attempt a fundamental change in the politics of legalized gambling at the state Capitol.
"At our core, we're all huge sports fans," Steve Koonin, CEO of the Atlanta Hawks, who was one of the diners. "We got ourselves aligned and have worked together really, really well as a unit, because we all want to do the same thing. We all want an illegal activity to be made legal. And we want it to be taxed."
On Monday, a year and change later, the umbrella organization the Big Four will use to make their case was unveiled: The Georgia Professional Sports Integrity Alliance. Signing onto the cause, in addition to Koonin, was Derek Schiller, president and CEO of the Braves; Rich McKay, president and CEO of the Falcons; and Darren Eales, president of Atlanta United.
The quartet is calling for a new state law -- the initial strategy is aimed at avoiding a constitutional amendment -- to legalize wagering on professional sports via mobile phones and the Internet. Betting on the sacred Southern institution of college football would remain illegal, as would wagering on professional minor league teams.
All would be regulated by the Georgia Lottery Commission. State revenue generated would go to the HOPE program.
Right about now, you're wondering how this is different than any other push we've seen over the past decade -- all unsuccessful -- to expand gambling in Georgia beyond the lottery. The answer is twofold.
First, previous conversations have focused on casinos - er, destination resorts - and horse racing facilities. Those would become, critics have argued, physical magnets for unsavory activities. This sports-wagering proposal would be architecturally invisible and thus, one could argue, more politically digestible. Even betting kiosks would be barred from the three metro Atlanta stadiums involved.
The teams say they will not partake of any proceeds from licensed wagering outlets. "We would not book bets, take bets. I imagine they would be advertisers, but that would be about it," Koonin said. "We're not the house. We're not bookies. It's pure opt in, via the phone."
The larger reason to treat this effort as something different is the fact previous gambling expansion efforts have originated with entities located beyond Georgia's borders. The best example may be that day in 2015 when Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson parked his limousine on the Mitchell Street side of the state Capitol - so that he could have a chat with a few of the more important people inside.
This would be the first gambling initiative instigated by home-grown institutions, which matters - economically and politically. Also note the four franchises offer a bipartisan balance, which could become important in January.
The Braves' move to Cobb County in 2017 has made the team a GOP favorite. National Football League stats say fans of the Falcons list slightly Republican. The Hawks and Atlanta United, meanwhile, cater to a Democratic demographic, if age and race are any guide.
The timing of the four-sport effort is no coincidence. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal ban on commercial sports betting in most, but not all states.
The New York Times quickly offered up this forecast of the coming revolution: "Placing bets will be done on mobile devices, fueled and endorsed by the lawmakers and sports officials who opposed it for so long. A trip to Las Vegas to wager on March Madness or the Super Bowl could soon seem quaint."
The dinner at the War Horse in Atlanta came three months later.
Possibly, you're baffled by the sports quartet's claim they don't intend to make any direct profit off the bets placed on their players. Although they do want some control over what kind of bets are placed - nothing that can be easily "fixed," like who makes the first foul in a basketball game, or whether the first pitch in an inning is a ball or strike.
And they want control of the statistics that might be used by the betting world - batting averages, completion stats and such.
So why do they want this? All four sports now live in a fractured TV universe with declining viewership. Video streaming is the uncertain future. Koonin said the Atlanta teams are taking a lesson from European soccer on the link between sports betting and fan investment in a team.
"How do you raise a generation that loves going to the games but has the attention span of a goldfish?" Koonin asked. "It's about engagement. The economic benefits go to the state. And an illegal activity becomes legal."
Last spring, the Tennessee state legislature passed a bill to permit sports betting. The governor allowed it to become law without his signature. The Atlanta alliance thinks Georgia could see more than the $50 million a year in state revenue the Tennessee initiative is expected to generate, but they're using that figure as a starting point.
Success in Georgia's Legislature next year could depend on whether backers choose to pursue a simple bill that would require majority approval in both chambers, or a constitutional amendment that would require two-thirds passage - and approval in a November referendum.
Last month, the Office of Legislative Counsel, in an opinion written in response to a request by state Sen. Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta, a horse racing advocate, noted our state Constitution isn't as clear on the topic of sports betting as it might be.
It forbids casino gambling and pari-mutuel betting, but sports betting falls into neither category. Which allows for the argument "the regulation of other forms of betting and gambling rests with the General Assembly," wrote Stuart Morelli, deputy legislative counsel.
But that's not a sure thing. "Because there are even odds on whether or not the Georgia Constitution currently prohibits sports betting, the only surefire way to avoid years of protracted litigation over the matter would be a constitutional amendment," he advised.

Texto completo: A Star Wars series is on Disney's new streaming service. And an acclaimed directorial debut is available for rental elsewhere.
What's Streaming
THE MANDALORIAN Stream on Disney Plus. A hand on a holster. Animals galloping over parched land. A mysterious, caped figure walking into the sunset. This new Star Wars series from Jon Favreau brings strong echoes of Sergio Leone and John Ford to George Lucas's galaxy far, far over yonder. Part of a slate of programming Disney is using to introduce its new streaming service, "The Mandalorian" casts Pedro Pascal (best known for getting his skull crushed as Oberyn Martell in "Game of Thrones") as a bounty hunter. His story picks up several years after Luke Skywalker and company celebrated victory in "Return of the Jedi," but before the plots of the newer Star Wars episodes of the 2010s. The show's cast also includes Giancarlo Esposito, Carl Weathers, Gina Carano, Nick Nolte and Werner Herzog -- but the secret weapon here may be the Swedish musician Ludwig Goransson, who has followed up recent work on "Black Panther" and Childish Gambino's "This is America" by scoring all eight episodes of "The Mandalorian."
THE CHAMBERMAID (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Mexico's entry in the best international feature category at the Academy Awards centers on a maid at a high-rise hotel in Mexico City. The movie follows that maid, Eve (Gabriela Cartol), through her day-to-day life, including a friendship; a romance; and a window into the lives of guests, who leave behind pieces of themselves in the form of books, bloodstains and more. The film was directed by Lila Avilés, and is a "quietly stunning debut feature," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "Avilés approaches Eve's inner life with frank and tactful sympathy, and depicts her circumstances with unsentimental clarity," he added. "The film's style is austere -- there are few camera movements and no musical score -- but its visual wit and emotional sensitivity lift it above the minimalist miserablism that drags down so many well-meaning films about modern workers. After you've seen it, the world looks different."
MARADONA IN MEXICO Stream on Netflix. Earlier this year, the famous Argentine footballer Diego Maradona was the subject of an HBO documentary that chronicled his storied career. A different side of Maradona can be found in this docuseries, which follows the athlete during a recent period when he was coaching the Dorados de Sinaloa, a team based in Culiacán, Mexico.
What's on TV
LIFE FROM ABOVE 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). While "The Mandalorian" offers an escape to a galaxy of jedi and starships, this series goes to space to look back at Earth. The previous couple episodes used strikingly detailed satellite imagery to showcase the colors and patterns as seen from above; Wednesday night's episode uses such images to look at the way the planet has changed over the years, and at humans' dramatic impact on the Earth's landscapes.

Texto completo: On Friday, House investigators released the transcript of former National Security Council official Fiona Hill’s testimony from last month. It showed a Republican staff member trying and failing to get Hill to concede that there might be some validity to the conspiracy theories underlying Donald Trump’s demands of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine.
“Are you familiar with the, you know, the allegation about Serhiy Leshchenko?” asked the Republican aide, Steve Castor. He added, “You know, relating to publicizing Manafort’s role in the Ukraine?”
Leshchenko, whom I interviewed in October, is a former member of Parliament in Ukraine and probably the most famous investigative journalist in the country. He helped expose the so-called black ledger that listed $12.7 million in secret payments to Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, from his client Viktor Yanukovych, the wildly corrupt Russian-aligned oligarch who ruled Ukraine until 2014. Manafort is in federal prison in part for failing to disclose or pay taxes on the millions he sucked out of Ukraine. Nevertheless, to make Trump’s demands of Zelenskiy seem just and rational, some Republicans have started painting Manafort as the victim of Leshchenko’s plotting.
Hill, a Russia expert and co-author of a psychological study of Vladimir Putin, tried to shut down this line of questioning. “The Ukrainian government did not interfere in the U.S. election,” she said, adding, “The Ukrainian Special Services also did not interfere in our election.” As the Republican questions continued, Hill seems to have grown almost indignant. “I’m really worried about these conspiracy theories, and I’m worried that all of you are going to go down a rabbit hole, you know, looking for things that are not going to be at all helpful to the American people or to our future election in 2020,” she said.
She is right to be concerned. This week, as part of its impeachment inquiry, the House begins public hearings into Trump’s attempt to extort Ukraine’s president into starting bogus investigations to benefit Trump politically. Republicans have telegraphed several possible defenses of the president.
The Washington Post reported that House Republicans may try to throw hapless Trump lackeys Rudy Giuliani, Mick Mulvaney and Gordon Sondland under the bus, suggesting they “could have acted on their own to influence Ukraine policy.” Other Republicans have settled on calling Trump’s actions “inappropriate” but not impeachable. But the House Republicans who are actually involved in the hearings seem set to go all in on the fantasy of Ukrainian election interference. To exonerate Trump, they are ready to help cover for Russia.
On Saturday, Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, sent the committee’s chairman, Adam Schiff, a list of people Republicans want to call to testify. To understand the significance of some of the names, you’d have to plunge into the very rabbit holes Hill warned of. Luckily, Nunes made his intention clear, writing of Trump’s “documented belief that the Ukrainian government meddled in the 2016 election,” which “forms the basis for a reasonable desire for Ukraine to investigate the circumstances surrounding the election.”
The conspiracy theories that undergird the president’s “documented belief” aren’t really coherent, but they don’t have to be to serve their purpose, which is sowing confusion about the well-established fact that Russia assisted Trump’s campaign. They posit not just that Manafort was set up but also that Democrats worked with Ukraine to frame Russia for hacking Democrats’ emails, a dastardly Democratic plot that led to Trump’s election. Naturally, George Soros, perennial scapegoat for the far right, is also involved.
“George Soros was behind it. George Soros’ company was funding it,” Giuliani said on ABC in September, spinning tales of Hillary Clinton’s collusion with Ukraine. Speaking to The Post, Giuliani accused Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, of “working for Soros.” Indeed, Hill in her testimony suggested that a sort of Infowars-era McCarthyism has been loosed on the national security bureaucracy, with “frankly an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about George Soros” used to “target nonpartisan career officials and also some political appointees as well.”
Some of these lies seem to have originated in Russia; documents from the Mueller investigation recently obtained by BuzzFeed News show that Manafort was blaming Ukraine for the Democratic National Committee hack back in 2016, a story he apparently got from one of his associates, a former Russian intelligence officer named Konstantin Kilimnik. (Hill testified that she’d encountered Kilimnik in a previous job, and “all of my staff thought he was a Russian spy.”)
A few of Trump’s more responsible aides have reportedly tried to disabuse him of Ukraine conspiracy theories, to no avail. Instead it appears that House Republicans, out of slavish fealty to the president, are going to use high-profile hearings to amplify them.
In her testimony, Hill seemed to warn Republicans off their current path. She mentioned the report issued last month by the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee about how Russia used online propaganda to boost Trump in 2016. “If we have people running around chasing rabbit holes because Rudy Giuliani or others have been feeding information to The Hill, Politico, we are not going to be prepared as a country to push back on this again,” she said. “The Russians thrive on misinformation and disinformation.” Unfortunately, so do Trump’s defenders.

Texto completo: La compañía Tribune Publishing anunció este martes el cierre del periódico Hoy, que servía a la comunidad hispanohablante del área de Chicago.
El semanario dejará de circular el 13 de diciembre. También se acabará su sitio web.
El periódico fue lanzado en 2003 como reemplazo del semanario Éxito y fue diario por varios años. En 2017 pasó a ser semanario después de un par de años circulando tres días a la semana. Actualmente operaba con cerca de media docena de empleados.
Relacionado: Suspenden operación del New York Times en Español
La publicación era la última de la marca Hoy que quedaba en funcionamiento. Hoy nació en Nueva York en 1998, y se expandió a Chicago y Los Ángeles al ser adquirido por Tribune Co. en 2000 .
Impremedia, propietaria de El Diario y La Opinión, adquirió Hoy Nueva York en 2007, cuando era un diario de distribución gratuita. El medio cerró en 2009.
En agosto pasado, el semanario Hoy Los Ángeles fue cerrado por Los Angeles Times para dar paso a Los Angeles Times en Español, que solamente opera de manera digital.
Tribune Publishing ofreció a los empleados de Hoy Chicago vincularse a plazas abiertas en el Chicago Tribune.
El sindicato del Chicago Tribune lamentó el cierre de Hoy.
“Estamos profundamente decepcionados de que Tribune Publishing esté cerrando Hoy, que ha ido más allá de los estereotipos y ha proporcionado noticias significativas al vasto cuerpo de hispanohablantes en nuestra región. Esto es perjudicial para nuestros periodistas, nuestros lectores y nuestra empresa”, escribió el sindicato en su cuenta de Twitter.
We're deeply disappointed that Tribune Publishing is shutting down Hoy, which has gone beyond stereotypes and provided meaningful news to the vast body of Spanish-speakers in our region. This is a disservice to our journalists, our readers and our company.

Patrick considers run for president

Texto completo: Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick is considering a late entry into the Democratic presidential race, according to two people familiar with Patrick's thinking, potentially adding another name to an already unsettled primary field less than three months before the Iowa caucus.
One person familiar with Patrick's thinking said he is “strongly considering" running and may announce his decision this week. This person also said Patrick had reached out to former vice president Joe Biden to let him know he was weighing the move. A second person said an announcement from Patrick could come Thursday.
The New York Times, which first reported Patrick's deliberations, said the former governor has told Democratic officials that none of the current Democrats running for president has sufficient political momentum.
That's a concern echoed among some party elites, who are hand-wringing behind the scenes about the shakiness ofearly frontrunner Biden and worry that his liberal challengers, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, would run too far to the left to be electable against President Trump. Former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg is also worried about the field and weighing a run, his advisers confirmed.
The window for Patrick's decision is rapidly closing. He has already missed the deadline to be on the ballot in Alabama, a Super Tuesday state; the deadline for Arkansas, another such state, is Tuesday; and the deadline to get on the ballot in New Hampshire is this Friday.
Nearly a year ago, Patrick, 63, announced he would not seek the presidency, citing the “cruelty" of the elections process and acknowledging doubts that he could cut through the noise of a crowded and chaotic primary. “It's hard to see how you even get noticed in such a big, broad field without being shrill, sensational, or a celebrity — and I'm none of those things and I'm never going to be any of those things," he said then.
One obstacle was Patrick's relatively low national profile, though he spent much of 2018 campaigning widely for Democrats in the midterms, granting national media interviews. He was the subject of lengthy profile in the New Yorker.
Patrick, the first black governor of Massachusetts, served from 2007 to 2015 and is a close friend and ally of former president Barack Obama. Like Obama, Patrick has an inspiring life story — rising from the welfare rolls in Chicago to the top levels of government and the inner sanctums of corporate boardrooms — and is seen as a skilled campaigner and powerful public speaker.
“I don't think I've ever met anybody better at campaigning than Deval Patrick," David Axelrod, a former political adviser to Obama who helped Patrick get elected governor in Massachusetts, told the Globe in April 2018. He said at the time that Patrick could articulate a unifying message that would be a good antidote to Trump's divisiveness.
Indeed, Patrick, who once headed the civil rights division of the Justice Department under President Clinton, had been dusting off his soaring, hopeful rhetoric before audiences last year in key primary states such as South Carolina as he stumped for other candidates. If he runs, Patrick will likely attempt to cut into Biden's strong support among that state's black voters.
“There's lot of buzz about it. He has lots of friends here and I believe could fundamentally reshape the race in South Carolina if he runs," said Tyler Jones, a Democratic strategist in the state.

Patrick's background as a progressive but also pragmatic executive could help him stand out in the current field, argued Joshua Boger, a Democratic donor and founder of Vertex Pharmaceuticals. “I think he's very solidly in the mainstream of the progressive side of the Democratic Party without being on any extreme," Boger said. “But he's actually practical. A governor has to get things done."
But the hurdles Patrick would face should he decide to run are formidable. He is not as well-known nationally as the Democrats running at the front of the pack. Patrick also doesn't have anything approaching the personal resources of Bloomberg, who is worth a reported $53 billion, to help him make up ground in the fund-raising race. A federal political action committee affiliated with Patrick had no cash on hand as of April.
There's also the matter of time. If he gets in the race this week, there will be roughly 80 days until the Iowa caucuses and 90-some days to the New Hampshire primary. Other candidates have been building organizations for a year or more — and voters in many of these states expect to see candidates multiple times.
Two of his closest former aides are tied up with other candidates. John Walsh, who served as Patrick's 2006 gubernatorialcampaign manager, is leading Senator Edward J. Markey's contested reelection campaign. Doug Rubin, another close former aide who also worked on Warren's 2012 Senate campaign, is working for billionaire candidate Tom Steyer.
“If Deval Patrick decides to run for president, I will not be a part of his campaign," Walsh said in a statement.
Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based Democratic strategist, said the only way Patrick could pull off a primary victory is if “the Obama operation from top to bottom — all of it — gets behind him." Even then, she added, “it would be the longest of long shots."
Judy Reardon, an environmental activist and longtime Democratic operative in New Hampshire, also raised doubts that Patrick would be able to threaten the race's top contenders entering this late and without money in the bank. “Where does he think he's going to win? If he can't do exceptionally well in one of the four early states, you have to have just a ton of money," she said.
Patrick also could find himself under attack from his more populist rivals over his Wall Street ties. After he left the governor's office, Patrick went to work as a managing director for Bain Capital, an investment firm that drew attacks from Democrats after its founder and Patrick's predecessor as governor, Mitt Romney, ran for president. His former employers include Texaco, Coca-Cola, and other corporate giants.
“The only thing worse for his chances than working at Bain is waiting this late to enter," Brian Fallon, a former top aide to Hillary Clinton, said.
If Patrick does enter the race, he would find himself facing off against fellow Massachusetts politician Warren, who is at the top or near the top of several polls. The two have said they are friends but would operate in very different lanes of the primary, given Warren's populist rhetoric about the excesses of Wall Street and corporate greed.
And although it's true none of the Democratic frontrunners has managed to lock down the race yet, it's still unclear if Democratic voters share the same questions about the field that are driving a wave of late-breaking candidates.
As governor, Patrick was credited with securing reforms in transportation and education and launching initiatives that stimulated the clean energy and biotechnology industries. But he was criticized for severe management failures and the death of children in the state's child welfare system.

Seeking a Path to Trust

Texto completo: "There's an old saying, 'Things move at the speed of trust,"' Brian Chesky, co-founder and chief executive of Airbnb, said on Wednesday at The New York Times DealBook conference. "Well, how could you possibly trust something on a platform if you don't even know if it's true?" If there is one singular issue that defines the intersection of business and policy at this moment, it is a deepening trust deficit. That appeared to be the conclusion of some of the most consequential leaders who came together for this year's conference, "Playing for the Long Term." The words "trust" and "responsibility" were peppered throughout more than a dozen conversations as well as what needs to change to regain that trust.
Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist, talked about the distrust between the United States and China, and his worries that such mistrust is missing a bigger point.
"If you're so paranoid," he said, "you know, what about the code that's being written by somebody whose grandmother was Chinese, or great-grandmother was Chinese? My God, just think about it. I mean, is there any piece of software in the world that you're willing to trust?"
Hillary Clinton said she was worried about Facebook's decision to allow paid political advertising.
"Information is the bloodstream of a democracy," she said. "And if we are living in a world increasingly where the press -- the historic, traditional press -- is under constant attack, the internet is filled with all kinds of unreliable and often blatantly false information, how do we even begin to judge that?"
Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive of Boeing -- which is in the midst of a crisis concerning its grounded 737 Max -- talked about trying to regain the public's trust in personal terms.
"It's fair to say I've thought about" resigning, he said. "But to be frank, that's not what's in my character. I don't see running away from a challenge, resigning, is the right solution." He added that the way he grew up, "what I believe in today, and the values I try to share with my team, is when we have challenges we face into them."
But the issue of trust -- or lack of it -- crystallized in the discussion with Mr. Chesky.
"I think many of us in this industry over the last 10 years are going from a hands-off model, where the internet's an immune system, to realizing that's not really enough, that we have to take more responsibility for the stuff on our platform," he said. "And I think this has been a gradual, maybe too gradual, transition for our industry."
Mr. Chesky's comments came in the wake of a shooting that killed five people and injured several others at an Airbnb property on Halloween.
Mr. Chesky said he planned to change the way the company operates -- no longer relying solely on crowdsourced reviews. He plans to verify the properties on his site, often manually. It is a reversal from the way so many tech companies have operated for years, relying on customers to provide star ratings to other customers rather than vet much of what's on their platforms themselves.
"When I came to Silicon Valley 10 years ago, the word 'technology' may as well have been a dictionary definition for the word 'good,"' he said. "We all believed it: Technology equals good. Because technology is progress, and every piece of progress is a step forward for humanity. So therefore if you're in the technology business, you're 'making the world a better place.'
"And I think the problem with that culture is it made us not ask really thoughtful questions about, well, what is the impact of our technology on society?"
That conversation is clearly beginning to happen, both within the world of business leaders and policymakers and beyond. Even Kim Kardashian West jumped in to the trust debate on social media, long her preferred medium. She is particularly concerned about social media's impact on young people.
"I think taking the 'likes' away -- taking that aspect away from it -- would be really beneficial for people" and their mental health, she said.
Businesspeople and policy leaders are scrambling for new ways to engender trust with constituents, including shareholders, employees and regulators. Some are trying to be more transparent. Others are diving into political and social issues that used to be verboten. Perhaps more than anything, they're speaking publicly more about their thinking.
Alex Gorsky, the chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, explained how he had tried to communicate more with his employees.
"It's a little bit like a bank account," he said. "If you have an ongoing conversation, and you're making contributions to that account over time, you're building trust, you're being open, you're being transparent, you're being authentic with them." He said he was giving "them the opportunity to have a debate." He added: "Then I think you're going to build a lot of trust. Because someday you're likely going to need to make a withdrawal."

Texto completo: I never thought the state of California would make it even harder for writers to make a living, but here we are.
To be fair, that's not the Legislature's intention. Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) drafted Assembly Bill 5 to help workers victimized by the gig economy. She consulted with writers' organizations regarding its effect on writers. She deserves a lot of credit for her efforts. But even before AB 5 takes effect on Jan. 1, 2020, the marketplace is making it unworkable for many freelancers.
The new law will require a company to hire as an employee any writer who contributes more than 35 "submissions" a year to that publication. (It applies to editorial cartoonists and photographers as well.)

It's meant to stop media companies from firing full-time staff and replacing them with the work of freelancers, without paying for benefits or payroll taxes.
But it runs into two problems. The first is the changing nature of the writing marketplace; the second is the diversity of writers' careers.
If you're an Uber driver, you can't operate a vehicle from across the continent (not yet, at least). But writing exists in a national marketplace, and most freelance writers can work remotely from wherever they live. Since local stories make up only a small subset of content that is in demand, publishers both in and outside California may well avoid buying work from California-based freelancers. Many freelancers say this is already happening.
AB 5 was written to minimize these effects; for example, multiple stories about the same event may count as a single "submission." But the market doesn't care. Facing ever narrower margins, media companies prefer to avoid the time and cost of parsing the law and any risk of running afoul of it. They can turn to the many good writers who live in the other 49 states.
It's commonly understood that an out-of-state employer must abide by labor laws where the worker resides. It would probably take a court case to settle the jurisdictional issues in AB 5. Would a New York or Washington-based media company risk litigation in order to hire a California freelancer? Unlikely.
The other problem with the law is that it doesn't sufficiently take into account the variety of categories of writers, and how they overlap. The assumption is that we all want a full-time job with an employer.
In some cases, that's true. Gonzalez, a former labor organizer, told the Hollywood Reporter that she was alarmed by the attack on journalists' unions with many reporters having been sacked unwillingly. A lot of freelancers would love to be staff writers.
But writing careers comprise a spectrum. Book authors like myself want to put most of our time into work on our own projects. We retain copyright over our work and the freedom to express our views through our creations.
Of course, only rarely does individual creation pay all the bills. I have two Pulitzer Prizes but no New York Times bestsellers. I, like others, write on a freelance basis as I attempt to put together income from a variety of sources while retaining my independence. Crimping even a minor revenue stream hurts the ability to create.
Many authors I know have had regular gigs writing columns or reviews for daily newspapers. No, they weren't paid enough, but trying to force their papers to hire them wouldn't help.
The San Francisco Chronicle, for example, is not about to create a new position for a full-time reviewer, since it has laid off its book editor.
For many years after I started to write books full time, I supplemented my income by writing catalog and jacket-flap copy for a publisher, often submitting as many as 60 pieces a year.
I don't know if I could have finished my first two books if AB 5 had come along and frightened away that client. Does the new law apply to that kind of marketing work? It might, unless the work "depends primarily on the invention, imagination, or talent of the employee," to quote the text of the law. A hard-pressed manager with a limited budget is unlikely to risk a court case to test this question.
And what if the law worked as intended, and I were offered a job?
No, thank you. I had quit my last job in order to write my own books and I would not want to go back to regular employment in marketing and advertising.
It's a tough time for writers. In a recent member survey, the Authors Guild found that incomes have declined sharply. The digital platform titans of Silicon Valley have remade the creative marketplace for their own profit, slashing pay for artists and writers as they harvest advertising and streaming revenue.
I believe AB 5 is meant to help, but it's not the solution. No matter how precisely drafted, a state-based intervention may simply push our clients to go elsewhere.
Please, revise AB 5 before it hurts writers who are already struggling.

Texto completo: The nation's tech giants, once celebrated as corporate heroes, are suddenly seen as bullies in the schoolyard of the American economy.
In recent months, federal agencies, states and Congress have started investigating the market power and potential anticompetitive behavior of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, collectively known as Big Tech.
What, if anything, should be done to rein in the Big Tech companies? New rules? Tougher enforcement? Break them up?
That is a hot topic in the United States, and in other countries. And it was a theme at The New York Times DealBook conference last week, addressed most pointedly by two participants: Makan Delrahim, chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division, and Bill Gates, a co-founder of Microsoft, the target of the government's last big case against a technology company.
Policing the Big Tech companies, Mr. Delrahim said, should be left to the nation's federal competition officials rather than beefed-up regulation.
Congress is looking at creating a new digital authority or significantly expanding the powers of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate the tech giants. In congressional hearings, expert witnesses have made that recommendation.
Other countries, including Australia and Britain, have either set up or are creating regulatory agencies focused on digital markets, as a way to respond more quickly to allegations of anticompetitive practices and other abuses.
"I hope we don't go there," Mr. Delrahim said.
Antitrust laws, dating back a century, he said, should be nimble and flexible enough to cope with competition issues in the fast-moving digital markets. "That's the challenge for us," he said.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Traditional antitrust enforcement has relied on higher consumer prices as a key signal of monopoly power and anticompetitive behavior.
But the internet services from Google and Facebook are free to consumers. The old yardstick no longer applies, prompting calls for new rules for the digital giants.
Prices matter, Mr. Delrahim said, but he emphasized that they were only one consideration in antitrust enforcement. Others, he said, are the impact a dominant company's actions have on consumer choice, quality of service and innovation.
Free offerings are not new in antitrust law.
In the Microsoft case in the 1990s, Mr. Delrahim noted, the company bundled its Internet Explorer browsing software to its dominant Windows system as a free add-on. That undermined competition from a new competitor, Netscape Communications, the commercial pioneer in internet browsing software.
At the time, Mr. Delrahim was a young lawyer working on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which held hearings on Microsoft. Asked if he were in the Justice Department then, would he have pursued the Microsoft suit?
"I absolutely think that was a case to bring," Mr. Delrahim replied.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Gates disagreed. And he recalled his time at the center of an antitrust case and the personal and corporate energy consumed by it.
Microsoft was found guilty of repeatedly violating antitrust laws, and in a settlement agreed to stop some tactics.
Asked if the suit made the technology market more competitive, Mr. Gates said: "No. Everyone else can say that if they want. It's not true to me, and I will never change that opinion."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Still, Mr. Gates said, the lawsuit hurt Microsoft, distracting him and the company from moving quickly enough in new markets, like mobile computing and cellphones. "But that's not a pro-consumer thing," he said.
The most drastic remedy would be to break up the Big Tech companies. The most detailed proposal is a split-up plan for Facebook from two antitrust experts, Scott Hemphill of New York University and Tim Wu of Columbia University, and Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook.
They propose forcing Facebook to shed two companies it acquired -- Instagram, a photo-sharing service, and WhatsApp, a messaging service. Those purchases, they say, were the biggest ones in a Facebook campaign to take over nascent competitors. A century ago, Standard Oil was broken up under a similar theory of "predatory" acquisitions as an anticompetitive strategy.
At the DealBook conference, Kevin Systrom, co-founder of Instagram, was skeptical that breaking up Big Tech companies would be an appropriate or effective solution to the perceived problem: the power the companies have over the economy and public discourse.
"Don't think that if you were to peel off WhatsApp and Instagram, that all of a sudden solves that problem," he said. "You still have two and a half billion people on Facebook."
He also defended big companies buying small ones as often vital to accelerate the spread of innovation, given the greater reach and resources of large corporations. Buyouts can also be extremely lucrative for the sellers, as it was for the fledgling Instagram in 2012. "When someone comes to you and offers you $ 1 billion for 11 people, what do you say?" Mr. Systrom said.

Texto completo: Five Naval Academy graduates were aboard the USS Grayback in February 1944 during its final combat mission of World War II, including commanding officer John Anderson Moore.
Cmdr. Moore was among 80 sailors aboard when the boat disappeared on Feb. 26, and was presumed to have died with the rest of his crew. The exact whereabouts of the sub remained a mystery for 75 years.
Sunday, a team of ocean explorers confirmed they had located the wreckage of the Grayback, one of the most successful U.S. submarines during the war. It was located about 50 nautical miles south of Okinawa in June. The group, led by undersea explorer Tim Taylor, spent the past few months searching for relatives of the crew, he told ABC News.
The Grayback sailed out from Pearl Harbor toward the East China Sea on Jan. 28, 1944 and sank at least two Japanese cargo ships in its path, according to the U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command.
It was due to return on March 7 of that year, but it never did. The submarine was attacked about two weeks earlier and "exploded and sank immediately," according to Japanese reports cited by the Navy. A Japan aircraft struck the submarine with a 500-pound bomb.
The Grayback is the fifth submarine discovered by Taylor's Lost 52 Project, which aims to find the 52 U.S. submarines that were lost in World War II. The location of the vessel remained unsolved for so long because of one wrong number in coordinates recorded by the Japanese navy. A 1949 document with approximate locations for each missing submarine was translated from Japanese into English with one digit wrong in the longitude and latitude of the site the Grayback was believed to have sunk, The New York Times reported.
The error was reportedly detected last year by an amateur researcher. The submarine was destroyed in its 10th and most successful patrol, in which it had sunk more than 21,000 tons of shipping belonging to enemy forces, according to the Navy.
Moore graduated from Annapolis in 1932, according to USNA Virtual Memorial Hall, an online list of graduates who have died in service to their company. It is maintained by Run To Honor, an organization of Naval Academy alumni founded in 2007.
Known as "Johnnie," Moore came to Annapolis from Arizona. He was on his second patrol aboard the Grayback at the time of his death.
According to the website On Eternal Patrol, a private listing of members of the U.S. submarine service who have died in combat, the four other academy graduates serving aboard the sub when it was sunk were:
Cmdr. Raymond Leon Mayo, Class of 1930. Mayo was on his third combat patrol aboard the sub.
Lt. Cmdr. Carthel Hill Smith, Class of 1940.
Lt. William C. Roy Jr., class of 1942.
Lt. j.g. Melvin Clyde Phillips, Class of 1944.
Naval Academy offices were closed Monday, and a spokesperson was unavailable for comment on the discovery.
Two sailors from Maryland also were aboard the sub when it disappeared, Quartermaster 3rd Class Ralph Bloodsworth of Baltimore and Electricians Mate Richard Hitch of Wicomico County, according to On Eternal Patrol.

McKinsey Bankruptcy Unit Faces Criminal Probe; Giant consulting firm faces mounting legal and court challenges as it attempts to defend its bankruptcy-advisory business

Texto completo: A McKinsey & Co. unit faces mounting legal and court challenges as the giant consulting firm defends its bankruptcy-advisory business.
Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into whether McKinsey's bankruptcy unit improperly failed to disclose investment interests in companies it was advising in bankruptcy and clients that had ties to those cases, according to people familiar with the matter.
Bankruptcy laws require advisers to troubled companies to be disinterested in the outcomes of chapter 11 cases.
As part of the probe, the people said, prosecutors are examining McKinsey's investing unit, known as MIO Partners. MIO held undisclosed stakes in hedge funds giving it a direct financial interest in the outcome of roughly half of the chapter 11 cases the firm had worked on between 2002 and the end of 2016, according to a 2018 investigation by The Wall Street Journal . In six of the 12 chapter 11 cases in which McKinsey acted as an adviser to the debtors, the Journal found, the firm had a financial interest in the outcome. In 2015, for instance, McKinsey advised Alpha Natural Resources, a troubled coal miner, and didn't disclose its investment in a hedge fund that received valuable Alpha assets in the bankruptcy.
McKinsey's spokesman said Monday that in mid-2018, it received an inquiry from the U.S. attorney's office in New York City. The firm addressed the inquiry and has received no additional requests from the office, the spokesman said.
The chapter 11 bankruptcy process requires advisers to be disinterested advocates for their clients and to disclose all relationships that might give rise to a conflict of interest so that other participants in the cases are aware of them. McKinsey has routinely disclosed far fewer potential conflicts of interest than other bankruptcy professionals over the past decade, the Journal has reported. The McKinsey spokesman said that the firm's disclosures "have always been undertaken in good faith" and have been "entirely lawful and responsive to industry developments." The firm strongly denies that MIO created a conflict of interest with its bankruptcy advisory business, the spokesman said.
The criminal inquiry into McKinsey, first reported in the New York Times, is taking place alongside an investigation into the firm's practices by the U.S. Trustee Program, a unit of the Justice Department charged with protecting the integrity of the bankruptcy system.
Earlier this year, McKinsey agreed to pay $15 million to settle with the U.S. Trustee over three chapter 11 cases it worked on. At the time, the U.S. Trustee said it was continuing to investigate McKinsey and that the settlement didn't foreclose the possibility of criminal charges down the road. The firm did not admit to wrongdoing in connection with the settlement.
The U.S. Trustee has focused on MIO, McKinsey's $12.3 billion investment unit, and in court filings has characterized as inaccurate the firm's sworn testimony that the unit is operated independently from the firm "as a blind trust."
The U.S. Trustee late last year also cited the fact that Jon Garcia, founder of McKinsey's bankruptcy advisory unit, simultaneously sat on the board of MIO Partners for many years and ratified its investment decisions. McKinsey's disclosures about MIO lacked "timely, voluntary, and direct candor," the U.S. Trustee contended.
McKinsey said at the time that its "disclosures in bankruptcy advising fully meet the terms of the U.S. bankruptcy code," adding: "We have been transparent about the connections we were disclosing and the process utilized to identify those connections." Mr. Garcia has declined to comment.
MIO Partners is under scrutiny in the 2018 bankruptcy of Westmoreland Coal, another company advised by McKinsey. The U.S. Trustee objected to McKinsey's application to work on the Westmoreland matter, which is being heard in Judge David Jones's Houston courtroom, saying the firm's disclosures were insufficient and at odds with bankruptcy law. McKinsey's spokesman said it is working constructively with the U.S. Trustee in the Westmoreland case.
McKinsey eventually withdrew its first application and submitted another with added disclosures, which the U.S. Trustee says remain "incomplete, inadequate and, in some areas, raise questions."

Scott Hapgood refuses to return to Anguilla amid death threats, possibility of jail

Texto completo: DARIEN — Scott Hapgood did not return to Anguilla Monday for a court appearance, citing safety concerns and the possibility of being sent back to jail.
The 44-year-old Darien man, who is on leave from his job as a UBS trader, has been accused of killing Kenny Mitchel, a hotel worker in April during a violent struggle while on vacation with his family in the Caribbean.
“Despite the unfairness of the charge continuing, Scott has cooperated with the Anguillan legal process and has returned to the island three times for hearings in an effort to clear his name,” said Jamie Diaferia, the Hapgood family spokesman.
“But it has become progressively apparent that Scott would not receive a fair trial in Anguilla. During the process, a toxicology report was suppressed, witnesses altered their accounts and submitted new statements that were false, a revised cause of death was ignored, legal counsel was excluded from the hearing, and numerous other actions that suggested that politics are governing Scott’s case rather than the law and the facts.”

His Monday court appearance was to be a preliminary inquiry and the judge could have revoked Hapgood’s bail, sending him to an Anguilla jail possibly until the case is resolved.
Hapgood was originally held at Her Majesty’s Prison in Anguilla when he was denied bail. But he was later released on bond after his attorney appealed to the High Court, sparking outrage among residents on the island. The judge who denied Hapgood’s bail in April was also scheduled to preside over Monday’s hearing.
“The guarantees of safety are essential for two reasons,” Diaferia said. “First, there is a significant likelihood Scott’s incarceration would be indefinite, as a trial may not happen for many years. Second, there is near certainty the death threats he has received will come to fruition if he were to be held in an Anguillan prison for any length of time.”
A spokesman at the Royal Anguilla Police Force said “the matter has been adjourned” until Tuesday and declined further comment.
The Royal Anguilla Police Force had issued a traffic advisory for the area near the Magistrate Court.
“This adjustment has become necessary in order to facilitate operational commitments by the Royal Anguilla Police Force,” the advisory said.
Though it did not indicate it was related to Hapgood’s court appearance, a Facebook page dedicated to defending Mitchel posted the notice with the comment, “We are preparing for his arrival.”
Another person commented, “Wow, what a beautiful welcoming...”
Diaferia said Anguilla authorities declined to guarantee Hapgood’s safety and also refused to allow him to appear at the hearing by video.
“An inflammatory and false rhetoric has also grown around this case,” Diaferia said. “Scott was accused of perpetrating racial violence.”
The Hapgood family has said the Darien man was defending himself and his young children after Mitchel came to their room to fix a bathroom sink. Hapgood contended the sink was never broken and no one called for someone to come to their room, but he trusted Mitchel because he was wearing a hotel uniform.
The family has accused Mitchel of pulling a knife, resulting in Hapgood “fighting for his life” and being bitten multiple times, including on the face.
Darien Police respond
“The Darien Police Department has been advised that Scott Hapgood, a Darien resident charged with manslaughter on the island of Anguilla, was scheduled to return to the island today, November 11, 2019, for a court appearance,” Darien Police Chief Donald Anderson said.
“We have been further advised that Mr. Hapgood, in consultation with his legal advisers, has made the decision to not return to Anguilla at this time amid reported concerns for his personal safety,” Anderson said.
The Darien Police Department statement said it had no direct involvement in these ongoing proceedings which have attracted national and international media attention during the year.
“The Darien Police Department, as always, looks to provide an effective public safety response and to ensure that the rights to safety and security, afforded to all residents and guests of the Town of Darien, are protected should our services be required. Our staff is aware of these latest developments in this matter and we will continue to provide reasonable, professional patrol (both general and focused) and effective response to ensure public safety,” Anderson said.
“Going forward, it appears that these ongoing criminal matters will most likely be handled at the United States Department of State level as it involves international criminal charges and a citizen of the United States and the State of Connecticut,” Anderson said.
The Darien Police Department will have no further comment on this matter at this time, they said.
A revised autopsy report, based on recently released toxicology tests, determined Mitchel died from a lethal dose of cocaine and not from injuries he sustained in the fight, according to The New York Times.
“Acute cocaine toxicity could have been a potentially independent cause of death in the known circumstances,” according to Dr. Stephen King, who oversaw the autopsy.
The report described cocaine levels in Mitchel’s bloodstream “twice that commonly accepted to have a fatal outcome,” causing his lungs to fill with blood and suffocating him.
A separate analysis of the new autopsy, conducted at the request of Hapgood’s lawyers by the Chief Medical Examiner for the state of Maryland, led to a similar finding.
The revised report supports the defense’s claim Mitchel was allegedly behaving erratically and aggressively — common side effects for that level of drug use. Hapgood has said Mitchel threatened him with a knife and demanded money. Mitchel’s blood also had alcohol levels at twice the legal limit.
“We understand there will be people in Anguilla who say Scott is running from a trial. That is 100 percent false,” his international lawyer Juliya Arbisman wrote in a statement on Monday. “There is nothing Scott wants more than to clear his name and get his life back. But he cannot clear his name if he is dead, or if the legal process by which he is bound is fundamentally biased and unjust.”
Widespread support
The support for Hapgood has spread beyond Darien with federal lawmakers and even President Donald Trump coming to his defense.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal was among about 100 people who gathered last month, rallying support for Hapgood outside of Darien Town Hall. Last week, Blumenthal and other federal lawmakers, including Sens. Chris Murphy, and Lindsey Graham, and U.S. Rep Jim Himes, sent a letter to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to express their concerns for Hapgood’s “safety and fair treatment.”
In a statement released Monday, Blumenthal said refusing to return to Anguilla was a “difficult decision” for the Hapgood family.
“This difficult decision was for the family to make, and only the family could fully assess the personal risks and uncertainties,” Blumenthal said. “I worked with Senate colleagues and the State Department in seeking to assure Scott Hapgood’s physical safety and fair, transparent legal proceedings. The State Department had discussions with British and Anguillan authorities. I continue to stand ready to help the Hapgood family in any appropriate way.”
Hapgood’s story was featured last month on Fox & Friends and Trump tweeted afterward that he would look into the case.
“Will be looking into the Scott Hapgood case, and the Island of Anguilla,” Trump tweeted. “Something looks and sounds very wrong. I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved!”
The family has released statements, thanking the president and federal lawmakers for their support in recent weeks.
Although we are all concerned about Scott’s safety in Anguilla, it is reassuring to have our government behind us in such a public and steadfast way,” the family said in a statement released last week after the letter was sent to Pompeo.

Texto completo: WMFE's space podcast "Are We There Yet?" is exploring a new frontier as a weekly radio series.
Space reporter Brendan Byrne will host the half-hour show at 6:30 p.m. Tuesdays, starting Nov. 12. It will air on 90.7 WMFE and sister station 89.5 WMFV in The Villages.
"For the first show, we'll be talking with retired NASA astronaut Nicole Stott about the milestone, all-female spacewalk," Bryne said. "What does this mean for gender diversity in the astronaut corps?"
On Nov. 19, the show will look at NASA's Voyager 2 mission. "It recently punched through the boundary of interstellar space after more than 40 years of flying through the solar system," Byrne said. "New York Times science reporter Kenneth Chang brings us up to speed on how the science is changing the way we think about our solar system."
The Nov. 26 show features author and SpaceX engineer Andrew Rader, who discusses the history of human exploration. The topic extends from the cavemen to the exploration of other worlds, Byrne said.
The radio show will air first, then be published as a podcast. "Subscribers to the podcast will get extra content like extended interviews from the on-air show and bonus guest interviews," Byrne said.
WMFE debuted "Are We There Yet?" in 2016, and Byrne has interviewed scientists, engineers, leaders and visionaries. The podcast has focused on Space Coast, NASA and private industry companies. It has listeners in 123 countries and about 35,000 episode downloads each month.
Byrne's space reporting has been heard frequently on NPR's "Morning Edition" and "All Things Considered."
"There's an appetite for space news here in Central Florida, and the move to the FM dial is a way to feed that appetite of our listeners' curiosity," Byrne said.
The program will feature listener questions in the segment "I'd Like to Know." Each week, Byrne will chat with UCF planetary scientists Josh Colwell, Addie Dove and Jim Cooney. Listeners can submit questions at AreWeThereYet@wmfe.org.
"Are We There Yet?" will air in the former time slot of "Friends Talking Faith." That series went on hiatus after the Rev. Bryan Fulwider, one of the hosts, was arrested last month on charges of sexual battery on a minor. Fulwider later took his life while out on bail.

Texto completo: Readers respond to Nicholas Kristof's column about the drop in those who identify as Christians in the United States.
To the Editor:
Re "Less and Less a Christian Nation," by Nicholas Kristof (column, Oct. 27):
The drop in those who identify as Christians in the United States is not a result of the non-politically correct views of some churches. The fact of the matter is that the mainline churches, which for the most part acquiesced to popular social trends, have had the greatest decrease in church attendance.
A 2017 article in The Washington Post speculated that if present trends continue, mainline churches have only 23 Easters left.
Thoughtful observers believe that although social issues are important, the lack of a transcendence is mainly responsible for the lack of church relevance to contemporary society.
The rise in "nones" for both Catholics and Protestants should be a wake-up call that the New Coke is not selling.
(Rev.) Michael P. Orsi
Naples, Fla.
The writer is a Catholic priest.
To the Editor:
I agree with Nicholas Kristof.
I grew up in a Christian home, and I continue to practice my faith even now that I am living on my own in college. I have heard the things Mr. Kristof mentions -- bigotry, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia -- and it breaks my heart because that is not how Christianity should be represented.
The problem is that most of the time people focus on the bad rather than on the good. It is true that some people who claim to be Christians are sexist, homophobic bigots, but the overwhelming majority are not.
The overwhelming majority follow a God who teaches love, grace and justice.
Audrey Blackwell
Chicago
To the Editor:
My husband and I, who are well into our 70s, couldn't agree more with Nicholas Kristof. Our turn from Christianity was before the advent of the blowhard evangelical preachers I had previously referred to as "those who give Christianity a bad name."
Their rise has strengthened our resolve not to be identified as Christian, but we easily meet the test of those who have done something in the last week of feeding the hungry and working for a more just, equitable and loving society.
Ann M. Black
Cincinnati
To the Editor:
Many Christians have lost credibility for failing to be inclusive and concerned about the poor, the environment and climate change, and for their support of gun rights and Donald Trump.
Nicholas Kristof's column is a call to the church to follow Jesus. We delude ourselves if we think that political views are either not related to Christianity or that only these extreme views can claim Christianity.

Klobuchar takes aim at Buttigieg

Texto completo: Says women in politics are likely to be held to 'a different standard'
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Sunday that women in politics are held to a higher standard than men, arguing that a female candidate with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's experience probably would not make it to the presidential debate stage.
Klobuchar's comments mark the latest instance of a 2020 presidential contender taking aim at Buttigieg, a newcomer on the national political stage whose ascent in the fundraising race and in polls for the Democratic nomination has taken many by surprise.
They also bring renewed attention to the hurdles female candidates face, following former vice president Joe Biden's description last week of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as 'angry' and antagonistic.
In an interview on CNN's 'State of the Union,' Klobuchar, who is serving her third term in the Senate, described herself as 'the one from the Midwest that's actually won in a statewide race over and over again,' adding, 'That's not true of Mayor Pete.'
A New York Times article on Saturday quoted Klobuchar as saying this summer that she doubts people would take any of the female presidential candidates seriously if they were running with the same qualifications as Buttigieg.
Klobuchar also recently declined to say whether she believes Buttigieg is qualified to be president, the Times reported.
Asked Sunday about those comments, Klobuchar clarified that she does believe Buttigieg is qualified but that she is the better candidate.
'The last point I made in that article was that, of the women on the stage " I'm focusing here on my fellow women senators, Senator Harris, Senator Warren and myself " do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don't. Maybe we're held to a different standard,' Klobuchar said on CNN.
Buttigieg's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the third quarter of the year, Buttigieg raised $19.1 million for his presidential bid, a haul that put him third behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who raised $25.3-million, and Warren, who raised $24.6 million. Klobuchar raised $4.8 million in the same period.
Recent polls show Buttigieg gaining ground on Biden, Warren and Sanders, particularly in Iowa, whose caucuses in February mark the first nominating contest of the 2020 primary race. Klobuchar has remained in the single digits.
The Minnesota Democrat's remarks come as Warren has also spoken out against what she views as a double standard against women on the campaign trail.
Last week, Biden accused Warren of holding an 'angry, unyielding viewpoint' " language that some decried as sexist.
Warren, who has typically pursued a strategy of ignoring her fellow Democrats' attacks, responded Friday, saying in an email to supporters, 'I'm angry and I own it.'
'Over and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry,' Warren said in the email. 'It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet.'

Texto completo: Today is Sunday, Nov. 10, the 314th day of 2019. There are 51 days left in the year.
Today’s Highlights in History:
On Nov. 10, 1938, Kate Smith first sang Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America” on her CBS radio program.
On this date:
In 1775, the U.S. Marines were organized under authority of the Continental Congress.
In 1944, during World War II, the ammunition ship USS Mount Hood (AE-11) exploded while moored at the Manus Naval Base in the Admiralty Islands in the South Pacific, leaving 45 confirmed dead and 327 missing and presumed dead.
In 1954, the U.S. Marine Corps Memorial, depicting the raising of the American flag on Iwo Jima in 1945, was dedicated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in Arlington, Virginia.
In 1969, the children’s educational program “Sesame Street” made its debut on National Educational Television (later PBS).
In 1975, the U.N. General Assembly approved a resolution equating Zionism with racism (the world body repealed the resolution in December 1991).
In 1982, the newly finished Vietnam Veterans Memorial was opened to its first visitors in Washington, D.C., three days before its dedication. Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev died at age 75.
In 2017, facing allegations of sexual misconduct, comedian Louis C.K. said the harassment claims by five women that were detailed in a New York Times report “are true,” and he expressed remorse for using his influence “irresponsibly.”
Ten years ago: John Allen Muhammad, mastermind of the 2002 sniper attacks that killed 10 in the Washington, D.C. region, was executed.
Five years ago: President Barack Obama, at the start of a visit to Beijing, announced the United States and China would start granting visas to each other’s citizens valid for up to a decade.
One year ago: President Donald Trump, in France to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, canceled a visit to a cemetery east of Paris where Americans killed in that war are buried; rainy weather had grounded the presidential helicopter.

Texto completo: Machine learning algorithms have quietly seeped into the world of health care, to the point that automated systems sometimes make life-or-death decisions. The trend seems inevitable as medicine becomes more complex and costly. But there are downsides.
Last month, for example, researchers found a substantial racial bias in an algorithm that decides who needs extra care to avoid costly emergency room visits. This may seem surprising, given that the algorithm didn’t take any racial data into consideration. But it did rely on historical data, and there’s racism embedded in history, as well as fallible human assumptions that inevitably go into the making of algorithms and interpretation of their output.
Government and private insurance programs are increasingly adopting algorithms and artificial intelligence to predict our future health care needs. Last spring, at a conference, Harvard Law professor Jonathan Zittrain compared artificial intelligence to asbestos. “It turns out that it’s all over the place, even though at no point did you explicitly install it,” he said. And by the time we recognize any potential dangers, it’s hard to remove.
In the paper on racial bias, published in the Oct. 25 issue of Science, the researchers wrote that they had access to additional data, including the self-reported race of people in the database. And what they found was that those who identified as black were much less likely to be included in the group targeted for extra care than white patients of similar health status.
The system was created with good intentions, said lead author Ziad Obermeyer, a health policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley. It was adopted in conjunction with the Affordable Care Act to direct medical attention to those most in need, thus both avoiding pain and suffering and saving money.
The race problem isn’t rooted in the algorithm itself, but in the way people have used it. The algorithm was predicting not future health status but future health costs, using data on people’s past health costs.
But patients who identify as black have historically received less health care than patients of equal health status who identify as white. The system was therefore less likely to flag black patients as eligible for extra preventive care, simply because less had been spent on their health care in the past. The crux of the problem was in the assumption that health needs were equal to health costs.
This same sort of bias has been found in algorithms used in the criminal justice system. There, the problem also stems from the fact that they don’t predict what people think they predict. Though advertised as predicting future crime, it is more accurate to say they predict future arrests. And yet, there is a growing body of evidence that racial bias affects who gets stopped by police, who gets arrested and whose charges are more likely to be dropped.
Writing a commentary to accompany the health algorithm paper, Princeton African American Studies professor Ruha Benjamin illustrated the problem with a stark hypothetical case involving the real historical figure Henrietta Lacks. In the real story, Lacks came to Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s with symptoms of cervical cancer. She was sent to what was known as the Negro ward, where her care was cheaper. She ultimately died from the disease.
In the hypothetical case, with a machine in charge, the same bias would be encoded, because the algorithm would use cost as a proxy for health, and would misinterpret her past low health care costs. “On the basis of those results, she would be discharged, her health would deteriorate, and by the time she returns, the cancer has spread and she dies.”
Benjamin wrote that she’s concerned that most algorithms used in health care, housing and employment aren’t transparent, and so it could be impossible for researchers to find what might be substantial racial biases. Obermeyer, the lead author of the study, said that the case they researched was unique in that the algorithm was public, along with all the data on the patients, as well as the additional data on race and health conditions.
He was able to fix the algorithm so that it measured health rather than health costs - and as a result, the number of self-identified black patients deemed eligible for additional care doubled.
Getting rid of algorithms altogether isn’t practical, and could cause more harm than good. In a 2017 commentary for the New England Journal of Medicine, Obermeyer wrote that medicine had become far too complex for the human mind to handle without the help of machines.
What we could work to improve is the lack of transparency. The complexity of the human body is nothing compared to the complexity of the health care billing codes, which have spawned an industry of experts in using them to maximize billing. Something as simple as weighing a patient during an office visit, or, more ominously, prescribing opioids, can drive up billing, as physician and former drug executive Mike MaGee writes in his book, “Code Blue: Inside America’s Medical Industrial Complex.”
In 2016, when I wrote about crime algorithms that were already being used in Philadelphia, one of the creators of the system, University of Pennsylvania Professor Richard Berk, worried that people would put too much faith in its predictions. The danger in mixing medicine and algorithms might also lie in the trust that algorithms engender, creating a false picture of simplicity, efficiency and objectivity that papers over a system that’s inherently convoluted, overpriced and unfair.

Texto completo: After October 2018's deadly shooting, Bari Weiss wrote several moving pieces about her childhood experiences in the Tree of Life synagogue for The New York Times where she's a writer and editor. She then spent a year writing "How to Fight Anti-Semitism," a slim book in which she defines her opponent as "an ever-morphing conspiracy theory in which Jews play the starring role in spreading evil."
Ms. Weiss argues that growing global inequality poses a risk to Jews, whom populists are eager to blame for economic downturns and crises. In the conclusion, Ms. Weiss provides useful strategies for confronting anti-Semitism. Throughout, Ms. Weiss expertly explains how Jews often "occupy the duplicitous middle"; they appear white yet frustrate white supremacists because they are "slavishly loyal to those at the bottom."
'Slavishly' is a clumsy word choice, but there isn't time to parse adverbs when there are, unfortunately, more pressing problems in this sloppy book about the evil that has quite recently terrorized our city.
I'm uneasy writing that last sentence. I recognize that many readers - particularly younger ones - may find this book to be an important introduction to an overlooked chronology. For Ms. Weiss, the shooting served as a wake-up call, revealing that "I had spent much of my life on a holiday from history."
The problem is that Ms. Weiss is very much on holiday throughout this book. She regularly directs readers elsewhere ("Others far wiser and more knowledgeable than I have written books about .," "Many others can give you chapter and verse ."). A generous interpretation is that she's providing a syllabus, although she infrequently names or quotes from these authors.
The more you read, the more you realize she has an allergy to context. Jeremy Corbyn has transformed the British Labour Party "into a hub of Jew hatred," but Ms. Weiss doesn't explain how. In Oslo, "a rapper asked if there were any Jews in the crowd" before disparaging them, and that's the entirety of the setup: "a rapper." She writes as though she wants her arguments to be un-Google-able.
Let me emphasize: This history is vital. The book is accessible. It wants to be read alongside Ta-Nehisi Coates' "Between the World and Me" and Valeria Luiselli's "Tell Me How it Ends: An Essay in Forty Questions."
But whereas Mr. Coates can lean on his experience as a reporter and memoirist when describing black parenthood, and whereas Ms. Luiselli can rely on her experiences as a novelist and translator when depicting the immigration crisis, Ms. Weiss lacks a go-to move. The result is a book that reads like op-eds stitched together with Wikipedia (consecutive paragraphs start "In 1984.," "In 1999.," "On April 28, 2000."). Structurally, her repeated "Anti-Zionists will say." line starts to sound like a Jeff Foxworthy bit about rednecks.
Worse yet, Ms. Weiss is alarmingly eager to simplify issues rather than explore their complexity. Take this question: Was President Trump culpable for the political atmosphere that produced Robert Bowers, the accused murderer of 11 Jews at Tree of Life last year?
The answer was "yes" for the thousands who marched in Squirrel Hill after the shooting to protest the president's visit. It was "yes" for the tens of thousands who signed an online petition arguing that the violence was "a direct culmination" of the president's influence. Ditto 72% of Jewish respondents in a J Street survey taken a week after the shooting.
It would be reasonable to counter that it's hard to draw a straight line between ideas and actions, between atmosphere and event, particularly with the internet filtering every social transaction.
But Ms. Weiss manages to avoid this debate entirely. She instead explores a literal reading of the president's post-shooting commentary, suggesting that he gave "a full-throated condemnation of the act, which revealed an understanding of anti-Semitism." She entertains the notion that because Mr. Bowers wrote about his displeasure with the president, the president and the political atmosphere he created cannot be considered an influence in his behavior.
Perplexingly, Ms. Weiss writes these paragraphs from the vaguely "imagined" perspective of "Trump-supporting Jews." So: None of those bad takes are technically "hers." It's a mystifying move, all in the name of avoiding extended interaction with a quoted human perspective.
It's worth noting that Jewish writers have published outstanding criticism of this book. I'd advise tracking down reviews from Talia Lavin, Jordan Weissmann and Judith Butler. They all admirably grapple with a tricky paradox: No Jew should ever be labeled as having a "disproportionate" response to anti-Semitism . yet each writer cannot ignore that Ms. Weiss' text regularly invites a form of this critique.

Texto completo: Send questions about the office, money, careers and work-life balance to workfriend@nytimes.com . Include your name and location, even if you want them withheld. Letters may be edited.
Good morning! It's me and I'm here: your new Work Friend, assembled from the frantically selected parts of expired Work Friends. Choire Sicha's blog-hardened heart; Megan Greenwell's Millennial fortitude; Katy Lederer's unorthodox spelling of "Katie" -- all are united in the hideous yet undeniably proportionate form of me, a Millennial former blogger named Caity.
Like the monster of Victor Frankenstein's creation, I have spent years learning to be human by eavesdropping and spying on strangers at work -- and occasionally enumerating all my complaints in dramatic personal confrontations. As the creature beseeched his creator for a mate, so do I know what it is to simultaneously resent and remain beholden to a supervisor. The moment the doctor achieved his objective, he fled from his responsibility; several of my own bosses have lacked formal management training because of the deeply disorganized nature of media promotions.
For the next six months, I will confidently answer your questions without betraying the true depraved depths of my innermost thoughts -- a skill I honed as a fitting-room attendant at Marshalls. I will analyze your co-worker disputes with the panache of one who has made lifelong companions and enemies both in offices and while working from home. I will prise you from the rigor-mortis grip of your anxieties and tell you what time of day to email people. (8:50 a.m. Prewrite the email the day before and schedule a delayed send.) (Contact me if you don't know how.) As Frankenstein's dæmon famously menaced him, I will even "be with you on your wedding-night" -- provided your wedding night is directly relevant to some employment conundrum.
All I ask in return is that you submit questions about your real-life life to workfriend@nytimes.com.
Phantom Dread
I've recently started a contract position with the opportunity for eventual full-time employment. My previous contract consisted of short-term assignments with weeks or months of no work at all, and this new position has minimum quotas for daily production.
I had a panic attack, complete with puking in the lav. How do I relax and do my work in those moments when I think I don't measure up? I believe my work is fine.
-- C.P., Illinois
When I feel anxious, I draw comfort from the high probability that our planet will one day be engulfed by the sun.
But let's analyze your situation through the lens of a biological truth: Humans hate change.
You got so nervous about starting a new job that you threw up. Not ideal, but also not unheard-of. Humans hate change so much that sometimes the sheer fear of it makes our bodies go haywire. This is why we are all unfit for work of any kind.
As for your unease about the future, let's assume the worst: that you are a terrible worker, totally unfit for the job, who should be fired immediately. The odds you will be are low, because humans hate change. Not only would the bosses have to cast about for your replacement, and do that person's new hire paperwork, and process your outgoing paperwork -- they would also have to fire you, which is an unpleasant activity many cowards will go out of their way to avoid.
You say you believe your work is fine, but worry about negative thoughts. Listen to me -- the words you are reading right now? I hate them. I regret my decision to select these specific ones from the rich English lexicon and am embarrassed at the idiotic way I have chosen to arrange them into these sentences. My worst possible fate is being buried alive while also burning to death slowly, and the second worst is hearing someone read these paragraphs back to me aloud. But the fact is, they're probably fine. (By which I mean they're definitely terrible, but the average person will probably think that they're fine, because the only person on Earth who actually understands what is good is me, which is an awful burden to have.)
If you can overcome your self-doubt enough to say you believe your work is fine, there's a good chance it's actually better than fine. If it's not, fine is good enough in most cases. It's not your job to tell yourself you aren't doing well; it's your bosses' job, and they are paid more money than you are to do it.

An ex-employee of the company where I work is under consideration for a new job at a wonderful place. He is a perfect fit for the position. The problem is that the hiring manager at the new job is calling around, asking why the ex-employee left in the first place. The actual answer is that someone in management, who subsequently left, simply hated his guts. There is no real way to reveal that without ignoring the informal company norm of simply verifying that he worked here from date X to date Y. What is the ethical thing to do?
-- Anonymous
If the most blisteringly honest thing you can say about someone is that they would be a perfect fit for a wonderful company, you have no ethical obligation to keep this secret from the world. I make it a point to say kind things about people behind their backs. It promotes a feel-good atmosphere and, if word ever gets back to them, I assume I look like a hero and that they can't stop crying.
Whether the call is for basic due diligence or an attempt to dig up dirt (by a wonderful company?), you can reasonably respond to it with something like, "I remember him fondly. He worked here from date X to date Y," and maybe top it off with your observation that this job sounds like a great fit. It's possible to both remain professional and do him a good turn without sharing the plotlines of your workplace's psychological melodramas. These should be emailed directly to me at workfriend@nytimes.com.

Texto completo: A federal judge rejected U.S. Soccer's argument that no discrimination existed. Megan Rapinoe praised the decision as a validation of their campaign.
The judge overseeing the United States women's national soccer team's gender discrimination lawsuit against U.S. Soccer granted the players class status on Friday, an important victory for the women that appeared to support the claim that they are subjected to unequal working conditions and unequal pay when they played games for their country.
The players had sought class-action status in September by arguing that the working conditions and compensation they were contesting applied not only to the 28 named plaintiffs, but also to any woman who had appeared in a national team camp or game over the multiyear period specified in the suit.
Friday's ruling by the judge, R. Gary Klausner of United States District Court for the Central District of California, drew no conclusions on whether the players' allegations against the federation were true, or whether U.S. Soccer had acted in violation of federal law; it merely noted that the players had sufficiently met the burden to be treated as a class rather than as individuals.
The players have been making their case for equal pay from U.S. Soccer for several years, as the leading edge in a wider fight by female athletes -- not just in soccer -- for equal treatment. In track and field, the Olympians Alysia Montaño, Kara Goucher and Allyson Felix disclosed to The New York Times that they had faced reduced compensation from their shoe sponsors for having children. Their revelations led Nike to adjust some of its policies.
In women's soccer, the world's best player, Ada Hegerberg of Norway, skipped last summer's Women's World Cup in part to protest what she said was her federation's lack of support for the women's program. And just this week, Australia's men's and women's teams reached a landmark deal that guaranteed the teams equal shares of revenue, though not equal compensation over all.
American players initially took on U.S. Soccer through a wage-discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and later in their gender-discrimination lawsuit. Friday's ruling was received by the players as the clearing an important legal hurdle and as a validation of their equal-pay campaign, according to Megan Rapinoe, one of the team's captains and a plaintiff in the lawsuit.
"Sometimes it's just nice for someone to say, 'I believe you and I am validating what you've been saying,"' Rapinoe said in a telephone interview. "We have an internal belief in what we're doing. But to have someone, and in this case someone very important in this case, say, 'I believe what you're saying,' is very important."
In granting class status, the judge effectively rejected U.S. Soccer's argument that, because many of the women had earned more than the top-earning men's players over that period, there could be no discrimination under federal law.
"Defendant cites no case law to support this premise," Klausner wrote in his decision.
Klausner went even further, though, writing that agreeing with U.S. Soccer's argument defending the current pay structure could yield an "absurd result" in which a woman could be paid half as much as a man as long as she overcame the disparity by working twice as many hours.
"Nice try," Rapinoe said acidly of the federation's argument. "No one bought it."
U.S. Soccer did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the judge's decision. It has argued from the beginning, both publicly and in court filings, that any differences in compensation between the men's and women's national teams are the result of differing pay structures in the collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the players on each team.
One immediate result of Friday's ruling is that it could push U.S. Soccer and the players to restart efforts to find an out-of-court resolution to the lawsuit. When federation's president, Carlos Cordeiro, introduced the new coach of the women's national team at a news conference in New York late last month, he strongly hinted that he would be open to such a resolution.
"I'd say we're still very committed to resolving this, and in a fair way," he said, adding, "Give us some more time, but that's where were hopefully headed, in that direction."
In August, Klausner had surprised both sides by setting a May 2020 trial date, an accelerated timeline that could see the team's bid for equal pay become entangled with its preparations for next summer's Tokyo Olympics.
Rapinoe would not say if the players would be open to a new round of mediation after a first attempt failed in August, but she would not rule it out, either.
'We're the only team they can have, they're the only federation we can have," she said, "I mean, everybody's here. If the conversation can move forward, if we get further along in the process, potentially we can get back together. But we're going to need to see quite a bit more."

Texto completo: What to Watch This Weekend
SOCCER Major League Soccer's season wraps up on Sunday with M.L.S. Cup. It is a familiar pairing: Seattle and Toronto, who faced off in the final in 2016 and 2017, each winning one title. This time, the game will be in Seattle, and that might be enough to give the Sounders the edge (Sunday, 3 p.m., ABC). Earlier, it is first versus second in the Premier League as Liverpool hosts Manchester City (11:30 a.m., NBCSN). A game that is just as big on Saturday in Germany: Borussia Dortmund's visit to Bayern Munich in Der Klassiker (12:30 p.m., FS2).
COLLEGE FOOTBALL In a late-season battle of unbeatens, Louisiana State, No. 2 in the initial College Football Playoff rankings, meets No. 3 Alabama in Tuscaloosa (3:30 p.m., CBS). It could be a battle of quarterbacks, with Tua Tagovailoa of Alabama, returning from an ankle sprain, against Joe Burrow of L.S.U.
N.F.L. The unbeaten 49ers play Monday night, and the Patriots, who lost for the first time this season last week, have a bye. That leaves a slightly less attractive slate than usual, with only two Sunday games, Panthers-Packers (4:25 p.m., Fox) and Vikings-Cowboys (8:20 p.m., NBC), featuring two teams with winning records.
TENNIS The year-end ATP Finals begin Sunday, and the eight singles players who qualified represent the driving story line in men's tennis: the Big Three (Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer) vs. the Kids. Four players age 23 or younger, including Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Matteo Berrettini, are in the event for the first time. Djokovic opens play on Sunday against Berrettini (9 a.m., Tennis Channel); Federer faces Dominic Thiem later (3 p.m., Tennis Channel).
AUTO RACING Martin Truex Jr. and Kevin Harvick have clinched spots to contend for the NASCAR title next weekend. The other two spots will be claimed Sunday in Phoenix (2:30 p.m., NBC).
ONE MORE WATCH In yoga, where sweaty bodies mix in tight spaces, what sort of touching is considered O.K., and what is not? "The Weekly," The New York Times's TV show, explores the grayest of gray areas on FX (10 p.m. Sunday) and Hulu (available Monday).
Times are Eastern.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Nike Vows Inquiry in New Salazar Abuse Claims

Texto completo: Several elite runners said they had similar struggles with body shaming and should have done more to support Cain at the Nike Oregon Project under Salazar.
Nike said on Friday it would investigate the "deeply troubling" allegations of emotional and physical abuse made by Mary Cain against its Oregon Project, a distance-running training program.
In a video for The New York Times Opinion, published on Thursday, Cain accused the project's director, the marathon great Alberto Salazar, of repeatedly urging her to lose weight to unhealthy levels.
Salazar was recently suspended for four years for antidoping violations, and the Nike Oregon Project was shut down. Salazar has denied giving athletes performance-enhancing drugs.
Nike also said in a statement that "Mary was seeking to rejoin the Oregon Project and Alberto's team as recently as April of this year and had not raised these concerns as part of that process."
Cain was a high school middle distance phenom from New York, qualifying for the Olympic Trials in 2012 at 16. Later that year, she began training with Salazar and continued to do so until 2015. Her later performances on the track did not match her early promise.
In the video, Cain, 23, accused Salazar of shaming her in front of others on the team when she did not reach the required weight targets. She said that her low weight caused her to miss her period for three years, leading to lower levels of estrogen and five broken bones.
She also said that she had suicidal thoughts and cut herself, but that no one at Nike "really did anything or said anything."
Salazar replied to Cain's video in a statement to The Oregonian: "Neither of her parents, nor Mary, raised any of the issues that she now suggests occurred while I was coaching her. To be clear, I never encouraged her, or worse yet, shamed her, to maintain an unhealthy weight."
In a Twitter message on Friday morning, Cain acknowledged that she had sought to reconnect with Salazar.
"I wanted closure, wanted an apology for never helping me when I was cutting, and in my own, sad, never-fully healed heart, wanted Alberto to still take me back," she wrote. "I still loved him. Because when we let people emotionally break us, we crave more than anything their very approval."
"We quickly fell out of touch this summer," she added, "and that made the rose color glasses finally fall off. He didn't care about me as a person; only as the product, the performer, the athlete."
Cain received support on social media from other runners.
"I had no idea it was this bad," tweeted Shalane Flanagan, the 2017 New York City Marathon winner. "I'm so sorry, @runmarycain that I never reached out to you when I saw you struggling. I made excuses to myself as to why I should mind my own business. We let you down. I will never turn my head again."
Amy Yoder Begley, a former American Olympian, tweeted that she was kicked out of the Oregon Project after finishing sixth in the 10,000 meters at the United States track and field championships.
"I was told I was too fat and 'had the biggest butt on the starting line,"' she wrote, "This brings those painful memories back."
Kara Goucher, another American Olympian who used to train with the Oregon Project, said on Twitter, "I have stories to match all of Mary's claims and so much more."

Uber’s CEO Really, Really, Really Doesn’t Like WeWork Comparisons

Texto completo: It seems everyone is distancing their business models from WeWork these days. And it’s not just real estate unicorns like Compass out to prove their sound strategy.
During The New York Times ‘ DealBook conference on Wednesday, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi discussed the fate of unprofitable tech unicorns, where at one point he stressed his company’s differences from the We Company.
SEE ALSO: Uber Money Is Company’s Latest Attempt at Profitability
Khosrowshahi spoke of investors’ shifting expectations of over-valued startups going public in 2019. Like the We Co., Uber is also a money-losing unicorn with major backing by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. However, when interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin asked if Uber’s IPO in May helped it avoid WeWork’s fate, Khosrowshahi insisted that the two companies’ business models are incomparable.
“We are very, very, very different from WeWork,” Khosrowshahi said with a laugh during the interview. “Fundamentally the rideshare market is of scale, is global, is an attractive business and it’s only going to get better in a competitive market.”
The interview took place just days after Uber’s Q3 earnings revealed another quarter marred with $1.16 billion in net losses. Though in the company’s defense, the figure was lower than analysts’ expectations of $1.45 billion but caused a subsequent drop in the company’s already-struggling shares.
Following the earnings report release, Khosrowshahi assured investors that Uber is on its way to profitability. However, the rideshare company’s week continued to worsen with the news that Uber is still using self-driving startup Waymo’s technology, which was stolen by a former executive working for both companies four years ago.
During the conference interview, Khosrowshahi also said that the pressure to turn a profit has prompted Uber to pick up the slack after years of burning cash and to “perform better.”
It’s unclear how long the road will be for Uber. But as the comparisons to WeWork continue, the unicorn will need to stabilize its earnings and thus, stock value, in order to impress the public markets.

Texto completo: With his expected late entry to the Democratic presidential primary, Michael Bloomberg hopes that he can find success by breaking campaign norms — something that fellow wealthy businessman President Trump proved was possible during his 2016 campaign.
But that may not be so easy for Bloomberg, New York City's mayor for 12 years starting in 2002, and a multi-billionaire through his eponymous financial services information and news company.
While Trump built a new coalition and subverted traditional Republican policy messaging with his combative personality, he entered the race relatively early and spent many months building campaign infrastructure before the first primary contests.
“Trump behaves in an unconventional way and frankly, unacceptable, but he ran a traditional campaign. He competed in a pretty traditional way,” said Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh.
Bloomberg, 77, has the money to build a campaign team before the Feb. 3rd Iowa caucuses but little time to do so. And without 200,000 unique donors, he would not qualify for the December primary debate, a threshold that may increase for future debates. Bloomberg might not accept campaign contributions, according to Axios.
Bloomberg, unlike Trump, also has a conventional political background and history of supporting within liberal advocacy groups.
“He was a mayor for 12 years. He has a long track record of funding and leadership on a variety of public policy issues,” said Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democrat Network and New Policy Institute. “He's not an outsider businessman. He's already made the transition to being a politician a long time ago.”

That history could be a liability for liberal activists energized by drastically changing political and economic structures. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls — including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has proposed a wealth tax on ultra-millionaires and billionaires — have condemned a potential Bloomberg run and accused him of trying to buy the presidency.
Bloomberg, though, appears to be hoping to capture more moderate voters. Last month, he reportedly indicated he would consider a presidential bid if former Vice President Joe Biden appeared unable to win.
A New York Times/Siena College poll of Democrats in six key battleground states released Friday found voters preferred a centrist candidate who could work across the aisle with Republicans. The survey suggests the 2020 Democratic primary field is fertile ground for a Bloomberg-like contender as pundits question the durability of Biden’s campaign.
Bloomberg’s history and influence could provide a boost to his candidacy.
“He is a far more formidable politician than people really understand,” Rosenberg said. “He might surprise people with the amount of support he gets from allied groups and other politicians in the early stages.”
But Marsh said that Bloomberg’s approach of swooping in to pick up support from a faltering Biden and other less liberal candidates like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker is “flawed.”
“That's now how the process works. And it's not where the Democratic primary and the party is today,” Marsh said.
Other candidates have spent months appealing to voters in early primary and caucus states, where election results can quickly change the course of the primary. A March Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll found Bloomberg with a negative 11% net favorability rating among likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa.
“He is not a great fit for these early states, and he's gonna have a lot of work to do to succeed there,” Rosenberg said.

SAFE Banking Act shouldn't harm children

Texto completo: The marijuana industry is lobbying hard for the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act (SAFE) of 2019. Its stated purpose is “to increase public safety by ensuring access to financial services to cannabis-related legitimate businesses.”
The bill’s supporters say it will increase safety for marijuana businesses that now rely on cash because, while some states have legalized marijuana, it remains illegal under federal law.
No one would argue against supporting the safety of employees at marijuana businesses. What’s been lost in the congressional debate over the bill so far, however, is the safety of children.
We have seen the damage when an industry gets ahead of the regulators. Currently, there are over 2,050 cases of lung injury and 39 deaths in the vaping epidemic. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that “most patients report using THC-containing products.” The vaping deaths include a 17-year-old boy, and CNN reported on an 18-year-old who doctors said now has lungs like “a 70-year-old’s."
Passing such an expansive marijuana bill seems premature. Yet, should Congress take this major step towards legitimizing the marijuana industry, as this bill would do, now is the time to build in safeguards to limit marijuana’s known harms to children.
One of the major stories about legal, commercial marijuana is the dramatic increase in the potency of today’s marijuana products — and the implications that has for the health of today’s youth. THC is marijuana’s main psychoactive chemical, and it poses significant risks to youth whose brains are still developing.
U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams has warned, “Recent increases in access to marijuana and in its potency, along with misperceptions of safety of marijuana endanger our most precious resource, our nation’s youth.”
In Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, commercial sales launched a THC arms race with exponentially rising potency levels.
THC potency nationally averaged around 2% in the 1980s and about 3.8% in the 1990s, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
Colorado reports that marijuana concentrates have increased to an average of 68.6% THC, and flower strains can now exceed 34% THC, according to High Times magazine.
The risk of vaping to teens is especially worrisome because the new marijuana products are easily concealed from parents and educators. One high-THC product in Colorado looks like an asthma relief inhaler, and others include powders dissolved in water bottles.
Colorado’s most recent survey of youth found an increase in children using marijuana edibles, vaping, and dabbing, a method of smoking ultra-potent THC resin. The survey shows that, while marijuana stores can’t sell to youth, teens are getting marijuana from an informal network of dealers, friends, and family.
Colorado’s youth health statistics are becoming increasingly worrisome, as well. Colorado youth suicide rates are now nearly double the national average, with THC being the number one substance found in toxicology reports of youth ages 10-19.
Because of the risks of ultra-potent marijuana, as documented by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, who ate a marijuana edible and “lay curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours,” there’s a common recommendation by the marijuana industry to “start low, go slow.”
That sensible approach should also apply as Congress considers banking legislation.
The SAFE Banking Act will help marijuana industry investors make a lot more money. As any negotiator knows, it’s when one party wants something that it is most willing to compromise. In this case, Congress can demand key safeguards for children that the industry has so far resisted.
That should include an amendment that limits the SAFE Banking Act to products that fall below a specific THC potency level and that have complied with adequate testing, labeling, and consumer safety standards. As more research on THC’s impact on the brain becomes available, Congress could revisit the potency limit.
As we’ve learned with the vaping epidemic when the proliferation of radically new products gets ahead of the research and regulations, terrible health consequences result.
As Congress considers the SAFE Banking Act, let’s make sure children have a voice, too. After all, they only have one chance to grow up.
Diane Carlson is Co-Founder and National Policy Director of Smart Colorado, the only nonprofit organization focused on protecting the health, safety, and well-being of youth as marijuana becomes increasingly available and commercialized.

Eddie Murphy's Raw Capitalism; His new movie is vulgar but it captures the creative spirit of small business.

Texto completo: Eddie Murphy's Netflix movie, "Dolemite Is My Name," is not family entertainment. The language is relentlessly vulgar and the real-life 1970s entertainer Rudy Ray Moore portrayed by Mr. Murphy contributed to a coarsening of culture and the promotion of negative stereotypes. Yet in this story of a washed-up, broke singer who wills himself into the movie industry, we have the rare Hollywood product that captures the spirit of entrepreneurial creativity.
Especially in a political and media climate which too often presents market competition as a scheme dominated by cartoonish oligarchs, this is the story of the ambitious small business dreamers who make the economy go.
Calling Mr. Moore a "D.I.Y. comedy pioneer," Reggie Ugwu wrote in the New York Times in September:
Rudy Ray Moore was, if nothing else, self-made. Self-made in the conventional, entrepreneurial sense — born in Arkansas on the eve of the Great Depression, he would traverse the unforgiving worlds of stand-up comedy, blaxploitation film and early hip-hop before his death in 2008. But also self-made in that other, less venerated way, common among certain figures who become legendary in show business: He was a brazen author of his own mythology.
Mr. Moore certainly had to sell himself. No one else would. And aggressive self-promotion was just about all he had. Yet he managed to publish his own comedy records before producing his own film. Recently in the Times, Aisha Harris described Mr. Moore's remarkable ability to ignore all the sensible reasons not to attempt a cinematic career:
Rudy, undeterred by changing tastes or his own lack of filmmaking experience, decides to self-finance and self-produce his movie. And thus "Dolemite" is born, a low-budget production about a pimp/nightclub owner featuring the three key things Rudy wants to see in a movie: nudity, comedy and kung-fu...
Rudy doesn't exactly have the talent or expertise, but he pulls together a cast and crew through his sharp enterprising skills — their soundstage, a rundown former hotel that is now a drug den, is procured for free when Rudy strikes a deal with the owner to remove the addicts camped out in the building. His ability to make something out of nothing proves to be his greatest asset.
Mr. Moore begins sleeping in the former hotel to avoid the necessity of rent payments and uses his comedy recordings as collateral to borrow just enough money to complete the picture.
This compelling story of independent filmmaking will likely resonate with anyone who's ever worked at a start-up of any kind. Perhaps movie producers will now consider telling the stories of creative gumption occurring every day in other industries.

The Climate of Bloomberg
Speaking of socially liberal but relatively fiscally conservative self-made men, Michael Bloomberg may soon be presenting himself as the moderate in the Democratic presidential race. To have a hope of making the sale with voters, he'll need to express that moderation in his economic agenda.
His entry into the race could bring a needed counterweight in Democratic debates lately dominated by anti-market extremism. But it may be pointless if Mr. Bloomberg intends to offer yet another multi-trillion-dollar climate plan premised on a radical overhaul of U.S. industry. In June of this year, Mr. Bloomberg's eponymous news service published an adaptation of his address to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology class of 2019. It didn't sound all that moderate:
We know how to power buildings using the sun and wind; how to power vehicles using batteries charged with renewable energy; how to power factories and industry using hydrogen and fuel cells... Yes, all of those power sources need to be brought to scale — and that will require further scientific innovation. But the question isn't, "How do we tackle climate change?" The question is, "Why the hell are we moving so slowly?"
... Our goal is to move the U.S. toward a 100% clean energy economy as expeditiously as possible, beginning right now...We will push states and utilities to phase out every last U.S. coal-fired power plant by 2030... We will work to stop the construction of new gas plants.
***
Message from Foreign Investors: America First The Trump political style is even less popular overseas than it is in the United States. But the substance of U.S. prosperity in the Trump era has made the country more popular than ever by one very important measure. The Journal's Steven Russolillo reports:
Even with U.S. stocks rallying back to all-time highs, adding to the longest bull market on record, many foreign investors feel they have no choice but to pile in.
... U.S. stocks remain appealing, despite rich valuations, because of brighter domestic growth prospects than other developed economies, a strong labor market and solid consumer spending, global investors say... Foreign private holdings of U.S. stocks hit a record high of $7.7 trillion as of July, the most recent data available, according to Treasury Department figures. The data for foreign funds excludes holdings from sovereign-wealth funds and central banks, meaning overall international holdings are likely substantially higher.

Texto completo: Mary Anne Fidati Eggleston, 76, of Waverly, enjoyed great success in her life as a gifted entrepreneur, generous philanthropist and was a respected businesswoman in Northeast Pennsylvania for decades.
She worked tirelessly as a director/vice president at Pagnotti Enterprises and its subsidiary companies where she played an integral role in re-energizing and revitalizing the businesses that her grandfather, Louis Pagnotti Sr., founded in 1934. In addition, her entrepreneurial footprint lives on today in the water filtration industry at both Carbon Sales Inc. and the Unifilt Corp., where she was both a founder and corporate officer.
Born in Scranton on July 29, 1943, she was the daughter of the late F. Robert and Marie Pagnotti Fidati.
Mary Anne graduated from Marywood Seminary and attended Wheeling College, Wheeling, W.Va.
Mary Anne passed away Oct. 5 at Allied Skilled Nursing following a courageous battle with cancer.
Mary Anne was involved in a number of local organizations, sat on numerous boards and participated in philanthropic efforts throughout her life. A true pioneer, she was one of the first women to be admitted to the Westmoreland Club, Wilkes-Barre, and was a founding board member at the Luzerne Foundation. Mary Anne was a board member at King’s College, where she was instrumental in the formation of the King’s College Family Business Forum and also sat on the board at Friendship House. She was an original Everhart Museum board member when the community board was formed, played a significant part in the restoration of the mineral exhibit at the museum and was recognized as the honoree in 2015 at the Everhart Museum Summer Solstice event.
Mary Anne is survived by her son and daughter-in-law, Bubba and Tracy Eggleston, and her two grandchildren, Elle and Brett, around whom her world revolved. She is also survived by her sister, Judy Fidati Haudenschield, and Jeff Haudenschield and their two sons, David and Christopher. Judy truly considered Mary Anne to be both a sister and mother to her, as David and Christopher fondly thought of her more as their grandmother than as their aunt. They were her closest relatives living locally and were a primary reason she fought so hard to survive.
Even during her time at Allied, she still always looked forward to being a part of as many milestones as possible in the lives of her family and her businesses. She cherished her friends from near and far, and always loved sharing stories about the fun times she had enjoyed throughout her life with her cousins.
Strongly influenced by her grandfather, Louis Pagnotti Sr., and his larger than life personality, she was a dynamic woman who was determined in business, yet even incredibly more caring and sensitive in her family life. She had a realistic way of looking at the world and her intuitive ability to quickly judge people’s characters was truly amazing and always spot-on. Some of her greatest pleasures were her time with family, gourmet cooking, reading the Sunday edition of The New York Times and watching college and professional football. She was an avid Penn State fan.
We appreciate the superior efforts of the staff at Allied Services and of her caregivers, Kathy, Keith and Melissa, who offered personal attention, compassion and love to Mary Anne over the last few years.
In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Mary Anne’s honor to Project Koru at https://secure.givelively
.org/donate/project-koru/mary-anne-eggleston
-memorial, the Everhart Museum, The Fund for Luzerne County at The Luzerne Foundation, or a charity of your choice.
Please join us in a celebration of Mary Anne’s life to be held at 10 a.m. Saturday at Glenmaura National Golf Club, 100 Glenmaura National Blvd., Moosic.

Citrus County was wrong to block NYT

Texto completo: The freedom to read and access information and ideas from diverse viewpoints are essential to creating a society of informed citizens. Public libraries play a vital role in this effort to ensure that all people have access to a wide range of information, perspectives and ideas in a variety of formats so they can make informed decisions that impact their lives.
On behalf of the Florida Library Association, representing more than 1,050 members and 60 public and academic institutions, we oppose the recent position taken by the Citrus County Board of County Commissioners in its denial of the library's electronic subscription to the New York Times. We firmly believe that all residents and library visitors should be allowed access to varying viewpoints as promised by their First Amendment rights.
The American Library Association (of which the Florida Library Association is a chapter) maintains the Library Bill of Rights and ALA Code of Ethics to guide libraries in collecting and providing access to a diverse set of materials that do not discriminate on the basis of background or beliefs.
Specifically, the Library Bill of Rights states, "Libraries should provide materials and information presenting all viewpoints on current and historical issues."
Further, libraries and librarians ensure the criteria used to select materials do not discriminate on the basis of factors such as political or religious viewpoint or the background, identity, gender, or beliefs of the publisher or author.
Decisions about which materials are added to a library collection should never be made on the basis of personal or political viewpoints. Selections should be made based on the availability of funds, the needs and interests of library patrons, and in consideration of the library's mission to provide balanced coverage of important topics so that members of the community can educate themselves, draw their own conclusions and participate fully in society.
By restricting access to a specific resource based on personal political beliefs, Citrus County commissioners are denying their constituents the ability to seek and receive information from a wide range of viewpoints and formats. They are overriding the recommendation of library professionals, not due to budgetary or public safety concerns but because the viewpoint of that publication does not match their own.
We expect our civic leaders to review information from all sides of an issue before making a decision that will represent the best interests of the community. We would not want them to make decisions based on incomplete information. We want the same for all members of the public.
As articulated in a recent statement by the American Library Association:
"Public libraries are government agencies subject to the First Amendment. Rejecting or censoring a publication based upon its political viewpoint represents both content and viewpoint discrimination that is contrary to the spirit of the First Amendment's promise of freedom of speech and freedom of belief."
In order to uphold Americans' First Amendment rights, governments at any level should not withhold funding or reject proposals to provide library patrons access to any information on the basis of political or personal viewpoints.
The members of the Florida Library Association urge the members of the Citrus County Board of County Commissioners to reconsider the recommendation of library staff and allow the members of the public to decide for themselves which news sources they choose to follow.
Heather Snapp is the first year experience and outreach librarian at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, and serves as the chair of the Florida Library Association's Intellectual Freedom Committee.

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg is hedging his 2020 bets.
The billionaire former city mayor will file paperwork Friday to qualify for Alabama's Democratic primary, taking his first official step toward running for president while still leaving himself an escape hatch to opt out of the race, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The sources stressed Bloomberg hasn't completely made up his mind about running, but said the 77-year-old has dispatched staffers to Alabama this week to gather signatures in order to make it onto the primary ballot.
"They've totally geared up over the last few days and they're doing 'round the clock meetings," a former Bloomberg administration official told the Daily News on Thursday.
Alabama's primary isn't until March, but the state has a Friday deadline to qualify for the ballot. A candidate needs 500 signatures to make the cut.
The former administration official said Bloomberg "appears enthusiastic." However, even if Bloomberg qualifies for the Alabama primary, he doesn't have to launch a campaign, and the sources noted that he's not totally on board yet.
Top Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson claimed his boss is the ideal Democrat to "take the fight to Trump and win."
"Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that," Wolfson said in a statement. "If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America's biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America's toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist."
Some of Bloomberg's fellow 2020 hopefuls believe the ultra-wealthy New Yorker is out of touch with the modern Democratic Party.
"The billionaire class is scared and they should be scared," Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted in a not-so-subtle dig at Bloomberg amid news of his Alabama move.
Sanders' like-minded Senate colleague, Elizabeth Warren, piled on.
"Welcome to the race, Mike Bloomberg! If you're looking for policy plans that will make a huge difference for working people and which are very popular, start here," Warren tweeted, along with a link to a widget on her campaign website that allows billionaires to calculate how much they'd pay under her proposed wealth tax.
If he ultimately decides to join the race, Bloomberg would likely pose a challenge to Joe Biden, who espouses similar centrist views but has recently dropped in the polls and struggled to raise cash.
But Bloomberg's moderate policy ideals and aversion to big government solutions to health care and other kitchen table issues could make him a progressive punching bag.
He'd also join the race with less than three months to go until February's Iowa caucuses, leaving him a narrow window for campaigning and assembling a political base.
Bloomberg, who began flirting with a White House bid nearly a year ago, has faced heat from fellow Democrats over his legacy in New York, which includes the controversial stop-and-frisk policing strategy that targeted young black and Latino men.
In September 2018, Bloomberg drew a barrage of criticism after he disputed the credibility of some #MeToo victims in an interview with The New York Times.
"The stuff I read about is disgraceful - I don't know how true all of it is," Bloomberg told the newspaper.
In another head-scratcher, Bloomberg publicly announced in March that he wasn't going to run for president - a declaration he's now apparently reconsidering.

Texto completo: "Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive. Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."
Ken Goldstein
Political scientist
With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his reelection bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump's worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn't add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don't always capture what's happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn't deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump's average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
"I think the battleground polls are more meaningful" than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true," said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points.
If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
"In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average," said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette's polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% – or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
"Battleground states are battlegrounds precisely because they're close. We should expect Wisconsin and probably Pennsylvania and North Carolina or Florida and Arizona to be pretty close states," Franklin said.
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump's approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state's most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump's ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president's approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump's true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn't changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump's job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president's approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent's share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
"Every president running for reelection over the last 60 years has received on Election Day a percentage of the popular vote within a point of their job approval number," ABC news analyst Matthew Dowd, a strategist for President George W. Bush who now considers himself an independent, wrote this week.
But some experts believe Trump can and will "overperform" his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance – such as the economy – and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.
"He has a vote that goes beyond the voters that approve of him," Feldman said.
Trump's flat approval ratings make it incumbent upon him to drive up the "negatives" of the Democratic nominee, said Ed Goeas, a GOP pollster.
"It's going to be driven by how high the negatives of his opponent are," said Goeas, who doesn't think Trump's approval number is as good a guide to his re-election performance as it has been for past presidents.
"His approval overall is kind of a worst-case scenario for him," he said.
Franklin said the Wisconsin polling suggests "the president's job approval has been consistently net negative, but not enormously so. He has been behind Biden in the (last two Marquette polls) but quite competitive with the other Democrats."
The Marquette pollster said, "it would be wrong to see the state as anything other than close," with Trump still facing an "uphill" battle due to his negative ratings.
"Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive," Goldstein said. "Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."
Feldman, the Democratic pollster, said "We are maybe looking at a situation that is more similar to 2016 than (Democrats) would like it to be," meaning a very narrowly decided contest.
If that is true, then Wisconsin would be right back where it was in the last election – on a knife's edge.
"Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive. Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."

STEYER AIDE OFFERED MONEY FOR BACKING

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa - A top aide to Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer in Iowa privately offered campaign contributions to local politicians in exchange for endorsing his White House bid, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the conversations.
The overtures from Pat Murphy, a former state House speaker who is serving as a top adviser on Mr. Steyer's Iowa campaign, aren't illegal - though payments for endorsements would violate campaign finance laws if not disclosed. There's no evidence that any Iowans accepted the offer or received contributions from Mr. Steyer's campaign as compensation for their backing.
But the proposals could revive criticism that the billionaire Mr. Steyer is trying to buy his way into the White House. Several state lawmakers and political candidates said they were surprised Mr. Steyer's campaign would think he could purchase their support.
Pence dismisses claim
WASHINGTON - Senior White House officials were certain Vice President Mike Pence would back an effort to have President Donald Trump removed from office over concerns about his mental state, the "Anonymous" administration official plans to claim in their forthcoming book, a source close to the book process confirms to CNN's Jake Tapper.
The book doesn't say Mr. Pence actually said he would support such a move, according to a summary of an excerpt first reported by HuffPost, which the source described as accurate.
The vice president dismissed the report Thursday and called on the book's author - who has been described as a senior Trump administration official who previously alleged there's an internal administration resistance to Trump in a 2018 New York Times op-ed - to resign.
Trump denies Barr report
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday denied a report that he wanted Attorney General William Barr to hold a press conference to declare he broke no laws during a July phone call in which Mr. Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democrats.
Mr. Trump tweeted just after midnight that the story, first reported by The Washington Post, "is totally untrue and just another FAKE NEWS story with anonymous sources that don't exist."
The Post reported that Mr. Barr rebuffed the request, which came in September around the time the White House released a rough transcript of Mr. Trump's July 25 call at the center of the House impeachment probe. House Democrats are investigating Mr. Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate political rivals as aid money was being withheld from the Eastern European country.
Sessions to run for Senate
WASHINGTON - Jeff Sessions said he'll run for the Alabama Senate seat that he vacated in 2017 to became President Donald Trump's first U.S. attorney general..
Mr. Sessions, 72, a former top Republican on the Senate Judiciary and Budget panels, easily held onto his seat for two decades, and his entry shakes up the race to defeat Democratic incumbent Doug Jones.
Mr. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, won a surprise December 2017 special election over Republican Roy Moore, a former Alabama chief justice who became mired in allegations of sexual assault and misconduct that he denied.

World News: American Diplomat Faults U.S. on Turkish Intervention

Texto completo: The senior U.S. diplomat for northeast Syria asserted in an internal memo that the Trump administration didn't try hard enough to dissuade Turkey from intervening militarily in northeast Syria, a person familiar with the assessment said.
The memo was written by William Roebuck, a veteran diplomat who previously served as the U.S. ambassador to Bahrain, and was sent Oct. 31 to James Jeffrey, the U.S. special envoy on Syria issues, as well as to Pentagon, State Department and White House officials.
In a lengthy analysis, Mr. Roebuck acknowledged that a more forceful policy of threatening economic sanctions against Ankara and a stepped-up military presence might not have deterred Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
from ordering a military intervention in Syria.
"It's a tough call, and the answer is probably not," Mr. Roebuck wrote in the unclassified memo, the person said. "But we won't know because we didn't try."
He also said that Turkish-backed Arab fighters that were used in the intervention have carried out "war crimes and ethnic cleansing."
The memo comes to light as Mr. Erdogan is planning to meet with President Trump on Wednesday at the White House. The memo was earlier reported on by the New York Times.
The State Department declined to comment on Mr. Roebuck's assessment. "We will not confirm or deny alleged private internal communications," said Morgan Ortagus, the State Department spokeswoman. "That said, we have made clear that we strongly disagreed with President Erdogan's decision to enter Syria and that we did everything short of a military confrontation to stop it."
Turkey's intervention in Syria was preceded by an Oct. 6 phone call between Messrs. Trump and Erdogan in which the Turkish leader expressed impatience with American efforts to work with Ankara to set up a safe zone to ensure that Kurdish fighters couldn't threaten Turkey.
After the call, Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal of about 50 U.S. troops from two outposts near Syria's border with Turkey, and later directed the departure of the approximately 1,000 troops from the northeast part of the country.
U.S. lawmakers complained that Mr. Trump effectively gave Turkey a green light to intervene militarily, creating a vacuum that Russian and Syrian forces would move to fill, diminishing American influence in the Middle East. Administration officials have said that Mr. Trump acted prudently to remove American troops from a volatile situation.
As criticism of Mr. Trump's withdrawal decision mounted, including from Republican lawmakers, Mr. Trump directed that some U.S. forces be sent to protect an oil field in northeast Syria.
Mr. Roebuck noted in his memo that this policy switch would mitigate some of the consequences of Mr. Trump's initial withdrawal decision. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces would have some territory to use and American forces could continue to work with them in confronting Islamic State militants.
But Mr. Trump's assertions that the U.S. "keep the oil" and perhaps bring in large American companies to develop it raised another problem. Mr. Roebuck cautioned that statements about protecting the oil would reinforce suspicious in the region that Washington was secretly plotting to take over the Middle East's resources. The diplomat advised that the Trump administration instead stress that the oil belongs to the Syrian people.
On Thursday, a Pentagon spokesman signaled a change in the administration's message on Syria's oil. "The revenue from this is not going to the U.S., this is going to the SDF," Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said.
Mr. Roebuck, who didn't respond to a request to comment, has spent more than two decades working on Middle East issues for the State Department and has been based in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Israel and Bahrain.
He now serves as special adviser to Mr. Jeffrey and has spent much of his time as the top diplomat -- and in recent weeks, the only -- on the ground in northeast Syria.

WASHINGTON -- When officials at a government weather forecasting office assured Alabama residents that a September hurricane would not hit their state, they did not intend to contradict President Trump's insistence that it would, according to newly disclosed documents.
Instead, they were answering a deluge of questions from Alabama residents whose concerns had been raised by Mr. Trump's statements.
Hundreds of emails and other documents obtained this week through public records requests shed new light on how the weather can turn political in an administration that demands loyalty to Mr. Trump even when his positions are at odds with scientific facts. They show that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the National Weather Service, was fully aware that Hurricane Dorian was not headed for Alabama even though they issued a statement days later chastising scientists for saying just that.
"I wanted to let you know that the forecasters in Birmingham who made the clarification post for Alabama was unaware of the POTUS tweet when they made their post," Susan Buchanan, director of public affairs for the National Weather Service, wrote to NOAA officials the morning after scientists posted their Twitter message on Sept. 1 saying that "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from Dorian." Potus is shorthand for president of the United States.
"They had started getting a lot of calls from partners and the public out of the blue, asking about the hurricane and local impacts," Ms. Buchanan wrote. "They didn't know what prompted these calls, but felt they needed to clarify from an operational perspective. I hope this info helps."
It apparently did not help much. The White House continued to engage in a whisper campaign against the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Ala., suggesting that officials there were intent on embarrassing Mr. Trump when they posted their message on Twitter.
The president then demanded aides intervene and have the agency "clarify" the scientists' position, according to people familiar with the events.
What followed was an unusual, unsigned rebuke of the Birmingham office from NOAA on Sept. 6 saying that staff members there had been wrong to categorically dispute the president's warning.
That outraged some staff members and many citizens, who emailed public relations officials at NOAA calling the rebuke a debasement of the federal government's scientific integrity, the documents show.
One NOAA meteorologist, Alex Krautmann, emailed the communications staff shortly after the statement was posted. "This statement is deeply upsetting to NOAA employees that have worked the hurricane and not fully accurate based on the timeline in question," he wrote. "Please raise this in feedback through proper channels."
Some citizens were sharper. "You have lost all credibility," one wrote to the Weather Service's office in Portland, Ore., which forwarded on the note to top agency officials.
Another asked: "Do you have any idea the damage you have done to NOAA's reputation and credibility? Do you care?"
The emails and other documents, which were reviewed by the White House before NOAA made them public, do not offer new clues about top administration officials' actions. A NOAA spokesman, Scott Smullen, said the documents demonstrated "a professional communications office handling media inquiries and normal agency operational email chatter, in addition to employee and public reaction to the issue."
The Sept. 6 NOAA statement came after Mr. Trump insisted groundlessly for five days that Hurricane Dorian would hit Alabama.
The New York Times reported that Mick Mulvaney, the White House acting chief of staff, directed Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who oversees NOAA and the National Weather Service, to have NOAA publicly rebut the forecasters. Mr. Ross warned NOAA's acting administrator that top employees at the agency could be fired if the situation was not addressed, according to multiple people briefed on the discussions.
Mr. Ross's spokesman has denied that the secretary threatened firings, and Mr. Trump denied that he gave his chief of staff instructions to disavow the forecast.
"I never did that," Mr. Trump said last month. "That's a whole hoax by the fake news media. When they talk about the hurricane and when they talk about Florida and they talk about Alabama, that's just fake news."
But Neil Jacobs, the acting administrator of NOAA, told congressional investigators that Mr. Mulvaney played a key role, according to Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Science Committee, which is leading one of three separate federal inquiries into the statement.
In a letter this month to Mr. Ross, Ms. Johnson noted that the interview with Mr. Jacobs revealed that top Commerce Department political appointees, not NOAA officials, had drafted the statement and that Mr. Mulvaney was "involved in high-level conversations" about it.
According to Ms. Johnson's letter, Mr. Jacobs also confirmed a New York Times report that he was first contacted about issuing the statement before dawn on Sept. 6. The Commerce Department officials involved in drafting the letter -- David Dewhirst, deputy general counsel; Earl Comstock, director of policy; and Julie Kay Roberts, Mr. Jacobs' deputy chief of staff and communications director -- are all political appointees. None holds a scientific degree.
The episode began the night of Sept. 1 as Dorian gathered strength over the Atlantic and headed toward the East Coast. Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that Alabama, among other states, "will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated."
A few minutes after Mr. Trump's tweet, the National Weather Service in Birmingham, caught off guard by worried calls from residents, posted its own message on Twitter declaring that "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama." The forecasters were correct; Alabama was not struck by the hurricane.
Mr. Trump was furious and insisted for days that he had been correct. He displayed or posted outdated maps, including one that had been apparently altered with a Sharpie pen to make it look like Alabama had been in the path of the storm.

Texto completo: Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is taking steps to enter the 2020 race for the Democratic presidential nomination, one of his advisers said, months after the former New York City mayor said he wouldn't run.
Mr. Bloomberg is preparing a possible bid out of concern that the current candidates may not be able to defeat President Trump, his adviser Howard Wolfson said.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What do you think Michael Bloomberg could bring to the 2020 presidential race? What would you want to ask him? Join the conversation below.
"Mike believes that Donald Trump represents an unprecedented threat to our nation," Mr. Wolfson said.
"We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated—but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that," Mr. Wolfson said.
Mr. Wolfson said Mr. Bloomberg was making preparations to appear on Alabama's primary ballot. The filing deadline is Friday, and Alabama is one of 14 states holding contests on March 3, known as "Super Tuesday."
People familiar with Mr. Bloomberg's plans said he hasn't made a final decision about whether to run. His entry would add a new dimension to an already crowded field and offer a well-financed alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden for voters seeking a more centrist candidate to challenge the president.
Two leading progressive candidates, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, cheered the potential of another billionaire joining Tom Steyer in the 16-person race. Ms. Warren, who has made her wealth tax a signature part of her agenda, welcomed Mr. Bloomberg and referred him to her campaign's "calculator for the billionaires."
Mr. Sanders tweeted, "The billionaire class is scared and they should be scared."
Mr. Bloomberg, 77 years old, would add to the septuagenarians in the field, joining Messrs. Sanders, Biden and Ms. Warren, against President Trump, 73.
Mr. Bloomberg's move toward running comes as some in the party—especially wealthy donors—grumble about the leftward lurch of the party, with Ms. Warren on the rise and Mr. Biden faltering in early states.
Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist and veteran of presidential politics, said Mr. Bloomberg's potential entry could serve as a "big disruption" in the race. "There's plenty of obstacles, but the fact is, he's got the resources to compete," Mr. Trippi said. He said Mr. Bloomberg and his advisers were unlikely to be "entertaining this unless they saw a path."
But he would enter the field with fewer than 100 days before the Iowa caucuses and months after most top candidates have plowed millions of dollars into organizing in early states. The filing deadline for New Hampshire, the second nominating contest, is Friday Nov. 15.
Democrats are satisfied with their choices for presidential nominee, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found late last month. Some 85% of the party's primary voters said they were satisfied with the candidates, including 31% who said they were "very satisfied.'' By contrast, 13% said they were unsatisfied.
Mr. Bloomberg's public image nationally remains something of a blank slate, Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling has found. In a 2016 survey, the most recent one testing Mr. Bloomberg, about one-third of voters said they had a neutral view of him, and about one-quarter said they were unsure of their impression or didn't know his name.
Some 16% of voters in the poll said they had a positive impression of Mr. Bloomberg, and 27% said they had a negative one.
The New York Times reported on Mr. Bloomberg's plans Thursday.
Mr. Bloomberg's possible entry comes as a Monmouth University poll released Wednesday found the majority of those surveyed—74%—were satisfied with the current field; 16% said they wanted another candidate.
Mr. Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, flirted with the idea of running late last year.
He had invested tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections and made several stops in December 2018 in Iowa, where the nomination season begins with the Feb. 3 caucuses.
Mr. Bloomberg had been a lifelong Democrat before joining the Republican Party ahead of his run for mayor in 2001. He left the GOP and became unaffiliated with any party when he flirted with running for president in 2008. He re-registered as a Democrat last year.
Mr. Bloomberg announced in March he wouldn't run for president because of the difficulty in winning the Democratic Party's nomination.
"I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election," Mr. Bloomberg wrote . "But I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field."
He didn't fully close the door to running, however, a person familiar with his plans said. Mr. Bloomberg's team had an internal deadline of about a year before Election Day, which will be Nov. 3, 2020, to decide, the person added. Members of his team recently spoke to Democratic strategists, another person familiar with the talks said.
Mr. Bloomberg spoke Thursday to former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, a longtime power broker in the early voting state, and discussed the possibility of running, a spokesman for Mr. Reid confirmed.
Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack said in an email that Mr. Bloomberg left him a phone message on Thursday.

Michael John Gray, chairman of the Democratic Party in Arkansas—another state with a coming filing deadline—said his office received a call from a Washington, D.C., firm around Thursday noon inquiring about the filing process. The representatives from the firm declined to name the candidate, "but the word 'mystery' was used," a spokesman for the party said.
In August at a gun-control event that he helped finance in Iowa, Mr. Bloomberg criticized Ms. Warren for her aggressive tone toward corporations and Wall Street.
"I just said to Sen. Warren on the way out, 'Senator, congratulations, it was a nice talk, but just let me remind you if my company hadn't been successful, we wouldn't be here today,' so enough with this stuff," Mr. Bloomberg said.
Mr. Bloomberg has been a frequent critic of President Trump. "Trump says he wants to run the nation like he's run his business? God help us," Mr. Bloomberg said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention where he endorsed Hillary Clinton. "I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one."
A person familiar with Bloomberg LP said no decisions have yet been made as to whether the company will be put into a blind trust should Mr. Bloomberg win the presidency.
A spokeswoman for Bloomberg News had no immediate comment on how Bloomberg's reporters will cover Mr. Bloomberg if he chooses to run. Earlier in the day, Bloomberg News did cover news reports that Mr. Bloomberg is again contemplating a race for president in 2020.

Bret Stephens: Mexico is on a path to becoming a failed state

Texto completo: Mexico City • On a working visit here, I have dinner with one of the country’s elder statesmen and listen to him describe its greatest challenges. He names three: “Rule of law. Rule of law. And rule of law.”
The truth of the observation is underscored a few days later, when gunmen kill nine members of the LeBarón family along a back-country road in the northern state of Sonora. The motive for the massacre is unclear, but its barbarity is not: three women and six children, including infant twins, shot at close range and burned alive in their cars.
The episode has gained major attention in the U.S. largely because the LeBaróns are part of a long-standing American Mormon presence in northern Mexico. (George Romney, the late Michigan governor and Mitt’s father, was born in a Mormon colony in Chihuahua in 1907, which he was forced to flee as a child during the Mexican Revolution.)
But the reason the killings really matter is that they are yet another reminder that Mexico is on a fast track toward becoming a failed state.
For this, blame a combination of managerial incompetence and ideological inanity from Donald Trump and his Mexican counterpart, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. In 2015, I asked then-candidate Trump whether he feared that his protectionist policies would hurt Mexico in ways that ultimately would hurt the United States as well. His reply: “I don’t care about Mexico, honestly. I really don’t care about Mexico.”
Since then, Trump has forced a dubious renegotiation of NAFTA but has yet to get the new trade agreement ratified in Congress, causing business uncertainties that have brought the Mexican economy to the edge of recession. It took the administration more than a year to replace its ambassador in Mexico, after the last one resigned in disgust. And Trump’s insistence that Mexico militarize its southern border with Guatemala has drained its army of the manpower it needs to fight the drug cartels.
Last month, in the northwestern city of Culiacán, Mexican security forces found themselves quickly outnumbered and outgunned when they tried to arrest the son of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, the jailed drug lord. The soldiers capitulated and the son was promptly freed.
If Trump’s actions have been damaging, López Obrador’s have been disastrous.
His slogan in the face of cartel violence is “hugs, not bullets.” His strategy has been to increase spending on social programs while urging gangsters to think of their mothers. He has claimed, preposterously, that crime is under control and still insists he has no intention of rethinking his approach. In the Culiacán fiasco, he praised the decision to release El Chapo’s son while ordering the disclosure of the officer’s name who had ordered the operation, endangering the man’s life. Much of the army officer corps now openly reviles their commander in chief.
A parody of a policy has produced a predictable result: 2019 is on course to become Mexico’s most violent year in decades, with about 17,000 killings between January and June. In sheer numbers, that’s a figure that exceeds the civilian death toll in Iraq at the height of war in 2006.
So what could work? A conversation with a former senior U.S. intelligence official suggests a bracing analogy.
“What has always been required,” the former official says, “is to construct a comprehensive, integrated civil-military campaign, where ‘military’ includes all security services , similar to a counterinsurgency campaign such as the one pursued in the surge in Iraq.”
But hasn’t that been tried before?
Not quite. Under President Felipe Calderón (2006-2012), Mexico pursued a “kingpin” strategy of taking down cartel leaders. But decapitation strikes never work when your enemy is a Hydra. His successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, believed that economic prosperity and political reform would be an antidote to criminality. But that turned out to be another mirage as growth lagged and corruption surged.
“When Mexican presidents have looked at this, it’s such a daunting task,” the former official notes. “It’s very manpower intensive, and it’s not just security forces to clear, hold, and build. They have to be supported by strong judicial authorities, which in turn have to be supported by strong prison authorities. Those are the three legs of the rule-of-law stool, and if any of them are weak, it can cause the whole enterprise to topple.”
In Mexico, all the legs of the stool are cracked. Prisons are out of control. Municipal authorities cower before the cartels. The “impunity rate” — that is, the likelihood that crimes will not be punished — is just shy of 99%.
This is not business as usual for Mexico. Either the country is going to get a grip on its crisis of institutions and its deficits in leadership or it is going to increasingly resemble Iraq before the surge, albeit with drug money taking the place of religious fanaticism. Donald Trump might not care about Mexico, but you should. Even if we build a wall, no crisis will ever respect a border.

Texto completo: Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is taking steps to enter the 2020 presidential race as a Democrat, one of his advisers said, months after saying he wouldn't run.

"Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that," Mr. Wolfson said. "If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America's biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America's toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist."
Mr. Wolfson said Mr. Bloomberg was making preparations to appear on Alabama's primary ballot. The filing deadline is Friday, and Alabama is one of 14 states holding contests on March 3, known as "Super Tuesday."
Mr. Bloomberg's move toward running comes as some in the party—especially wealthy donors—grumble about the leftward lurch of the party, with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on the rise and former Vice President Joe Biden faltering in early states.
The New York Times first reported Mr. Bloomberg's plans .
If he moves forward with a presidential run, Mr. Bloomberg would join 16 other candidates vying for the Democratic nomination, including another billionaire, Tom Steyer. Mr. Bloomberg, 77, will also add to the septuagenarians in the field.
Mr. Bloomberg's possible entry comes as a Monmouth University poll released Wednesday found the majority of those surveyed—74%—were satisfied with the current field, and only 16% said they wanted another candidate to run.

Texto completo: Mary Anne Fidati Eggleston, 76, of Waverly, enjoyed great success in her life as a gifted entrepreneur, generous philanthropist and was a respected businesswoman in Northeast Pennsylvania for decades.
She worked tirelessly as a director/vice president at Pagnotti Enterprises and its subsidiary companies where she played an integral role in re-energizing and revitalizing the businesses that her grandfather, Louis Pagnotti Sr., founded in 1934. In addition, her entrepreneurial footprint lives on today in the water filtration industry at both Carbon Sales Inc. and the Unifilt Corp., where she was both a founder and corporate officer.
Born in Scranton on July 29, 1943, she was the daughter of the late F. Robert and Marie Pagnotti Fidati.
Mary Anne graduated from Marywood Seminary and attended Wheeling College, Wheeling, W.Va.
Mary Anne passed away Oct. 5 at Allied Skilled Nursing following a courageous battle with cancer.
Mary Anne was involved in a number of local organizations, sat on numerous boards and participated in philanthropic efforts throughout her life. A true pioneer, she was one of the first women to be admitted to the Westmoreland Club, Wilkes-Barre, and was a founding board member at the Luzerne Foundation. Mary Anne was a board member at King’s College, where she was instrumental in the formation of the King’s College Family Business Forum and also sat on the board at Friendship House. She was an original Everhart Museum board member when the community board was formed, played a significant part in the restoration of the mineral exhibit at the museum and was recognized as the honoree in 2015 at the Everhart Museum Summer Solstice event.
Mary Anne is survived by her son and daughter-in-law, Bubba and Tracy Eggleston, and her two grandchildren, Elle and Brett, around whom her world revolved. She is also survived by her sister, Judy Fidati Haudenschield, and Jeff Haudenschield and their two sons, David and Christopher. Judy truly considered Mary Anne to be both a sister and mother to her, as David and Christopher fondly thought of her more as their grandmother than as their aunt. They were her closest relatives living locally and were a primary reason she fought so hard to survive.
Even during her time at Allied, she still always looked forward to being a part of as many milestones as possible in the lives of her family and her businesses. She cherished her friends from near and far, and always loved sharing stories about the fun times she had enjoyed throughout her life with her cousins.
Strongly influenced by her grandfather, Louis Pagnotti Sr., and his larger than life personality, she was a dynamic woman who was determined in business, yet even incredibly more caring and sensitive in her family life. She had a realistic way of looking at the world and her intuitive ability to quickly judge people’s characters was truly amazing and always spot-on. Some of her greatest pleasures were her time with family, gourmet cooking, reading the Sunday edition of The New York Times and watching college and professional football. She was an avid Penn State fan.
We appreciate the superior efforts of the staff at Allied Services and of her caregivers, Kathy, Keith and Melissa, who offered personal attention, compassion and love to Mary Anne over the last few years.
In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Mary Anne’s honor to Project Koru at https://secure.givelively.org/donate/project-koru/mary-anne-eggleston-memorial, the Everhart Museum, The Fund for Luzerne County at The Luzerne Foundation, or a charity of your choice.
Please join us in a celebration of Mary Anne’s life to be held at 10 a.m. Saturday at Glenmaura National Golf Club, 100 Glenmaura National Blvd., Moosic.
Arrangements have been entrusted to Lawrence E. Young Funeral Home and Cremation Services Inc.

Texto completo: MILWAUKEE — With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his re-election bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump’s worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn’t add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don’t always capture what’s happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn’t deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump’s average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
“I think the battleground polls are more meaningful” than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
“There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we’re seeing in the national polling. I don’t know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he’s only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can’t be true,” said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points.
If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
“In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average,” said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette’s polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% — or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
“Battleground states are battlegrounds precisely because they’re close. We should expect Wisconsin and probably Pennsylvania and North Carolina or Florida and Arizona to be pretty close states,” Franklin said.
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump’s approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was more Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state’s most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump‘s ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president’s approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump’s true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn’t changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump’s job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president’s approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent’s share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
“Every president running for reelection over the last 60 years has received on Election Day a percentage of the popular vote within a point of their job approval number,” ABC news analyst Matthew Dowd, a strategist for President George W. Bush who now considers himself an independent, wrote this week.
But some experts believe Trump can and will “overperform” his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance — such as the economy — and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.
"He has a vote that goes beyond the voters that approve of him," Feldman said.
Trump's flat approval ratings make it incumbent upon him to drive up the "negatives" of the Democratic nominee, said Ed Goeas, a GOP pollster.
“It’s going to be driven by how high the negatives of his opponent are,” said Goeas, who doesn’t think Trump’s approval number is as good a guide to his re-election performance as it has been for past presidents.
“His approval overall is kind of a worst-case scenario for him,” he said.
Franklin said the Wisconsin polling suggests “the president’s job approval has been consistently net negative, but not enormously so. He has been behind Biden in the (last two Marquette polls) but quite competitive with the other Democrats. ”
The Marquette pollster said, “it would be wrong to see the state as anything other than close,” with Trump still facing an “uphill” battle due to his negative ratings.
“Everyone’s obsession with Wisconsin isn’t just hype. It’s truly competitive,” Goldstein said. “Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it’s going to be a choice. ”
Feldman, the Democratic pollster, said “We are maybe looking at a situation that is more similar to 2016 than (Democrats) would like it to be,” meaning a very narrowly decided contest.
If that is true, then after all this time, Wisconsin would be right back where it was in the last election — on a knife’s edge.

U.S. Didn't Try Hard Enough to Stop Turkey's Assault in Syria, Diplomat Says; Internal memo acknowledges Turkey's Erdogan might not have been stopped by more forceful policies

Texto completo: The senior U.S. diplomat for northeast Syria asserted in an internal memo that the Trump administration didn't try hard enough to dissuade Turkey from intervening militarily in northeast Syria , a person familiar with the assessment said.
The memo was written by William Roebuck, a veteran diplomat who previously served as the U.S. ambassador to Bahrain, and was sent Oct. 31 to James Jeffrey, the U.S. special envoy on Syria issues, as well as to Pentagon, State Department and White House officials.
In a lengthy analysis, Mr. Roebuck acknowledged that a more forceful policy of threatening economic sanctions against Ankara and a stepped-up military presence might not have deterred Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan from ordering a military intervention in Syria.
"It's a tough call, and the answer is probably not," Mr. Roebuck wrote in the unclassified memo, the person said. "But we won't know because we didn't try."
He also said that Turkish-backed Arab fighters that were used in the intervention have carried out "war crimes and ethnic cleansing."
The memo comes to light as Mr. Erdogan is planning to meet with Mr. Trump on Wednesday at the White House. The memo was earlier reported on by the New York Times.
The State Department declined to comment on Mr. Roebuck's assessment.
"We will not confirm or deny alleged private internal communications," said Morgan Ortagus, the State Department spokeswoman. "That said, we have made clear that we strongly disagreed with President Erdogan's decision to enter Syria and that we did everything short of a military confrontation to stop it."
Turkey's intervention in Syria was preceded by an Oct. 6 phone call between Messrs. Trump and Erdogan in which the Turkish leader expressed impatience with American efforts to work with Ankara to set up a safe zone to ensure that Kurdish fighters couldn't threaten Turkey and said he wouldn't tolerate the situation.
After the call, Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal of about 50 U.S. troops from two outposts near Syria's border with Turkey, and later directed the departure of the approximately 1,000 troops from the northeast part of the country.
U.S. lawmakers complained that Mr. Trump effectively gave Turkey a green light to intervene militarily, creating a vacuum that Russian and Syrian forces would move to fill, diminishing American influence in the Middle East. Administration officials have said that Mr. Trump acted prudently to remove American troops from a volatile situation.
As criticism of Mr. Trump's withdrawal decision mounted, including from Republican lawmakers, Mr. Trump modified his plan and directed that some U.S. forces be sent to protect oil field in northeast Syria.
Mr. Roebuck noted in his memo that this policy switch would mitigate some of the consequences of Mr. Trump's initial withdrawal decision. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces would have some territory to use and American forces could continue to work with them in confronting Islamic State militants.
But Mr. Trump's assertions that the U.S. "keep the oil" and perhaps bring in large American companies to develop it raised another problem. Mr. Roebuck cautioned that statements about protecting the oil would reinforce suspicious in the region that Washington was secretly plotting to take over the Middle East's resources. The diplomat advised that the Trump administration instead stress that the oil belongs to the Syrian people.
On Thursday, a Pentagon spokesman signaled a change in the administration's message on Syria's oil. "The revenue from this is not going to the U.S., this is going to the SDF," Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said.
Mr. Roebuck who didn't respond to a request for comment, has spent more than two decades working on Middle East issues for the State Department and has been based in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Israel and Bahrain.
He now serves as special adviser to Mr. Jeffrey and has spent much of his time as the top diplomat—and in recent weeks, the only—on the ground in northeast Syria. A U.S. official said that Mr. Roebuck is considered a professional who has carried out his duties in an apolitical manner.
One striking portion of Mr. Roebuck's assessment is an accusation that Syrian Arab Islamist groups backed and paid by the Turks have carried out war crimes as part of a deliberate effort to scare Kurds into leaving northern Syria.
Ms. Ortagus, the State Department spokeswoman, said that the U.S. has had concerns that Turkish-supported militias may have killed unarmed civilians and prisoners, among other abuses.
"We have raised them with the highest level of the Turkish government," she said. Turkey has said it would investigate the allegations.
Mr. Jeffrey, who is now in Ankara, is leading a U.S. delegation for talks with Turkish officials there on Friday and Saturday.
One focus of American concerns involves a push by Turkish-backed forces toward the Syrian town of Tal Tamar, which is a largely Christian area.
Turkey has said that it wouldn't take the town, but the U.S. had raised its concerns with senior Turkish officials and is monitoring the situation, a senior State Department official said Wednesday.

Profit Slump
Starts to Ease
Qualcomm Inc. signaled a strong year ahead for 5G phone sales. The San Diego chip maker gave its first forecast for global 5G smartphone shipments of between 175 million and 225 million next year. It reported revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter of $4.81 billion, down 17% from a year earlier, but exceeding a FactSet analyst survey consensus estimate of $4.76 billion.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share fell to 78 cents, above analysts' expectations and at the higher end of a range management forecast three months ago.
The company said it shipped 152 million chips in the quarter, down 34% from a year earlier, underscoring the effect of trade turmoil and a handset market where many manufacturers are trying to sell down 4G phone inventories before they introduce 5G ones.

FOX
Revenue Gains From
Programming Fees
Fox Corp. said Wednesday its quarterly revenue rose 5%, boosted by growth at its television unit and higher proceeds from its Los Angeles studio lot, which is being leasing to rivals.
Fox, which was spun off from 21st Century Fox earlier this year after a sale of most of its assets to Walt Disney Co., is now built around Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and television stations, and Fox Sports.
Revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $2.67 billion, roughly in line with analysts' estimates. Revenue at the television unit grew 6.2% to $1.36 billion, thanks in part to a 14% rise in programming fees from third-party Fox affiliates and higher average rates per subscriber.
Fox and The Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.

New York Times Co. reported strong digital-subscription growth in the third quarter, but earnings suffered from a drop in advertising revenue, which the company said would accelerate in the following quarter.
The Times reported net income of $16.4 million, or 10 cents a share, for the quarter, down 34% from $25 million, or 15 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. On an adjusted basis to exclude severance and some retirement costs, earnings per share were 12 cents.
Revenue rose 2.7% to $428.5 million from $417.3 million in the third quarter last year, driven by a 3.7% increase in subscription revenue and a 26% rise in other revenue, mostly coming from the Times's new television program, "The Weekly."
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast adjusted earnings of 10 cents a share on revenue of $429.1 million.
Advertising revenue fell 6.7% to $113.5 million. Revenue from digital advertising declined 5.4% to $54.7 million, while print advertising revenue dropped 7.9% to $58.9 million. The company forecast that both total advertising revenue and digital ad revenue would fall in the fourth quarter by a percentage in the midteens.

BMW
Results Bounce Back
On SUV Sales Boost
BMW AG returned to profit in the third quarter, helped by cost-cutting and a sales shift to higher-margin sport-utility vehicles. The company undertook a large cost-cutting program earlier this year after its profit margin was eroded by slowing sales and the costs of shifting toward electric cars and self-driving technology. It said its efforts to boost earnings were bearing fruit and could see it achieve annual savings of 12 billion euros ($13.3 billion) by the end of 2022.
Net profit in the quarter rose to 1.52 billion euros from 1.36 billion euros a year earlier. Its closely watched pretax profit margin in its automotive business rebounded to 6.6% of sales from 4.4% a year ago.
Revenue rose nearly 8% to 26.7 billion euros on strong sales in China. New car sales rose 3.6% on the back of higher X3 and X4 SUV sales. BMW's quarterly earnings were largely in line with analyst forecasts

Texto completo: Rep. Adam Schiff recently revealed that, before he entered politics, he wanted to be a screenwriter. He even penned scripts for a courtroom drama and an action-filled spy thriller. Mr. Schiff, now leading the Democratic push to impeach President Trump, hasn't lost his theatrical flair.
He insisted for months that there was "ample evidence of collusion in plain sight" before the Mueller report blew that claim to hell. Then there was Mr. Schiff's opening statement for the impeachment proceedings, in which he reimagined Mr. Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, presenting an alternate script. It was largely panned as a B-movie "Godfather" rip-off.
Now the would-be dramatist is staging a new production: "Impeaching the President." His script features secret sessions in the Capitol basement, anonymous whistleblowers, constant and selective leaks of testimony, and, of course, a brilliant performance by the heroic lead.
Count me as a skeptic, and not only because we know how this drama is likely to end: with an almost straight party-line vote by the House to impeach Mr. Trump and a near-straight party-line vote by the Senate not to remove him from office.
I'm also skeptical because I was cast in an earlier Schiff production, following my September 2007 departure as deputy White House chief of staff. On May 22, 2008, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed me to answer questions regarding the Bush administration's removal of nine U.S. attorneys starting in 2006 and the prosecution of Don Siegelman, a former Democratic governor of Alabama, who was convicted in 2006 of bribery and fraud and sentenced to seven years.
A New York Times editorial supported the Judiciary Committee's demand, speculating that I "may have been directly involved" in the "possibly illegal firings" of the U.S. attorneys and claiming Mr. Siegelman's prosecution "appears to have been politically motivated." Never mind that U.S. attorneys serve at the president's pleasure, that all nine were removed for cause, and that a career deputy U.S. attorney with an impeccable reputation led Mr. Siegelman's prosecution.
An Alabama lawyer named Dana Jill Simpson stoked Mr. Siegelman's complaints that I had railroaded him. On "60 Minutes" and MSNBC, she alleged I recruited her as an opposition researcher to take down Mr. Siegelman because he threatened the GOP's hold on the White House. This was absurd: I never met Ms. Simpson, the governor was never going to be president, and her claims on TV sounded unhinged because they were.
None of this mattered. As House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers explained, "We're closing in on Rove. Someone's got to kick his ass."
The subpoena raised issues of executive privilege and was stalemated until the Obama administration intervened to broker a compromise. So on July 7, 2009, I met with Judiciary Committee staff for a day of questioning. On July 30, I appeared for nearly 10 hours before Mr. Schiff, the committee's designated interrogator.
He hadn't even prepared. His staff gave him a large notebook full of questions, which he was evidently seeing for the first time. There were long pauses as he reviewed questions before asking them. He was repetitive, leading my lawyer to object frequently that I had already answered a question several times. Mr. Schiff barely touched the Siegelman issue and never raised Ms. Simpson's accusations. His staffers later admitted to me that they found her a completely unreliable witness.
Following my appearance, in the interest of transparency, I gave my emails and other documents to reporters. I didn't want to wait for Messrs. Schiff and Conyers to spin the information and "kick my ass." Predictably, they accused me of sidestepping an agreement not to discuss my testimony. I'd never made any such agreement.
Soon Mr. Schiff wrote a Huffington Post article to get in his shots. He claimed his interviews of former White House counsel Harriet Miers and me revealed that "the White House brought an unprecedented level of partisan pressure to bear" in the decision to fire the U.S. attorneys, and raised the question of "whether criminal charges are warranted."
No criminal charges were ever filed by the special prosecutor who investigated the matter, but Mr. Schiff enjoyed his moment in the cable-news sun, even though the Siegelman issue somehow disappeared.
Now Mr. Schiff probably hopes the public impeachment hearings will allow him to reprise Tom Cruise's role in "A Few Good Men" as Lt. Daniel Kaffee -- "I want the truth!" But I know from experience that Mr. Schiff isn't much interested in the truth. He's more interested in drama, fiction and fame. His calm demeanor masks the heart of a fierce, untrustworthy partisan.

Texto completo: Southerners have a special affinity for their cast-iron skillets. Many are heirlooms with slick patinas seasoned with decades of chicken-frying and cornbread-baking. Others are modern adaptions designed to tap into our memory banks just like Grandma's did.
I know this sentiment well, and so does Anne Byrn, my longtime friend and former colleague at the AJC where we both once held the title of food editor. Even now, with more than a dozen cookbooks to her credit -- including the New York Times bestseller "The Cake Mix Doctor" and its sequels -- her tool of choice for everyday meals in Nashville is still the 12-inch Griswold skillet she bought decades ago at an Atlanta estate sale.
Yet much as she appreciated the way it seared salmon steaks on busy weeknights and griddled pancakes on Saturday mornings, she didn't think much about its potential beyond that until she poured her favorite pound cake batter into it on a whim. She was astounded by the result.
"The cake rose to a glorious height. The crust on top was golden and crackly, and the interior was even and smooth," she writes in the introduction to her newest cookbook. "In that instant, I fell in love. Yes, in love with my skillet."
In "Skillet Love: From Steak to Cake: More Than 150 Recipes in One Cast-Iron Pan" (Grand Central Publishing, $30), Byrn helps us understand why food cooked in cast iron tastes so good, and how we can capitalize on its capabilities. She walks us through 10 great techniques for using our skillets, from dry-roasting nuts to caramelizing onions, before moving on to the recipes -- all tested with one 12-inch skillet, with tips for adapting to a smaller one if that's all you've got.
Mixed in with classics like Country-Fried Steak and Georgia Burnt Caramel Cake are more contemporary creations such the ones I made for two terrific healthy dinners: Skillet-Seared Shrimp with Lemon-Basil Potlikker, and Picadillo Stuffed Peppers with Quinoa. I'd make either again, and save room for that skillet-sized Warm Chocolate Chip Cookie heaped with ice cream beckoning me in the Sweets chapter.
I thought my own trusty cast-iron skillet and I knew each other well. Clearly our relationship has just begun.

Texto completo: There are many eco-conscious steps to take around your tech, says John Schwartz, a climate reporter. Tech can also help us see the scope of climate change.
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? John Schwartz , a climate reporter, discussed the tech he's using.
What does your tech setup look like for work and at home?
It's pretty messy, and it's all about the laptop. I use a MacBook Pro that I carry back and forth. At work, The Times gives me a big second monitor and a dongle to charge the phone and tie in the backup drive. At home, I have a desk but do much of my evening research and writing in an easy chair in the living room with the laptop propped up on the chair arm.
More important than the way my system is set up is what I do with it. I have configured my computer system at work so that along with whatever stories I'm dealing with, the big extra monitor shows me a stream of photos of my grandkids, my children and my folks.
It's no news to readers that the technologies we use can make us jittery, angry and sad. There's Twitter outrage, Facebook and Instagram FOMO, and the constant nagging of email and Slack. And let's face it, writing about climate change for a living isn't exactly cheerful. So that stream of photos brings me little bursts of pleasure throughout my day, a regular lift. Similar images show up on my Apple Watch and iPhone. Why shouldn't technology bring us joy along with all that angst?
You're a climate reporter and self-proclaimed Apple lover. Many Apple fans buy every new iPhone every year. Does your knowledge of the environmental impact of yearly upgrades change your tech consumption habits?
I've been an Apple guy since buying my first ][+ in 1983. But I've never had the money to buy a new machine every year, and that kind of consumerism just isn't for me, despite my Apple fanboy ways.
I'm cheap. My car is 11 years old, and I'll drive it until it dies. I wear clothes until they get so ragged that my wife sneaks them over to the donation bin or into the trash. Even though my employer now provides my laptops, I don't push for the latest and greatest. (I've even written a book about reaching financial security.)
So my understanding of the environmental cost of replacing tech hasn't changed my habits, though it's definitely a factor people should consider when the tech press starts trumpeting the latest toys.
Buying gadgets or using any kind of online service consumes carbon and energy. In a looming climate crisis, is it possible to be an ethical tech consumer? If so, how should we go about it?
The environmental and climate costs of the technology we use are stunning. But you can minimize your carbon footprint by buying refurbished goods instead of new, holding on to them a bit longer, repairing them instead of replacing them, and resell or recycle so that your old electronic devices are less likely to show up in landfills. I have been very happy with refurbished computers from Apple instead of buying new.
If you want to incorporate ethical sourcing and low waste into your purchasing plans, there are companies like Fairphone, the Dutch social enterprise.
What is some of the most interesting tech being used to monitor climate change?
Science is so wonderfully accessible; some of the most fascinating work is there for you to read for yourself.
All you need is a screen, an internet connection and a browser to see what satellites tell us about the extent of ice loss in Greenland or river levels during spring flood season along the Mississippi River Basin.
You can find out the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at the Keeling Curve site, and the extent to which the planet, or even your state, has warmed at the Ed Hawkins "Show Your Stripes" site (or check out this amazingly simple feature that shows you how much your hometown has warmed since you were born).
You can watch Katharine Hayhoe's amazing "Global Weirding" video series or be stunned by the amazing stories about climate change here at The Times.
Outside of your job, what tech products are you personally obsessed with?
For someone who loves technology, I don't have much of it in my house. My wife is a proud Luddite, and doesn't like tech for tech's sake; we don't have Alexa or HomePod or any of the talking gewgaws, no camera at the door. She yanked out all the wires for the security system that came with the house after it kept going off when the power went out.
I'm still semi-Luddite in some ways myself. I was recently visiting my daughter and son-in-law, and my granddaughter asked me to turn on "Aquanauts" for her. I couldn't even figure out how to turn on the TV. (It required the game controller to choose among the channels and subscription services.) It was a good excuse to read books instead.
Having said that, I love my Apple Watch, which has worked its way into my consciousness in ways I hadn't expected: It tracks my exercise and lets me see my notifications without having to pull the phone out of my pocket and spend way too much time on my phone.
The unobtrusive tech that gives me the most pleasure is my Jabra earbuds, which I use when I'm running and seem to be just about impervious to sweat. And the camera on my iPhone is my constant companion. I take daily pictures on my morning run and post them to Twitter and Instagram.
There's been a lot of talk about recycling, but some of it seems futile. Lots of plastics can no longer be recycled. What should we do?
Recycling is great in concept and fraught in practice. Like so many of the personal actions people try to take to address climate change, it can only do so much.
The most effective action on climate has to come from governments through major policy shifts, so the single most important personal action people can take is to vote their principles and work for candidates whose policies they favor -- not just at the presidential level, but up and down the line, since even policies at the local level can have an effect on greenhouse gas emissions and the environment.
Does that mean personal action is worthless? Absolutely not. For one thing, it reinforces that save-the-planet state of mind and serves as an example to others. For another, small things add up.

DNC: 2019 elections a ‘repudiation of Trumpism’

Texto completo: The Democratic Party is crowing over its victories in Tuesday’s elections in several states around the country, claiming it was a continuation of wins driven by voter concerns about President Trump.
Party Chairman Tom Perez said that elections showing Democratic gains in 2017, 2018 and 2019 prove that there is a growing voter disgruntlement with Trump.
“There have now been three elections, 2017, 2018, and 2019, and every single election has been a repudiation of Trumpism,” Perez told a media roundtable hosted by the Christian Science Monitor Wednesday morning.TweetWhile the administration pointed to a handful of wins in Tuesday’s election, it was the Democrats who came away with the biggest prizes, including taking control of Virginia’s legislature and likely the Kentucky governorship.
Perez highlighted Kentucky, where Trump just three years ago beat Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton by 29.8 points, nearly double her support.
“Donald Trump wins a state by 30 points, and he can’t drag a Republican across the finish line in that state,” he said of Kentucky Republican Gov. Matt Bevin’s apparent loss by 5,333 votes to Democrat Andy Beshear. The results could lead to a recount.TweetThe results, he added, could also lead to a new wave of House GOP retirements, which would ease the pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi going into the 2020 election.
“I think one effect of last night’s elections is that you are going to see more retirements,” said Perez, adding, “they can see the handwriting on the wall.”
And he pointed out that the Democratic Party did well in suburbs, coal country, and in presumably pro-gun areas like the counties surrounding the National Rifle Association’s northern Virginia headquarters.

Texto completo: Steven J. Hayes, quien cumple seis cadenas perpetuas por una masacre familiar en Connecticut, está recibiendo terapia hormonal en prisión como parte de una transición de género.
El recluso discutió su plan de cambio de sexo durante una serie de entrevistas telefónicas recientes con Joe Tomaso para el podcast “15 Minutes With…”, informó The New York Times.
Hayes, de 56 años, se encuentra en la prisión estatal Greene en Waynesburg, Pensilvania, después de ser transferido en 2016 como parte de un acuerdo interestatal.
Cumple seis cadenas perpetuas por los asesinatos de Jennifer Hawke-Petit (48) y sus dos hijas, Michaela (11) y Hayley (17), cometidos el 23 de julio de 2007.
“Hay muchos problemas con (mi) presentación como mujer”, dijo Hayes en el podcast. “Mucha gente lo acepta, pero en esta instalación, hay muchos racistas y fanáticos en el personal y no están contentos con eso. Hay dos de nosotros aquí que somos femeninas”.
Hayes todavía usaba el nombre Steven en el podcast, y no dijo cómo prefería ser llamado.
Afirmó tener un diagnóstico médico de disforia de género, en el que la apariencia externa de una persona no se alinea con su estado mental y emocional, y un problema recurrente de drogas.
“Soy transgénero”, dijo Hayes. “Me diagnosticaron a los 16 años con trastorno de identidad sexual. Mi familia nunca lo reconoció y nunca fui tratado”.
Maria Finn, portavoz del Departamento de Correcciones de Pensilvania , dijo que no podía comentar sobre un preso específico, pero comentó que había 222 personas transgénero en instituciones penales estatales.
Finn dijo que el sistema penitenciario estatal no paga las cirugías de afirmación de género, pero gasta $60 mil dólares al año en total y hasta $600 por interno en medicamentos para tratar a quienes tienen disforia de género. Los costos anuales de atención médica promedian $5,582 por recluso, según la vocera.
Además de la terapia hormonal, Hayes habló en el podcast de tratar de obtener “otras cosas” como parte del proceso de transición de género, pero no dio más detalles.
Originalmente Hayes recibió la pena de muerte por la invasión del hogar de Hawke-Petit, junto con un cómplice, Joshua Komisarjevsky, cuya apelación de condena será juzgada por la Corte Suprema de Connecticut.
Ambos fueron condenados a cadena perpetua después de que Connecticut abolió la pena de muerte en 2012, enojando a los partidarios de la pena capital y a los defensores de las víctimas, quienes dijeron que la derogación tenía la intención de ser prospectiva y no aplicable a los reclusos que ya estaban en el corredor de la muerte.
En el ínterin, Hayes se convirtió en judío ortodoxo en la cárcel.
Durante el podcast, expresó su remordimiento por los asesinatos y criticó la apelación de Komisarjevsky.
“No hay defensa para lo que hicimos”, dijo. “No quiero formar parte de este juicio. La familia ya no merece pasar por esto”.
Hayes y Komisarjevsky rastrearon a Hawke-Petit y sus dos hijas desde un supermercado cercano hasta su casa en Cheshire (Connecticut), donde las víctimas fueron retenidas como rehenes, agredidas sexualmente y rociadas con gasolina antes de que su casa fuera incendiada.
Antes de matarlas, Hayes obligó Hawke-Petit a ir a un banco local, donde retiró $15 mil dólares, mientras Komisarjevsky esperaba en la casa de la familia con las dos hijas, de 11 y 17 años.
El único sobreviviente del ataque, el Dr. William Petit Jr., un endocrinólogo que era el esposo y el padre de las víctimas, fue brutalmente golpeado con un bate de béisbol durante la invasión. En 2016 fue elegido miembro de la Cámara de Representantes del estado, por el Partido Republicano.
Hayes habló de haber tenido una recaída de drogas y estar en dificultades financieras en el momento de la invasión de la casa. “No era un monstruo”, afirmó sobre el triple homicidio.

Texto completo: More rich and diverse offerings are happening at SOMOS Salon & Bookstore for this year's Prose Month.
Opening act
On Saturday (Nov. 2), SOMOS hosted the first of many readings this month. In anticipation of the 7 p.m. reading by Mirabai Starr, Rabbi Judith HaLevy and Debora Seidman, the audience began to hush itself at five minutes before the hour. Members of the eager ensemble of listeners seemed to know that a special evening was in store for them, and they lowered their voices to whispers of their own accord.
Curator Johanna DeBiase introduced the trio, joking about the unintentional creation of a "Jewish Ladies Night" of readers. The unplanned harmony continued with the reading itself; all three readers chose selections about their mothers.
The reading began with a re-creation of Shabbat in miniature: two candles, a cup, a loaf of challah set on a cloth, all on a brass tray. "On the last night of my mother's life, my sister-in-law Anita brings Shabbat into the hospital," Seidman read from her memoir in progress, "Lost and Found in My Mother's Kitchen." Seidman created an intimate portrait of a complicated relationship through the objects, actions and feelings that fill our daily lives: casserole dishes, soup bowls, caregiving and forgiveness.
The theme of the importance of objects that fill our minds and days continued in the humorous reflections of HaLevy, who claimed, "It's all about the shoes," while offering incisive reflections on what it means to honor our mothers (and fathers) and on wise aging. "The first step to wise aging is a ruthless inventory of the shoeboxes clogging your closet," Rabbi Judith read, itemizing her own four-inch spikes, thigh-high boots and the like. After earnest reflection, she decides that, rather than give them to her daughter-in-law, the garbage is the most suitable place for the "painfully tight family traumas.
"At the end of this curve, it's just too much weight to carry."
DeBiase acknowledged that the final reader of the evening, Mirabai Starr, likely needed little introduction, and Starr opened with appreciation for the two readings before her, and for her brother, Roy, who was there with her, selling books.
Starr then shared her freshest writing, written that very evening - a moving draft of a forward to a collection of writings by her dear friend Elaine Sutton, who passed away in 2017. She ended with an essay about her own mother published this year on Mother's Day in The New York Times . "She modeled for me what it looks like to shatter and mend," Starr read, and to be "open to the amazement in the face of life's small beauties."
Insights into process from Mirabai Starr
Every writer develops her own process, and Starr generously shared some of hers with the Taos News . As she is usually writing on deadline, Starr has learned to write at any time. In a typical writing session, in a space of total solitude and silence, she begins with timed free writing from a Natalie Goldberg prompt and writes "without any filter." Then, with raw material to work with, she sets to refining it, guided by sculptor and painter Michelangelo's reflection: "I saw an angel in the marble and carved until I set him free."
Coming up this week
Curator DeBiase said she wishes to "represent a variety of different types of prose for audiences to get a feel for all the possibilities," and this week's offerings reflect that intention. From fiction in progress today to playwriting Friday evening and during Saturday's workshop, humor on Saturday evening and memoir on Sunday evening.
Today (Nov. 7) at 5 p.m. listeners will be offered the opportunity to hear fiction in progress. Members of Taos' No Coast Writers group, Christine Autumn, Krystal Cretecos and Lauren Bjorkman, will share from their latest projects. Autumn is well-known in Taos for her singing, art and teaching and is completing a book of fiction. Cretecos, who focused mostly on poetry in the past, is working on "a blend of a magical realism memoir and cyber-punk-esque sci-fi novel." Bjorkman is the author of two young adult novels, "My Invented Life" and "Miss Fortune Cookie."
Friday (Nov. 8) at 7 p.m., Ned Dougherty presents Playwright Night, where playwrights will read their own work, offering an uncommon view of both their inspiration and the subject matters of their work. "This event was very successful last year," DeBiase said. "Many people told me they had been wanting to see something like this." Two Wurlitzer Foundation of New Mexico fellows, Erick Forrest Jackson and Kim Merrill, "are well-established playwrights, doing amazing things in their field," DiBiase said. She invited them both. Jackson and Merrill are award-winning dramatists who works have been produced widely.
For those who would like to learn more about playwriting and how these techniques can enrich their own writing, host Ned Dougherty will be teaching a workshop "Playwriting Fun01: Exploring the Building Blocks of a Scene" Saturday (Nov. 9) from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m.
Saturday (Nov. 9) at 7 p.m. will be a reading by humorists Eddie Tafoya from Albuquerque and Robert Wilder of Santa Fe. DiBiase said, "If you want a good laugh, come to this reading." Tafoya is a stand-up comedian and professor of creative writing at New Mexico Highlands University. His most recent book, "The Marxist Revolution," will be released next year, and he has appeared on several television shows, including "The After After Party."
For close to a decade, Wilder contributed a monthly column, "Daddy Needs a Drink," to the Santa Fe Reporter , and he has published a book of essays by the same title, as well as one titled "Tales from the Teachers' Lounge." He has appeared on numerous radio programs and published his essays widely, as well as written a well-reviewed debut novel, "Nickel."
Sunday (Nov. 10) at 5 p.m., "well-loved local writers and partners" Jim Levy and Phaedra Greenwood will individually present their work. Both have published widely. Most recently, they published, "Those Were the Days: Life and Love in 1970s Northern New Mexico," a joint memoir.
Continuing throughout the month
Anyone who would like two hours of scheduled, uninterrupted writing is invited to attend the weekly write-ins to take place at SOMOS on Wednesdays from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. and Sundays from noon to 2 p.m.
All events take place at SOMOS Salon & Bookstore at 108B Civic Plaza Drive, Taos. They are $8; $5 for members. For more information, contact SOMOS at (575) 758-0081 or somos@somostaos.org or visit somostaos.org.

After Tuesday's elections, is there reason for a smidgen of hope?

Texto completo: I've been feeling this strange sensation.
It started on Wednesday morning, and it is not at all unpleasant. I feel warmth for my fellow citizens to the south. And, weirdly, less dread about the future of the entire country. In place of leaden despair, there is something lighter.
Wait. Could this be . . . hope?
It's been a while, but still, I'm pretty sure this is what it used to feel like: The sense that every single thing is not, in fact, going to hell. That, at least sometimes, basic standards of decency will prevail. That, even in the unlikeliest places, enough voters still exist to reject those who say and do awful things.
Can we start with Kentucky? In that deep red state, voters delivered a spectacular, if narrow, victory to Democrat Andy Beshear over incumbent governor and Donald Trump fanboy Matt Bevin on Tuesday. Bevin isn't likely to concede any time soon, and it looks like Republican lawmakers will try to keep him in the corner office by whatever means they can conjure. But his loss has got to smart if you're a Trump cultist in that part of the world.
The president, who won the state by 30 points in 2016, begged voters at a Monday rally to reelect Bevin, who had said and done so many offensive and nutty things that it was easy to see why he and Trump were buds.
“If you lose, they're going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world," Trump told rally-goers. “You can't let that happen to me!"
Oof! They let it happen to him. Like being booed at a baseball game and at an UFC fight, that has got to sting. You have to think that Bevin's loss — especially among suburban voters — will sow a little fear in Trumpland: Why, perhaps even soulless Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell — also of Kentucky — is rethinking his blind fealty to his president, or at least losing a little sleep.
Then again, nah. Mitch is a man without honor, and Bevin's loss was mostly about Bevin.
For heartening change that will stick, look to Virginia, where voters delivered Democratic majorities in both chambers of state government, revealing a commonwealth that is now reliably blue, and good with women candidates, who made many of the gains.
With Democratic majorities, Virginia can now make serious progress: Legislators can undo Republican gerrymandering (imagine, the party that wins a majority of votes winning a majority of seats!), raise the minimum wage, enact gun safety laws, and even force a national discussion of the Equal Rights Amendment, which would enshrine equal protections for women in the US Constitution. Delightful!
Closer to home, where we're spoiled for good news, there was plenty of it on Tuesday night. Jasiel Correia is leaving the mayor's office in Fall River: It seems that enough voters there finally see that he didn't have their best interests at heart. A truckload of federal indictments for fraud and corruption might have been the tip-off there.
And in Boston, voters elected a City Council dominated by women, progressives, and people of color — many of them big thinkers with powerful ambitions for themselves and the city. It's no less than residents of this majority-minority city — and its pressing problems — deserve.
Such progress warms the heart. Why, it almost makes one optimistic about the future.
Until reality intrudes to crush the election's sugar rush. Nobody with my inbox could stay hopeful for long, anyway. After all, Trump is still president, the man and his cruel policies enabled by a GOP that appears determined to look the other way, even as evidence piles up of impeachable offenses.
Worse, as a New York Times poll earlier this week revealed, he might yet win reelection because, though he trails in national polls, Trump is still formidable in the battleground states that carried him to Electoral College victory in 2016. And, worse still, there remain plenty of voters — even among those inclined to choose a Democrat for president — who are turned off by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren solely because she's a woman. Female presidential candidates are “super unlikable," one respondent said. In 2019.
Ah, there is that familiar leaden thing again.
Hello darkness, my old friend.

New York Times Adds More Online Subscribers, but Expects Continued Ad Declines, Higher Costs; Company now has 4.1 million paid digital subscribers, with 529,000 coming from international markets

Texto completo: New York Times Co. reported strong digital-subscription growth in the third quarter, but earnings suffered from a drop in advertising revenue, which the company said would accelerate in the following quarter.
The Times reported net income of $16.4 million, or 10 cents a share, for the quarter, down 34% from $25 million, or 15 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. On an adjusted basis to exclude severance and some retirement costs, the company reported earnings per share of 12 cents.
Revenue rose 2.7% to $428.5 million from $417.3 million in the third quarter last year, driven by a 3.7% increase in subscription revenue and a 26% rise in other revenue, mostly coming from the Times's new television program, "The Weekly."
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast adjusted earnings of 10 cents a share on revenue of $429.1 million.
Advertising revenue fell 6.7% to $113.5 million. Revenue from digital advertising declined 5.4% to $54.7 million, while print advertising revenue dropped 7.9% to $58.9 million.
The company forecast that both total advertising revenue and digital advertising revenue would fall in the fourth quarter by midteen percent from the year-earlier period.
"Like other publishers, we're seeing continued turbulence in the digital advertising space," Chief Executive Mark Thompson said in a statement. "We expect a fairly challenging fourth quarter."
Times shares were 4% lower in morning trading in New York. The stock remains up more than 35% so far this year.
Operating costs for the quarter rose 5.4% to $401.5 million, driven by the cost of an expanding newsroom and product development team—and increased costs related to the paper's new television series, "The Weekly." The company says it now employs 1,700 newsroom staffers, an all-time high.
Marketing expenses, which had been rising in recent quarters as part of an effort to boost digital subscriptions, declined in the third quarter to $38.4 million from $40.4 million a year earlier.
The company expects operating costs to increase in the fourth quarter by low-single digit percent and even higher in 2020.
Digital-subscription growth continued with 273,000 additional customers in the quarter. Of those, 209,000 signed up to the paper's core news offering and 64,000 for its lower-cost cooking and crossword apps.
The Times said it ended the quarter with 4.1 million paid digital subscribers—3.2 million for core news and 0.9 million for the cooking and crossword apps. About half a million subscribers came from international markets. Including print subscribers, the Times had 4.9 million paying customers at the end of the quarter.
"We are clearly seeing acceleration of our digital subscription model," said Mr. Thompson said later Wednesday during a call with analysts. "The weight and complexity of the stories—impeachment, Brexit, Boeing and so on—plays to the strength of Times journalism."
He said the company was confident that it would reach its goal of 10 million total subscriptions by 2025, and projected that two million of those will come from international markets.
Subscription revenue rose to $267.3 million from $257.8 million a year earlier. That was driven by an increase in revenue from digital subscriptions, which rose 14.5% on the year to $115.9 million.
The company forecast low-to-mid-single digit growth in the subscription revenue for the fourth quarter with digital-only subscription revenue rising by midteen percent.
Other revenue rose to $47.7 million in the quarter from $37.9 million the year before and was expected to increase further in the next quarter due to revenue from a licensing deal the Times has signed with Facebook Inc. to contribute content to the social-media platform's recently launched news product.
"This is the first time that a Silicon Valley major has recognized the value of Times journalism to its platform and has agreed to pay a substantial fee for it," Mr. Thompson said. The company didn't disclose the terms of the deal.
Facebook has reached licensing deals with numerous news organizations, including The Wall Street Journal's parent company, News Corp, to participate in its news product. In all, the product will include news from some 200 publications, although many aren't being paid licensing fees.

Texto completo: Multiple published reports say that the U.S. government has launched a national-security review of the China-owned video app TikTok, popular with millions of U.S. teens and young adults.
The reports Friday from Reuters,The New York Times and others said that the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews acquisitions by foreign firms, has opened an inquiry into TikTok owner ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of a predecessor app, Musical.ly.
Several senators have recently noted concerns about censorship and data collection on TikTok.
The Treasury Department, which houses CFIUS, said it does not comment on specific cases because the agency by law cannot disclose to the public information filed to it.
TikTok said it cannot comment on ongoing regulatory processes. But it said it "has made clear that we have no higher priority than earning the trust of users and regulators in the U.S. Part of that effort includes working with Congress and we are committed to doing so."
After acquiring Musical.ly, Beijing-based ByteDance merged it into TikTok. Musical.ly, popular in the U.S. and Europe, had operated out of offices in Shanghai and California.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) last month sent a letter to Treasury requesting a CFIUS review of the national-security implications of the Musical.ly deal, saying there is "ample and growing evidence" that TikTok is censoring content that is not in line with the Chinese government. In the letter, he said there had been questions about why the app had so few videos of the recent protests in Hong Kong.
Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) later in October asked for the U.S. intelligence community to assess national-security risks of TikTok and other Chinese-owned content platforms in the U.S. They said that while TikTok says it stores U.S. user data in the U.S., the company must still adhere to Chinese law on supplying information to the government. Such accusations have also been leveled against other Chinese companies, including Huawei.
The senators also said that TikTok is a potential target of foreign influence campaigns similar to Russia's attempts to undermine the 2016 U.S. election on Facebook.
TikTok has said its data is not subject to Chinese law and that it does not remove content based on "sensitivities related to China."
On the app, people share short videos, often set to music. They lip-sync and dance to songs, do silly pranks and share other bits of their lives. It's searchable by user names, songs and hashtags, like "thisishalloween" or "tiktokcats."
The government has stepped in several times over the past few years to block or break up Chinese deals. A Chinese company that owns the gay dating app Grindr reportedly agreed to sell it earlier this year after a CFIUS review. Broadcom, based in Singapore, was stopped from going after U.S. chip maker Qualcomm because of U.S. national-security concerns over losing dominance in the race to for leadership in "5G" wireless, particularly to China. Qualcomm is a major telecom supplier.

Texto completo: For the Monitor
I am a proud descendant of the Blackfeet Nation. Like many of you, my upbringing allows me to be keenly aware of the sacred circle of life. Right now this circle is broken, and it affects our planet, ecosystem, food system, biodiversity, humanity, all species and Mother Earth.
We live in a time of dangerous change, and it is time to join together and save our one planet. Right now we are in the sixth mass extinction. It sounds overwhelming, but it is the truth.
David Festa shared this in his Environmental Defense Fund article headlined, “Humans are causing 1 million species to go extinct.” People may debate the exact number, but the fact that we are in this stage of loss is tragic. We need to stop our current trajectory to lessen the damage in the future or there will not be future generations.
The New York Times reported Nov. 27, 2018, on “the insect apocalypse.” It's a part of the current worldwide loss, known as the sixth extinction, which is the sixth time in the Earth's history that large numbers of species disappear in unusually rapid succession.
In the past, various studies have estimated the amount of time for us to try to overcome this is 10 to 12 years; another study stated that we have five years. Most recently Matt McGrath, a BBC environmental correspondent, wrote a story headlined, “Climate change: 12 years to save the planet? Make that 18 months.”
This time the extinctions are not caused by asteroids but humans. Insects and especially pollinators, native and nonnative, are in danger. They are crucial to our survival. Pollinators support one in three bites of food we eat each day. We need these amazing pollinators to support and sustain our food system.
Alarmingly, the U.S. government is developing drone to technology to pollinate crops. In a 2012 article by Dave Goulson headlined, “Decline of Bees forces China's apple farmers to pollinate by hand,” he shared that some orchards are being hand pollinated. To my knowledge this is still happening. This is a crisis, and the fact that humans need to do this is an alert to humanity and Mother Earth. In our country the EPA has just approved use of pesticides that are more harmful to bees, while in Europe a fourth neonic is being banned.
Sadly, in New Hampshire the rusty patched bumblebee is believed to be locally extinct. New Hampshire lawmakers are now working to pass legislation to address the crisis: House Bill 646-FN: “The Saving New Hampshire's Pollinators Act.” Members of N.H. Save Our Pollinators Coalition and Non Toxic N.H. have collected more than 2,500 signatures in support of the bill. It recently passed the House Environment and Agriculture subcommittee. This was a first victory and now it moves to the executive session for a vote on Thursday at 10 a.m. in Legislative Lobby Room 303 in Concord.
Please attend and support the bill by wearing yellow and sharing your posters. This bill is championed by state Rep. Catherine Sofitikis, D-Nashua. We hope the bill passes this step and moves forward.
We need to take vital steps to protect our biodiversity and environment, especially pollinators. We must peacefully raise awareness and take positive action to preserve and protect all species, especially pollinators in the United States and globally.
As a fellow human being on this incredible planet, I implore all of you to take notice and action to help stop this extinction. We are indeed a threat to ourselves. I still believe in the innate goodness in humanity to care for all living things, including ourselves and our world.

Why the media resists naming whistleblower

Texto completo: President Trump and his allies say there's a gaping hole in the middle of the biggest news story in years: the name of the federal whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry that now threatens Trump's presidency.
They've called on news organizations to reveal the name of the CIA officer who first raised concerns about Trump's phone call with the president of Ukraine. Yet despite apparent knowledge of the individual's identity among people in Washington, his name hasn't been widely reported.
One online publication, Real Clear Investigations, offered a lengthy, if unconfirmed, account about the whistleblower's identity last week. But its reporting was largely ignored. Outside of a few conservative news sources such as RedState.com and Breitbart and personalities such as Rush Limbaugh, the story didn't get much traction.
How come?
The answer appears to lie in several factors: concerns that revealing the name could jeopardize the whistleblower's safety; legal questions about whether the whistleblower's identity is protected by federal law; and potential adverse public reaction to such a disclosure. There's also a question about whether the person identified in news accounts and bandied about the Internet so far actually is the whistleblower.
Trump has repeatedly said he deserves to know the identity of his accuser. His allies have made similar calls; at a Trump reelection rally in Kentucky Monday night, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) demanded the news media disclose it. "Do your job and print his name," he said.
Some in the media say the whistleblower's identity is less newsworthy now that multiple federal officials have corroborated elements of his or her complaint that Trump allegedly strong-armed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call, insisting that his government investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a Democratic rival, and his son, Hunter.
"I'm not convinced his identity is important at this point, or at least important enough to put him at any risk, or to unmask someone who doesn't want to be identified," said Dean Baquet, executive editor of the New York Times. "Pretty much everything has now been discussed or confirmed on the record, multiple times, by others in the administration. So I'm not sure I see the point of unmasking someone who wants to remain anonymous."
The Washington Post, the Times and the Associated Press have reported that the whistleblower is a male CIA officer, but none has identified the individual.
Both Baquet and AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said the intelligence community connection was an important part of the story because - at least at that point several weeks ago - readers had very little information by which to assess the value or veracity of the whistleblower's complaint.
Easton said Tuesday that the AP has continued to keep the name under wraps because "AP typically refrains from identifying whistleblowers." She did not explain why.
Post spokeswoman Kris Coratti said The Post wasn't naming an individual because it "has long respected the right of whistleblowers to report wrongdoing in confidence, which protects them against retaliation."
She added, "We also withhold identities or other facts when we believe that publication would put an individual at risk. Both of those considerations apply in this case."
Other news organizations didn't respond to requests for comment, or were terse in reply. The Wall Street Journal and Fox News declined to explain their approach. NBC News said it wasn't naming the individual "until or unless they identify themselves publicly." It also did not say why.
CNN had no response.
On Monday, Fox News host Sean Hannity suggested on his program that he knew the name of the whistleblower but was withholding it because of alleged legal threats. "I actually have multiple confirmations of who the whistleblower is," he said on the air. "But you know what? I'll play the game for a little bit, and I'll take the lawyers' threats that they're going to sue me." Such a lawsuit, he said, "wouldn't go anywhere."
Reporters frequently withhold names of sources. They also don't reveal the names of victims of certain crimes, such as rape. But neither of those circumstances apply to a whistleblower.
The mainstream media's silence is puzzling to Tom Kuntz, the editor of Real Clear Investigations (RCI), which published its whistleblower investigation last week.
"The silence has been deafening," he said. "It's almost like there's a code of omerta [the Mafia vow of silence] about what media organizations can report. . . . There's a herd mentality and a reluctance to cut against the grain."
RCI is an offshoot of Real Clear Media, a digital company best known for Real Clear Politics, a site that aggregates a wide spectrum of political reporting and commentary and produces original work. RCI is funded by a nonprofit foundation associated with the for-profit company.
Kuntz says journalists should identify newsworthy sources whenever they can, so that readers or viewers can judge their credibility for themselves. In the case of someone asserting that a crime had been committed, he argued that it's also a question of fairness and due process. That is, Trump should be able to face his accuser, as Trump himself has argued.
However, the whistleblower's attorney, Mark Zaid, has said that revealing the whistleblower's name could subject him to physical or professional reprisals and could discourage future whistleblowers from coming forward. Zaid has said he would never confirm or deny the identity of his client.
But both Kuntz and Baquet disputed the notion, advanced by Hannity, that a news organization would face legal consequences by publishing the name.
In nearly a week since publishing its story, RCI hasn't received any legal threats, Kuntz said. Baquet said he didn't foresee any such penalty, either, "especially if there was a truly compelling journalistic reason" for disclosing the name.

New York Times stokes backlash for tweet about Mexico slayings

Texto completo: People on social media blasted the New York Times for a Twitter headline that seemingly minimized the deaths of nine members of an American family in Mexico and implied their religion was to blame.
The headline on Twitter read, “Brutal Killings Spotlight Small Religious Sect in Mexico,” with a description that said, “The brutal killing of 9 members of an American family in northern Mexico on Monday highlights the long history of religious fundamentalist settlers in the region. Our religion reporter, Elizabeth Dias, details their history back to the early 20th century.”
Tweet
The article, penned by a religion reporter, has the headline, “Murder in Mexico: Mormon Families Have a Long History There,” and goes in-depth about a fundamentalist offshoot of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and how they settled in the region decades ago after splintering off from the Mormons.
On social media, some said the tweet was tone deaf in light of the six children and three women who were slaughtered by gunmen on Monday.
Tweet TweetTweetTweet
Some drew parallels between the tweet and when the Washington Post briefly changed the headline of its obituary for Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi to refer to him as an “austere religious scholar.”
Tweet Tweet Tweet
The women and children killed Monday were part of the LeBarón family. The assailants, who have not been identified, shot and killed several of the victims, while others were trapped inside a burning vehicle.

Texto completo: President Trump offered U.S. military support to Mexico after a Mormon family with U.S. citizenship was massacred.
At least six American children and three women were killed when they were ambushed in northern Mexico on Monday, members of the LeBarón family said.
Trump tweeted Tuesday that the family “got caught between two vicious drug cartels, who were shooting at each other.”
“If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these monsters, the United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively,” Trump tweeted.
“This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth. We merely await a call from your great new president!” he said.
Tweet Tweet
Julian LeBarón, a cousin of the three women who were driving the vehicles, told the New York Times that one of the women, Rhonita, was on her way to Phoenix to pick up her husband, who works in North Dakota and was returning home to celebrate their wedding anniversary when her car broke down.
The gunmen “opened fire on Rhonita and torched her car,” he said. The woman, a 9-year-old girl, an 11-year-old boy, and twins less than a year old were killed, he said.
When the rest of the group returned to the first car, they were also ambushed.
“Six little kids were killed, and seven made it out alive,” LeBarón said.
The LeBarón family settled in Mexico decades ago after disagreeing with the central church over polygamy.
Kenny LeBarón, another cousin of the women, said much of his family now lives in North Dakota, but they regularly travel to Mexico for holidays and vacations.

Texto completo: Even by Donald Trump’s standards, his tweet of Oct. 23 — the one that called NeverTrumpers “human scum” — plumbed new depths in the debasement of presidential speech.
But what else has changed? If Robert Ballard, who discovered the wreck of the Titanic, were given the job of finding Trump’s moral bottom, he’d fail.
Far more revealing in Trump’s tweet was its first sentence. “The Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats,” the president wrote, before warning of their scummy natures.
Think that one over. If the few remaining NeverTrump conservatives can still be that dangerous while we’re on respirators, we must be powerful indeed. Somewhere in eternity’s permanent exile, Leon Trotsky is smiling.
Yet Trump’s tweet is basically right on both counts. As a movement, NeverTrumpism is on life support. And the president has greater reasons than ever to fear it.
Three years ago, on the eve of the election, the NeverTrump coalition was a wide one, ranging from hard-core conservatives like Erick Erickson and Ted Cruz to somewhat squishier ones like Michael Gerson, John Podhoretz and, well, me.
Then Trump won. The guy who was supposed to lead his party to a catastrophic defeat became the man who, in the eyes of the right, uniquely figured out how to save the country from Hillary Clinton. The coarseness of speech and crudeness of character that were supposed to be his central flaws became evidence of his gutsy indifference to liberal reproach.
There were also those conservative policy and political victories. Regulatory rollback. Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and all the lower court judges. Increased military spending. The tax cut. Withdrawal from the Iran deal. An expanded GOP majority in the Senate. The Mueller fizzle.
The NeverTrumpers scattered. Some became ex-conservatives. Others, full-on Trumpers. Still others, anti-anti-Trumpers — which only meant they were smart enough to see the president for what he is and churlish enough to be angry at those who wouldn’t join them in capitulating to it.
Yet the NeverTrumpers never scattered entirely, and thank heavens for that. Every political system will always have a conservative faction, and every healthy democracy needs that faction to be rooted in some combination of classical liberalism and moral traditionalism. Trump’s GOP, whatever its political fortunes, is the opposite: a nativist party led by a libertine.
At some level, conservatives know this. Trump knows they know it. Which explains why he has turned his sights on NeverTrumpers: What despots and demagogues fear most is their followers developing a conscience.
No wonder the president chose to lambaste Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman as a “Never Trumper.” The combat veteran had the simple decency of being scandalized by what he heard from the president on the Ukraine phone call, and by what he knew of the discrepancies between what he heard on the call and the account of it released by the White House.
The decency of being scandalized is what being NeverTrump is centrally about, and why the movement remains important. It’s the opposite of the opportunism required to go along with the president because you might get something out of him.
It’s the same sense of scandal that led to the first significant GOP revolt against Trump since John McCain turned his thumb down on Obamacare repeal in 2017: the suppurating disgust even pliant conservatives like Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham feel at Trump’s cavalier betrayal of the Kurds. It could motivate John Bolton (a born-again NeverTrumper, along with John Kelly, Rex Tillerson, H.R. McMaster, Anthony Scaramucci and everyone else who made the mistake of working for this president) to deliver what may yet be the most devastating insider’s indictment of the president’s shameless shadow foreign policy.
And it helps explain why the president’s support with his base is slipping at last. A new poll finds Trump’s support among Republicans at 74% — an 8-point decline since September and the lowest since he was elected. Nearly 1 in 5 Republicans support impeachment and removal. So do 47% of independents. These numbers will not move in Trump’s favor if the truth about his drug deals (to borrow Bolton’s phrase) continues to come to light.
I doubt any of this will be sufficient to get at least 20 Republican senators to vote for Trump’s removal from office. But Trump knows that the number needed to spell his moral defeat on impeachment is four. If Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and one other Republican join the Democrats to convict, the political humiliation will be thunderous. And, as my colleague David Leonhardt has convinced me, it could devastate his re-election chances. If the administration thinks impeachment is such a political winner, they wouldn’t be fighting it this hard.
In the meantime, someone ought to print “Human Scum” on a limited-edition T-shirt. Given who said it about whom, it turns out to be a badge of honor.

Paul Krugman: Elizabeth Warren and the Wrath of the Wall Street Snowflakes

Texto completo: Given all the recent focus on health policy, you might think that the medical-industrial complex would be heavily involved in the Democratic primary race, going all out to block Elizabeth Warren. And a coalition of drug companies, insurers and hospitals is indeed running ads attacking “Medicare for All.”
But the health industry’s political role has been relatively muted so far. Partly this may reflect realism: Even if Warren becomes president, the chances of getting Medicare for All through Congress are small. It may also reflect the surprising openness of doctors to reform. While the American Medical Association still officially opposes single-payer, at a recent meeting, 47% of the delegates voted to drop that opposition.
No, the really intense backlash against Warren and progressive Democrats in general is coming from Wall Street. And while that opposition partly reflects self-interest, Wall Street’s Warren hatred has a level of virulence, sometimes crossing into hysteria, that goes beyond normal political calculation.
What’s behind that virulence?
First, let’s talk about the rational reasons Wall Street is worried about Warren. She is, of course, calling for major tax increases on the very wealthy, those with wealth exceeding $50 million, and the financial industry is strongly represented in that elite club. And since raising taxes on the wealthy is highly popular, it’s an idea a progressive president might actually be able to turn into real policy.
Warren is also a big believer in stricter financial regulation; the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was highly effective until the Trump administration set about gutting it, was her brainchild.
So if you are a Wall Street billionaire, rational self-interest might well induce you to oppose Warren. Rationality does not, however, explain why a money manager like Leon Cooperman — who just two years ago settled a suit over insider trading for $5 million, although without admitting wrongdoing — would circulate an embarrassing, self-pitying open letter denouncing Warren for her failure to appreciate all the wonderful things billionaires like him do for society.
Nor does it explain why Cliff Asness, another money manager, would fly into a rage at Warren adviser Gabriel Zucman for using the term “revenue maximizing” — a standard piece of economic jargon — describing it as “disgustingly immoral.”
The real tell here, I think, is that much of the Wall Street vitriol now being directed at Warren was previously directed at, of all people, President Barack Obama.
Objectively, Obama treated Wall Street with kid gloves. In the aftermath of a devastating financial crisis, his administration bailed out collapsing institutions on favorable terms. He and Democrats in Congress did impose some new regulations, but they were very mild compared with the regulations put in place after the banking crisis of the 1930s.
He did, however, refer on a few occasions to “fat cat” bankers and suggested that financial-industry excesses were responsible for the 2008 crisis because, well, they were. And the result, quite early in his administration, was that Wall Street became consumed with “Obama rage,” and the financial industry went all in for Mitt Romney in 2012.
I wonder, by the way, if this history helps explain an odd aspect of fundraising in the current primary campaign. It’s not surprising that Warren is getting very little money from the financial sector. It is, however, surprising that the top recipient isn’t Joe Biden but Pete Buttigieg, who’s running a fairly distant fourth in the polls. Is Biden suffering from the lingering effects of that old-time Obama rage?
In any case, the point is that Wall Street billionaires, even more than billionaires in general, seem to be snowflakes, emotionally unable to handle criticism.
I’m not sure why that should be the case, but it may be that in their hearts they suspect that the critics have a point.
What, after all, does modern finance actually do for the economy? Unlike the robber barons of yore, today’s Wall Street tycoons don’t build anything tangible. They don’t even direct money to the people who actually are building the industries of the future. The vast expansion of credit in America after around 1980 basically involved a surge in consumer debt rather than new money for business investment.
Moreover, there is growing evidence that when the financial sector gets too big it actually acts as a drag on the economy — and America is well past that point.
Now, human nature being what it is, people who secretly wonder whether they really deserve their wealth get especially angry when others express these doubts publicly. So it’s not surprising that people who couldn’t handle Obama’s mild, polite criticism are completely losing it over Warren.
What this means is that you should beware of Wall Street claims that progressive policies would have dire effects. Such claims don’t reflect deep economic wisdom; to a large extent they’re coming from people with vast wealth but fragile egos, whose rants should be discounted appropriately.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump loses in a hypothetical matchup with all the leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Tuesday.
Trump – who has a job approval rating 20 percentage points lower than his disapproval rating of 58% – trails by sizable margins against former Vice President Joe Biden (56%-39%); Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (54%-39%); Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (56%-39%); South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (52%-41%); and Sen. Kamala Harris of California (52%-41%).
Each of those Democratic candidates performed well against Trump in a Post-ABC poll Sept. 5, and all of them expanded those leads in this week's survey.
Experts said a national poll more than a year away from the general election is not necessarily the best predictor of Trump's reelection chances.
Morgan State University journalism professor Jason Johnson said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" that the poll was an outlier relative to other surveys that have looked at head-to-head matchups and that "the real numbers that are the best indicators of what will happen in 2020" won't start coming out until after the holiday season.
'I have the real polls': Trump calls Fox News polls 'lousy' after survey finds 49% support impeachment
"The top four or five candidates probably do lead Trump, and they probably do lead the president in a lot of swing states," Johnson said. "But I don't think anyone in our current political environment is going to beat the incumbent president by 10, 12 points. "
MSNBC analyst John Heilemann said there "literally is almost nothing more meaningless right now than head-to-head polls that are national more than a year out from the election. "
"It's a terrible mistake for Democrats to look at these national numbers and get overconfident," he said, pointing to how competitive the race is in the battleground states that will determine who wins in the Electoral College.
A recent poll from The New York Times and Siena College found Trump narrowly leading Warren and Sanders among likely voters in most of the tossup states that will be critical to the election outcome. Out of the six states in the poll, Trump led Biden only in North Carolina, but he was within the margin of error in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Arizona.
More: Biden leads Trump in battleground states, but Warren does not, poll finds
According to the Post-ABC poll, most Americans share negative opinions of Trump in a number of areas. Sixty-three percent say they don't think the president is "honest and trustworthy," 62% say he lacks presidential temperament, 60% say he does not understand their problems, 55% say he is not good at making political deals and 54% say he is not a strong leader.
Fifty-four percent say the United States is less respected around the world as a result of the Trump administration's policies. Half of Americans say Trump uses the office of the presidency to boost profits at his hotels and golf courses, and 46% say that is unacceptable.
Forty-nine percent favor impeaching Trump and removing him from office, and 47% are opposed. In contrast, Post-ABC polls found support for President Bill Clinton's impeachment at 27% to 41% in 1998.
Trump is accused of using the power of the presidency to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden and of using his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to help apply that pressure. Sixty percent of respondents say it was inappropriate for Trump to involve Giuliani in U. S. foreign policy, and 55% say Trump did something wrong – though 8% say they don't think it was a serious matter.
Slightly more than two-thirds of Republican-leaning voters want to see Trump as their party's nominee in 2020, and 30% say they would prefer someone else.

Biden leads the Democratic field with 27%, followed by Warren at 21%, Sanders at 19% and Buttigieg at 7%. Harris is tied at 2% with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
When asked who has the best chance of beating Trump in November, 42% of Democratic-leaning voters say Biden, 17% say Warren and 16% say Sanders.
The poll was conducted Oct. 27-30 using a random sample of 1,003 adults, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3. 5%.

Texto completo: The board of commissioners in Citrus County, Florida, says it will no longer pay for the county library's digital subscription to The New York Times, citing the newspaper's "fake news. "
At the meeting Oct. 24, the five-member commission was asked to approve a $2,700 expenditure for the annual subscription. The motion was seconded and appeared to be bound for approval when three commissioners spoke up.
"Do we really need to subscribe to the New York Times?" Commissioner Ron Kitchen asked.
That set off Commissioner Scott Carnahan, who had seconded the motion less than a minute earlier.
"I actually was going to say that," Carnahan said. "I am going to be voting no for this. Fake news. I agree with President Trump. I won't be voting for this. I don't want the New York Times in the county. "
Carnahan was unmoved when reminded the library had sought approval to provide the subscription to its 70,000 cardholders.
"I understand, but they can take that money and do something else with it," he said. "Those (Times readers) can subscribe and have it come to their homes. I support Donald Trump. "
The latest on Trump: Trump's phone records back details of 'Apprentice' contestant's assault claim, lawyer says
Kitchen said he wouldn't support it either, citing a readership estimated at about 140.
"I won't go into all the details, but when I saw $2,700 a year for digital format for a newspaper," he said. "(Not) many people are actually reading that for $2,700 a year. "
The motion was withdrawn, drawing praise from Commissioner Jimmie Smith.
"I truly appreciate that because I have to ask why the heck we would spend money on something like that," he said.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly railed against the "failing" New York Times and other news outlets, citing "fake news. "
Sandy Price, chairwoman of the Citrus County Special Library District Advisory Board, said she was disappointed in the decision, adding that the board will discuss it at a meeting this month.
“Someone’s personal political view does not have a place in deciding what library resources are available for the entire county,” Price told the Citrus County Chronicle. “Libraries have to ensure all points of view are represented. ”
'You don't have this problem': Trump vents to Putin about frustration with reporters
Most of the commissioners stood by the decision this week. Commissioner Brian Coleman, however, said the decision should be reviewed.
“Do I think I made a mistake? Yes,” Coleman told the Chronicle. “Our decision should have been impartial, instead of having it become a personal thing. ”

Texto completo: Man, 27, charged in alleged plot to bomb Colo. synagogue
DENVER -- A man who repeatedly espoused anti-Semitic views has been arrested in a plot to bomb a historic Colorado synagogue, federal officials said Monday.
The co-conspirators in the plot turned out to be undercover agents, who arrested the man shortly before he planned to bomb the synagogue early Saturday, according to court documents.
Richard Holzer was arrested Friday in Pueblo just after the agents brought him what he believed were two pipe bombs along with 14 sticks of dynamite to blow up Temple Emanuel. The explosives were incapable of causing damage, authorities said.
Holzer, 27, described what he thought were explosives as "absolutely gorgeous" and said they should go ahead with the attack overnight to avoid police, the court document said.
Holzer, who lives in Pueblo, briefly appeared in court Monday in handcuffs. He told U.S. Magistrate Judge Kristen Mix that he understood the charge against him, and she scheduled his next court date for Thursday. She granted his request for a public defender.
The foiled plot is the latest attempted attack against a synagogue in the U.S. in just over a year.
In October 2018, a shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh killed 11 people and became the deadliest attack on Jews in modern U.S. history.
According to the Anti-Defamation League, Holzer's arrest is the 13th time someone has been arrested on accusations of plotting attacks or making threats against the Jewish community since then.

Border Patrol agent shoots, kills gunman who opened fire
SUNLAND PARK, N.M. -- A U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and killed a gunman who opened fire about a mile from the border with Mexico, immigration officials said.
The agent approached a group of four people early Monday, and one of them pulled out a gun and started shooting, according to a statement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
The agent fired back, hitting the man, who died at a hospital. No agents were hurt during the shooting in Sunland Park, a suburb of El Paso, Texas.
No additional information was released, including the names of the agent and gunman. The CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating the shooting.
New Mexico State police and FBI also are investigating, Albuquerque FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said.

DOJ sends letter to publisher of book by anonymous writer
NEW YORK -- The Justice Department has sent a letter to the publisher and literary agency of the anonymous government official whose book is scheduled to come out Nov. 19. The letter raises questions over whether any confidentiality agreement has been violated and asked for information that could help reveal the author's identity.
The publisher, Hachette Book Group, responded by saying it would provide no additional information beyond calling the author a "current or former senior official."
The book, "A Warning," is by the official who wrote an essay published last year in The New York Times, alleging that numerous people in the government were resisting the "misguided impulses" of President Donald Trump.

Advice columnist sues Trump for calling sex assault claim a lie
NEW YORK -- An advice columnist for Elle magazine who has accused President Donald Trump of raping her in a New York City department store dressing room in the 1990s sued him Monday, saying he defamed her by calling her a liar whom he had never even met.
E. Jean Carroll's lawsuit, filed Monday in New York, says Trump "smeared her integrity, honesty and dignity -- all in the national press" when he responded to her allegations, first broached in a New York magazine article this past June.
A message requesting comment was sent to a law firm that has represented Trump in other cases.
Carroll is among over a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or sexual assault, or both, predating his presidency.

Texan in school shooting said to be unfit for trial
HOUSTON -- The trial for a teenager accused of fatally shooting 10 people at a Texas high school will be delayed while he receives mental health treatment, his attorney said Monday.
The news comes after three experts -- one for the defense, one appointed by the court and one picked by prosecutors -- found Dimitrios Pagourtzis incompetent to stand trial, said Nick Poehl, one of Pagourtzis' attorneys.
Kevin Petroff, the first assistant district attorney for Galveston County, said his office was working to meet with all families of the victims before making any statement.
Pagourtzis, 19, is charged with capital murder in the May 18, 2018, attack at Santa Fe High School, which is 50 miles southeast of Houston. His trial was set to start Feb. 18. Because he was 17 at the time of the attack, he is not eligible for the death penalty.

'King Perry' pleads guilty in $115 million Ponzi scheme
SCRANTON, Pa. -- The fraudster called himself "King Perry," and for a while he lived like royalty.
Perry Santillo masterminded an investment scam that collected more than $115 million from 1,000 investors around the country, using some of the proceeds to fund a lavish lifestyle of cars, casino junkets and houses in multiple states, according to federal securities regulators.
The Ponzi scheme collapsed, and Santillo, of Rochester, New York, is likely to trade his fancy duds for prison attire when he is sentenced on criminal conspiracy and fraud charges.
He appeared Monday in federal court to plead guilty to a federal fraud charge, having already entered a guilty plea last month to similar charges in Rochester. Each charge carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.
In Oklahoma: A jury Monday found an Oklahoma City police officer guilty of second-degree murder in the shooting death of a suicidal man who was threatening to set himself on fire.
The jury deliberated 5 1/2 hours before finding Sgt. Keith Sweeney guilty in the Nov. 15, 2017, death of Dustin Pigeon, 29, and recommending a 10-year prison sentence. Second-degree murder is punishable by 10 years to life in prison.
Sweeney was among officers who found Pigeon doused in lighter fluid and threatening to set himself on fire in a courtyard. Prosecutors say Sweeney shot Pigeon after another officer fired a bean bag. An affidavit says Pigeon was unarmed and did not pose a threat when he was shot.

Texto completo: If you are looking for the perfect gift for your most stylish friend, several new books are bound to please. While the words "icon" or "legendary" get thrown around loosely, these books all feature true masters of style in different genres: men's and women's fashion, music and art. Whether it's getting a rare peek behind the making of Chanel's haute couture collection or slice-of-life images of New York street style, there's something guaranteed to delight and inspire any reader.
"Bowie: An Illustrated Life"
By María Hesse and Fran Ruiz
One of the most innovative artists of the 20th century, David Bowie created work that crossed genres and shattered boundaries. This inventive biography told through María Hesse's hip illustrations and text by Fran Ruiz explores his life from his working-class childhood as David Jones to his transformation to David Bowie and eventual superstardom to the final recording sessions before his death from cancer in 2016. Told from Bowie's viewpoint, readers follow along his personal and professional life and meet many of the famous musicians he interacted with, including Iggy Pop, Brian Eno, Freddie Mercury and others. $21.95
"Chanel: The Making
of a Collection"
By Laetitia Cénac, Illustrated by Jean-Philippe Delhome
Rarely can mere mortals glimpse how a fashion collection comes together from idea to fruition, but the new book about the House of Chanel by fashion writer Laetitia Cénac pulls back the curtains. This 240-page book contains hundreds of color illustrations by famed artist Jean-Philippe Delhomme detailing Karl Lagerfeld's Spring 2019 collection - Lagerfeld's last before his death. The book also highlights the work of the artisans who create the fashion house's distinct style, the embroiderers, flower-makers, shoemakers and many others. Cénac weaves in the history of the iconic house with its contemporary collections. $35
"I've Seen the Future and I'm Not Going:
The Art Scene and Downtown New York
in the 1980s"
By Peter McGough
In his memoir, artist Peter McGough tells of that almost-mythical time in New York's pregentrified Lower East Side in the 1980s, when he fell into the East Village's art scene, getting to know artists like Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, and frequenting mythic locations like Studio 54 and the Chelsea Hotel.
When McGough first moved to New York in 1980, he met and fell in love with another artist, David McDermott, and has collaborated with him ever since. McDermott and McGough became as well-known for their work in painting and photography as much as their lifestyle, which embraced a Victorian aesthetic in all they did, including wearing top hats and detachable collars and living in a converted townhouse lit only by candlelight.
Their paintings were backdated to various decades, depending on the subject, adding a highly conceptual element to the work, and their photography was produced in historical processes such as cyanotype, gum bichromate and salt prints, leading the duo to became hugely successful, and showing in three Whitney Biennials. Told with humor, McGough looks back at their professional and romantic partnership and struggles. $29.95
"Hunks & Heroes:
Jim Moore Four Decades of Fashion at GQ"
By Jim Moore
Few editors have had such an influence on men's fashion as Jim Moore, GQ magazine's famed creative director at large. For nearly 40 years, Moore shaped modern men's fashion, discovering new designers, highlighting trends and giving fashion advice and critiques. The book contains 250 of Moore's legendary fashion photographs that showcase in an eye-popping manner the magazine's most memorable covers, many in a double gatefold. It's not simply a look book of cool covers and celebrities but also includes Moore's commentary and shows the evolution of men's style through the decades. Classic covers include a 1980s "American Gigolo"-era Richard Gere and Kanye West, who does the forward for the 352-page book. $75
"Bill Cunningham: On the Street: Five Decades of Iconic Photography"
By The New York Times
From the 1970s until his death in 2016, New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham captured New York street style almost daily. A new book by the newspaper chronicles through his eyes not only how fashion changed over nearly 50 years, but also how people and culture changed. The book focuses heavily on style - it includes essays and contributions from Anna Wintour, Guy Trebay and others - but also on important moments, such as the 1980s New York transit strike, the rise of casual Fridays and President Barack Obama's inauguration. The 384-page book contains famous Cunningham photographs that ran in The New York Times and many never-seen-before images of how he captured life. $65

Nancy Pelosi gives Democrats some much-needed advice

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a fair, stern warning for the Democratic candidates vying for the presidency: “Remember November. You must win the Electoral College.”

To Pelosi, the 2020 election isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon. And that means Democrats need to think long term, especially when it comes to their party platform.

“What works in San Francisco does not necessarily work in Michigan,” Pelosi told Bloomberg, adding that “what works in Michigan” does in fact “work in San Francisco,” especially when it comes to “workers’ rights and sharing prosperity.”

Other policies, however, such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, tend to isolate the voters Democrats need to win over in the general election.

“As a left-wing San Francisco liberal I can say to these people: What are you thinking?” Pelosi said. “You can ask the left — they’re unhappy with me for not being a socialist.”

Pelosi seems to understand what Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren doesn’t: The Democratic base to which she is currently appealing for support is not representative of the rest of the country, and neither is President Trump’s base, for that matter. Warren’s plan-for-everything agenda might be enough to secure the Democratic nomination, but it won’t help her win the general election. In fact, Warren would lose to Trump in five of the six key swing states, a recent New York Times poll suggests.

Change, then, must be gradual. On healthcare, Pelosi suggests stepping away from Medicare for All and all of “its complications” and instead returning to the Affordable Care Act, which provides a “path to healthcare for all Americans.”

Pelosi is a pragmatist and on this she’s right. Instead of focusing on the race against Trump, Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and the other liberals are focusing on their inner race against each other to see who can get the furthest to the Left without dropping out. This isn’t a winning strategy. Pelosi knows this, and more importantly, the voters do, too.

Daily on Healthcare, presented by SBEC: ‘Medicare for all’ faces unexpected scrutiny about jobs

‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ QUESTIONS TURN TO JOBS: Democratic presidential candidates faced questions this weekend about what would happen to the jobs of people who work in the health insurance industry, just shortly after Elizabeth Warren put out a funding plan for “Medicare for all.”
It was an unexpected line of questioning. The industry itself isn’t terribly popular with the public. That’s one of the reasons why candidates like Warren and Bernie Sanders aren’t afraid to go after them on a regular basis when they advocate for “Medicare for all,” while at the same time avoiding talk about taking on high costs in the hospital and drug industries, which people view more favorably even though their costs to the system are significantly higher than those of insurers or even drug companies. All of those industries, too, would face tremendous disruption under “Medicare for all.”
Warren had already acknowledged her plan would eliminate 2 million jobs in health insurance, both among people who work directly in the industry and among administrators in hospitals who negotiate with insurers about price. This weekend, she said those laid off workers could switch over to the auto and life insurance industries.
But Sanders had a different answer, saying those people would transition into providing healthcare, and that if elected he would “do everything we can” to provide training and support. He noted that more generous coverage that left no one uninsured would create a shortage of healthcare workers, so there would actually be a need for more jobs on net.
“We will transition those workers from sitting behind a desk arguing with you about whether or not you’re entitled to the coverage you thought you were into a more productive area of providing real healthcare,” Sanders said.
Cory Booker, who supports the Medicare for All Act but also has promised to sign any bill into law that moves in that direction, called job losses “fearmongering,” though he appeared to misunderstand that the question focused specifically on the private health insurance industry, which would be abolished under the bill. Colorado’s Michael Bennet, who supports a public option and has been critical of “Medicare for all,” said he wasn’t worried about what would happen to the health insurance industry. “We’re trying to get to universal healthcare as fast as we can,” he said.

COURT BLOCKS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM FORCING IMMIGRANTS TO GET HEALTH INSURANCE: Federal Judge Michael Simon of the Federal District Court in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from carrying out a policy that will require immigrants to show they can get health insurance before getting a visa.
OBAMACARE OPEN ENROLLMENT OFF TO A ROCKY START: On the first day of open enrollment for plans on the Obamacare exchanges, widespread technical glitches on HealthCare.gov made signing up for insurance difficult and even impossible in many cases, according to the Associated Press. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they were aware that people were having issues signing up and receiving error messages on the site, and promised its highest priority is to remedy the problem. Americans have until Dec. 15 to enroll in a plan through the site.
PELOSI NOT A ‘BIG FAN’ OF ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’: Speaker Nancy Pelosi tamped down expectations for ‘Medicare for all’ Friday, the same day that Warren released her funding plan for the government-financed healthcare system. "I'm not a big fan of 'Medicare for all,’” Pelosi told Bloomberg Friday.
"But it is expensive. Who pays is very important. What are the benefits that come in there?” she asked. “I would think that, hopefully, as we emerge into the election year, the mantra will be more 'healthcare for all Americans.'"
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REVERSES OBAMA-ERA ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS: Organizations that receive at least $500 billion in grants from Health and Human Services, including those that provide healthcare services and foster care, will no longer be required to show they won’t discriminate against gay or transgender people, as they were under Obama administration rules published in 2016. Gay and transgender-rights groups were quick to respond. Lambda Legal tweeted: "This rule will openly encourage discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, AND religion in *all* HHS programs. This is taxpayer-funded discrimination. Religion is NOT a #LicenseToDiscriminate.”
Religious organizations, like the Catholic Association Foundation, applauded the decision having fought for years against the Obama policy, which they said violated freedom of speech and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. "The proposed HHS rule frees faith-based adoption and foster care groups participating in programs that receive federal grants from the prior administration’s demand they include sexual orientation as a protected trait under anti-discrimination protections," said Andrea Picciotti-Bayer, a legal adviser for the foundation.
TRUMP NOMINATES CANCER SPECIALIST TO HEAD THE FDA: Dr. Stephen Hahn, chief medical executive at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, was tapped for the top position at the Food and Drug Administration Friday. If confirmed, he will replace fellow oncologist Dr. Ned Sharpless. While Hahn doesn’t have experience running a government agency, he’ll have to hit the ground running as the FDA is currently entangled in debates about banning e-cigarette flavors and methods of remedying the opioid crisis.
Trump’s nomination came just under the wire. His deadline was Friday, because the Federal Vacancies Reform Act bars people from serving in an "acting" capacity for more than 210 days — in this case, Sharpless. Hahn will face the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for questioning, followed by the full Senate for a vote.

SS. Cyril and Methodius Ukrainian Catholic Church donated truckloads of goods to two local nonprofit organizations.
Following its annual rummage sale in September and a follow-up sale last month, the church filled four pickup beds and two cars with boxes last week, delivering them to United Neighborhood Centers of Northeastern Pennsylvania, said Lauren Telep, chairwoman of the rummage sales.
The church also filled a truck bed with boxes, delivering it to Catholic Social Services, she said.
“We would rather pay it forward,” she said.
This was the fifth year they donated to UNC and the second year they donated items to CSS, Telep said, explaining the church asks its congregation to suggest nonprofit organizations that need help.
Items included Christmas decorations, dishes, glasses, sheets, towels, lamps, suitcases, backpacks, tote bags and small figurines, she said.

Texto completo: The Justice Department issued a warning that the anonymous writer of a coming book about the Trump administration could be violating nondisclosure agreements, requesting information from the author's agents and publisher that they said they wouldn't provide.
At issue is a book by a writer described as a senior Trump administration official whose op-ed piece in the New York Times last year caused controversy by suggesting that administration insiders were intentionally working to blunt the impact of some of the president's decisions. The book, "A Warning," is slated to hit bookshelves on Nov. 19. It isn't known whether the writer still works in the administration.
In the letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Assistant Attorney General Joseph H. Hunt raises questions about the writer, saying that if he or she is "in fact, a current or former 'senior official' in the Trump Administration, publication of the book may violate that official's legal obligations under one or more nondisclosure agreements."
Adds Mr. Hunt: "Such agreements typically require that any written work potentially containing protected information be submitted for pre-publication review."
The letter goes on to ask for evidence that the author didn't sign a nondisclosure deal or have access to classified information. If such evidence can't be provided, the department asks for the nondisclosure agreements that were signed or when and where the author worked for the federal government.
A Justice Department official described the letter as part of a "fact-gathering" process and said no final determination had been made on next steps. The letter was first reported by CNN.
The letter is directed to Carol Ross, the top attorney for the Hachette Book Group, and to Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn of the literary agency Javelin.
Ms. Ross, in a letter responding to Mr. Hunt's, declined to turn over any information to the Justice Department. Hachette, she wrote, "routinely relies on its authors to comply with any contractual obligations they may have. Hachette has, however, made a commitment of confidentiality to Anonymous and we intend to honor that commitment."
Javelin, in its own statement, wrote, "[W]e support the publisher in its resolve that the administration's effort to intimidate and expose the senior official who has seen misconduct at the highest levels will not prevent this book from moving forward."
The book is being published by Twelve, an imprint of Lagardère SCA's Hachette Book Group. Javelin sold the book on behalf of the author to Twelve.
The op-ed piece, which ran in September 2018, was headlined "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration." In the essay, the author said that while he or she wanted the administration to succeed, "the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic."
The Trump White House has reportedly asked top administration officials to sign nondisclosure agreements, but it isn't publicly known which aides signed them or whether any such agreements could be legally enforced.

Resumen: The New York Times poll found that President Trump has a viable path in 2020 to again win the Electoral College even if he loses the popular vote.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's approval rating may be underwater, and about half of the country may want him impeached, but he still has shot to win in the half-dozen battleground states that could secure his reelection next year, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Siena College.
The poll looked at potential matchups between Trump and the leading Democratic primary candidates in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina, the states where Trump held his narrowest wins over Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Former Vice President Joe Biden beat Trump among likely voters in all of those states but North Carolina in a hypothetical head-to-head contest, but his lead was 2% or less in all of them. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont lost to Trump in every state but Michigan, where he was favored by a three-point margin. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was behind in all six states among likely voters.
'I have the real polls': Trump calls Fox News polls 'lousy' after survey finds 49% support impeachment
USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll: Biden's lead over Warren narrows in a turbulent Democratic field
The results were slightly better for the candidates among registered voters, with Sanders besting Trump by 1% in Pennsylvania and 2% Wisconsin, in addition to maintaining a 2% lead in Michigan. Warren finished 2% over Trump in Arizona and tied him in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden maintained an edge in most states, but Trump tied him among registered voters in Michigan.
Biden, Warren and Sanders have all performed better against Trump in most national polls, but because of the Electoral College, the Democratic candidate will likely have to win at least half of the above states to defeat Trump in 2020. Clinton led in most national poll ahead of the last presidential election and won the popular vote by about 2% but still lost the election.
The Times said the results of the poll "suggest that the president’s advantage in the Electoral College relative to the nation as a whole remains intact or has even grown since 2016, raising the possibility that the Republicans could – for the third time in the past six elections – win the presidency while losing the popular vote. "
And The Times said the results showed "little evidence that any Democrat, including Mr. Biden, has made substantial progress toward winning back the white working-class voters who defected to the president in 2016. "
Averages of Trump's job approval on RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight have been in the low-to-mid-40% range since his first weeks in office, with a disapproval rating about 10 percentage points higher. A Fox News poll published Sunday found his job approval at 42% – his lowest mark in its polling since February 2018 – and his disapproval at 57%.
And recent polls have consistently found support for his impeachment and removal from office to be around 50%. Forty-nine percent of registered voters said they thought he should be impeached and convicted in the Senate in Sunday's Fox News poll.

Texto completo: Here are six potentially armchair-worthy new paperback releases.
“Blowing the Bloody Doors Off” by Michael Caine (Hachette, $16.99): Sir Michael is among the most charming of men — which I can say with some authority, because I interviewed him on the phone once and nearly passed out from the delightfulness of it all. This memoir/how-to book for actors, filled with anecdotes from his career, is like that phone conversation in book length; reading it, as I did last year, feels like a down-to-earth, kindhearted ramble from your
nice British great-uncle, who has led a fascinating and glamorous life but never forgot his humble roots.
“Little” by Edward Carey (Penguin Random House, $17): Set in 1760s Paris, this novel tells of the adventures of a tiny orphan named Marie, who has a remarkable gift for sculpting wax — and whose destiny, against the backdrop of the French Revolution, is to become the famous Madame Tussaud. A review in The Guardian called it “a visceral, vivid and moving novel about finding and honoring one’s talent; about searching out where one belongs and who one loves, however strange and politically fraught the result might be.”
“The Infinite Blacktop” by Sara Gran (Washington Square Press, $16.99): The third in Gran’s series of mysteries featuring private detective Claire DeWitt, “The Infinite Blacktop” combines three intertwining stories: Claire’s present in Oakland and Las Vegas, in which someone seems to be trying to kill her; her early years as a young detective in Brooklyn, when her best friend disappeared; and her first Los Angeles case, involving an artist’s unexplained death. The author “has an engagingly sardonic voice and a sure grip of storytelling basics,” wrote a New York Times reviewer, praising the book as a “completely original hybrid of mystery, thriller, contemporary noir, dark comedy and postmodern meditation about what it means to be a detective.”
“Killing Commendatore” by Haruki Murakami (Vintage, $17): Murakami, the acclaimed Japanese author whose works have been translated into more than 50 languages, has said that this novel is his homage to his favorite book, “The Great Gatsby.” A New York Times critic wrote that the book “is hard to describe — it is so expansive and intricate — but it touches on many of the themes familiar in Mr. Murakami’s novels: the mystery of romantic love, the weight of history, the transcendence of art, the search for elusive things just outside our grasp.”
“An Orchestra of Minorities” by Chigozie Obioma (Little, Brown, $16.99): Obioma’s second novel (his first, “The Fisherman,” was a finalist for the Booker Prize) recounts the life story of a modest chicken farmer in southeastern Nigeria, told from the point of view of his guardian spirit. Seattle Times reviewer David Takami called it “a rare treasure: a book that deepens the mystery of the human experience” and noted that its “acknowledgment of life’s mystery — and a willingness to embrace it — makes ‘An Orchestra of Minorities’ a transcendent read.”
“Family Trust” by Kathy Wang (HarperCollins, $16.99): Wang’s debut is a whirling family saga featuring the Huangs: a dying patriarch, his ex-wife and his two adult children, all of whom live and work in California’s Silicon Valley. An NPR critic called it “addictive” and “captivating,” describing it as “a story about families and what connects everyone to one another, about the ties that bind and the comfort that financial security can bring to people inside the hamster wheel of American consumerism.”

Texto completo: Geyserville, Calif. -- For 12 hours the night the Kincade fire started, photographer Noah Berger kept his Nissan Xterra running. In the fire zone, Mr. Berger never turns it off. There might not be enough oxygen to start it again.
Mr. Berger drove through blood-orange smoke banks and flame-lined country roads in Northern California wine country, snapping photos for the Associated Press. In the back seat, cameras sat on a packed fire shelter -- essentially an aluminum foil coffin the freelancer could climb into as a last resort attempt to survive a burn over.
Stories like this come standard for this group of shooters who deliver the most dramatic shots of California's escalating wildfires. They race to the far corners of the state from June to November to capture the first -- and often most consequential -- hours of a fire.
"I got hooked on the experience of being out here," Mr. Berger says. "It strips off the mundane layers of life."
When multiple fires break out around the state, they skip from one to the next. Their photos appear in the world's largest newspapers and magazines and have won top photography awards.
In reality, the craft requires Mr. Berger and other freelancers to slog through months of monotonous but better-paying work for corporate clients. (Their day rates for the news assignments are often between $250 and $600.) It also strains family life at home. Much of those months off, Mr. Berger says, are spent anticipating the next season.
Mr. Berger already had a sense of what was ahead back in May. "It's coming; I felt a dry leaf crinkle under my foot this morning when walking the dog," he said then.
Five months later, northerly winds whipped across the ridges above Sonoma County's Alexander Valley the night the Kincade fire broke out. Winds have fanned the fire into one of the state's most destructive blazes of the season.
With bags already packed, Mr. Berger left his home in Alameda, an island in San Francisco Bay, within 20 minutes of receiving an alert on his phone about a new fire.
By midnight, Mr. Berger drove up a winding rural road in wine country mountains. He met up with usual fire-shooting partners, Josh Edelson, a freelancer for Agence France-Presse, and Justin Sullivan, a staff photographer with Getty Images.
The fire gained steam. A scanner picking up radio chatter between nearby firefighters crackled: houses on fire down the mountain. The crew, with this reporter following, began a perilous drive around curves obscured by smoke while flaming stumps framed the road. Heat from flames could be felt inside the car. Fire burst out of a manhole.
Mr. Berger jumped out to photograph the first moments a home with a bench press in the yard caught fire. He retreated when the home's propane tank shot ignited gas into the air like a blow torch.
He ran down the street and snapped photos of a burning house, an image that would run on the front page of The Wall Street Journal a day later.
"You push deeper [into the fire zone] and realize it's not as dangerous as you thought. So you push further and further," Mr. Berger said about his evolution into high-stakes fire photography.
As the sun rose over Sonoma County, Mr. Berger jogged through rows of grapevines. From behind a trellis, he photographed a sprawling estate burning to the ground. Tall flames rained ash into a swimming pool and a bocce court smoldered.
In the six years Mr. Berger has shot wildfires, he has become a recognizable figure at wildfires and known affectionately to some as Big Man. At 6-foot-6, he sports a custom-made, extra-long yellow fire jacket. Two cameras dangle from his shoulders. He smokes cigarettes almost nonstop at fires.
This year, Mr. Berger and two other photographers were Pulitzer Prize finalists for breaking news photography. Their photos of the 2018 fire season included a shot by Mr. Berger of five men carrying a body bag through haze in the destroyed town of Paradise.
Mr. Berger, 45, has a way of maintaining a sense of humor even when witnessing something awful. In an evacuated neighborhood near the Kincade fire, a firefighter wheeled trash bins to the curb to clear a path for a hose crew.
"Big Man!" the firefighter said when he saw Mr. Berger standing on the lawn.
"You taking out the trash?" Mr. Berger bantered.
"Like a normal day, man," the firefighter said before rushing off.
As news coverage of wildfires intensifies and more news crews flock to fire zones, Mr. Berger sometimes winces at the spectacle he acknowledges he's a part of.
"It feels a little more icky than it did a few years ago, like it's an attraction now," Mr. Berger said. Most of all, he worries that rookie photojournalists and television news crews covering this story don't get the importance of staying out of firefighters' way.
At the Kincade fire, the morning weather calmed the blaze and Mr. Berger and his colleagues regrouped along a country road. Stephen Lam, there on assignment for Thomson Reuters and a regular in Mr. Berger's crew, showed up after hours of radio silence, which had been worrying Mr. Berger.
Mr. Edelson, the AFP photographer, agonized about having to leave to shoot executive headshots for San Francisco software company Salesforce.com.
"I emailed the client and said 'I'm literally surrounded by fire,' " Mr. Edelson said. He estimates corporate work pays 10 times what working a fire does. "I only do that work so I can be out here."
Mr. Edelson's photos from the night ran in the Journal, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.
Obsessively chasing wildfires for six months each year has become a point of contention back at home for Messrs. Berger and Edelson. The Kincade fire's flare-up on Oct. 27 came the day before Mr. Edelson's wedding anniversary. Torn between the fire and a trip to Santa Catalina Island with his wife, Mr. Edelson pulled an all nighter in the fire zone before flying to Southern California to board a boat the same day.
Mr. Berger worries his lifestyle is contributing to his 9-year-old son's anxiety issues.
Still, the shooters' passion for the craft is only deepening. To improve, they study others' bodies of work. For instance, Santa Rosa Press Democrat staffer Kent Porter's expertise in reading weather and topography puts him in perfect locations, Mr. Berger says.
Stuart Palley is a Newport Beach, Calif.-based photographer and buddy of Mr. Berger's who has also covered this story. (His work has also been used by the Journal.)
"There's an element of time being suspended. I feel in the moment," Mr. Palley said at the Saddleridge fire near Los Angeles in early October.
Mr. Berger spent about a week at the Kincade fire -- eating, sleeping, editing photos and socializing with other photographers, all from his car.
When new fires erupted near L.A., Mr. Berger drove across the state to them. Mr. Edelson and his wife cut their anniversary trip short and he joined Mr. Berger.
But soon, when the rains return and firefighters contain the last of the state's fires, the men will call fire season quits. That's sometimes the hard part. "You come back and hear people talking about their prosaic lives," Mr. Berger says. "But your mind is still out there."

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
Lindy West's first book, "Shrill," was named one of the best books of 2016 and is now a Hulu series with actress Aidy Bryant playing West. The Seattle-based writer co-founded the #ShoutYourAbortion reproductive rights movement and is a contributing opinion writer for the New York Times.
In "Shrill," West wrote personally and politically about fat-shaming, her family of origin, why rape jokes are never funny, her abortion, confronting internet trolls and finding love.
Her new collection of 18 essays, "The Witches Are Coming," is less personal than polemical. When she's good, she's very, very good -- bracingly original, biting and funny -- and when she's not, the reader still finds brilliant nuggets.
"The Witches Are Coming" takes its title from "witch hunt," a pet phrase of our president, who, as West points out, has tweeted it hundreds of times. Lindy West adopts the witch invocation as a badge of courage, a call to change prevailing norms that countenance structural sexism as well as racism and economic inequality. If certain men are frightened, West argues, perhaps they should be in this time of #MeToo "cultural reckoning."
A throat-tuggingly effective essay for me was "Gear Swap." West takes a squabble on a Facebook music gear-swapping and sales website her husband uses, and illuminates achingly relevant issues of economics, class and race. West's husband, who is black, desperately wanted to play the trumpet as a child but living in Section 8 housing in Seattle with a single mother without a dime to spare it seemed like an impossible dream. Then a neighbor posted a flier selling an affordable trumpet and his mother received her tax refund, setting him on his path as a gifted musician in a city where at present, white net worth is 20 times more than black net worth.
In another powerful essay, "What Is an Abortion, Anyway?," West argues against silence. A third of all women have had abortions, yet because of stigma and shame, they do not talk about them. West is all for breaking the silence, arguing for women to "exist as our whole selves in public, unapologetically."
The essays in which West deconstructs cultural icons -- such as Adam Sandler or Joan Rivers -- who are not touchstones for me, were less effective. Yet even these pieces contain incisive, memorable passages. In the pop culture category, she does a deft takedown of the creators of "South Park," who dislike liberals and conservatives alike, choosing a spiky amorality instead.
Unapologetic, salty, tired of making nice, West gives us another refreshingly nervy essay collection. While not as poignant or funny as her first book, this one is fueled instead by a righteous anger. Let the witches come.

Texto completo: Joe Biden at a Democratic event Friday in Des Moines, Iowa. PHOTO: Michael Bucher/The Wall Street Journal
DES MOINES, Iowa—Joe Biden is facing a narrower path to win the first presidential-nominating contest, as a strengthening Pete Buttigieg threatens to cut into his support among centrist Democrats while Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders solidify their hold on the party's left wing.
A weekend of events in Iowa, capped by a raucous party fundraising dinner before 13,000 activists, offered evidence of a scrambled race for the 2020 nomination. Recent surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire, the second state in the nominating process, show the former vice president slipping even as he holds a lead in national polls.
More From the Late October Poll
* Impeachment Increasingly Divides Americans by Political Party
* Poll results
Three months before the start of voting, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Sunday showed Mr. Biden with 27% support among Democratic primary voters nationally, followed by Ms. Warren at 23%, Mr. Sanders at 19% and Mr. Buttigieg at 6%.
But the picture looks different in the state with the first contest, which at times has been an outlier but where the results can serve as a burst of momentum for a candidate at the start of voting. During a four-day swing across Iowa, Mr. Biden said he was the candidate best-positioned to challenge President Trump next November. He made his appeal before crowds numbering in the hundreds and meeting in intimate venues, a contrast to the larger rallies held by Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg.
During Friday night's Liberty and Justice Celebration , a section of seats near the top of the arena that had been assigned to Mr. Biden's campaign was largely vacant.
A spokesman for Mr. Biden said some of the campaign's supporters were unable to use their tickets and were spread around the arena. The campaign estimated it had 1,200 ticketed supporters at the venue, comparable to other campaigns.
Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has seen growing crowds at his events and rising support in polls that has coincided with Mr. Biden's struggles. A New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday showed Ms. Warren at 22% in the state, Mr. Sanders at 19%, Mr. Buttigieg at 18% and Mr. Biden at 17%. Many polls earlier in the fall and summer that showed Mr. Biden leading in Iowa had Mr. Buttigieg in the single digits or low teens.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How important is Iowa to Joe Biden's path to the Democratic presidential nomination? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Buttigieg, traveling with reporters aboard his campaign bus, said Sunday, "we all know that it's a fluid race, that it's a competitive race and that anything can happen."
Mr. Biden, in a brief interview, described the race as a "dog fight" and said he would not "take anything for granted. I've got to work like hell out here."
The Biden team is playing down his prospects in Iowa, noting that his broad support among black voters in particular will help him in places like South Carolina, which votes at the end of February.
"I think we're the only ones who don't have to win Iowa, honestly, because our strength is the fact that we have a broad and diverse coalition," said Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden's campaign manager.
Mr. Schultz said the Iowa caucuses could "have three or four or five candidates all within a couple of percentage points. Does anybody win? Technically, yes, maybe. But does that give you clarity on where the heart of the Democratic Party is? I would say, 'no.' "
Mr. Biden's team released new advertising in Iowa as part of a $4 million buy that will air through the Feb. 3 caucuses. They also noted that Mr. Biden raised $5.3 million online in October, his best month to date, after Mr. Trump tore into the former vice president over his son's overseas work in Ukraine, which has led to the Trump impeachment inquiry.
Mr. Biden's team also said he could pick up support among voters who don't view him as their first choice in Iowa, given the 15% threshold needed to qualify for delegates in individual caucus meetings. National polling, however, suggests Ms. Warren might benefit should other candidates not meet the threshold: In the new Journal/NBC News poll, 24% of voters named her when asked their second choice, while 15% backed Mr. Biden and 14% favored Mr. Sanders.
Meanwhile, Mr. Biden is being pressed from the left, with Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, senators from Massachusetts and Vermont, respectively, questioning his progressive bona fides.
When Ms. Warren last week released her plan for covering the $20.5 trillion cost of her Medicare for All proposal, Mr. Biden pointed to the nearly $9 trillion in taxes to be placed on U.S. employers over a decade—in line with health premiums they would no longer pay.
Ms. Warren, in turn, suggested that Mr. Biden was defending high profits for insurance and pharmaceutical companies and was "running in the wrong presidential primary." That prompted Mr. Biden to respond in a fundraising email that he had been "a card-carrying Democrat since I was 27." (Ms. Warren was a registered Republican in the 1990s).
Mr. Biden's team views Medicare for All as a liability in Iowa.
"The plan put forward by Bernie and Elizabeth, even out here, is not embraced by a majority of the people," Mr. Biden said in the Journal interview. "And so I think what people are going to start to focus on, at least I hope, is a little bit of, sort of, truth in advertising."
That approach resonated with Susan Reighard, a substitute teacher from DeWitt, Iowa, who signed a pledge card for Mr. Biden after initially considering Ms. Warren.
"I like that his health-care plan isn't restarting everything from square one. I like that his plan is doable," she said.
Mr. Sanders has seized upon the recent decision by supporters of Mr. Biden to form a super PAC to push back against millions of dollars in anti-Biden advertising by Mr. Trump.
Mr. Biden, who had said he would oppose the formation of any outside groups that back his candidacy, has said he has no control over outside expenditures. Another could come from the International Association of Fire Fighters, which is planning an independent expenditure soon on Mr. Biden's behalf.
Tom Avenarius, a United Auto Workers retiree who surveyed some of the 2020 candidates at an event in Cedar Rapids, said he was leaning toward Mr. Biden but that the former vice president hadn't been "forceful enough."
Mr. Avenarius, who is active with the Iowa Democratic Veterans' Caucus, said he was interested in the 37-year-old Mr. Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan in the U.S. Navy Reserves.
"I think that's what this country is looking for, which is a young president just to change some ideas and rattle some cages," Mr. Avenarius said.

AJC EXCLUSIVE: Debate on Tyler Perry's turf isn't about the 'Medea' vote

Texto completo: The Democratic National Committee has decided to locate the fifth presidential debate at Tyler Perry's studio complex. There's more to this than a bid for the "Madea" vote -- though that's worth chasing, too.
Not everyone gets it.
After word of the decision leaked out (as of this writing, no formal announcement has been made), the person in charge of the Twitter account of the Cobb County GOP tapped out the accusation that "the DNC has chosen a venue that showcases elite Hollywood values." In a word, no.
Tyler Perry isn't Hollywood. He has become the foremost African American alternative to Hollywood. It is the point of his operation, as he explained at the BET Awards ceremony in June -- to an audience frustrated by Hollywood's on-again, off-again attempt to diversify.
"While everybody else is fighting for a seat at the table, talking about '#OscarsSoWhite, #OscarsSoWhite,' I said, 'Y'all go ahead and do that. While you're fighting for a seat at the table, I'll be down in Atlanta building my own,'" Perry told the crowd. "Because what I know for sure is that if I could just build this table, God will prepare it for me in the presence of my enemies."
Moreover, bringing nine presidential candidates --
maybe more -- to south Atlanta is more than an acknowledgment that black voters hold the key to Democratic fortunes in Georgia, next year and beyond.
The debate will bestow national recognition on an African America media/ entertainment complex that could become the greatest legacy of Gov. Nathan Deal's decision to dangle substantial tax credits to lure film and TV productions away from the West Coast.
Perry is now the only African American who is the sole owner of a major studio. As many a movie magazine has pointed out, his 12 sound stages make his operation larger than Disney, Paramount and Warner Brothers.
Perry has bankrolled himself with the creation of a series of successful stage plays, several TV sit-com families and his 14-year portrayal of a pistol-wielding, big bosomed black matriarch -- which he retired early this year. The first 10 "Madea" movies alone generated more than $500 million.
But it would also be wrong to say Perry has done this wholly on his own.
Fort MacPherson, a hub of military activity during the Vietnam War and beyond, closed in 2011, in the midst of the Great Recession. An entire sector of Atlanta -- never the most prosperous side of town -- suddenly needed rescuing.
A local governmental authority known as Fort Mac LRA took control of the 488-acre property and sold 330 acres to Perry in 2015 for $30 million.
Kasim Reed, then mayor of Atlanta, had much to do with the transaction. He's the one who first showed Perry the Fort Mac property. (People forget that Reed got his start as an entertainment lawyer.)
His successor, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, this summer became an early advocate for locating the Nov. 20 Democratic debate in Atlanta, specifically on Tyler Perry's turf. At the same time, Bottoms was advocating for the remainder of the Fort Mac property to be purchased by Perry. The deal didn't gel. Or hasn't yet.
For his part, Perry has found that creating the core of an industry still dependent on the tax-credit largesse of a GOP-controlled state Legislature imposes some restraints.
Throughout the debate over House Bill 481, the "heartbeat" measure that would ban nearly all abortions after about six weeks, Perry held his tongue -- even after Gov. Brian Kemp signed the bill into law.
Finally, in a Sept. 25 interview with the Associated Press in Los Angeles, Perry made two points. First, he said he wouldn't participate in any boycott of Georgia over the new law, as other actors and directors on the West Coast have called for.
"Atlanta has been the dream. It has been the promised land," he said. "So when I got here, this whole state and city has been amazing to me and I wouldn't trade that for anything," Perry said. "Also, I put $250 million in the ground here and in the studio. So when you have a quarter of a billion dollars sat down in the ground, you can't just up and leave."
When pushed, Perry also said he opposed Georgia's new abortion law -- a likely requirement for snagging that Democratic debate. "I don't believe any man should be able to tell a woman what she can do with her body or reproductive organs," he said.
That brings us back to the aforementioned Republican accusation, that Perry is Hollywood and vice versa.
Perry told my AJC colleague Rodney Ho that many in the California film industry are unhappy that so much production has left that state. The abortion debate is a form of counterpressure, he told Ho. "There is a financial interest in California having an issue with Georgia," he said.
I did not go to the grand opening of Tyler Perry Studios on Oct. 6. My invitation was lost in the mail.
But if you study the photos and video clips from the event, which featured famous faces from politics, movies, the media and even religion, you can tell this was a celebration of something new, different -- and apart from the West Coast.
State Sen. Leroy Johnson died this week at age 91. In 1962, he became the first African American elected to the Georgia Legislature since Reconstruction. In 1970, he rescued the boxing career of Muhammad Ali, a conscientious objector facing down the Vietnam War. Other cities boycotted the boxer. Johnson rallied an African American community on the verge of coming to power in Atlanta.
The match here pitted Ali against Jerry Quarry.
"It was the greatest collection of black money and black power ever assembled until that time. Right in the heart of the old Confederacy, it was 'Gone With the Wind' turned upside-down," according to the late boxing historian Burt Sugar.
Tyler Perry's grand opening had that kind of look.
If Democrats are smart, they will use Tyler Perry Studios as more than a location for a debate. They'll use it as an example.
In the past, Perry's "Madea" character -- with her mixture of outrageous behavior and morality -- has brought him a deal of criticism. "Buffoonery" was one of the kinder words used. "Minstrelism" was another. In fact, "Madea" movies were a variety that Hollywood refused to make -- and so Perry did. Very successfully.
Perry has argued, convincingly, that the disapproval showered upon him was a matter of class, not race. "I understood very early on that this mostly blue-collar African American audience was feeling inspired," Perry wrote in The New York Times -- in a kind of obituary for Madea.
If there's a current white parallel to Madea, it might be Larry the Cable Guy -- of "git 'er done" fame.
Democrats are in the process of picking up more support among the college-educated and losing the support of those who stopped at high school.
Tyler Perry and his studios are a reminder that lectures aren't always the best way to persuade an audience. Some moviegoers -- and voters -- need to be addressed emotionally, not intellectually. And that kind of story-telling often requires the occasional belly laugh.

Texto completo: First of all, please show me where any liberal column writer has ever gone against Obama. I've yet to see it. Ross Douthat (New York Times, need I say more?) is a true liberal hack, just like Paul Krugman was when you carried his column. Douthat has been constantly wrong, which he admits in his Oct. 22 column ( "A weak president among strongmen poses risks to U.S.," Opinion). Regardless of being wrong for three years, he thinks he may in the future be correct on Trump being the evil one. Douthat needs some serious counseling. The AJC can do better!

Heartbreaking to watch people back autocrat
One of the most heartbreaking phenomena of the Trump era has been watching Republican friends, and even a few who proclaim to be independents, make excuses for Donald Trump's inexcusable behavior because they "like his policies." The cult of a business cheat and failure and TV personality has overwhelmed the basic common sense of 35% to 40% of Americans and almost destroyed the Republican Party. Until now, I had never understood how the good people of Germany in the 1930s got taken in by Adolf Hitler. Sadly, I now see how the dynamics of constant lies and propaganda and enablers in high positions try to protect an unfit man with autocratic tendencies. I am so grateful to the many people of integrity and good conscience in our government and media who shine a light on who Trump really is. It is not too late for us.

Medicare for All plan sheer fiscal insanity
The Economist magazine recently analyzed Elizabeth Warren's proposed new government programs relative to expected additional taxes from her proposed net worth tax and expanded Social Security taxes. It concluded that her new taxes would roughly cover her new programs other than Medicare for All (MFA). She has not explained how MFA would be paid for. According to the article, the projected cost over the first decade for MFA would be roughly $34 trillion, an amount roughly 10 times the average total federal revenue for the past three years. Warren's other tax additions aside, that means current taxes would need to be roughly double what they now are to pay for MFA. Proposing something so costly with no specific means of paying for it should disqualify Warren from serious consideration. However, we live in a country where financial sanity is unwelcome.

Georgians shouldn't tolerate voter purge
Deny the vote to 300,000 voters, merely because they haven't voted for a couple of years? That's what the Georgia secretary of state plans to do. This is blatant voter disenfranchisement, fearing that young people and people of color and the newly registered will come out and vote in large numbers in 2020. Why isn't the Secretary of State's Office spending time on programs to urge people to register, and investigating ways to make voting easier? Why is it not pursuing ways to encourage counties to have more polling places rather than closing them, especially in areas where populations are largely people of color? Georgians should not tolerate this. After the record-breaking purge of 2017, and the impact that had on the 2018 election, we all need to contact legislators and the secretary of state to urge them to correct this terrible strategy for preventing people from voting.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump will name Chad Wolf to be the next acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the fifth person in the administration to lead the agency responsible for securing the country.
Who is he?
Wolf was the chief of staff to Kirstjen Nielsen, who was the homeland security secretary until she was replaced this year by Kevin McAleenan, who said last month he would resign.
As Nielsen's chief of staff, Wolf helped enforce the administration's "zero tolerance" policy to prosecute families who crossed the border illegally, which led to thousands of children being separated from their parents. Many of those children are still separated from their families.
Why it matters
The agency has not had a Senate-confirmed leader since April, when Nielsen stepped down. The chiefs of the agencies responsible for Trump's immigration agenda -- Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services -- are all serving in an acting capacity.
The tumult has extended to the White House's search to find a leader for a sprawling agency of more than 240,000 employees, a search that does not appear to be over. Even when Wolf is officially named as acting secretary, he is not expected to be nominated to the position, according to two administration officials.
What's next
McAleenan will step down from the position after Nov. 11, Hogan Gidley, a spokesman for the White House, said Friday. "As the president has said, Kevin McAleenan has done a tremendous job," Gidley said. "After he departs, Chad Wolf will serve as acting capacity in the interim."
He declined to say whom the president would nominate to lead the department on a permanent basis.

Texto completo: The New York Times asked readers to send their queries.
Most people on Medicare report that they are very satisfied with their health care coverage -- but the program is complicated. Medicare features an alphabet soup of plans, coverage choices, premium levels and enrollment rules.
The New York Times recently invited readers to submit their questions about Medicare. Today, we're responding to some of the most frequent ones.
What kind of monthly premiums for either original Medicare or Advantage can I realistically plan on budgeting, especially considering inflation?
Health care inflation has been running about double the rate of general inflation. HealthView Services, a research and consulting firm, expects annual health care inflation to run an average of 5 percent to 5.5 percent through most of the coming decade.
The standard monthly premium for Part B (outpatient services) this year is $ 135.50; Medicare's trustees forecast annual increases averaging 5.9 percent through 2028. Enrollees in traditional Medicare can expect inflation of 6 percent if inflation for Medigap premiums is included.
Among Medicare Advantage plans (Part C), 49 percent of plans that include drug coverage will charge no additional premium beyond Part B next year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Plans that do have additional premiums for drugs will charge an average of $ 36 next year, Kaiser says.
According to HealthView, a 65-year-old couple using original Medicare this year will spend around $ 10,300 on premiums for prescription drugs and Medigap, and various out-of-pocket costs. In 20 years, their costs are projected to be around $ 33,000 annually (future dollars).
"The compounding effect of inflation is significant," said Ron Mastrogiovanni, HealthView's chief executive.
How can I get insurance for dental care? I am 78 years old and this is my largest uncovered medical expense.
Dental care is a critical component of preventive health care; research has shown clear links between poor oral health and chronic diseases like diabetes, as well as pain, chronic infection and reduced quality of life. Yet over all, nearly two-thirds of Medicare enrollees have no dental insurance, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That means a majority pay for their care out of pocket or go without.
Original fee-for-service Medicare does not cover most dental care, and it also does not cover hearing or vision care. Dental care is covered only in very limited circumstances, for example, if it is necessary as part of a covered procedure.
Many Medicare Advantage plans -- the managed-care private alternative to the original program -- include some level of dental coverage. Next year, 90 percent of Advantage enrollees will have access to some level of dental benefits, according to Avalere Health, a research and consulting firm. Sixty percent will have access to a plan covering restorative services; 78 percent will be able to get coverage for X-rays and cleanings.
Like other dental insurance, Advantage plan coverage levels have caps. "'Limited' would be a good word to describe it," says Sean Creighton, a managing director in the policy practice at Avalere.
The percentage of Medicare Advantage plans covering hearing and vision care is rising by similar percentages, he adds.
In most cases, these services are being offered without an additional premium. Plans are paid based on a benchmark per-capita rate Medicare uses to pay for original Medicare enrollees; when Advantage plans bid below that rate for matching original Medicare benefits, they are permitted to use the difference to offer extra benefits.
"Advantage plans are growing as a share of total enrollment, and they are trying to attract members from original Medicare and in competition with each other," he added. "Dental, vision and hearing benefits are very popular."
Original Medicare enrollees have the option of adding a commercial stand-alone dental policy. For example, a Delta Dental P.P.O. plan offered in New York City carries a monthly premium of $ 48, with an annual deductible of $ 50 and an annual per-person payment limit of $ 1,500.
Many of the current Medicare for All proposals would add coverage of dental, vision and hearing care.
Someone called me claiming to be from Medicare and I gave out my Medicare number. Should I be concerned?
Medicare generally does not initiate calls to enrollees -- with a couple of exceptions. Medicare health or drug plans can call current members. And customer service representatives from Medicare (1-800-MEDICARE) may call if you have left a message, or if a representative indicated that you would receive a return call.
Never give out your Medicare -- or Social Security -- number to anyone who calls you on the phone, sends email or makes a personal contact. Your personal information, including your Medicare number, should be shared only with health care providers, your insurers or trusted counseling services, such as the State Health Insurance Assistance Program.
"Any unexpected call from someone claiming to be from Medicare is a huge red flag, especially if you didn't call first," says Amy Nofziger, director of fraud victim support at AARP.
AARP's fraud help line (877-908-3360) has noted a recent increase in phone schemes, usually aimed at persuading people to order equipment or services that are then billed to Medicare. "A big one lately has been DNA genetic testing kits," Ms. Nofziger said. The Medicare program isn't the only victim of the phony bills, she said. "Sometimes, Medicare will deny the claim and then the perpetrator mails a bill to the enrollee. You might get a bill for up to $ 10,000, which is pretty scary for people."
If you suspect you've been victimized by fraud, alert Medicare that a scammer may have your identifying number so that your account can be flagged and monitored. And, keep a careful eye on the monthly explanation of benefits that Medicare sends, looking out for any suspicious charges.
"If Medicare feels the problem rises to the level of needing to provide you a new Medicare number, they can do that," Ms. Nofziger added.
Issuing new numbers became easier recently after the government revamped its system. The old Medicare cards used Social Security numbers, but those were phased out as part of a federal anti-fraud initiative. New cards that were mailed to all enrollees during 2018 and 2019 use a unique, randomly assigned number.
Why does Medicare set my 2019 premium cost using my 2017 income? I am newly retired as of August 2019 and my Part B premium is $ 433 a month. I'm also paying more for my prescription drug plan. My income in 2019 is much lower than it was in 2017.
High-income Medicare enrollees have been paying surcharges on Part B and Part D premiums since 2007. These so-called Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA) affect a relatively small share of the Medicare population -- about 7 percent this year, according to federal data -- but they are steep.
The standard Part B premium requires enrollees to pay 25 percent of the government's total per-capita program costs; the surcharges require high-income enrollees to pay anywhere from 35 to 85 percent more, depending on their income. The Part D income-related surcharge is calculated as a percentage of the national average cost of the standard drug benefit, using the same percentages and income thresholds used for Part B IRMAA.
IRMAA is determined by your modified adjusted gross income, which includes the adjusted gross income reported on your tax return, plus tax-exempt income.
For many retirees, the big surprise is the look-back that determines whether IRMAA is owed -- income often declines in retirement, but your initial premium could be set using pre-retirement income levels. The Social Security Administration determines whether surcharges are owed from data in the most recently available tax return it obtains from the I.R.S.; for 2020 premiums, the agency will use income tax data provided this year from 2018 tax filings.
"The sticker shock comes in the form of the Social Security benefit," Mr. Mastrogiovanni adds. "Not only is the Part B premium deducted, but also the surcharges. So people go through their planning to see what Social Security will generate, but people in these high-income brackets could lose up to half of their gross Social Security benefit."
In your recent discussion of limitations of Medicare Advantage plans , you did not include information about improper claims denials and the difficulty people have pursuing appeals. That certainly should be part of your coverage.
A report last year by federal investigators did find that Advantage plans have a pattern of inappropriately denying patient claims. The Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services found "widespread and persistent problems related to denials of care and payment in Medicare Advantage" plans. The report examined appeals filed by patients and health care providers from 2014 through 2016, and found that Advantage plans themselves overturned the denials in 75 percent of cases.
However, very few claim denials are appealed -- just 1 percent during the three-year period reviewed in the inspector general's report.
The Advantage payment model reimburses plans a preset amount per patient; that may be incentivizing plans "to deny preauthorization of services for beneficiaries, and payments to providers, in order to increase profits," the report concluded.
"We see plenty of denials by Advantage plans that shouldn't be denied, and wouldn't be if the patient had been enrolled in original Medicare," says David Lipschutz, associate director and senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy.
Among the most common problems, he says, are early hospital discharges, denial of care in a skilled nursing facility or home health care.
I had an accident this year that has required bilateral knee surgery -- I was in the hospital for a week and a residential rehab facility for physical therapy and treatment of related problems for one month. Now I am home with a home health nurse weekly, and visits from a physical therapist five days a week. I also have adaptive equipment. My recovery process will be at least five more months, carrying over into 2020. Can my Plan G Medigap supplemental insurance provider cancel me for 2020?
Original Medicare enrollees often add a Medigap supplemental plan to cap out-of-pocket expenses -- and that comes in especially handy when a major medical problem arises. You can choose among a dizzying array of standardized plan options with varying degrees of coverage; Plan G is one of the most comprehensive, covering hospital and doctor co-insurance costs, hospice care, coinsurance for skilled nursing facilities and hospital deductibles.
Fortunately, Medigap coverage does not disappear when you need it.
"No Medigap plan can cancel you for spending too much," says Chris Hakim, senior vice president of Medicare at eHealth, an insurance exchange. "The only way you can lose coverage is if you don't pay your premiums."

Texto completo: In the Oval Office, an annoyed President Trump ended an argument he was having with his aides. He reached into a drawer, took out his iPhone and threw it on top of the historic Resolute Desk:
"Do you want me to settle this right now?"
There was no missing Mr. Trump's threat that day in early 2017, the aides recalled. With a tweet, he could fling a directive to the world, and there was nothing they could do about it.
When Mr. Trump entered office, Twitter was a political tool that had helped get him elected and a digital howitzer that he relished firing. In the years since, he has fully integrated Twitter into the very fabric of his administration, reshaping the nature of the presidency and presidential power.
After Turkey invaded northern Syria this past month, he crafted his response not only in White House meetings but also in a series of contradictory tweets. This summer, he announced increased tariffs on $ 300 billion worth of Chinese goods, using a tweet to deepen tensions between the two countries. And in March, Mr. Trump cast aside more than 50 years of American policy, tweeting his recognition of Israel's sovereignty in the Golan Heights. He openly delighted in the reaction he provoked.
"Boom. I press it," Mr. Trump recalled months later at a White House conference attended by conservative social media personalities, "and, within two seconds, 'We have breaking news."'
Early on, top aides wanted to restrain the president's Twitter habit, even considering asking the company to impose a 15-minute delay on Mr. Trump's messages. But 11,390 presidential tweets later, many administration officials and lawmakers embrace his Twitter obsession, flocking to his social media chief with suggestions. Policy meetings are hijacked when Mr. Trump gets an idea for a tweet, drawing in cabinet members and others for wordsmithing. And as a president often at war with his own bureaucracy, he deploys Twitter to break through logjams, overrule or humiliate recalcitrant advisers and pre-empt his staff.
"He needs to tweet like we need to eat," Kellyanne Conway, his White House counselor, said in an interview.
In a presidency unlike any other, where Mr. Trump wakes to Twitter, goes to bed with it and is comforted by how much it revolves around him, the person he most often singled out for praise was himself -- more than 2,000 times, according to an analysis by The New York Times.
The Times examined Mr. Trump's use of Twitter since taking office, reviewing all his tweets, retweets and followers, and interviewing nearly 50 current and former administration officials, lawmakers and Twitter executives and employees. What has emerged is a rich account, with new analysis, previously unreported episodes and fresh details of how the president exploits the platform to exert power.
It is often by brute repetition. He has taken to Twitter to demand action 1,159 times on immigration and his border wall, a top priority, and 521 times on tariffs, another key agenda item. Twitter is an instrument of his foreign policy: He has praised dictators more than a hundred times, while complaining nearly twice as much about America's traditional allies. Twitter is the Trump administration's de facto personnel office: The chief executive has announced the departures of more than two dozen top officials, some fired by tweet.
More than half of the president's posts -- 5,889 -- have been attacks; no other category even comes close. His targets include the Russia investigation, a Federal Reserve that won't bow to his whims, previous administrations, entire cities that are led by Democrats, and adversaries from outspoken athletes to chief executives who displease him. Like no other modern president, Mr. Trump has publicly harangued businesses to advance his political goals and silence criticism, often with talk of government intervention. Using Twitter, he threatened "Saturday Night Live" with an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission and accused Amazon, led by Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, of cheating the United States Postal Service.
As much as anything, Twitter is the broadcast network for Mr. Trump's parallel political reality -- the "alternative facts" he has used to spread conspiracy theories, fake information and extremist content, including material that energizes some of his base.
Mr. Trump's use of Twitter has accelerated sharply since the end of the special counsel's Russia investigation and reached a new high as Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry, the analysis shows. He tweeted more than 500 times during the first two weeks of October, a pace that put him on track to triple his monthly average. (The Times analyzed Mr. Trump's tweets through Oct. 15. The total by the end of the month reached 11,887.)
His more than 66 million Twitter followers have become his private polling service, offering what he sees as validation for his performance in office. But fewer than one-fifth of his followers are voting-age Americans, according to a Times analysis of Pew Research national surveys of adults who use Twitter.
The White House press office declined to comment for this article and turned down an interview request with the president. Now, as Mr. Trump anticipates a bitter re-election battle and faces an impeachment inquiry by Democrats, the stakes are higher than ever before, and Twitter even more central to his presidency.
His top campaign aides are embracing the outrage that Mr. Trump stirs with his tweets to reinforce his anti-establishment brand and strengthen his bond with the fiercely loyal supporters who propelled him into office. And as public backing for impeachment grows, the president is using the platform to build a defensive echo chamber.
While people around Mr. Trump acknowledge that his tweets can cause political damage, the president is confident in his mastery of Twitter.
This past week, as he announced that American Special Forces had killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, Mr. Trump noted the terror group's digital prowess. "They use the internet better than almost anybody in the world," he said. "Perhaps other than Donald Trump."
Policy via Twitter
With a single tweet last fall, Mr. Trump sent his administration into a tailspin. "I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught," he wrote in October 2018, angry about a caravan of migrants from Central America. "If unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!"
Mr. Trump's aides had tried for weeks to talk him out of shutting down the border -- the logistics would be impossible and the economic pain extreme. The tweet prompted an emergency meeting down the hall from the Oval Office as aides scrambled to head off Mr. Trump's impulse, according to people familiar with the frantic scene. Like others in this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of angering the president.
The aides succeeded in temporarily holding him off, but the tweet crystallized for cautious bureaucrats exactly what he wanted: to stop people from coming into the country. In the months that followed, Mr. Trump's threat helped to set off an effort inside the government to find ever more restrictive ways to block immigrants. Nearly six months later, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, was still trying to prevent a border shutdown when the president brought her resistance to an end.
"Kirstjen Nielsen," he tweeted, "will be leaving her position."
This is governing in the Trump era. For President Barack Obama, a tweet about a presidential proposal might mark the conclusion of a long, deliberative process. For Mr. Trump, Twitter is often the beginning of how policy is made.
"Suddenly there's a tweet, and everything gets upended and you spent the week trying to defend something else," said Representative Peter King, Republican of New York. "This person thrives on chaos. What we may find disconcerting or upsetting or whatever, it is actually what keeps him going."
In October 2017, Rex W. Tillerson, the president's first secretary of state, was in China with a team of diplomats negotiating sanctions on Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, when Mr. Trump weighed in on Twitter. Mr. Tillerson was "wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man," he wrote. "Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!"
Two months later, a Reuters headline blared that Mick Mulvaney, who then was Mr. Trump's new pick to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, had decided to put "on ice" sanctions against Wells Fargo for consumer abuses. It was little surprise: Mr. Mulvaney was an ally of the financial industry. But Mr. Trump had other ideas.
"Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased," he tweeted.
Political appointees at the bureau wanted to affirm Mr. Trump's desire publicly, despite longstanding policies against commenting on active investigations, according to former officials there. A spokesman for Mr. Mulvaney issued a statement saying only that he "shares the president's firm commitment to punishing bad actors and protecting American consumers."
According to two people with direct knowledge of the Wells Fargo inquiry, career bureau officials took Mr. Trump's outburst as a green light to pursue aggressive negotiations with the bank, even as Mr. Mulvaney's team prepared to dial back penalties in other cases or shelve them. Wells Fargo ultimately agreed to a billion-dollar federal settlement, the bureau's largest-ever civil penalty.
Over time, Mr. Trump has turned Twitter into a means of presidential communication as vital as a statement from the White House press secretary or an Oval Office address. The press secretary has not held a daily on-camera press briefing -- a decades-long ritual of presidential messaging -- since March. Instead, Mr. Trump's Twitter activity drives the day.
And Mr. Trump has removed any doubt that his tweets carry the weight once reserved for more formal pronouncements.
In summer 2018, his aides repeatedly tried to reassure Republican lawmakers that the president backed their hard-line immigration bill, despite his remarks suggesting otherwise. But privately, Mr. Trump told several senators that there was only one certain sign of his support.
"If I don't tweet it," he said, according to two former senior advisers, "don't listen to my staff."
Adapting a Platform
When Mr. Trump entered office, aides were determined to rein in his itchy Twitter fingers.
In a series of informal conversations in early 2017, top White House officials discussed the possibility of a 15-minute delay on the president's account, a technical change not unlike the five-second naughty-word system used by television networks. But, one former senior official said, they quickly abandoned the idea after recognizing the political peril if it leaked to the press -- or to their boss.
Several weeks later, a trio of close advisers presented Mr. Trump with another idea. Gary Cohn, the top economic adviser; Hope Hicks, the president's director of strategic communications; and Rob Porter, his staff secretary, argued that they should see the tweets before he sent them out.
Mr. Trump was skeptical, worrying that delayed tweets would be irrelevant, according to a former White House official. But he agreed to a weeklong trial. Within 72 hours, the president had resumed tweeting from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J.
Three thousand miles away, in Silicon Valley, similar conversations were unfolding at Twitter's offices, where executives faced the same dilemma as Mr. Trump's inner circle: whether, and how, to restrain him.
At the time, Twitter lagged far behind larger competitors like Facebook. While popular among politicians and journalists, it was struggling financially. But the president's incessant tweeting gave the company more currency.
His Twitter account often drove more "impressions" -- a key company metric -- than any other in the world. But some of his messages seemed to violate the company's policies against abuse and incitement.
On a now-defunct internal company message board known as Twitter Buzz, some left-leaning employees favored barring the president. Mr. Trump's behavior came up at almost every all-hands gathering and at many smaller meetings of executives. Some of them had set their phones to alert them whenever the president tweeted, according to a former employee who spoke on the condition of confidentiality.
"What I saw was a company coming to grips with an entirely new situation, a new level of scrutiny, a new level of vitriol," said Dianna Colasurdo, a former account executive on Twitter's political advertising sales team, "and working to adapt their policies in the moment to align with that."
A turning point came in fall 2017, at the height of tensions with North Korea, when Mr. Trump tweeted that the rogue nation might not "be around much longer!" The country's foreign minister called that a declaration of war. On Twitter, users wondered if the company would allow Mr. Trump to tweet his way into a nuclear conflict.
The response came the next day. Referring back to Mr. Trump's online declaration, Twitter announced in a tweet that it took "newsworthiness" into account when evaluating whether to remove a post that violated its policies.
In an interview, Twitter executives said that newsworthiness had long figured into the company's internal enforcement guidelines and that officials there had been formulating the announcement, which applied worldwide, months before Mr. Trump's North Korea tweet. But former employees said they understood the announcement to be Trump-driven. Twitter did not want to be in the business of censoring the president.
Late in summer 2018, White House insiders tried again to curb Mr. Trump's use of social media, according to two former aides. After a series of over-the-top weeks of tweeting -- including calling Omarosa Manigault Newman, his onetime aide, "wacky" and "a lowlife" -- several advisers suggested he go just two days without Twitter and see what happened. Mr. Trump nodded, and then promptly discarded the advice.
Mr. King, who said most of his Republican colleagues wished the president would tweet less, added that whenever he had raised the issue with White House staff members, they shrugged helplessly.
"It's not going to stop," he recalled their saying. "Forget it; we've all tried."
Soon enough, Mr. Trump was as prolific as ever.
On Sept. 13, he mocked Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, for claiming he could beat Mr. Trump in an election. "He doesn't have the aptitude or 'smarts' & is a poor public speaker & nervous mess," the president tweeted. Over the next 12 hours, Mr. Trump attacked two former F.B.I. officials, accused The Wall Street Journal of getting a tariff story wrong and blasted former Secretary of State John Kerry for holding "illegal meetings" with Iran.
"BAD!" he wrote.
First Things First
Mr. Trump's Twitter habit is most intense in the morning, when he is in the White House residence, watching Fox News, scrolling through his Twitter mentions and turning the social media platform into what one aide called the "ultimate weapon of mass dissemination."
Of the attack tweets identified in the Times analysis, nearly half were sent between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., hours that Mr. Trump spends mostly without advisers present.
After waking early, Mr. Trump typically watches news shows recorded the previous night on his "Super TiVo," several DVRs connected to a single remote. (The devices are set to record "Lou Dobbs Tonight" on Fox Business Network; "Hannity," "Tucker Carlson Tonight" and "The Story With Martha MacCallum" on Fox News; and "Anderson Cooper 360" on CNN.)
He takes in those shows, and the "Fox & Friends" morning program, then flings out comments on his iPhone. Then he watches as his tweets reverberate on cable channels and news sites.
Early on Sept. 2 -- the start of a week in which he tweeted 198 times -- the president sent a few benign tweets, then lashed out at Paul Krugman as a "Failing New York Times columnist" who "never got it!" Over the next 44 minutes, he fired off 10 more tweets. He disparaged Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ("Likes what we are doing until the cameras go on.") He called James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and his "dwindling group of friends" liars and traitors. He railed against The Washington Post and four women of color in Congress who called themselves "the Squad."
Almost every morning that week, Mr. Trump kicked off the day with an attack on one critic or another: the "incompetent Mayor of London," or "Bad 'actress' Debra The Mess Messing" -- whom he accused of being racist -- or the "Fake News Media." He referred to conservative media outlets 45 times, berated the mainstream media 32 times and tweeted about conspiracy theories 12 times.
Sometimes the president's apparent fury on Twitter is meant to troll his critics and get a rise out of them, many of his closest aides said. But they still brace themselves, knowing that they are likely to be blindsided by one of his tweets. Aides who gather for the early-morning staff meetings in the West Wing said their agenda was regularly blown up when their phones simultaneously went off with a tweet from the boss.
Once Mr. Trump arrives in the West Wing -- usually after 10 a.m. -- Dan Scavino, the White House social media director, takes control of the Twitter account, tweeting as @realDonaldTrump from his own phone or computer. Mr. Trump rarely tweets in front of others, those close to him say, because he does not like to wear the reading glasses he needs to see the screen.
Instead, the president dictates tweets to Mr. Scavino, who sits in a closet-size room just off the Oval Office until Mr. Trump calls out "Scavino!" Often, he prints out suggested tweets in extra-large fonts for the president to sign off on. (A single-page article that Mr. Scavino recently printed out for him ran to six pages after the fonts were enlarged, according to one person who saw it.)
Mr. Scavino's role in Mr. Trump's Twitter machine has made him an unlikely White House power broker and the go-to person for aides, business executives, friends and lawmakers who want the president to tweet something. Ms. Conway noted what she called the hypocrisy of many Republicans who begged her to get Mr. Trump to stop tweeting during the 2016 campaign and now come to Mr. Scavino with suggestions. Mr. Scavino declined to be interviewed for this article.
He sometimes acts as a brake -- or tries to -- on the president's tweeting impulses. When Mr. Trump started angrily posting about the "Squad," Mr. Scavino told him it was a bad idea, according to an aide who witnessed the conversation. Along with Michael Dubke, who served as White House communications director for several months in 2017 and is from Buffalo, home of the famous chicken wings, Mr. Scavino presented some tweets to Mr. Trump in degrees of outrageousness: "hot," "medium" or "mild." Mr. Trump, said one former official who saw the proposed messages, always picked the most incendiary ones and often wanted to make them even more provocative.
And while many of Mr. Trump's tweets are shoot-from-the-hip attacks, he chews over others for days or even weeks, waiting for just the right moment to maximize the reaction, aides say.
He plotted for days to tweet about Mika Brzezinski, the liberal co-host of the popular MSNBC morning program, according to former White House officials, before finally posting one morning in June 2017. He called her "low I.Q. Crazy Mika" and wrote that she had been "bleeding badly from a face-lift" during a New Year's Eve party.
In October of last year, the president started telling his aides that he planned to denounce Stormy Daniels, a pornographic-film actress who claimed to have had an affair with him more than a decade earlier. He said he wanted to call her a "horse face."
Several current and former aides recalled telling Mr. Trump that it was a terrible idea and would renew accusations of misogyny against him. But he persisted.
Finally, after watching a Fox News report days later about how a federal judge had thrown out a lawsuit by Ms. Daniels, the president tapped out the tweet.
"Great, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas," he wrote.
A Love of 'Likes'
For Mr. Trump, Twitter reinforces his instincts about his performance as president.
After a rally in Dallas in mid-October, Mr. Trump's aides prepared a large-type printout of tweets gushing over his speech that day, including one from Tomi Lahren, a Fox News commentator and the host of a show on the Fox Nation site. Mr. Trump scrawled a thank-you note on one copy to Ms. Lahren -- who then tweeted a picture of the letter back at the president.
Aides said they often compiled positive feedback for Mr. Trump. He revels in the stream of praise from his most loyal followers, on paper or as he scrolls through his phone early in the morning and late at night. He considers his following to be like the ratings on a TV show, better than any approval poll. After one weekend Twitter spree, the president told Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his press secretary at the time, he had expected a tweet he was particularly proud of to get more response than it did, according to a former administration official. Ms. Sanders said that if he tweeted 60 times, people wouldn't pay as much attention, the official said.
The president is keenly aware of his number of followers and reluctant to acknowledge that any of them are not real. Mr. Trump has accused Twitter of political bias for its periodic purges of bot accounts across the platform, which have cost him -- and other prominent users -- hundreds of thousands of followers. When he met with the company's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, in April, Mr. Trump reportedly pressed him at length about the lost followers.
There is plenty of evidence that Mr. Trump's Twitter following may not be a reliable proxy for what the American people think of the job he is doing.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine with certainty how many of Mr. Trump's more than 66 million followers are fake. Some studies of his followers have estimated that a high proportion are likely to be automated bots, fake accounts or inactive. But even a conservative analysis by The Times found that nearly a third of them, about 22 million, included no biographical information and used the service's default profile image -- two signs the accounts may be rarely used or inactive. Fourteen percent have automatically generated user names, another indication that an account may not belong to a real person.
Even if Mr. Trump is not shouting into the void on Twitter, he is often preaching to the converted. Data from Stirista, an analytics firm, shows that his followers tend to be the kind of users who are most likely to be his supporters -- disproportionately older, white and male compared with Twitter users over all.
And they constitute just a fraction of the electorate. According to the Times analysis of Pew data, only about four percent of American adults, or about 11 million people, follow him on Twitter. Those followers represent less that one-fifth of his total, the analysis shows.
According to data from YouGov, which polls about most of the president's tweets, some of the topics on which Mr. Trump got the most likes and retweets -- jabs at the N.F.L., posts about the special counsel's investigation, unfounded allegations of widespread voter fraud -- poll poorly with the general public.
But people close to Mr. Trump said there was no dissuading him that the "likes" a tweet got were evidence that a decision or policy proposal was well received.
Last December, after Mr. Trump announced plans to withdraw some troops from Syria, lawmakers came to the White House to argue against it. According to Politico, Mr. Trump responded by calling in Mr. Scavino.
"Tell them how popular my policy is," Mr. Trump asked Mr. Scavino, who described for the lawmakers social media postings that had praised Mr. Trump's decision. Aides said that for Mr. Trump, his Twitter "likes" were proof that he had made the right call.
The reaction in the outside world was far less favorable. Within weeks, Mr. Trump's defense secretary and the special anti-ISIS envoy quit over the decision. American allies were enraged. More than two-thirds of the Senate voted to rebuke Mr. Trump, who agreed under pressure to keep the troops in Syria.
Almost a year later, American troops in Syria became an issue again after Mr. Trump appeared to give President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey a green light to invade Kurdish-controlled areas in northern Syria.
That resulted in another congressional rebuke for Mr. Trump and complaints even from loyal Republican allies. In subsequent days, Mr. Trump sought to defend himself on Twitter, alternately denying he had abandoned the Kurds and suggesting the United States had no stake in their safety, threatening Mr. Erdogan if the incursion continued and praising Turkey as an important trading partner.
Many people took note of the back-and-forth, including Mr. Erdogan. "When we take a look at Mr. Trump's Twitter posts, we can no longer follow them," the Turkish president told reporters mockingly in mid-October, according to Hurriyet, a Turkish newspaper. "We cannot keep track."

A Tool for Re-Election
In the months ahead, the man tasked with winning Mr. Trump a second term is hoping to focus the president's Twitter habit on its original purpose: connecting with voters.
Brad Parscale, who served as Mr. Trump's digital director in 2016 and is now campaign manager, has worked closely with Mr. Scavino to shape perceptions of the president through social media. The two men speak a half-dozen times a day, according to people familiar with their interactions.
Mr. Parscale criticized Twitter after it announced on Wednesday that it would no longer allow paid political advertising on the platform, calling it "yet another attempt to silence conservatives." But the change may benefit Mr. Trump: He has a far larger organic Twitter following than any of his likely Democratic opponents, and is therefore less reliant on paid ads to spread his message through the platform.
While some campaign aides say Mr. Trump's tweets can be a distraction, they also view Twitter as an essential tool to present him as someone strong, willing to stand up to so-called political elites and what the president recently called the "unholy alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians, deep-state bureaucrats and the fake-news media."
The aides seek to cultivate the image of a man who understands "regular people." Mr. Trump's team believes that his unvarnished writing, poor punctuation and increasing profanity on Twitter signals authenticity -- a contrast to the polished, vetted, often anodyne social media style of most candidates.
Twitter, Ms. Conway said, is the president's most potent weapon when it comes to bypassing the powerful people he believes have controlled the flow of information too long.
"It's the democratization of information," she said. Everyone receives Mr. Trump's tweets at once -- the stay-at-home mom, the plumber working on the sink, the billionaire executive, the White House correspondent.
"They all hear 'ping,"' she said, "at the same time."
The New York Times reviewed every tweet and retweet sent by President Trump from Jan. 20, 2017, through Oct. 15, 2019. Each one was evaluated and tagged for several factors: whether it included an attack or praise; who or what was attacked or praised; and for topics including trade, immigration, the military, the economy, the 2018 midterm elections, the Russia investigation and the House impeachment inquiry. In the Times analysis, retweets in each of those categories were counted as tweets.
The Times reviewed each Twitter account that followed Mr. Trump by analyzing profile information, tweet frequency and the date the account was created. The Times also used data from Pew Research to estimate how many American adults follow Mr. Trump on Twitter. Pew Research conducted a nationally representative sample of American adults with personal, public Twitter accounts to analyze how many follow American politicians.

Castro forges forward after 11th-hour fundraising drive, O'Rourke exit

Texto completo: DES MOINES — And then there was one.
Julián Castro became the sole Texan in the presidential race after Beto O'Rourke ended his campaign Friday, a sudden departure that creates new opportunity for Castro. But the former U.S. housing secretary is facing an uncertain fate of his own and trying to forge forward despite the long odds, sharpening his pitch as a unique advocate for the voiceless in the still-crowded primary field.
"This campaign has marched to the beat of its own drummer," Castro said Friday night here at the Iowa Democratic Party's Liberty and Justice Celebration. "We've been a little bit different from all the other campaigns. We haven't been the same. We've been speaking up for the most vulnerable folks in this country — people sleeping on the streets and in storm drainage tunnels in Las Vegas, folks who are the victims of police brutality."
Still, Castro's message is colliding with cold hard political realities. While he met a self-imposed deadline Thursday to raise $800,000 or drop out, there is talk of potential staff departures soon, and it remains very unlikely he will qualify for the next debate on Nov. 20. He has the 165,000 donors required for the debate, but he has not yet received the 3% he needs in any of the four qualifying polls, and the deadline is 11 days away.
"For now, we're working like crazy to try and get on that November debate stage," Castro told reporters here Friday. Asked how realistic that goal is, Castro insisted he was "gonna keep working."
Castro said the $800,000 would be used to "keep the campaign going" and to air ads to boost his poll numbers in the early voting states. The money is expected to help pay staff for a little longer, but the campaign has also been open with staffers about imminent tough decisions and given them the green light to look elsewhere for work if they want to, according to people familiar with the campaign.
Those details were first reported Saturday by CNN. Castro spokesman Sawyer Hackett told the network that "in pushing to keep Secretary Castro's critical voice in this race, our campaign, like many others, will make adjustments in staffing and resources."
Now that O'Rourke is no longer running, the campaign is increasing its focus on delegate-rich Texas, which holds its primary on March 3 — Super Tuesday. While Castro's poll numbers have never been as high as in Texas as O'Rourke's were — and he has not been as organized in the state as O'Rourke was — Castro's supporters see a new state of play at home.
"I understand [Joe] Biden and [Elizabeth] Warren have semblances of campaigns here, but I don’t think they were going to do what [Castro and O'Rourke] would be able to do," said state Rep. Poncho Nevárez, who has endorsed Castro. "I don’t see how this doesn’t benefit Julian. It's his opportunity. Maybe a lot of people didn’t see a path forward, but we had to assume that at some point a herd was going to get culled and if he can survive some of those first culls, and he has, then it becomes a different game.”
While zeroing in on Texas, Castro will also continue to focus on two states that he has previously suggested were priorities for his campaign: Iowa and Nevada, the first state in the nominating process with a significant Latino population. While there has not been much polling in Nevada — much to Castro's chagrin — he has been far behind in Iowa surveys, getting 0% in a New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday morning.
Asked if there remains a path forward for Castro in Iowa, Steffen Schmidt, a political science professor at Iowa State University, responded in an email with a "no" and a straight-faced emoji. "I don’t see his slice of Iowa caucus participants," Schmidt said.
Still, Castro is determined to prove his bona fides as a candidate distinctly focused on the most vulnerable communities. On Friday afternoon, he bypassed the traditional activities before the state party dinner in downtown Des Moines to visit the nearby YMCA Supportive Housing Campus, which provides permanent housing and services to the homeless and those at risk of being homeless. Castro spent an hour and a half touring the facility and holding a roundtable with advocates, reminding them at one point that he has made housing a "front-and-center issue" in his campaign.
"We've been trying to address issues that a lot of other campaigns, for whatever other reason, don't want to address or don't take the time to address," Castro said at the roundtable's conclusion.
Castro continued to make a similar case at the Liberty and Justice Celebration, saying Democrats are "great at talking about the middle class — and we need to fight for the middle class and I'm fighting for the middle — but we also need to fight for the poor and those who have the least, those who suffer the most."

Heisler: Warriors just went from dynasty to expansion team

Texto completo: Farewell, little dynasty.
That splat you heard was the the Warriors, who dominated the NBA the past five seasons as it went from marginally profitable to immensely wealthy, hitting the pavement like an egg dropped from space.
Of course, it’s still way early to write them off, as TNT’s Charles Barkley did, predicting they wouldn’t even make the playoffs … at halftime of their opener … or, at least it was until Steph Curry broke his hand in the fourth game.
There’s now a common theme in Warriors stories
Will they tank?
Shouldn’t they tank?
Are they tanking?
Isn’t it timely that they lost Curry, removing the temptation to claw into the playoffs so they can tank … as owner Joe Lacob seemed to suggest to The Athletic (“Potentially, there’s a silver lining in all of this, who knows?”)
Not that the Warriors may have a choice with all of last spring’s nine rotation players, and all three of their Big Three, out or gone for the duration: Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook.
That left Draymond Green, who hurt just his left index finger, and Kevon Looney, who’s out with a pulled hamstring.
Things started off challenging with Las Vegas setting their over-under at 47 wins, No. 6 or 7 in the West.
Then, unfortunately for the Warriors, the season started.
Game 1: In the opening of the new Chase Center, the Clippers beat them by 19 points, after leading by 31.
Thompson, recovering from knee surgery, goes on with TNT at halftime, airs his hopes … and has Barkley inform him to his face they won’t make the playoffs.
As if agreeing, Coach Steve Kerr notes, “This is not a one-off. This is the reality. There are going to be nights like this this year.”
Game 2: Showing Kerr was right, they lose by 28 in Oklahoma City … after trailing by 41 … to the Thunder, a 1-4 team going into this weekend.
Game 3: Win in New Orleans!
Game 4: Lose by 11 in Phoenix … after trailing by 33.
In the very bad, awful, no good, worst possible news, Curry breaks his left hand early in the third quarter with the Warriors down by 29.
Game 5: Back home, lose to Spurs by 17 … after trailing by 25.
They now start Green, D’Angelo Russell, Glenn Robinson, Willie Cauley-Stein and rookie Jordan Poole, looking more like an expansion team than a dynasty.
This isn’t just a fall. This is the end of the pride of the NBA.
The Warriors didn’t invent the modern offense, spacing the floor with three-point shooters. That was Mike D’Antoni in coaching stints at Phoenix, New York and Houston.
Nevertheless, it was Steph, Klay & Co. who took it and ran with it, popularizing an approach that had always been anathema, expressed by the mantra, “Live by the jump shot, die by the jump shot.”
With their unprecedented firepower came a coincidence of personalities that made the Warriors a delight for the press and lured KD as a free agent in 2016: the personable Kerr … the sweet-tempered Curry, everyone’s favorite … the unaffected Thompson … the trash-talking, stand-up guy, Green.
“To me, they speak not just to the modern NBA, but to the unique place that sports can have in society,” said Commissioner Adam Silver before the season.
“And it’s not just the spirit they bring to the game on the floor, but, I think, the spirit they bring as citizens and to their participation in their community.”
The ascent was symbolized by the $1.4 billion Chase Center they built in San Francisco with money they raised privately, leaving the boondocks of the East Bay.
With personal seat licenses estimated at $18,000 each, revenue is projected to zoom from last season’s $400 million that was already ahead of the Lakers’ $398 million, according to Forbes, to $700 million … ahead of every team in every U.S. league except the Dallas Cowboys.
This is a new reality, indeed. The Lakers, long the NBA’s richest team, used to wish there was no salary cap so they could spend whatever they wanted. Now they can thank their lucky stars there is one
(Giannis Antetokuonmpo, anyone? He’s not free until 2021 but the big teams are eyeing him in all they do.)
The Warriors cherished the fact they were all in this together, but it was no longer true.
Things began unraveling last fall when Green argued with Durant, who had spurned an extension to sign for one year, signaling his intention to become a free agent.
“We won without you,” snapped Green, according to Yahoo’s Chris Haaynes. “We don’t need you. Leave.”
Dray and KD made up, insisting it was behind them in countless interviews … until last week when Durant, now in Brooklyn, acknowledged the blowup had been a factor in his decision to leave (“I mean, your teammate talked to you that way, you think about it. … Definitely, for sure. I’m not going to lie about it.”)
Nevertheless, the Warriors clung to their illusions to the bitter end when Durant went down in Game 5 of the Finals.
GM Bob Myers choked back tears in the interview room. Teammates were glum, despite having just won to cut the Raptors’ lead to 3-2.
If KD wanted most of all to be loved, it looked like the outpouring of grief might persuade him to stay.
Instead, he signed with the Nets to play alongside Kyrie Irving, who is already reportedly showing the mood swings in Brooklyn that he had in Cleveland and Boston.
Of course, the Warriors will try to put Humpy Dumpty back together next season, but they’re not the kids they were when they won the first of their three titles in 2015.
Curry, 31, was averaging 20 points and 2.3 threes, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 30 and 5.1 … as Kerr noted they can’t just turn Steph loose, a la James Harden (“That kind of basketball wears you out, especially for a guy who’s 180 pounds like Steph is.”)
With all those shot attempts and points gone, Green, 29, is averaging a pale 9.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 0.0 blocks, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 14-10-7 with 1.4 blocks.
Thompson, 30, may be coming off a missed season.
You can’t say they didn’t enjoy the journey. In 2015 after winning their first title, Lacob told the New York Times, “We’re light years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we’re going to go about things. We’re going to be a handful for the rest of the NBA to deal with for a long time.”
So they were, but “a long time” is over, the Warriors just learned.

Texto completo: Farewell, little dynasty.
That splat you heard was the the Warriors, who dominated the NBA the past five seasons as it went from marginally profitable to immensely wealthy, hitting the pavement like an egg dropped from space.
Of course, it’s still way early to write them off, as TNT’s Charles Barkley did, predicting they wouldn’t even make the playoffs … at halftime of their opener … or, at least it was until Steph Curry broke his hand in the fourth game.
There’s now a common theme in Warriors stories
Will they tank?
Shouldn’t they tank?
Are they tanking?
Isn’t it timely that they lost Curry, removing the temptation to claw into the playoffs so they can tank … as owner Joe Lacob seemed to suggest to The Athletic (“Potentially, there’s a silver lining in all of this, who knows?”)
Not that the Warriors may have a choice with all of last spring’s nine rotation players, and all three of their Big Three, out or gone for the duration: Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook.
That left Draymond Green, who hurt just his left index finger, and Kevon Looney, who’s out with a pulled hamstring.
Things started off challenging with Las Vegas setting their over-under at 47 wins, No. 6 or 7 in the West.
Then, unfortunately for the Warriors, the season started.
Game 1: In the opening of the new Chase Center, the Clippers beat them by 19 points, after leading by 31.
Thompson, recovering from knee surgery, goes on with TNT at halftime, airs his hopes … and has Barkley inform him to his face they won’t make the playoffs.
As if agreeing, Coach Steve Kerr notes, “This is not a one-off. This is the reality. There are going to be nights like this this year.”
Game 2: Showing Kerr was right, they lose by 28 in Oklahoma City … after trailing by 41 … to the Thunder, a 1-4 team going into this weekend.
Game 3: Win in New Orleans!
Game 4: Lose by 11 in Phoenix … after trailing by 33.
In the very bad, awful, no good, worst possible news, Curry breaks his left hand early in the third quarter with the Warriors down by 29.
Game 5: Back home, lose to Spurs by 17 … after trailing by 25.
They now start Green, D’Angelo Russell, Glenn Robinson, Willie Cauley-Stein and rookie Jordan Poole, looking more like an expansion team than a dynasty.
This isn’t just a fall. This is the end of the pride of the NBA.
The Warriors didn’t invent the modern offense, spacing the floor with three-point shooters. That was Mike D’Antoni in coaching stints at Phoenix, New York and Houston.

President Trump calls Pelosi's bluff

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has repeatedly slammed the secret impeachment hearings in the Capitol basement as "a totally compromised kangaroo court." Sounds like Speaker Nancy Pelosi got the message. On Monday, she announced the full House will vote to formally launch impeachment proceedings, which will be out in the open instead of in the dark.
Until now, Democrats have been trying to trick the public into believing they've got the goods on Trump. But the truth is, none of the witnesses they've called so far have had any firsthand knowledge of presidential wrongdoing.
Behind closed doors and with no press allowed, House Democrats have tried to put on the appearance of a legal proceeding. At the end of each session, they leak to the press what they claim happened. The media are all too willing to play along, printing the Democratic pols' claims as if they were fact. "Powerful testimony from multiple state and national security officials," the Hill reports, adding up to a "scathing picture of Trump and his allies withholding nearly $400 million in security aid from Ukraine."
Politico called Ukrainian Ambassador Bill Taylor's testimony "explosive," though Taylor's prepared statement merely regurgitated what other State Department minions had told him. His source was the rumor mill. In law, it's called hearsay.
The New York Times reports "a rapidly moving investigation securing damning testimony." That's hardly the case. But soon the jig will be up. Regardless of how many "witnesses" the Dems parade into the Capitol hearing, it won't matter if they have no firsthand knowledge. Even the Times concedes that to impeach a president, the House needs proof "tying him directly" to wrongdoing.
Before Pelosi's announcement on Monday, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who's overseeing the secret hearings, gave up on calling witnesses who have direct, firsthand working relationships with Trump and can attest to what the president has said and done.
Schiff caved after a key witness actually challenged the committee's subpoena as illegitimate and said see you in court. Charles Kupperman, former deputy national security adviser -- and one of the few people who was on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president -- filed a lawsuit, arguing that the House committee can't compel testimony for an impeachment until the full House has voted to authorize subpoenas for that purpose. That, of course, is the vote Pelosi was dodging.
"We are not willing to allow the White House to engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope with the courts," Schiff said. Translation: Dems don't think they'd win in the highest court.
They also don't want to risk dragging the inquiry on for months, as they did with the Mueller investigation. Better to ram anything through. After all, without evidence of grave wrongdoing, the Republican-controlled Senate won't remove this president from office. But Dems have one goal: to impeach Trump, damaging him enough to tip the 2020 election.
Schiff's cynical decision not to meet Kupperman in court indicates he's also not going to press for testimony from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Energy Secretary Rick Perry or former National Security Adviser John Bolton -- advisers who actually know the facts about Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Trump released the transcript of his July 25 call with the Ukrainian president. He didn't have to. If there's any kind of presidential communication that's legally protected, it's conversation between two heads of state. Even so, Democrats and their media allies claim the call is damning evidence of a quid pro quo. All you have to do to see that that's false is read the words yourself.
The public's not stupid, and Pelosi is a far better politician than Schiff. Polls show fewer than half of voters support impeachment in key swing states like Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan. These are states Trump won in 2016, and Pelosi has been reluctant to put Democratic members from these states on the spot. But Trump's called her bluff. Now the Democrats will have to put up or shut up.

Texto completo: Los críticos del presidente Donald Trump se burlaron en internet y lo acusaron de intentar aligerar su factura de impuestos después de que anunció el jueves que su residencia permanente sería Palm Beach, Florida, en lugar de la Torre Trump en Nueva York.
“Donald Trump no quiere que el estado de Nueva York vea sus impuestos, me pregunto por qué. Digamos esto como es: corrupción, simple y llanamente”, tuiteó el jueves la senadora Elizabeth Warren , candidata presidencial para las elecciones de 2020.
Trump, un neoyorquino de toda la vida, presentó una “declaración de domicilio” ante el Tribunal de Circuito del Condado de Palm Beach en septiembre, renunciando a su residencia en Nueva York y designando el resort Mar-a-Lago de la familia como su residencia principal, según The New York Times. El diario, que informó por primera vez el cambio de residencia de Trump, dijo que la medida tiene motivos fiscales: Florida en particular no tiene impuestos estatales sobre la renta o la herencia.
En Nueva York, Trump enfrenta el escrutinio tanto del fiscal general del estado como del fiscal de distrito de Manhattan sobre sus declaraciones de impuestos.
“Los estadounidenses de a pie no son dueños de resorts que pueden enumerar como direcciones alternativas para modificar su obligación tributaria”, tuiteó el jueves la representante Nita Lowey, demócrata de Nueva York. “Las familias de clase media hoy enfrentan más cargas impositivas mientras el presidente esquiva las consecuencias del proyecto de ley republicano”.
Dan Pfeiffer, exasesor de Obama, bromeó en un tuit el jueves: “El presidente huye a Florida para evitar pagar impuestos”.
Trump tuiteó el jueves por la noche que apreciaba su ciudad natal y “odiaba tener que tomar esta decisión”, pero “a pesar del hecho de que pago millones de dólares en impuestos municipales, estatales y locales cada año, los líderes políticos me han tratado muy mal, tanto de la ciudad como del estado “.
Agregó que Nueva York “siempre tendrá un lugar especial en mi corazón”.
La exrepresentante Gwen Graham, demócrata de Florida, reaccionó a la noticia con solo cuatro palabras: “Nosotros. No. Lo. queremos”.
Y Michael Steele, ex presidente del Comité Nacional Republicano, tuiteó: “Maldita sea, habrás sacado a Trump de #NYC”. #PobreFlorida “.
El alcalde de Nueva York, Bill de Blasio, demócrata y ex candidato de 2020, también opinó.
“No dejes que la puerta te golpee al salir o algo así”, tuiteó el jueves. De Blasio hizo un seguimiento temprano el viernes con otro mensaje: “Nuestro más sentido pésame a la buena gente de Florida mientras Trump intenta escapar de su pasado (y futuro cercano)”.
En un monólogo burlón el viernes por la mañana, Pat Kiernan , presentador de noticias matutinas durante mucho tiempo en NY1, también criticó duramente al presidente por la mudanza, específicamente el costo y las molestias que la ciudad ha soportado para proteger el perímetro de la Torre Trump en Manhattan.

“No dejes que la puerta te golpee al salir o algo así”, tuiteó el jueves. De Blasio hizo un seguimiento temprano el viernes con otro mensaje: “Nuestro más sentido pésame a la buena gente de Florida mientras Trump intenta escapar de su pasado (y futuro cercano)”.
En un monólogo burlón el viernes por la mañana, Pat Kiernan , presentador de noticias matutinas durante mucho tiempo en NY1, también criticó duramente al presidente por la mudanza, específicamente el costo y las molestias que la ciudad ha soportado para proteger el perímetro de la Torre Trump en Manhattan.

Texto completo: Following his breakout debate performance, presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has surged into striking distance of a win in Iowa, putting up his best showing in recent polls in the state with the first nominating contest.
In a New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday morning, the mayor of South Bend is polling at 18%, behind Elizabeth Warren at 22% and Bernie Sanders at 19%. He edged out Joe Biden, who entered the race at the top of the polls in Iowa, but slipped to fourth place at 17%.
The poll has a margin of error of 4.7%, meaning the race remains tight, with the top three in a statistical tie. The remaining candidates are polling at 4% or less.
In some ways it's no surprise. Pundits think Buttigieg is positioned to contend in mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire, but caution his continuing struggle in South Carolina, a state with a larger African American population, might be more noteworthy.
"He's bound to do well in Iowa," said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. "He's Midwestern and Iowa is 90 percent white. I'm still very skeptical that he can go on to win the nomination (given his lack of support among African Americans). I just don't see how he does it."
Buttigieg has had a sometimes bumpy relationship with African Americans in South Bend, most recently thrust into the spotlight when a white police officer shot a black man wielding a knife this summer.
It's not his only obstacle. Acceptance of marriage equality and LGBTQ rights among African Americans and Latinos is growing, but isn't as high as among other groups, a potential problem for the first openly gay Democratic candidate for president.
Still, pundits say a win in Iowa would give him more time to win over those voters. And if Biden continues to stumble, many might be looking for a more moderate candidate than Warren and Sanders, a point Buttigieg reinforced again and again at the October debate.
"If he can be successful in Iowa and in New Hampshire that gives him more time and opportunity to really reach out to voters and try to get them on his side," said Laura Merrifield Wilson, assistant professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis.
In fact, the national takeaway from the recent polls has been the continuing collapse of Biden, pundits say, which is leaving the door open for other candidates like Buttigieg.
"Biden is now, I think you can make an argument that he's out in Iowa and New Hampshire," Sabato said. "That ought to be a concern for him, though he has a chance to recover in South Carolina (where he remains popular with African American voters)."
The poll had more good news for Buttigieg, who has been positioning himself as a moderate alternative to the former vice president. The South Bend mayor is the second choice of 31% of caucus goers, behind only Sanders at 34%.
Buttigieg fared somewhat better with older voters than younger voters, according to the poll.
There was some bad news for him, too. Among the top four candidates, voters were the least confident in his chances of defeating President Donald Trump, at 70%. Warren was at 81%, Biden at 80% and Sanders at 76%.
The poll of 439 Iowa Democratic caucus goers was conducted Oct. 25-30.
Buttigieg has been a leader in collecting campaign money, and he appears to be putting it to good use, said Andy Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics.
"It's being put to work in Iowa and in New Hampshire and in South Carolina and we'll see if the same sort of thing can happen (elsewhere)," Downs said.
The survey comes just a week after Buttigieg polled at 20% in the latest Iowa State University/Civiqs poll, behind only Warren at 28%.
Sanders was at 18% and Biden at 12% in that poll of 598 likely Democratic caucus attendees surveyed between October 18-22. The margin of error was 5%.
Buttigieg moved up from fourth place in the same poll in September.
There was trouble for the mayor in this poll, too, foreshadowing his issues in more diverse states.
Among non white voters in Iowa, Buttigieg was at fifth place at 9%, behind Biden, Warrem, Sanders and Kamala Harris. The mayor also ranked poorly as a second choice, ranking behind Warren, Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard.

DES MOINES, Iowa—Thirteen Democratic presidential candidates addressed roughly 13,000 Democrats at the Wells Fargo Arena here, hoping to replicate Barack Obama's performance at a similar event 12 years ago that started his path to the party's nomination.
In the crowded 2020 field, with each candidate getting 10 minutes over the course of more than four hours, there was no single breakout performance like Mr. Obama's.
Here are several moments that mattered with less than 100 days until the first nominating contest:
"I'm here to launch the era that must come next."
South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg almost immediately invoked Mr. Obama, pitching himself as the young Washington outsider capable of uniting the country after what is likely to be a divisive general election. "The first time I came to this state was as a volunteer, to knock on doors for a presidential candidate—a young man with a funny name," he said.

Mr. Buttigieg's supporters took some cues from Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign. Clad in bright yellow and lights, they clapped thunder sticks together loudly and took over the largest section of the arena.
"We knew the stakes were high then. The stakes are colossal now," Mr. Buttigieg said.
Hundreds of his backers, who deemed themselves the "barnstormers," traveled from around the country to see Mr. Buttigieg. Lynn Wilson, a nurse from Rochester, Minn., described him as "hope personified."
Mr. Buttigieg has been enjoying a bump in recent polling. A Friday New York Times/Siena College poll had Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Mr. Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden all effectively tied among Democratic primary voters in Iowa, close behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
"Anyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory."
Ms. Warren, who rarely veers off her usual campaign speech, made a more forceful case for the "big structural change" her campaign is centered on. With the moderates in the race targeting her more aggressively, Ms. Warren used part of her speech to respond to her critics.

"Look, anyone who comes on this stage and doesn't understand that we're already in a fight is not the person who is going to win that fight," she said.
"I'm not running some consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed to not offend anyone," Ms. Warren added.
Mr. Biden—along with Mr. Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who are all seeking to win over more moderate Midwestern voters—have been going after Ms. Warren lately over her support for a government-run health-care plan that would eliminate private insurers.
"Unlike others, I've never represented a corporation."
California Sen. Kamala Harris, who has been fading in polls as her campaign goes all-in on Iowa, emphasized her experience as a prosecutor, including a line that could be seen as a shot at Ms. Warren.
"I've never represented a special interest," Ms. Harris said. "I've always represented the people."
Ms. Warren's work for corporations while she was a law professor has come under scrutiny from some liberals. As an expert on bankruptcy, she made hundreds of thousands of dollars representing corporate clients. Her campaign has disclosed 50 cases she was involved in on its website.
Ms. Harris, whose campaign was hoping to use her speech Friday to reboot her candidacy, got one of loudest receptions from the crowd.
"This is like a general election in a primary."
Mr. Biden, who has been fighting to hold on to his front-runner status, continued to stress to caucus-goers that he was the best candidate to take on President Trump, saying Republicans have already turned their firepower on him.

"Folks, it's the reason he's spending so much money with his henchmen in running ads against me in a primary. This is just like a general election, in a primary," Mr. Biden said. "He knows I will beat him like a drum."
Mr. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in part over efforts to press Ukraine to launch an investigation into Mr. Biden and his family. Mr. Trump and the GOP have accused Mr. Biden's son Hunter Biden of profiting off his father's name.
"I see you, I love you."
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker received a standing ovation for his speech pushing unity. He began by talking about a mentor whose last words were "I see you, I love you."
"I hear the pundits say this about who's polling the best or who has the most money or who can best deliver a shot against another Democrat on a stage," Mr. Booker said. "This is going to be best decided by who can best pull us to our common aspiration, who can best inspire us to be the truth of who we are."
So far, Mr. Booker's positive message has failed to garner strong support. He averages in the low-single digits in national and early state polls.
Other low-polling candidates failed to even get a proper introduction. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney was introduced with photos of Montana Gov. Steve Bullock on the screens behind the stage. When it was Mr. Bullock's turn, the announcer introduced him as Mr. Booker.

Texto completo: She was a 20-year-old sprinter when she made history by lighting the caldron at the Summer Games in Mexico City in 1968.
Enriqueta Basilio, a Mexican sprinter who at the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City became the first woman to light the Olympic flame, died on Oct. 26. She was 71.
Her death was confirmed by the Mexican Olympic Committee, which did not specify where she died or the cause.
The 1968 Olympic Games were memorable for a number of reasons, starting with Basilio's appearance in the opening ceremonies. A 20-year-old member of the Mexican track and field team, she created a stir in the international press after she was selected to light the Olympic caldron and greeted the honor with aplomb.
The New York Times quoted her as saying, through a translator, that she thought she may have been selected because Mexican men and women had "the same rights," and that her country hoped to demonstrate this equality to the world.
"The days we live in, it's difficult to depend on a man," Basilio said. "They must be iguales -- the same."
On Oct. 12, 1968, Basilio ran into the Olympic stadium in Mexico City holding the Olympic torch, which had been carried over land and sea from Greece by a succession of more than 2,775 torchbearers. She jogged around the track, climbed 90 carpeted steps and dipped the torch into a massive metal caldron, igniting gas burners and officially starting the Games as some 100,000 spectators roared.
"Anyone with acutely sensitive ears could then hear a spectral sound," the Times sports columnist Arthur Daley wrote. "It would have been the ancient Greeks spinning madly in their crumbling mausoleums. They never permitted a woman to come near their Olympic Games but had summary punishment for every female intruder detected. She was promptly tossed off a seaside cliff onto the rocks below."
He continued: "Here was a woman in a focal role a couple of thousand years later. She handled it well."
The Mexico City Olympics had several more unforgettable moments, among them when the American track and field athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised black-gloved fists on the winners' podium to protest racism during the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner," and when the American Bob Beamon shattered the long jump world record by leaping 29 feet, two and a half inches -- nearly two feet farther than the previous record.
Basilio competed in the 400-meter, the 80-meter hurdles and the 400-meter relay. But she was eliminated in each event and never again competed at the Olympics.
Several women have since lit the Olympic flame at Winter and Summer Games. But Basilio and the Australian sprinter Cathy Freeman, who lit the caldron at the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, in 2000, are the only two to ignite the flame at the Summer Games by themselves.
Norma Enriqueta Basilio Sotelo was born on July 15, 1948, in Mexicali, the capital of the state of Baja California, to a large family of cotton farmers. She attended college in her home city and became a national champion in the 80-meter hurdles before her turn in the Olympics.
Information on her survivors was not immediately available.
In 2004 Basilio carried the Olympic torch once again, this time as it passed through Mexico City en route to the Summer Games in Athens.

Democrats Sharpen Attacks to Win Over Iowans

Texto completo: Ms. Warren said "complacency does not win elections," as she pushed for big changes, while moderates like Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden vowed they could unite the country.
DES MOINES -- Displaying a new assertiveness toward her Democratic opponents, Elizabeth Warren laced into her chief political rivals, warning on Friday night that the country was in a "time of crisis" and arguing that Democrats would lose in 2020 if they nominated "anyone who comes on this stage and tells you they can make change without a fight."
Speaking to thunderous applause during the party's biggest Iowa political event of the year, Ms. Warren denounced candidates in the presidential race who opposed bold ideas in favor of more moderate solutions, in veiled attacks on Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Pete Buttigieg.
"Complacency does not win elections," she said at the Iowa Democratic Party's fund-raising dinner. "Hope and courage do not win elections. I'm not running some consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone."
Befitting her front-runner status, Ms. Warren was the target of heated attacks from three of the first five speakers on the stage: Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. None of the candidates mentioned one another by name, though Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg both presented themselves as more capable of uniting the country.
"We will fight when we must fight but I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think that fighting is the point," Mr. Buttigieg said.
Mr. Biden, who spoke directly after Mr. Buttigieg, extended the theme, saying, "If you can't bring the country together we're in real, real, real trouble."
Even Ms. Harris, whose campaign is lagging to the point that she may not qualify for the party's December debate, attacked Ms. Warren personally for the first time.
"I've only had one client in my life -- the people," Ms. Harris said of her career as a prosecutor. "Unlike others, I've never represented a corporation."
The sharp exchanges underscored the urgency motivating the candidates as the race enters its final phase ahead of the Iowa caucuses three months from now.
The dinner occurred on one of the most consequential days of the race so far, with Ms. Warren, under pressure from other candidates over how she would pay for "Medicare for all," finally introducing a long-awaited, $ 20.5 trillion proposal that immediately drew a fierce attack from her chief rival, Mr. Biden.
Mr. Biden declared that under his health care plan, there would be "no increase in taxes for the middle class. None, none, none," a shot at Ms. Warren's delay in articulating whether such taxpayers would see tax increases. Instead, Mr. Biden promised an opportunity to "buy into a Medicare-like proposal."
The Biden, Buttigieg and Warren campaigns each bought large sections of the 16,000-seat Wells Fargo Arena here for supporters to cheer on their candidates. Mr. Buttigieg's section was particularly enthusiastic, clapping thundersticks and waving flashing lights throughout his address. Ms. Warren's fans were also spirited, unfurling a banner during her speech with the words, "Win with Warren."
Mr. Sanders, while speaking at the event, brought no supporters, electing to lead them in a march outside instead, part of a pattern of the independent senator's antipathy toward Democratic Party functions.
At the same time, the candidates have been wooing voters with bus tours, rallies and town hall-style events. Ms. Harris, the California senator who is trying to revive her campaign, has taken to cooking Sunday night dinners in supporters' homes and plans to spend Thanksgiving in the state.
The surge in attention on Iowa coincides with a more contentious phase of the race, marked by aggressive campaigning and an increased willingness to go on the offensive.
Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, and Mr. Biden, the former vice president, have resumed their attacks on each other, with back-and-forth sniping in the last week about Medicare for all and super PACs. Mr. Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have shown an increased willingness to go after Ms. Warren, the senator from Massachusetts.
Hours before the dinner was to begin, Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas announced the end of his presidential campaign. His departure was so sudden that supporters had already planted scores of his signature black-and-white campaign signs outside the arena.
Lower-tier candidates looking to energize their campaigns have also been more pugnacious: Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, for instance, has amped up her criticisms of the Democratic National Committee, the news media and even Hillary Clinton, who is not in the race.
But nowhere has the battle been more intense than at the event on Friday, with candidates trading barbs less on specific policies, and more on political ideology.
"We need big ideas, and here's the critical part: We need to be willing to fight for them," Ms. Warren said. "It's easy to give up on a big idea, but when we give up on big ideas, we give up on the people whose lives would be touched by those ideas."
Of the top-tier candidates, only Mr. Sanders -- the sole candidate to stand stationary and speak from note on a lectern -- did not attack his opponents, instead delivering a version of his standard stump speech that championed the working class and took aim at corporate interests and the rich. He quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt and Nelson Mandela and provided please for his signature policy proposals, including Medicare for all and tuition-free public college.
He also announced his campaign was donating $ 20,000 to the Iowa Democratic Party in a symbolic show of solidarity even as he continues to eschew traditional party politicking.
The crowded and diverse field -- there are still 17 candidates -- has proved challenging for contenders outside the top tier. While nine have qualified for the party's November debate in Atlanta, just four are guaranteed a spot for the December debate in Los Angeles.
A poll taken this week of likely caucusgoers by The New York Times and Siena College shows the top four candidates locked in an extraordinarily tight race. Ms. Warren held a narrow advantage, with the support of 22 percent of voters, while Mr. Sanders drew 19 percent and Mr. Buttigieg 18 percent. Mr. Biden, who entered the race as a front-runner, had the backing of 17 percent of likely caucusgoers, much weaker than his position in national polls.
For Democrats who had been inclined to support Mr. Biden but now find themselves shopping around, that means the moderate choices are limited to Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Ms. Klobuchar, the senator from Minnesota, with other would-be options like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey falling out of the conversation.
Susan Swift, a 58-year-old yoga teacher from Dubuque, said at a Biden event Wednesday that even after watching nine months of campaigning she was still trying to decipher the field.
Ms. Swift said she liked the former vice president for "his experience," but had become more impressed with Mr. Buttigieg the more she had seen him.
"Did you see the pluck that that guy had in the last debate?" she said. "Seriously? I was like, 'You just won my heart."'
Conversations this week with 24 of Iowa's 99 Democratic county leaders revealed moderate Democrats moving from Mr. Biden toward Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, who the county officials said had benefited from strong debate performances and repeated trips to the state.
Mr. Sanders, who fought Mrs. Clinton to a draw in Iowa four years ago, has struggled to retain support in the party's most liberal pockets. Some of his anti-establishment backers have gravitated to candidates even more outside the mainstream, like the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Ms. Gabbard.
Zach Simonson, the Democratic chairman in Wapello County, backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 and said he was now torn between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren.
"I was all in for Bernie in 2016, but with Warren in the race, some of the weaker parts of his candidacy are magnified," Mr. Simonson said. "He's got a very reasonable critique of the national Democratic Party institution, but from campaigning so much on the outside, I don't know if he'll be ready to take the role of national standard-bearer for all Democrats after the convention."

DES MOINES, Iowa—The leading Democratic presidential contenders, bunched together in the latest Iowa poll, sought to separate themselves from the pack in a high-stakes audition Friday night just three months before this state's leadoff caucuses.
In back-to-back speeches before roughly 13,000 Democratic Party activists, the candidates rarely spoke about an effort to impeach President Trump and instead offered a stark choice over their own party's future: dramatic change or building on the policies of former President Obama.
The gathering itself was heavy on spectacle and ear-piercing at times. The candidates, who mostly spoke without notes, had 10 minutes to make their pitch in an arena filled with signs, thunder sticks and campaign T-shirts.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which Democrat do you think has the best chance to win the February Iowa caucuses? Why? Join the conversation below.
The 13 candidates who spoke at the Liberty and Justice Celebration sought the kind of breakout moment recorded a dozen years ago at a similar event by Mr. Obama, then the junior senator from Illinois and trailing in the polls. The dinner was the final major Iowa organizing event before the Feb. 3 caucuses, when participants must attend hourslong gatherings on an often-frigid winter night.
The candidates took the stage as a new survey showed a tight race in Iowa. A New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 22%, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 19%, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., at 18% and former Vice President Joe Biden at 17%.
The survey is the latest warning sign for Mr. Biden, who entered the race in April as the leading contender in Iowa and nationally. He still leads in most national polls, but his weakness in a state that ended his last presidential bid in 2008 has raised concerns about his ability to challenge Mr. Trump.
His uneven performances on the campaign trail and in the debates have presented an opening for other moderate candidates in the race, including Mr. Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

'I'm here to launch the era that must come next,' said candidate Pete Buttigieg at Friday's event. PHOTO: Michael Bucher/The Wall Street Journal
Mr. Buttigieg was the first candidate to take the stage and most directly compared himself to Mr. Obama in a bid to present himself as an heir to the former president's legacy. Mr. Buttigieg noted that more than a decade ago he was an organizer in Iowa for "a young man with a funny name," a reference to his own age and hard-to-pronounce name.
"We knew the stakes were high then," Mr. Buttigieg, 37 years old, said. "The stakes are colossal now."
Mr. Buttigieg had one of the largest and loudest groups of supporters. As he walked on stage, his supporters turned on flashing green and blue LED lights that framed signs reading "BOOT EDGE EDGE."
"I'm here to launch the era that must come next," he said. "I am ready to gather up an American majority that is hungry for change, that is done with division."
Ms. Warren embraced the mantle of the race's agent of change, pointing to 2020 as the year to win the fight for liberal causes such as a Green New Deal , Medicare for All and her signature tax on the wealthiest Americans .
"Anyone who comes on stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory," she said, decrying a campaign that "nibbles around the edges" in a veiled shot at Mr. Biden.
"If the most we can promise is business as usual after Donald Trump, then Democrats will lose," she said.

In his remarks, Mr. Biden made no mention of Ms. Warren but sought to offer a contrast to her on health care in the hours after she rolled out a plan on how she would pay for her Medicare for All proposal .
Mr. Biden said the next administration needed to "build upon the Affordable Care Act, not abandon it," adding, "We can do it quickly without taxing the middle class."
Going further, Mr. Biden pledged that there would be "no increases in taxes for the middle class, none, none, none."
The decibel level inside the arena was significantly lower during Mr. Biden's speech compared with those by Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.
Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who has sought to reboot her campaign in recent days , took a swipe at Ms. Warren, who served as a corporate consultant while teaching at Harvard Law School.
"Unlike others, I've never represented a corporation. I've never represented a special interest," Ms. Harris said, recalling her work as a California prosecutor "for the people."
Mr. Sanders, unlike the other top candidates, used a lectern for his speech, predicting that the president "will soon be impeached."
But Mr. Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the party's nomination in 2016, devoted much of his remarks to the areas of disagreement in the party. He said Democrats would need to decide whether to continue "status quo politics" or change.
"The Democratic Party must become the party of the working-class of this country, not of super PACs, not of corporate interests, not of their lobbyists," Mr. Sanders said.
The senator had virtually no supporters in the arena because his campaign opted instead to host a separate event nearby. An aide said the campaign donated $20,000 to the state party instead of purchasing seats in the arena.
Also absent was Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who dropped out of the race two hours before the event began. He had struggled to raise money recently and based on his most recent polling was unlikely to meet the necessary threshold to qualify for the fifth debate later this month.

Stray bullet kills beloved Queens boy

Texto completo: NEW YORK - He was a 14-year-old boy playing basketball at dusk before curfew. Just another night, on his usual court, focused on the game he envisioned as his future.
Then came the gunshots, splintering the fall air. From 100 yards down the block, a bullet sailed across a parking lot, slipped through a fence and struck the teenager - a neighborhood jewel whom everyone knew - Aamir Griffin.
A boy and a dream crumpled to the concrete. Not the target, but the victim.
Some would chalk it up to wrong place, wrong time. But Aamir had been where he was meant to be: outside his apartment building in Jamaica, Queens, shooting hoops, staying far from the trouble that had lured away so many of his peers.
"Aamir was not like these little kids out here running around and trying to gangbang for fun," said his friend Isis Eastman, 16. "Aamir just played ball. That's all he did."
Crime is at an all-time low across New York City, dropping to levels not seen for nearly seven decades. But gun violence still flares in some pockets, shattering worlds and igniting despair. Officials have attributed recent bursts to gang conflicts.
Northern Brooklyn has seen a rise in shootings this year, with six in one weekend alone. So have several precincts in Manhattan and Queens. The 113th Precinct, where Aamir was killed Saturday, has had more than 20 shootings this year, compared with 13 for the same period in 2018.
Police officials acknowledge the uptick and say they plan to deploy extra resources to certain areas and create "safe corridors" for students going to and from school.
Two days after Aamir's death, a 16-year-old girl in Jamaica was struck in the arm by a stray bullet when a fight erupted during dismissal at New Dawn Charter High School II.
The episodes are believed to be related.
Chief of Detectives Dermot F. Shea said the shootings appeared to stem from a feud between two gangs. "These are young kids with guns," he said. "Sometimes they forget what they were fighting for."
A male teenager was questioned Tuesday about both shootings but not charged in them, Shea said. Instead, he was arrested on an unrelated robbery charge.
Frustrated residents are unable to reconcile such brazen acts with the heavy police presence in their neighborhood. Next to the basketball court where Aamir was shot is a security camera. Across the street, a Police Department watchtower.
The shootings are a symptom of the dearth of resources for youth, said Erica Ford, an area activist who founded LIFE Camp, a nonprofit that aims to stem gun violence.
"There are pockets with no investments in certain neighborhoods," Ford said. "There is nothing for these kids to do. It's like a third-world country."
But Aamir was an outlier, a boy who had found his calling and built his life around it. He had become one of the brightest fixtures in his corner of Jamaica, a tight-knit community where neighbors watch out for one another.
They knew his grin, the one he flashed that made his deep-set dimples appear. Playful and lighthearted, he had one of those belly laughs, so infectious, even if you didn't know what was funny. He was charismatic, easy to be around, but took care to show others respect. When he stopped by the local convenience store to order a chopped cheese with jalape�os, he would offer to help the owner stack the shelves.
"He was nothing but joy," said his friend Daja, 15, who declined to give her surname.
Aamir liked to dance and play video games. But he defined himself through basketball.
He had been a chubby child, round cheeks, short stature. It didn't matter. He played as if he were tall and lithe, always working drills, challenging friends, entering tournaments. He walked around with a basketball tucked in the crook of his arm, and passersby knew to ask him about his game. He idolized Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Stephen Curry.
The love of the sport had come from his father. The fire that drove him was all his.
"He was more determined than all of us," his friend Billy Jeanfrancois, 14, said. "He was like, 'I'm going to lose and come back stronger.'"
Aamir was thrilled to make his middle school team. When they lost their first game, he cried. At a matchup later in the season, the team was again close to defeat.
"Then Aamir started draining threes," recalled Shamel McCallum, 14, who lives in the same public housing complex as Aamir did. "He was the clutch player."
By then, Aamir had slimmed down and sprouted to nearly 6 feet.
He applied and got into Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, wanting to learn from its storied coach, Ron Naclerio.
"He was a sponge, he wanted to work," Naclerio said. "He really had no ego. Kids today that are good, you can see a bravado like, 'I'm the bomb, I'm the best.' They'll put stuff on Facebook or their social media like they're the next LeBron. He was not like that at all."
Aamir was being prepped to be the shooting guard for the junior varsity team. He kept up his grades so he could stay eligible. He spoke often about the NBA.
"He had tunnel vision," his stepfather, Larry Hawkins, said. "It's just so rare at that age. He already had his mind made up."
If the goal of going pro was too lofty, too impractical, no one told him. And he could make people believe.
They liked how basketball centered him. He earned the nickname "Buddy," because of his welcoming demeanor and how he enjoyed teaching others to play. If you were looking for a game, you only had to track down Aamir.
"We definitely had big dreams for him, but for him to be a good person was overall the best thing," said Shaun Lilly, 35, the fiance of Aamir's aunt. "That's what it really was about at the end of the day."
Aamir had two older sisters and a younger brother and lived in the Baisley Park Houses with his stepfather and his mother, Shanequa Griffin.
"He was passionate, he was amazing, he was great - he was everything a mother could ask for in a kid," Griffin said.
Aamir would tell her that once he became a star, he was going to buy her a house and a flashy car.
"He used to always say, 'Ma, you're my best friend,'" she said.
On Saturday, Aamir had risen early to warm up for a tournament. He led his team to a victory by hitting a last-minute 3-pointer.
When he arrived home, he headed to the court to play with his friends. Just after 8 p.m., several shots were fired near the intersection of Foch Boulevard and Long Street, the police said.
Aamir slumped to the ground with a bullet in his torso. He was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. Surveillance video showed two people fleeing the area, one in a red hooded sweatshirt, the other in dark clothing. On Monday afternoon, community members flocked to that same blue-gray court, the crowd increasing with each hour as the temperature dropped. They were friends and neighbors who had no words to heal a family broken by violence. But they wanted to be near to help bear the weight of the loss. Aamir had been theirs, too.
Items were added to the memorial of flowers and teddy bears and balloons. "Rest easy young king, you're too good to be forgotten," read a message on a poster with Aamir's photo. On the ground, a giant heart had been created with candles. Within it, a logo written for a brilliant boy: "E4A." Everything for Aamir.

Texto completo: The impeachment inquiry into President Trump over his pressure on Ukraine to conduct an investigation into a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, is moving rapidly, and developments are coming to light at all hours. Here's a summary of what you might have missed, and what's expected to happen next.
What happened Thursday
— The House voted 232-196 to formalize the impeachment inquiry on Thursday, marking the first time since the inquiry began that members were forced to go on record either in support or opposition to it. It was a largely party line vote, with no Republicans supporting the House resolution, and two all but Democrats voting in favor. The Globe's Jazmine Ulloa and Ryan Wangman describe the mood on Capitol Hill.
— White House national security aide Tim Morrison confirmed testimony that EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland told Morrison of an explicit quid pro quo related to Ukraine: That promised military aid would not be sent until Ukraine's president committed to investigating Trump's political rivals.
What's expected to happen next
— Though lawmakers break today for recess, and will return on Nov. 12, several Trump administration officials are scheduled be deposed by investigators on Monday, including a top aide to acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. It's unlear whether those depositions will take place because the officials haven't responded to subpoenas.
— House Democratic leaders would like to see public hearings wrapped up by Thanksgiving, according to the New York Times.

Texto completo: Our guide to stand-up, improv and variety shows happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
RACHEL FEINSTEIN at Gotham Comedy Club (Nov. 1-2, 8 and 10 p.m.). This stand-up is one of the girls on the Spotify podcast "3 Girls, 1 Keith" (the other two are Amy Schumer and Bridget Everett; the Keith is Keith Robinson). She also released an hourlong stand-up special on Comedy Central in 2016 and a half-hour spot on Season 2 of Netflix's "The Standups." On Friday and Saturday, she headlines this venerable comedy club in Chelsea.

'KREEPS WITH KIDS' at St. George Theater (Nov. 2, 8 p.m.). The four stand-ups headlining this tour -- Ron Bennington, a SiriusXM host; Jim Florentine, a "Crank Yankers" voice actor; Robert Kelly; and Rich Vos -- have more in common than just being fathers. They found their warped sensibilities mesh well onstage, so they decided to go out on the road together. They're all based in the tristate area, but Staten Island is so far their only New York City stop on this tour.

[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
NICK OFFERMAN at Beacon Theater (Nov. 3, 7:30 p.m.). This actor, who became widely known from his role on NBC's "Parks and Recreation," has written four New York Times best sellers this decade: "Paddle Your Own Canoe: One Man's Fundamentals for Delicious Living," "Gumption: Relighting the Torch of Freedom With America's Gutsiest Troublemakers," "Good Clean Fun: Misadventures in Sawdust at Offerman Woodshop," and, with his wife, the actress Megan Mullally, "The Greatest Love Story Ever Told." Currently he co-hosts the NBC show "Making It." This is his first theater tour since 2017.
212-465-6000, beacontheatre.com
'JULIA SWEENEY: OLDER AND WIDER' at Joe's Pub (Nov. 3, 7 p.m.). In the 1990s and 2000s, Sweeney was a cast member on "Saturday Night Live," starred in "It's Pat: The Movie," appeared on TV shows such as "Frasier" and "Sex and the City," and performed one-handers such as "God Said, 'Ha!"' and "In the Family Way." Then, for about a decade, Sweeney, who currently co-stars in the Hulu series "Shrill," took a breather from Hollywood to spend time with her husband and child in Chicago. In this, her latest monologue, she will fill us in on those years.
212-967-7555, joespub.com
'WE HEART JOAN' at Housing Works Bookstore Cafe (Nov. 1, 7 p.m.). The estate of Joan Rivers is donating some of her items to Housing Works, posthumously continuing the comedian's support for New Yorkers with AIDS. This SoHo bookstore will celebrate Rivers with an auction of these items and a showcase of some of the city's current funny ladies, hosted by Macy Rodman and Theda Hammel. Catherine Cohen, Mo Fry Pasic, Rachel Pegram and Sydnee Washington will perform.

Texto completo: Readers express disappointment in the partisanship that marked the vote and urge Democrats to "throw the book at Donald Trump."
To the Editor:
Re "A Divided House Endorses Impeachment Inquiry Into Trump" (nytimes.com, Oct. 31):
It is a sad day for American democracy when not one Republican voted to authorize the public impeachment inquiry. The resolution was fair and gave Republicans all they demanded: open hearings, the right to subpoena witnesses and due process for the president, consistent with past impeachment proceedings.
That few would dare to vote their conscience -- I'm assuming that some Republicans in Congress still have a conscience -- is not a surprise given their fear of President Trump and his base. But not even Representative Francis Rooney, who is retiring and had said publicly that he was open to impeachment, voted in favor of the resolution.
It is now really up to the American people. They must tell their Republican representatives that they are disappointed if not outraged that they wouldn't even endorse this public and fair inquiry. For the good of this country, this cannot remain a partisan matter.
Ronald L. Hirsch
Great Barrington, Mass.
To the Editor:
The current impeachment proceedings are not just about President Trump. The proceedings will define how future presidents lead and preserve our democracy. Democracy is based on laws. If future presidents, whether Democratic, Republican, Libertarian or independent, define their own laws, democracy is at risk.
Partisan beliefs have no place in this determination. The message to Congress: Your job is to protect our long-term democracy, not any political party for short-term gain.
As the impeachment process proceeds, may all rise above partisanship, evaluate the facts and make the right long-term decision for our country. This is about more than President Trump.
Karen Lurvey
Marysville, Ohio
To the Editor:
This country was founded because it wanted to be rid of a king. Now we have a king, one who combines the worst qualities of Don Rickles and Don Corleone and who, if he isn't in the pay of Russia, might as well be.
The gutless Republicans led by Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham have allowed the president everything short of nullifying the Constitution by executive order -- though probably they'd let that pass as well.
Ukraine won't be enough for impeachment. The Democrats have to throw the book at Donald Trump to make him seem absolutely, utterly, finally indefensible. Of course, he's that already. But only a full on-camera public litany of his depredations can do the job.

Treasury Dept. Is Scaling Back Rules to Stop Tax Inversions

Texto completo: The Treasury Department says the Obama-era regulations are unnecessary after the 2017 tax overhaul.
WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department said on Thursday that it was rolling back regulations issued under the Obama administration that were enacted to prevent American companies from moving their official residence abroad to reduce their tax bills.
The regulations are no longer necessary, Trump administration officials say, because of changes made in the tax overhaul that President Trump signed in 2017. The changes reduced taxes on American companies and included provisions meant to discourage these so-called inversions. In an inversion, an American company merges with a foreign firm and becomes its subsidiary, effectively moving its headquarters abroad for tax purposes.
The previous regulations, issued over the course of President Barack Obama's second term, were credited by many tax analysts with reducing inversions. Business groups criticized the regulations, and the United States Chamber of Commerce sued to block one set of the rules, calling them "unauthorized and unlawful."
In a news release, the Treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, referred to the 2017 law, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, saying that it "leveled the playing field for American businesses."
"Because tax cuts made our business environment more competitive, we are now able to remove regulatory burdens that have been rendered obsolete, further reduce costs for job creators and hard-working Americans, and protect the U.S. tax base," Mr. Mnuchin added.
Democrats criticized the move.
"The corporations that got a massive taxpayer handout are getting another gift from Donald Trump," Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said in a statement. "The Obama administration had essentially shut down inversions -- transactions whose only purpose is to help big multinational corporations move overseas to avoid paying taxes. Weakening these rules only provides an opening for corporations to again dodge their taxes."
The 2017 law reduced the corporate income tax rate in the United States to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent. It included provisions meant to discourage companies from shifting profits, headquarters designations or actual economic activity overseas to minimize their tax bills.
Thus far there is little evidence, in spite of Mr. Trump's promises, that the law has reversed a flow of outsourcing that saw many American companies move factory production and jobs to lower-cost countries in recent decades. But supporters of the tax law have claimed at least one victory regarding inversions: the purchase this year of the Irish pharmaceutical company Allergan by its American rival AbbVie.
Mr. Obama's anti-inversion regulations had effectively scuttled in 2016 what would have been a merger between Allergan and the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, which would have resulted in Pfizer's moving its declared headquarters overseas.
In beginning to undo the Obama-era rules, Treasury officials on Thursday withdrew a set of documentation requirements issued in October 2016 and proposed to replace other regulations relating to inversions with more "streamlined and targeted" rules regarding when certain corporate debt is treated as stock.

TWITTER TO BAN POLITICAL ADS, UNLIKE FACEBOOK POLICY

Resumen: "While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions," Dorsey added. "Rather than taking the Facebook route and letting anarchy ensue, Twitter is taking responsibility," said Eric Goldman, director of the Santa Clara University School of Law's High Tech Law Institute. People such as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren have sharply criticized Facebook's policy.

Texto completo: As Facebook continues to defend its controversial policy that allows politicians to run false advertising, Twitter said Wednesday it is pulling the plug on political ads altogether.
"We've made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally," Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted Wednesday. "We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought."
The new policy, effective Nov. 22, will apply to candidate and issue ads.
"While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions," Dorsey added.
If that sounds familiar, it's because online misinformation has been shown to have played a key part in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Dorsey and the top executives of Facebook and Google all have testified before Congress over Russian misinformation campaigns run on their social media platforms, among other things.
Some are cheering Twitter's move which could negatively affect its already declining revenue while also pointing out that the company hasn't solved its misinformation problem. So far, the company has offered no antidote for politicians who make false statements in their own tweets.
"Rather than taking the Facebook route and letting anarchy ensue, Twitter is taking responsibility," said Eric Goldman, director of the Santa Clara University School of Law's High Tech Law Institute. "But it's still allowing politicians to lie without consequence."
Goldman said it's not just about President Donald Trump, whose online megaphone of choice is Twitter.
"Trump is a symptom of the disease," he said. "The disease is: Politicians will lie if given the chance." Goldman believes politicians currently in office shouldn't be allowed on Twitter or any other platform where they can spread their messages unfiltered.
Twitter's much bigger competitor, Facebook, has been under fire for refusing to take down an ad by Trump's reelection campaign that included accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden that have been proven false. Facebook said it does not fact-check political ads and has no intention of doing so.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said the policy is a matter of freedom of expression. During Wednesday's earnings call, he dug in and pointed out that TV networks and Google run political ads, too. He also said that political ads will bring in only 0.5% of the company's revenue this year.
People such as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren have sharply criticized Facebook's policy. Warren ran a false ad on Facebook claiming that the tech company is supporting Trump's reelection, which it is not to illustrate her point.
Bernice King, daughter of the late Martin Luther King Jr., also has been critical of Facebook recently because Zuckerberg invoked her father while defending the tech giant's policy. She tweeted a couple of weeks ago: "I'd like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians. These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination." On Wednesday, she wrote in a tweet directed at Dorsey, "Thank you, @jack, for taking the lead on responsible sharing of political ads via social media."
Last week, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's questioning of Zuckerberg exposed holes in Facebook's policy of not checking facts in political ads. When the congresswoman from New York asked the CEO whether she would be able to buy an ad that would target black voters and give them an incorrect election date, he said no. Their exchange has inspired many memes.
In addition, The New York Times this week published a letter sent to Zuckerberg by 250 of his own employees in which they said, "Misinformation affects us all" and "Free speech and paid speech are not the same thing." It was a rare public show of dissent within Facebook.
One San Francisco man is going so far as declaring himself a candidate for California governor to further highlight Facebook's policy. He argues that if Trump can run false ads on Facebook, why can't he?
Adriel Hampton this week registered for the 2022 gubernatorial race, but Facebook has blocked a false ad he tried to run.
"The problem here is regular people in America are being abused by the corporate state," Hampton said Wednesday in an interview with this news organization. He said he's considering suing Facebook over its blocking of his ad and that he plans to produce a whole bunch of fake video ads for other political candidates who also want to call out Facebook over its policy.
Facebook has not returned a request for comment about Hampton.

Texto completo: PHOTO: Gwenda Kaczor
If you want to see how our values change over time, look no further than the kitchen. So many things that once seemed absolutely vital about food just fade away and become an irrelevance. Take sauces. Knowing the "right" French sauce for each dish used to be one of the tests of a cook, but now in these more globalized times, few people would expect you to know your béarnaise from your soubise.
Another idea that I suspect—and hope—is on the way out is the insistence on "authenticity."
You can tie yourself in knots trying to source the ingredients to make the most supposedly authentic version of a particular dish. Is the olive oil in your Ligurian pesto the right one? Does your paella contain the required snails? The truth, however, is that no recipe is ever truly authentic. A dish is always borrowed or tweaked from somewhere else, and that is no bad thing.
A couple of years ago, the Israeli chef Yotam Ottolenghi, who is famous for his inventive flavors, was vilified by readers on the Guardian website for publishing an online recipe for Irish stew. Mr. Ottolenghi made no pretense that his stew was anything anyone would recognize in Ireland, where the original stew is nothing but mutton, potatoes, onions and water. His version—an homage to his Irish husband—contained white wine and herbs and was finished with an aromatic paste of orange zest, garlic and parsley. He saw these addition as a way to adapt Irish stew to his own palate. But to the chef's online critics, these tasty seasonings, especially the orange zest, were a violation of the holy memory of the original Irish stew.
The cult of authenticity is based on the idea that recipes are suspended in time and place, like berries in an old-fashioned Jell-O mold. Yet since the discovery of fire, every generation of cooks has rewritten the rule book of cooking, depending on the ingredients and resources available and the tastes of the times. Modern apples tend to be sweeter than older varieties, so to make an apple pie that tastes authentically like one of the 1950s, you would need to use less sugar.
Even in Ireland, stew is evolving. I recently ate the best Irish stew of my life at a restaurant in Galway run by a brilliant chef from New Zealand named Jess Murphy. In place of potatoes, Ms. Murphy uses an assortment of local root vegetables and seasons the broth with lovage, an herb that tastes like celery, only earthier. Alongside the stew was a damp dark soda bread and superb Irish butter.
If her Irish customers were offended by her updated stew, they showed no sign of it. Sipping the delicious lovage-scented broth, it suddenly occurred to me that it's more respectful to a dish to cook it and keep it alive than it is to insist on making it the exact same way it happened to be made a hundred years ago.
"Who cares if it's authentic, so long as it tastes good?" Mr. Ottolenghi remarked at London's National Theatre in London in August, talking about the Irish stew affair. I was on stage with him and cookery writer Nigella Lawson, talking about "food and identity." Both said that when it comes to food, authenticity is not as important as cooking something authentically delicious. Ms. Lawson said she believed it was important to respect the origins of a recipe and to acknowledge its roots but also to recognize that cooking traditions are always changing.
It's hard enough making time for cooking in the modern world without giving yourself the added burden of authenticity to live up to. A few months ago, the journalist Stephen S. Hall traveled to the city of Amatrice in the Lazio region of Italy for the New York Times, in search of the "real" pasta all'Amatriciana—the deliciously comforting sauce of tomatoes and cured pork. What he discovered was that he had been cooking his favorite pasta dish "wrong" for the past 40 years.
Following Marcella Hazan's classic recipe, Mr. Hall had always made his Amatriciana with pancetta, butter and onions (a recipe that I can confirm is pure comfort), yet he found that in Amatrice, onions and butter were never added to the dish. The true Amatriciana, he found, contained only tomato sauce, pecorino and guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), which has a sweeter taste than pancetta. Locals were horrified when he confessed to using pancetta in his Amatriciana.
Is using pancetta instead of guanciale really such a crime? The thing that gets missed by those who cling to the idea of authentic food is that when you change the context of the cooking, you change the meaning. In Amatrice, guanciale is used in pasta dishes because it is a normal, everyday item. Outside of Italy, as Marcella Hazan wrote, "pork jowl is hard to get," and therefore it's a reasonable choice—and true to the original spirit of the dish—to substitute something that's easier to find.
I am not suggesting for a moment that we should pay no regard to the origin of dishes. A British chain, Marks and Spencer, recently caused offense by selling a vegan wrap sandwich that was labeled as biryani—biryani being a noble and festive Indian rice dish. This wasn't so much an adaptation as an outright piece of misdescription.
But when it comes to authenticity there are bigger fish to fry than whether you used exactly the right variety of wine in your osso bucco. Our stores are full of items that claim to be something they are not. We are sold lemonade that contains no lemons and berry-flavor breakfast cereals that never saw a piece of fruit. A 2010-2012 report on seafood fraud by the nonprofit Oceana found that much of the fish for sale in the U.S. was mislabeled. The group found, for instance, that 87% of the "snapper'' on sale was mislabeled (it was mostly tilapia).
Rather than devoting so much of our energy and attention to searching for the authentic, we could ask a simpler question of our food. Is it real?

Texto completo: In announcing he would not, after all, award the 2020 summit of the Group of Seven major industrial nations to his own resort in Florida, President Donald Trump tweeted, “I thought I was doing something very good for our Country,” and disparaged the “Crazed and Irrational Hostility” of his critics.
Even in backing down, Trump rejects any expectation that he should separate his public office from his business interests. Awarding himself the G-7 summit was especially audacious not least because in 2016, the G-7 committed to fighting corruption specifically in government contracts. But this brazen attempt at self-dealing was consistent with the Trump administration’s long record of retreating from America’s bipartisan role as a leader in the fight against global corruption.
Trump retreat from corruption fight
The United States has long understood that corruption has profoundly corrosive and transnational ripple effects. Where there is impunity for official corruption, government itself becomes a means for the elite to enrich itself and silence its critics. Corruption allowed to fester breeds poverty, violence and instability that can have far reaching consequences. Human Rights Watch, the World Bank and others have documented how corruption often disproportionately harms the poor, denying them access to basic rights such as health, education and fair trials.
Recognizing this, the United States has pioneered groundbreaking efforts to curb corruption through its laws, enforcement and diplomacy. When the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibited U. S. companies from bribing foreign officials in 1977, no other country had a similar law, but similar laws have since been enacted by the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, France and many other countries.
The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act required publicly traded oil, gas and mining companies to publish what they pay to foreign governments, a provision that inspired copycat laws in Canada, the European Union and Norway.
Also in 2010, the Department of Justice established an innovative kleptocracy asset recovery initiative, dedicated to seizing illicit funds laundered in the United States and returning them for the benefit of the public from whom they were stolen.
The United States, however, has retreated from this role under Trump, who once disparaged the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as “ridiculous” and a “terrible law. ” The Dodd-Frank transparency provision hasn’t yet gone into effect because Congress, with Trump’s support, repealed the federal rule creating the disclosure requirement and has yet to propose a replacement.
The Trump administration also withdrew the United States from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a global standard for transparency around natural resources.
Ukraine to Guatemala, walking away
But it’s more than that. The Trump administration sought to cut funding for foreign anti-corruption programs, including in Ukraine. And it has noticeably demurred using its formidable diplomatic leverage to combat corruption in places where America's voice was once decisive. There is perhaps no better example of this transformation and its enormous stakes for the rights of ordinary citizens than Guatemala.
Endemic corruption in Guatemala has allowed organized crime to thrive, fueling grave abuses. Yet the Trump administration helped strangle a fledgling anti-corruption commission in Guatemala, which shuttered its doors in September. The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, known as CICIG, was backed by the United Nations and founded in 2007 with the strong support of President George W. Bush. The United States, its top donor, had given it $44 million.
Don't praise Trump for G-7 reversal: It was an intolerable abuse of power.
In 2015, when then-President Otto Pérez Molina threatened to end CICIG’s mandate, he said he reversed course because the Obama administration made its continuation “practically a condition” for U. S. aid. Only months later, Pérez Molina was forced to resign after a CICIG investigation connected him to massive corruption.
In sharp contrast, the Trump administration has stood by silently since Guatemala’s latest president, Jimmy Morales, whom CICIG has also accused of corruption, announced last year that he would not extend the commission’s mandate.
Trump is role model for corruption
Beyond that, Trump’s flagrant self-dealing, by echoing the language of kleptocrats, is itself a major blow to the fight against global corruption. Soon after he was elected, he told The New York Times he sees no problem pursuing his business interests during official meetings. “The president can’t have a conflict of interest,” he said.
He has also refused to release his tax returns or divest from his complex web of international businesses, as all modern U. S. presidents have done. (He promised to put his businesses in a revocable trust run by his sons, although it would do little to resolve the risk of conflict of interest, and no trust agreement has been made public. ) Since then, he has regularly used the presidency in ways that benefit his businesses — for example, making over 360 visits to properties he owns at enormous public expense.
Trump's sleaze: Grifters, women, trampling Constitution and now G-7 at Doral
In pursuing these open conflicts of interest, Trump gives cover to other kleptocrats who loot public funds. In one 2011 case, the Justice Department's anti-kleptocracy unit seized a private plane, California mansion and other assets belonging to Teodorin Obiang, son of the president of Equatorial Guinea, where I have spent years documenting corruption and its contributions to the dire state of health, education and human rights. Justice uncovered evidence detailing how officials, including the president’s son, siphoned off millions in government funds by awarding enormous contracts to companies they own.
Obiang’s defense was that he did not break any laws because conflict of interest rules don’t apply to senior officials. Justice vigorously protested this argument and ultimately settled the case for $30 million, which the agency must now repatriate for the benefit of ordinary Equatorial Guineans.
Trump backed away from his most audacious attempt at self-dealing in the face of criticism from Republicans, but they were merely treating a symptom. They should return to the fight against corruption at home and abroad.

The Democrats' Spooky Politics

Texto completo: It was this weekend in 2012 that I went to a Halloween party wearing a quite realistic-looking Joe Biden mask. After about an hour, people said it was too spooky and asked me to take it off. When the Obama presidency ended, I threw the Biden mask away, assuming I'd never need it again. Wishful thinking is always a mistake.
With Halloween in the air, it's the right moment to discuss the central role played in presidential politics by bogeymen -- creatures conjured to distract and scare the citizenry. In politics, the bogeyman is always just around the corner. For John F. Kennedy it was "the missile gap"; for Barack Obama, "the wealthiest"; and for Donald Trump, criminals pouring across "the border."
Naturally, the Democrats running for their party's presidential nomination needed a bogeyman, and they have created one even scarier than the Trump monster. It's them -- "corporations!" At their recent presidential debate, one candidate after another claimed corporations were wrecking the country.
Elizabeth Warren, who knows a thing or two about scaring people: "They have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line." And by the way, "I have a plan." Yikes.
Cory Booker ranted about "corporate tax incentives," and Amy Klobuchar wants a rollback of "what we did with the corporate tax rate." Beto O'Rourke somehow related a woman he said was working four jobs with "some of these corporations," andTom Steyer, billionaire, said we have to "break the power of these corporations."
Finally Joe Biden, seeing where this was going, invoked the "corporate greed" of companies that are "not investing in our employees."
Politics, as has been proved lately, can get crude, and one understands why candidates play the race card, the class-warfare card or the anti-immigrant card. But how has the Democratic Party arrived en masse at playing the anti-corporation card?
If one sits through any of these three-hour-long Democratic debates or their climate and LGBTQ town halls, it's hard not to notice that there is an 800-pound elephant in the room that none of them (including the moderators) want to talk about -- the American economy in the here and now.
Unless the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is another front for Donald Trump, the reality of historically high job creation and rising wages for people regardless of income level, race, sex or sexual orientation has become impossible not to notice.
Even the New York Times recently admitted the jobs boom was forcing "corporations" to dig deeper for workers: "With the national unemployment rate now flirting with a 50-year low," it noted that companies are offering work-from-home options to parents, accommodating employees with disabilities, reducing educational requirements and waiving criminal background checks.
This 50-year unemployment low -- and the self-respect and sense of personal possibility that comes with it -- didn't just happen. It is the explicit result of Congress and President Trump redeploying two proven pillars of Reaganomics. They dropped the tax rate on -- yes -- "corporations" to 21% from its investment-killing decades at 35%, and he unwound a waaay-overboard Obama regulatory regime that was imposed on virtually every private-sector producer in the U.S. economy.
You'd have to be obtuse not to recognize the historic burst of individual economic opportunity happening now. The wonder wasn't so much the economic revival this produced but the astonishing scope of the Trump boom.
The Democratic presidential candidates aren't talking about the real economy because most of them don't understand it. The Democratic Party's historic link to the real economy was private-sector labor unions affiliated with industries such as steel, mining and cars. With the decline of those unions, the Democrats have become an almost wholly public-sector party, for which the private economy, which employs millions of workers, has become a distant planet whose only function is to send the oxygen of tax revenue. Which is why Democrats propose unpriceable ideas like Medicare for All or the Green New Deal. Which is why so many blue-collar workers in 2016 managed to identify their lot with an unapologetic billionaire businessman.
This is the real reason a moderate and totally embedded private-sector Democratic figure such as Mike Bloomberg isn't likely to run. The party, captured by cotton-candy socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has deserted him. The real-world disconnect even got to primo Never-Trumper Alec Baldwin, who recently lamented the attacks on "a country built on both freedoms and commerce." Commerce? What's that?
The economy slowed to a 1.9% growth rate in the third quarter as business investment fell beneath the enduring weight of the Trump tariffs, which could yet take some sheen off his accomplishment. But come the general-election debates next year, Mr. Trump will relentlessly pound his opponent with the fact of real work created for real people. Whether it's Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren, they're going to need a better bogeyman to compete than corporate greed.

Texto completo: Jho Low, the businessman-turned-fugitive accused of masterminding a multibillion-dollar fraud involving Malaysia's sovereign-wealth fund, agreed to forfeit more than $700 million in assets U.S. authorities sought to seize, according to a settlement filed Wednesday.
Mr. Low will give up assets that include real estate, a luxury yacht and a private jet, according to the settlement, which doesn't resolve the criminal cases against the Malaysian businessman or include any admission of wrongdoing by him.
Mr. Low remains a fugitive from the U.S. criminal justice system and is believed to be in China or under Chinese protection elsewhere in the world.
In a statement, Mr. Low admitted no wrongdoing and called the agreement "a successful and satisfactory result."
Mr. Low still faces criminal cases in New York and Washington that accuse him of conspiring to launder billions of dollars in proceeds from the fraud and bribing Malaysian government officials.
The settlement resolves a set of civil-forfeiture suits the U.S. has filed to recover property valued at more than $1 billion, including van Gogh and Monet paintings and luxury real estate in New York and Los Angeles. Prosecutors alleged that the assets were obtained using funds Mr. Low embezzled from 1Malaysia Development Bhd., or 1MDB.
The scandal is believed to be one of the largest financial frauds in history, and has resulted in the downfall of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.

Texto completo: John Carpenter's formative slasher movie airs on AMC, alongside lots of other creepy Halloween offerings.
What's on TV
HALLOWEEN (1978) 7 p.m. on AMC. "This is an evil that makes no facial expression, doesn't have a voice, moves slowly but kills with a vengeance," Jamie Lee Curtis said in an interview with The New York Times last year, answering a question about why the creepy killer Michael Myers has remained a compelling figure for four decades. This is the original John Carpenter slasher movie that spawned a franchise. "Halloween" introduced both Curtis (it was her film debut) and her character, Laurie Strode, a teenage babysitter who is stalked by the masked psychopath Myers (Nick Castle). "This is a universal terror that you combine with a woman representing everyone," Curtis added, "and you have a recipe for people going to the movie over and over again."
BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA (1992) 5:30 p.m. on BBC America. Francis Ford Coppola delivered a relatively faithful take on Bram Stoker's classic horror novel in this Gothic drama. Gary Oldman plays Dracula, under heavy makeup; the all-star cast also includes Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves and Anthony Hopkins. This, Vincent Canby wrote in his review for The Times, is a "wild dream of a movie, which looks as if it required a special pact with the Treasury Department to finance."
HOCUS POCUS (1993) 8:50 p.m. on Freeform. Last week, Disney confirmed that a long-rumored new "Hocus Pocus" movie is in development. It was a convenient time to generate renewed conversation about this cult classic and Halloween favorite, which stars Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy as sister witches, and is a good child-friendly option for Thursday night.
GRETA (2019) 11:20 p.m. on HBO. More contemporary scares can be found in this psychological thriller, which stars Chloë Grace Moretz and Isabelle Huppert. Moretz plays Frances McCullen, a newly settled New Yorker who is stalked by an older Brooklynite (Huppert). In his review for The Times, A.O. Scott compared it to "Fatal Attraction," "Single White Female" and "other madwoman-in-the-city movies of the '80s and '90s." "'Greta' updates the genre (people have smartphones now) without improving on it much," he wrote, "though the maniac-mommy twist is an interesting wrinkle, adding a sinister fairy-tale element to the modern setting."
What's Streaming
US (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Alfred Hitchcock had Bernard Herrmann's screaming strings; Jordan Peele has "I Got 5 on It." In this well-regarded follow-up to "Get Out," Peele turned that 1995 hit by the Bay Area rap duo Luniz into the creepy sonic backdrop of a story set in Northern California, where a family is stalked by its psychotic doppelgängers.
SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET (1982) Stream on BroadwayHD. For Halloween-appropriate programming with even more singalong potential, consider this filmed version of the original United States touring production of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's bloody meat-pie musical, with Angela Lansbury as the charmingly evil Mrs. Lovett and George Hearn in the title role. For those looking to limit their candy intake on Thursday night, this can also double as a useful appetite killer.

Texto completo: The chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, faced a second day of questions from Congress over the 737 Max crashes.
One Boeing employee worried the 737 Max might be "vulnerable." A company document said if pilots didn't respond to a new automated system within seconds it would be "catastrophic." A plan to include an alert for the system, known as MCAS, was considered but scrapped.
The new revelations about how Boeing wrestled with the safety questions surrounding the new system on its best-selling plane came at a congressional hearing on Wednesday in Washington, adding to evidence that the company was aware of concerns about the plane's safety before two crashes that left 346 people dead.
Taken together with emails released this month showing that a top Boeing pilot was having trouble with the new system in the simulator before the plane was complete, the documents paint a fuller picture of Boeing employees' developing and at times raising concerns about MCAS.
The company, facing intense competitive pressure from its rival Airbus, ultimately determined the system was safe to install in the Max. And it continued to defend the safety of the plane after the accidents.
The latest documents were made public at a hearing of the House transportation committee that lasted more than five hours. Committee members took turns grilling Boeing's chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, interspersing calls for his resignation with slides depicting damning internal company documents questioning the safety of the automated system.
In one partly redacted email from 2015, years before the plane was certified, a Boeing employee questioned whether the system was vulnerable to malfunctioning if a single sensor failed. Investigators believe that is what happened in both doomed flights, a Lion Air flight that crashed off the coast of Indonesia in October 2018 and another 737 Max that went down in Ethiopia in March.
The new documents again raise the question of why Boeing installed MCAS in the Max after making it more powerful and less reliable. Boeing played down the risks of the system to the Federal Aviation Administration during the development of the plane and asked the F.A.A. for permission to remove mention of it from the pilot's manual. Pilots were not notified about MCAS until after the first crash.
Two days after the accident in Ethiopia on March 10, Mr. Muilenburg called President Trump and insisted the Max was safe. The United States grounded the plane the next day, however, after most other regulators around the world had already done so.
Boeing's actions were "inexplicable, inexcusable and as far as I know unprecedented in the history of passenger aviation," said Representative Peter DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the committee.
The 737 Max remains grounded, and the crisis has cost Boeing more than $ 8 billion and roiled the broader aviation industry.
The hearing was the second day in a row that Mr. Muilenburg had faced irate lawmakers, following an appearance at the Senate commerce committee on Tuesday where he acknowledged that he was aware of the emails from the pilot before the second crash.
"If we knew then what we know now we would have grounded right after the first accident," Mr. Muilenburg said during Wednesday's hearing.
Mr. DeFazio displayed an image of an early design for a cockpit indicator that would have notified pilots of an MCAS malfunction, a feature that never appeared on the plane. Another document showed that in June 2018, months before the Lion Air crash, an internal Boeing document said that if pilots took 10 seconds to respond once MCAS was activated, the result could be "catastrophic."
The House hearing was longer, more sprawling in scope and, at times, more charged than the Senate's. Multiple representatives criticized Mr. Muilenburg's salary -- he received a $ 23.4 million pay package last year -- and demanded that he resign. Some of his answers brought groans or exclamations from victims' family members in attendance.
"What does accountability mean?" Representative Stephen Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, asked Mr. Muilenburg at one point in a raised voice. "Are you taking a cut in pay? Are you working for free from now on until you can cure this problem? These people's relatives are not coming back. They're gone. Your salary is still on."
Mr. Muilenburg's face reddened, as he noted that the board determines his pay.
The barrage of questions seemed to strike a chord with the cluster of more than a dozen victims' family members gathered in a corner of the hearing room. Chris and Clariss Moore, the parents of Danielle Moore, who died in the Ethiopia crash, began to cry and a man brought over tissues.
"Mr. Muilenburg, if you had an ounce of integrity, you would know that the right thing to do is to step down," Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, Democrat of Florida, said later.
Mr. Muilenburg repeatedly said he was "accountable" for the failures that led to the two crashes, but declined to resign and said he had not offered the board his resignation. (This month, the board stripped him of his chairman title.) He frequently mentioned that he grew up on a farm in Iowa, and said that his father taught him "you don't run away from challenges."
Lawmakers were unmoved by his biography. "You're no longer an Iowa farm boy," Mr. DeFazio said. "You are the C.E.O. of the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world."
Near the end of the hearing, Mr. Muilenburg said he did not expect to receive a bonus this year, after receiving a $ 13 million bonus last year. "I'm anticipating that this year's annual bonus cycle will be zero," he said.
Other documents made public by lawmakers on Wednesday raised questions about why the F.A.A. did not ground the Max after the first crash. In December, after the first accident, Boeing made a presentation to the F.A.A. in which it noted that the failure of one sensor on the outside of the plane could be "catastrophic." In both crashes, investigators believe a single sensor malfunctioned, triggering MCAS and sending the planes into nose dives.
At another point, Representative Albio Sires, Democrat of New Jersey, read from an email he said was sent to the head of the 737 program in 2018, from a Boeing employee complaining of fatigue and safety concerns on the production line. Shortly after the second crash, The New York Times reported on the intense pressure to produce the Max.
"Our work force is exhausted," the employee wrote. "Fatigued employees make mistakes.
"Frankly right now all my internal warning bells are going off," the email continued. "And for the first time in my life, I'm sorry to say that I'm hesitant about putting my family on a Boeing airplane."
Several representatives also presented evidence they said showed that Boeing was consumed with minimizing pilot training for the Max, leading them to play down the importance of the new system and not include it in pilot manuals. Mr. DeFazio confirmed that Boeing had offered Southwest Airlines a $ 1 million discount per plane if the Max required simulator training, and displayed a slide from an internal presentation playing up the fact that the Max would not require simulator training.
Representatives also questioned Mr. Muilenburg on messages that Mark Forkner, the plane's chief technical pilot, sent to a colleague, Patrik Gustavsson, during the plane's development. In the messages, which were made public this month, Mr. Forkner said that he was having trouble with MCAS during simulator training, and had unintentionally lied to regulators.
Mr. Gustavsson was removed from certification work at Boeing in recent days, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.
Mr. Muilenburg also faced sharp criticism from lawmakers about other Boeing airplanes facing challenges, including the 787 Dreamliner, which is plagued with production problems, and the KC-46, a long-delayed military refueling tanker.
Representative John Garamendi, Democrat of California, accused Mr. Muilenburg of running a company that was relentlessly focused on the bottom line.
"Three of your principal product lines, the 737 Max, the KC-46 and the Dreamliner all have quality issues," he said. "I would posit the reality that you are pushing profits over quality and safety."
After the hearing, Nadia Milleron, whose daughter Samya Stumo was killed in the Ethiopian crash, confronted Mr. Muilenburg for the second day in a row and told him to resign.
"You talked about Iowa just like one too many times," she told Mr. Muilenburg, who listened to Ms. Milleron, his hands clasped. "Go back to the farm. Go back to Iowa."

Germans Act To Toughen Laws to Curb Extremism

Texto completo: The country will increase background checks for gun buyers and requirements for reporting online hate speech.
BERLIN -- Prospective gun buyers in Germany would have to undergo background checks to ensure they have no ties to extremism and social media companies operating in the country would be required to report suspicious posts under a series of proposals advanced Wednesday by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government.
The legislation comes amid a recent spike in far-right crime. In June, a conservative politician, whose name had appeared on a neo-Nazi hit list circulated online, was fatally shot in the head in what officials believe was the country's first far-right political assassination since the Nazi era. And just three weeks ago, a right-wing gunman killed two people after attacking a synagogue in Halle on Yom Kippur.
"The threat from far-right extremism and far-right terrorism, and with them anti-Semitism, is high in Germany and we can't stress it often enough," Horst Seehofer, Germany's interior minister, said at a news conference.
The bulk of far-right attacks in recent years have consisted of anti-Semitic crimes and hate crimes targeting foreigners and those who support them. The far right has scapegoated immigrants as dangerous and broken longstanding taboos about using language that echoes that of the Nazis. This has come despite more than a decade of German economic prosperity and the country's persistent ranking as one of the safest in the world.
Alternative for Germany, a far-right party, has stoked public anxiety over the 2015 arrival of more than a million, mostly Muslim, refugees and closed ranks with neo-Nazis during street protests. After the synagogue attack, mainstream parties criticized the far right for contributing to the increase in violence by using aggressive language.
The proposals must still be approved by Parliament, where Ms. Merkel's government holds a majority. It is expected to pass.
The legislation would further toughen the country's strict 2018 law against online hate speech. The law passed last year requires companies running social media platforms, including Facebook, Google and Twitter, to remove "obviously illegal" content within 24 hours, or face fines of up to 50 million euros, or about $ 56 million.
Under the proposed legislation, just removing the posts would no longer be enough -- companies would also be required to report any such content to the authorities. Germany's federal police plan to establish a new department that would collect the reported content and the I.P. addresses -- the numbered codes that differentiate individual internet connections -- of those posts.
Spreading insults and hate-speech online would also carry stiffer sentences, reflecting the "unlimited reach" of such comments.
"It cannot be that there is fertile ground in this country for hate and incitement," said Christine Lambrecht, the country's justice minister.
Germany already has strict gun laws that forbid the production of weapons and require extensive training and a permit to purchase a firearm. Nevertheless, authorities found last year that more than 790 people considered far-right extremists held a weapons permit. Under the proposed legislation, those permits could be revoked.
The proposed legislation would also make attacks on local politicians and first-responders or emergency medical personnel a separate crime. Along with police officers and fire fighters, both groups have increasingly become the target of violence -- from both the left and the right -- while trying to carry out their jobs.
Germany's domestic intelligence agency considers an estimated 24,100 people in the country to be right-wing extremists. About half of them have the potential to become violent, authorities believe.
Critics charge the proposals do not go far enough to prevent people from turning extremist in the first place, despite its pledge of 115 million euros annually through 2023 for projects promoting democracy. But the legislation, they said, would not have prevented the attack on the synagogue.
The man accused in the attack, Stephan Balliet, did not have a previous record and was not on authorities' radar before he tried to carry out a massacre of Jews on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on their calendar. Authorities believe that he was radicalized online and built or printed on a 3D printer several of the weapons that he used in the attack -- one of the reasons that authorities believe more people were not harmed.
"I don't want to imagine how things would have turned out with professionally made weapons," Mr. Seehofer said of the attacker. "Nor do I want to think about how things would have turned out if we had American gun laws."

Texto completo: Our fancy new internet-based home or office phones are the communication tool of the future cheap, efficient and versatile.
They're also, in a power outage, about as useful as a brick.
All over the Bay Area, residents who rely on these digital landline phones are feeling angry and betrayed during PG&E's shutdown, unable to get even a simple dial tone.
Those with old analog phones on quaint copper lines are, in general, doing just fine.
But the growing number of consumers with new digital Voice over IP (VOIP) systems, which use the internet to make calls, are finding them maddeningly unreliable.
No power means no internet. And no phone. Ironically, the only way to fix your high-tech phone is to buy a low-tech backup power source, like a battery or generator.
With no working landline, internet or cell service, Charlotte Gibb of Lafayette drove to a high hill Sunday night to get a cell signal and watch a frightening blaze that had erupted on nearby Acalanes Ridge.
"What was terrifying is that no one in our neighborhood would be alerted to evacuate," she said. "All I could do was look for the tell-tale sign of fire a red glow."
In the high-tech Bay Area, the old system dubbed POTS, for "Plain Old Telephone Service" doesn't get much respect.
For consumers, it's expensive.
The phone is a relic, stuck into a jack in the wall and cluttering a room. Sure, it gets great reception. But it rarely rings, and even when it does, it's usually the dentist, a robocaller or someone wanting to sell you life insurance.
VOIP, in contrast, is cheap. Plans are flexible, so you can customize and change them over time. It's easy to add new features. The phone service offers video calls and other features.
The VOIP-based phones are supported by fiber networks that use light instead of electricity. This allows for much faster data transmission, broader bandwidth, quicker access to cloud-based services and better support of streaming video.
The traditional landline system is especially unpopular with the telecom industry, because its aging infrastructure is bothersome to keep up. The industry dreams of the day when it is abandoned, and the companies can invest instead in technologies like 5G and fiber optic cables.
The telecom industry also prefers VOIP for financial reasons. It isn't regulated like traditional phones, so there's no obligation to guarantee universal access and fair prices to consumers, according to the nonprofits Electronic Frontier Foundation and The Utility Reform Network.
AT&T, Verizon and other companies are pushing consumers hard to get them to shift away from landline service. In 2012, after Hurricane Sandy destroyed much of the copper infrastructure in western Fire Island, New York, Verizon didn't want to fix the phone lines. Instead, it proposed replacing them with Voice Link, a substitute that connects to the cellular network, according to The New York Times. In Pennsylvania, Verizon was fined for refusing to repair an elderly couple's copper phone lines.
To persuade consumers to switch, the telecom industry often offers "Triple Play" packages of services, like television with internet and phone, and other incentives.
"They should have to make a point of informing you of this when they talk you into changing," said Candy Promes, who switched to a VOIP phone, then was frustrated when she lost service.
But in emergencies, the traditional system is a robust and fairly bulletproof way to deliver phone calls. No bells, no whistles. They just work.
That's because the lines carry their own power. This power low voltage, posing no risk comes from the company's central office. And that's backed up by a generator.
"When power goes out, those generators are powered by diesel. And there is enough fuel to last several days," said Regina Costa, telecom policy director of TURN. "And they're in locations where it's easy to refill."
Old-fashioned landlines go down only when they're served by a longer line in a rural area that depends on the phone company's remote "terminal." That terminal is supposed to have backup power, but many don't.
That's what is happening in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where customers of Frontier Communications are without service.
"When commercial power is shut off, the remote terminals remain in service until batteries are depleted," said Javier Mendoza of Frontier. "When utility power is restored, disrupted Frontier services should also restore soon after."
In contrast, VOIP phone services that are delivered using internet technology over fiber optic lines require commercial power to operate. You need to plug in your modem, router or other hardware for it to work.
There's nothing wrong with the VOIP system, said Ernesto Falcon, senior legislative counsel with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
"The transition is happening," he said. "That's just where the technology is going."
The problem, said Falcon and Costa, is that phone companies aren't required to provide batteries or other backup. This is confusing to consumers; different phones have different batteries, costing from $20 to $35, plus shipping. Batteries age, and fail. Where should these batteries live? In the garage? Near the phone jack? No one knows.
"It is a very dicey situation," Costa said.
On Jan. 1, an old law will expire and the California Public Utilities Commission has the opportunity to mandate power backup,Falcon said.
"It is a matter of public safety," he said. "The old copper phone line has had a long history of these protections. We need the same for the new technologies."

Texto completo: It was this weekend in 2012 that I went to a Halloween party wearing a quite realistic-looking Joe Biden mask. After about an hour, people said it was too spooky and asked me to take it off. When the Obama presidency ended, I threw the Biden mask away, assuming I'd never need it again. Wishful thinking is always a mistake.
With Halloween in the air, it's the right moment to discuss the central role played in presidential politics by bogeymen—creatures conjured to distract and scare the citizenry. In politics, the bogeyman is always just around the corner. For John F. Kennedy it was "the missile gap"; for Barack Obama, "the wealthiest"; and for Donald Trump, criminals pouring across "the border."
Naturally, the Democrats running for their party's presidential nomination needed a bogeyman, and they have created one even scarier than the Trump monster. It's them—"corporations!" At their recent presidential debate, one candidate after another claimed corporations were wrecking the country.
Elizabeth Warren, who knows a thing or two about scaring people: "They have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line." And by the way, "I have a plan." Yikes.
Cory Booker ranted about "corporate tax incentives," and Amy Klobuchar wants a rollback of "what we did with the corporate tax rate." Beto O'Rourke somehow related a woman he said was working four jobs with "some of these corporations," and Tom Steyer, billionaire, said we have to "break the power of these corporations."
Finally Joe Biden, seeing where this was going, invoked the "corporate greed" of companies that are "not investing in our employees."
Politics, as has been proved lately, can get crude, and one understands why candidates play the race card, the class-warfare card or the anti-immigrant card. But how has the Democratic Party arrived en masse at playing the anti-corporation card?
If one sits through any of these three-hour-long Democratic debates or their climate and LGBTQ town halls, it's hard not to notice that there is an 800-pound elephant in the room that none of them (including the moderators) want to talk about—the American economy in the here and now.
Unless the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is another front for Donald Trump, the reality of historically high job creation and rising wages for people regardless of income level, race, sex or sexual orientation has become impossible not to notice.
Even the New York Times recently admitted the jobs boom was forcing "corporations" to dig deeper for workers: "With the national unemployment rate now flirting with a 50-year low," it noted that companies are offering work-from-home options to parents, accommodating employees with disabilities, reducing educational requirements and waiving criminal background checks.
This 50-year unemployment low—and the self-respect and sense of personal possibility that comes with it—didn't just happen. It is the explicit result of Congress and President Trump redeploying two proven pillars of Reaganomics. They dropped the tax rate on—yes—"corporations" to 21% from its investment-killing decades at 35%, and he unwound a waaay-overboard Obama regulatory regime that was imposed on virtually every private-sector producer in the U.S. economy.
You'd have to be obtuse not to recognize the historic burst of individual economic opportunity happening now. The wonder wasn't so much the economic revival this produced but the astonishing scope of the Trump boom.
The Democratic presidential candidates aren't talking about the real economy because most of them don't understand it. The Democratic Party's historic link to the real economy was private-sector labor unions affiliated with industries such as steel, mining and cars. With the decline of those unions, the Democrats have become an almost wholly public-sector party, for which the private economy, which employs millions of workers, has become a distant planet whose only function is to send the oxygen of tax revenue. Which is why Democrats propose unpriceable ideas like Medicare for All or the Green New Deal. Which is why so many blue-collar workers in 2016 managed to identify their lot with an unapologetic billionaire businessman.
This is the real reason a moderate and totally embedded private-sector Democratic figure such as Mike Bloomberg isn't likely to run. The party, captured by cotton-candy socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has deserted him. The real-world disconnect even got to primo Never-Trumper Alec Baldwin, who recently lamented the attacks on "a country built on both freedoms and commerce." Commerce? What's that?
The economy slowed to a 1.9% growth rate in the third quarter as business investment fell beneath the enduring weight of the Trump tariffs, which could yet take some sheen off his accomplishment. But come the general-election debates next year, Mr. Trump will relentlessly pound his opponent with the fact of real work created for real people. Whether it's Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren, they're going to need a better bogeyman to compete than corporate greed.

Texto completo: Two interesting things have been happening in the world of film over the last month. A relatively low-budget, no-special effects movie that places Batman's Joker in a version of Martin Scorsese's decaying 1970s-era New York City has become one of the most successful American movies of the year . And everyone on the internet is yelling at, about, or in defense of Scorsese himself, because the aging director told an interviewer that superhero movies aren't real cinema.
We often talk about unexpected political controversies in terms of their relationship to an established order, an existing regime.The success of "Joker" and the outrage around Scorsese are both disturbances that matter because of their relationship to thecurrent pop-cultural regime.
That order is built on the commercial exploitation of what was once called "genre" entertainment - the comic-book movie especially, the Marvel empire above all, with a wider range of science fiction and fantasy blockbusters .
Strikingly, this regime is a marvel of corporate capitalism, a machine for global moneymakingthat is also intensely defended by people who think of themselves as rebels, outsiders, weirdos, freaks. The Western in its Ford-Wayne heyday knew itself to be mainstream and middlebrow, but even in its gazillion-dollar apotheosis the world of "genre" still maintains a fan base that imagines itself eccentric and disrespected and oppressed.
This nurtured sense of grievance explains the online anger every time somebody like Scorsese dares to doubt the aesthetic merits of the new regime. And it may be a strength of the superhero order, a source of resilience, that so many of its fans continue to answer Andrew O'Hehir's 2012 question, "at what point is the triumph of comic-book culture sufficient?", with a zealot's absolutism: Not until the last film snob shuts up; not until Scorsese breaks down and makes a Batman sequel.
But maybe that zeal hides an uneasy conscience, a buried knowledge that while "genre" cinema can be as great as any other formits complete commercial takeover has been obviously bad for popular culture and pop art.
The superhero regime has wasted far too much talent on stories that are fundamentally unworthy of the actors and directors making them. It has empowered and interacted with corporate consolidation. And it has habituated adult audiences to stories that belong - with, yes, exceptions - to the state of arrested development in which far more of Western culture than just Hollywood is trapped.
I say "arrested development" because a common critique of these movies is that they are childish . But that seems not quite apt: Children and their stories are much stranger and more interesting than the superhero industry, which sells a mix of grandiosity, moral certainty and performance anxietythat belongs essentially to early adolescence.
And this is where the success of the Joaquin Phoenix "Joker" becomes especially interesting. My initial take on the movie was hostile, because I don't think "Joker" is really about any of the thingsthat its admirers and enemies have read into its story. Instead it's a competent Scorsese simulacrum whose success exposes both the frustrated desire for movies that are more politically and morally adult  and the tragedy of a movie system that can only simulate grown-up art inside the comic-book machine.
But a more sympathetic reading might say that the character of Arthur Fleck, the Joker-to-be in the movie, is a kind of Dorian Gray's picture for the entire comic-book universe: A damaged man-child with pre-sexual romantic attachments and fantasies of secret lineages and untapped greatness, whose destructive arc is far closer to what perpetual adolescence really looks like than the sexless godhood of the Marvel heroes or the eternal school days of Hogwarts.
In which case its audiences aren't just getting an imitation of the better movies that the age of genre has displaced. They're experiencing a work that is genuinely subversive - maybe not of progressivism or neoliberalism, but at least of the all-conquering, imagination-shrinking cultural juggernaut to which "Joker" ostensibly belongs.
Ross Douthat writes for the New York Times. His syndicated column appears on Wednesdays.

Farrow's tale of reporting, perseverance NBC portrayed as hostile workplace review

Texto completo: At first, I wasn't sure I wanted to read Ronan Farrow's book.
I didn't want to spend hours with a revolving cast of powerful men accused of doing unspeakable things to women, with impunity or the next best thing. I know the world can be like this, but I didn't want to know the world can be like this.
Now I know, in painful detail, thanks to Farrow and "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators." And you should too.
Farrow is the New Yorker magazine contributor who shared the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for public service with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of The New York Times. Their reporting is why disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is headed to trial on rape charges in New York City and could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted.
Their work fueled the #MeToo movement and gave voice to scores of women who allege Weinstein harassed, groped, raped or otherwise forced himself on them and then brutalized them into silence. Their meticulous reporting allowed these women not just to be heard but to be listened to for the first time. And it brought to account men accused of sexual miscount and the industry that protected them.
But this is where the stories diverge.
Kantor and Twohey's new book, "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story that Helped Ignite a Movement," details what it's like to be investigative journalists for a newspaper that gave them the time, resources and support to make a difference. Told in the third person, it has the cool, authoritative voice of The New York Times. It focuses on the women who broke their silence and the work that helped them do it; it's a primer on how to do deep-dive journalism.
"Catch and Kill," which was released Tuesday, is a far different work. It's equal parts memoir, spy story and portrait of perseverance - the women's and the author's - under terrible circumstances.
Farrow began exploring rumors of Weinstein's sexual misconduct as a reporter for NBC News. In "Catch and Kill," he describes what it's like to work for a media outlet that tried to quash the story. The New Yorker later published Farrow's series of articles on which this book is based.
The NBC that Farrow portrays in "Catch and Kill" is the definition of a hostile workplace. Farrow's more sensational allegations about the company have already made their way into the headlines.
He described MSNBC President Phil Griffin waving around an enlarged image of a television personality's genitalia during a work meeting. And Farrow leveled the bombshell allegation that former "Today" show co-anchor Matt Lauer anally raped a young colleague while they were covering the Sochi Olympics in 2014.
That colleague is Brooke Nevils, and her complaint led to Lauer's firing in 2017, but NBC News did not disclose the accusation at the time. Lauer denies the allegation; he says he and Nevils had a consensual affair. Nevils' allegations are lengthy, graphic and on the record in "Catch and Kill." Her account underscores the pain, damage and, in Farrow's telling, the complexity of sexual assault. After Sochi, Nevils and Lauer had several sexual encounters, at his home and in his office.
"Nevils told friends at the time that she felt trapped," Farrow wrote. "Lauer's position of authority - over both her and her boyfriend, whose brother worked for Lauer - made her feel unable to say no."
Lauer is the specter that hangs over much of Farrow's deeply reported book, with its largely on-the-record accusations.
A foundation of "Catch and Kill" is Farrow's contention that Weinstein had collected dirt on Lauer and that NBC killed Farrow's story on the producer's misdeeds to protect the star at the center of one of the network's most important franchises. NBC counters that Farrow's work was neither substantiated nor ready to run.
As the Los Angeles Times has reported, NBC has launched a counterassault against the book at the same time it is trying to quell the uproar Farrow's allegations have caused among its employees.
At the heart of "Catch and Kill" is Farrow's quest to get the story - and then get it published. All the while, Farrow alleges, NBC worked to shut down his efforts.
Throughout "Catch and Kill," the author maintains that Weinstein tried to bully them into silence, and to threaten, harass and buy off the women Weinstein had harmed. Farrow writes that Weinstein went so far as to have him followed by spies with ties to Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency.
Actress Daryl Hannah, whose sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein are detailed in the book, said she previously had told anyone who would listen, but it didn't matter.
"I think it doesn't matter if you're a well-known actress," she told Farrow. "It doesn't matter if you're twenty or if you're forty. It doesn't matter if you report or if you don't because we are not believed.
"We are more than not believed - we are berated and criticized and blamed."
Someday, maybe, that will no longer be the case.

U.S. News: Parties Spar Over Impeachment Witness

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Testimony of a White House national security official turned combative Tuesday as Democrats accused Republicans of trying to unmask the whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, while the GOP lawmakers argued theirs was a legitimate line of questioning.
The appearance by Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a White House Ukraine expert who testified that he expressed alarm at a U.S. pressure campaign on Ukraine's president over the summer, spurred Mr. Trump and his allies to attack his background and credentials, which drew some pushback from Republicans.
Meanwhile, House Democrats released a resolution Tuesday laying out how public hearings in their impeachment investigation will be conducted, ahead of an expected vote later this week.
Democrats after Col. Vindman's hearing called the GOP attempt to ferret out details on the whistleblower potentially dangerous. While the identity of the person remains publicly unknown, the legal team representing him has received multiple death threats that have led to at least one law-enforcement investigation, according to people close to the legal team, as well as other abusive communications.
None of the threats thus far have appeared to be credible, the people said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly lashed out at that whistleblower, known to be a Central Intelligence Agency officer, while pushing for the person's identity to be revealed. "Where's the Whistleblower?" Mr. Trump asked on Twitter Tuesday. Since the whistleblower's account was released more than a month ago, several Trump diplomats and other witnesses have testified, backing up many of the allegations about the pressure campaign on Ukraine while aid to the country was being held up.
Col. Vindman's hearing occurred behind closed doors, and he said in his prepared testimony that he isn't the whistleblower and doesn't know who it is, but Democrats said Republican questioning was aimed at the person's identity.
"Most of their hour seemed to have been spent trying to backdoor him into narrowing down, for them, who the whistleblower is," Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D., Fla.) said.
In a July call, Mr. Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open investigations into matters related to the 2016 election and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Those requests, and the temporary hold on aid to Ukraine, are at the center of House Democrats' impeachment probe. Mr. Trump has defended the call as appropriate.
Col. Vindman, who listened in on the call, testified that he was concerned because he didn't think it was appropriate to ask another country to investigate a U.S. citizen.
Republicans complained that Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) had blocked their questioning over whom Col. Vindman had spoken to about his concerns.
The rough transcript of the call released by the White House contained missing words and phrases, Col. Vindman told investigators. He testified that he tried to restore those words but wasn't successful, according to people familiar with the testimony. The people added it wasn't clear how significant or intentional the omissions were. The New York Times earlier reported the testimony regarding the omissions.
The substance of Col. Vindman's testimony was at times overshadowed as Mr. Trump and his defenders repeated a pattern of attacking those who come forward in the inquiry.
In separate interviews on CNN and Fox News, respectively, Sean Duffy, a former Republican congressman, and John Yoo, a former George W. Bush administration official, appeared to suggest that Col. Vindman had divided loyalties because he was born in Ukraine. The Iraq war veteran, who was awarded a Purple Heart, migrated to the U.S. with his family when he was young.
Both Messrs. Duffy and Yoo subsequently sought to walk back their comments.
The House Democratic resolution on the inquiry sets equal time for questioning for both the majority and minority party, of up to 45 minutes per side, and allows Republicans to request witnesses, subject to Democratic approval. It also gives the president or his counsel an opportunity to participate in Judiciary Committee hearings, including the ability to cross-examine witnesses.
A vote on the resolution is expected on Thursday.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The White House is weighing legal options that could allow President Trump to appoint Ken Cuccinelli as the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, according to people familiar with the matter.
The White House personnel chief told Mr. Trump in a meeting last week that his top choices for the job -- Mr. Cuccinelli, acting head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection -- are both ineligible under a federal statute governing vacancies, according to an opinion by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.
Now, the White House is considering a plan allowing the administration to change the line of succession at the department to bypass the vacancies statute and appoint Mr. Cuccinelli or another pick. White House officials have asked the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel if such a plan is legal, one of the people familiar with the plan said.
Mr. Trump has told allies that he wants Mr. Cuccinelli to lead the department.
Acting Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan submitted his resignation earlier this month and has told associates his last day will be Thursday.
Officials cautioned that Mr. Trump hasn't made a final decision about whom he will choose to lead the department, or whether to pursue the plan. The New York Times earlier reported that the White House was considering the plan. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.

Texto completo: A popular sports website was told to stick to sports -- and staff members revolted.
Deadspin, a sister site to Gizmodo and Jezebel, is the latest blog run by G/O Media involved in an escalating conflict with its new owner, Great Hill Partners, a private equity firm based in Boston.
When a memo circulated to Deadspin staff on Monday about the site's editorial direction was met with derision, management shot back. The site's interim editor in chief, Barry Petchesky, who had worked there for 10 years, tweeted Tuesday that he had been fired for "not sticking to sports."
It comes less than two months after the site's previous editor in chief resigned.
"Sports touches on nearly every aspect of life -- from politics to business to pop culture and more," Paul Maidment, G/O Media's editorial director, said in an emailed statement Tuesday, referring to the memo he had written.
"We believe that Deadspin reporters and editors should go after every conceivable story, as long as it has something to do with sports," he added. "We are sorry that some on the Deadspin staff don't agree with that editorial direction and refuse to work within that incredibly broad mandate."
Mr. Petchesky did not reply to a request for comment.
Deadspin -- at one time the sports equivalent of Gawker -- is known for its irreverence, with a motto promising: "Sports News Without Access, Fear, or Discretion." It was acquired in April from Univision when it was part of Gizmodo Media Group. The bundle of sites was then renamed G/O Media.
Though sports has been Deadspin's focus since its beginning, the site has also delved into political coverage and was praised for its 2014 analysis of "Gamergate," one of the first exhaustive looks at the issue of sexism and harassment in the world of video games. Indeed, it would have been hard for reporters to avoid any mention of politics when covering the numerous sports incidents that occurred as a response to the rise of President Trump, including the N.F.L. quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem and the booing of Mr. Trump at a World Series game on Sunday night.
"To create as much great sports journalism as we can requires a 100% focus of our resources on sports," Mr. Maidment said in the memo, which has been viewed by The New York Times.
The memo, which was first reported by The Daily Beast, prompted a puckish response from Deadspin's staff members Tuesday: They only published articles having little or nothing to do with sports, including a post about a pumpkin thief in Washington, another discussing the virtues and demerits of various wedding dress codes (keep it simple, the author urges) and a resurfaced long-form article on an obscure German actor who played a villain in "Ghostbusters II."
The sole exception was a post about the booing of Trump. In his memo, Mr. Maidment allowed that "where such subjects" like culture, business and politics "touch on sports, they are fair game for Deadspin."
"Where they do not," he added, "they are not."
By late afternoon, the Deadspin home page returned to topical sports stories: the World Series game on Tuesday night and N.F.L. head coaches. "Deadspin staffers had nothing to do with the changes on the front page," the staff's union said in a tweet.
In fact, Mr. Maidment assumed direct control of Deadspin on Tuesday, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation. G/O Media has been looking for a new full-time editor in chief since its previous editor, Megan Greenwell, left in August.
There has been a broader debate in sports journalism about how much, or little, coverage there should be of politics. ESPN has publicly wrestled with a sense of journalistic obligation to acknowledge divisive events during an unusually polarizing moment in American life, while balancing it against many fans' desire for sports to serve as a welcoming refuge from the wider world.
Less than a year ago, posts on The Concourse, the section of Deadspin reserved for non-sports coverage, averaged more than twice as many page views as average Deadspin posts, according to internal numbers seen by The Times. Concourse posts made up approximately one of every 50 Deadspin posts.
The dispute reflects an atmosphere between G/O Media and Deadspin that has become increasingly tense.
It is the second conflict between G/O Media management and staff this week. The sites published a post stating they had heard negative reader feedback about ads that autoplayed with volume on the websites and "are as upset with the current state of our site's user experience as you are." Management took down the post, according to the staff's union, which condemned the move.
Ms. Greenwell, Deadspin's last editor in chief, published an essay in August on her final day accusing Great Hill Partners and the chief executive of G/O Media, Jim Spanfeller, of "narrowing the scope of Deadspin's coverage" for business reasons.
Earlier this year, Deadspin and G/O Media owners were at war over an article on Mr. Spanfeller that was published by a Deadspin staff writer. Mr. Spanfeller accused writers and editors of acting in bad faith based on a list of questions submitted to him before publication and the fact that a draft of the article had been sent for legal review before he had a chance to respond. In a response, Ms. Greenwell, then the editor in chief, described the reporting process as "ongoing" and said she had planned to incorporate Mr. Spanfeller's answers in the published article.
Deadspin is not the only site under G/O Media's scrutiny. Earlier this month, it shuttered Splinter, a politics blog that was seen as the closest descendant of Gawker, the gossip site that was shut down after Terry G. Bollea, who was a professional wrestler under the name Hulk Hogan, won a $ 140 million settlement in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit financially backed by the conservative Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel.

Texto completo: Fewer people might have died in a 2017 fire in a London high-rise if they had not been told to stay put, a government analysis concluded.
LONDON -- Some of the 72 people who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 would have survived if firefighters and emergency operators had not told them to stay in their apartments, according to a government report to be released on Wednesday.
The 1,000-page report, which comes more than two years after the deadliest fire in recent British history, is harshly critical of the London Fire Brigade, calling it dangerously unprepared for such a tragedy, according to multiple British news organizations that gained access to the conclusions before their release.
The fire on June 14, 2017, began on the fourth floor of the 24-story building and spread rapidly upward because of flammable exterior cladding and insulation that had been added to the building the year before.
Those outer layers would not have been allowed on a high-rise in many countries, including the United States, because of the fire danger they posed.
The report is to be released to the public on Wednesday. The work of an official inquiry led by Martin Moore-Bick, a former appellate court judge, it does not go in depth into the tower's renovation and the materials used in it.
The next phase of the investigation is expected to do so, but firefighters and survivors of the blaze have criticized the investigation for not tackling those questions first. They contend that the unacceptable level of danger built into the tower outweighed any mistakes made on the night of the fire.
In recordings made that night, firefighters arriving at the scene expressed horror at how fast the flames were spreading, and bewilderment at how it was possible.
Matt Wrack, the chief of Britain's main firefighters' union, said in a Twitter post on Tuesday that "firefighters did not put flammable cladding on Grenfell Tower," but risked their lives in it. He accused the government of doing "nothing substantive" since then.
Britain had lax construction standards compared with many other countries -- a decision approved by successive governments to let builders save money. Tests conducted to determine whether materials met fire safety rules were also lax, allowing products that had undergone limited testing in laboratories -- but then failed under real-world conditions.
In 2005, Britain stopped requiring certifications from government inspectors that a building complied with fire codes, allowing builders and owners to police themselves.
Mr. Moore-Bick found that the fire brigade had no evacuation plan for Grenfell, that it had failed to instruct firefighters on the risk created by the cladding and insulation, and that it was too slow to deploy crews with breathing apparatuses. There were not enough emergency operators to handle all the calls they received.
But the report found that the biggest failing once the inferno began was that for nearly two hours, residents were instructed to stay in their apartments with their doors closed. The first emergency call went out at 12:54 a.m., and it was not until 2:47 a.m. that the decision was made to evacuate.
"That decision could and should have been made between 01:30 and 01:50 and would be likely to have resulted in fewer fatalities," the report states, according to the BBC.
The report was shown in advance to relatives of the dead and people who escaped the fire, but they declined to comment on Tuesday, because they had agreed not to discuss it until its official release.
The tower, built in 1974 in the North Kensington neighborhood, lacked fire alarms, sprinklers or fire escapes, and had just one internal staircase. Residents had complained for years that it was unsafe.
The advice to shelter in place is common in buildings with inner and outer walls made of concrete, which is expected to slow the spread of fire within the structure.
But at Grenfell the fire spread from the outside in, leaping up the sides of the building on the cladding and into apartments through the windows.
The fire brigade has acknowledged some of the mistakes made that night. Andrew Dismore, the chairman of the fire and emergency planning committee of the London Assembly, the elected panel that oversees city governance, has said that "significant progress is being made with new training, equipment and policies."
After the Grenfell tragedy, hundreds of high-rise buildings around Britain -- apartment blocks that are home to thousands of people, college dormitories and hospitals -- were found to have similar cladding and insulation.
The government said it would all be removed and replaced, but more than two years later, many people are still living in buildings sheathed in the same kind of flammable material.
Other buildings are clad in nothing more than bare concrete, because their dangerous exteriors were removed, but owners, residents and government officials continue to fight over who will pay to replace it.

Charlie Puth Is Finally Comfortable in the Spotlight; The Grammy-nominated singer gets the call when Katy Perry and Ozzy Osbourne need fresh ideas. Is his next move a country album?

Texto completo: It didn't take long for 27-year-old singer Charlie Puth to make peace with the fact that his radio-friendly debut album, 2016's Nine Track Mind, was largely a misfire. "That album... It hurts me," he says. "It was very rudimentary production, but it was me. [The album] was super rushed and didn't feel like me at all."
With the gift of perfect pitch—the ability to correctly identify the exact note of any sound he hears—and a Berklee College of Music education, Puth seemed destined for more than formulaic drivel. The New Jersey native got his start posting poppy covers to YouTube and broke out with "See You Again," a duet with Wiz Khalifa in 2015. Earning three Grammy nominations for the record, Puth now says he gave too much credence to industry executives in the aftermath of his success.
"I wouldn't blame them. I had no idea where I was going, so I took a bunch of suggestions," he says.
Share Your Thoughts
What's your favorite Charlie Puth song? Why? Join the conversation below.
In a few years' time, Puth has tried to course-correct. Last year's Voicenotes was the commercial and critical project he says he wanted to make in the first place. The album was nominated for a 2019 Grammy in the Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical category, recognition of his technical precision as co-engineer on the project. He's released three singles over the past couple of months: "I Warned Myself," "Cheating on You" and "Mother," the latter a radio single.
Now intent on reconciling his ascent as a pop star with his ambition to be taken seriously as an artist with production chops, he's got another album's worth of material ready. Artists like Katy Perry and Ozzy Osbourne are calling him to work on their music, hoping his production skills will lend their new releases some fresh ideas.
"I would consider myself a record producer," he says. He adds that fellow hitmaker Benny Blanco, who has helped create songs for Ed Sheeran, Rihanna, and Justin Bieber, taught him that he should never take longer than 30 minutes creating a beat. "I don't want my songs to ever sound sloppy, I want to make sure they hit the right way. But I don't need to spend two months on a production," Puth says.
And though he's famous for big records with a light funk sheen, Puth says he wants to broaden his range—even if it means being less commercial. On a recent Instagram Live, he teased the prospect of recording a neo-soul project (he names expressive early-2000s artists Musiq Soulchild and Raphael Saadiq as his favorites), as well as a country album.
After peaking in popularity with "See You Again," the Wiz Khalifa duet that stayed No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks, and its follow-up "Marvin Gaye," which verged on cliche and also charted in the top 25, Nine Track Mind was quickly forced out by his record label (Atlantic Records declined to comment on the matter). But most of the album didn't reflect his true creative spirit. He delivered a series of overly emotional public performances, which peaked with an aggressive set at the family-friendly Jingle Ball in 2016. He explained to The New York Times in 2018 that loneliness and his struggles with anxiety led to his acting out. He retreated to the studio to work on his follow up.
"Voicenotes should have been my debut album," he says. "But at the end of the day, this stuff really isn't about me. If people really want to hear 'Marvin Gaye,' and I really don't like that song at all, I'll make an arrangement to make myself tolerate it just to make people happy. I'm happy to do that."
Puth, who currently lives in Los Angeles, has taken full advantage of the creative freedom that Voicenotes, one of the best-selling pop albums of 2018, has afforded him. This year, he's popped up on a remix of 5 Seconds of Summer's "Easier" and co-wrote and co-produced Katy Perry's songs "Small Talk" and "Harleys in Hawaii." His network has expanded, too: "Mother" came about when he was in the studio working with behind-the-scenes wunderkind Andrew Watt on Ozzy Osbourne's upcoming album along with Louis Bell, Ryan Tedder and Billy Walsh. Red Hot Chili Peppers' drummer Chad Smith, who was also in the studio playing on the Osbourne record, readily hopped on "Mother."
For now, he's focused on chasing his trio of singles with his third album. He says he has at least an album done, and that it's going to be more fun and less moody than Voicenotes, with surprising collaborations.
"What makes a good pop song is just a different way of saying something that's been said for so, so long," he says. "Bringing out an insecure feeling—we're all insecure in some way—and highlighting that and putting a beat to it and making the insecure feeling feel cool."

Texto completo: All praise to the brave Special Forces operators and CIA analysts who took down the heinous ISIS chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
President Donald Trump gets credit for ordering the raid, but his effusive self-praise diminished the moment. (He apparently forgot his tweet storm in 2012 demanding that credit for Osama bin Laden's demise go to "our brave military and intelligence officers," not to President Barack Obama.)
Moreover, Trump's remarks on Baghdadi's death, along with the wild news conference that followed, ignored the heavy cost of his sudden retreat from Syria, which nearly undercut the Baghdadi mission. That retreat leaves the door open for the rise of new jihadi movements.
Most unsettling, Trump offered thanks to Russia, Syria, and Turkey - all countries that have helped ISIS - while continuing to insult our Kurdish allies, who were key to this mission. His failure to grasp who are America's friends and who are adversaries means big security troubles down the road.
No surprise, Russia was number one on Trump's thank-you list. The Russians knew nothing about the operation and did nothing except stay out of the way. Contrary to Trump's claims, Russian forces in Syria were never interested in pursuing ISIS.
Russian TV called the Baghdadi operation "very strange" and accused the Americans of "creating" Baghdadi. "They were just laughing at Trump," says noted independent Russian journalist Yevgenia Albats. Yet Trump called the Russians "very good."
As for Syria, Trump actually thanked a regime headed by war criminal Bashar al-Assad, who released hundreds of ISIS fighters from prison at the beginning of their rise to power. Assad has also let Iran take over much of Syria. Never mind.
But the worst was Trump's praise for Turkey, a country notorious for letting ISIS fighters cross freely into Syria and be treated at Turkish hospitals.
"Turkey also has some explaining to do," writes Brett McGurk, former special presidential envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, in the Washington Post. That's because Baghdadi was found not in ISIS's traditional area of eastern Turkey, but far away in western Turkey, near the Turkish border and Turkish military outposts. This suggests that Turkish military intelligence knew Baghdadi's location and didn't share it.
Clearly, the U.S. military distrusted Ankara. They chose to launch the Baghdadi operation from hundreds of miles away in Iraq, rather than from nearby Turkey (a NATO partner), and reportedly gave Turkey no advance notice. Yet Trump singled this ISIS enabler out for thanks, just the same.
And whose crucial help did he downplay? The Syrian Kurds, who, together with the Iraqi Kurds, reportedly provided more key intelligence help than did any country, and were key in locating Baghdadi. Syrian Kurdish leaders say they were working with U.S. forces on this mission for the past five months, and continued to do so even after Trump sold them out to Turkey early this month. This is why the celebration of Baghdadi's demise is undermined by Trump's performance. The president is clearly ignorant of, or doesn't care about, Turkey's enabling of ISIS. Ditto for Russia's and Syria's indifference. He keeps repeating that they all hate ISIS. They don't.
It's the Kurds who hate ISIS, and who lost 11,000 men and women defeating the caliphate. It's the Kurds who were willing to keep the ISIS network from reviving, backed by a minimal 1,000-troop U.S. presence that had taken almost no casualties. This was a small, safe investment to prevent an ISIS revival until Syria stabilized. It wasn't, as Trump has insisted, a commitment to stay for the next 200 years.
Instead, Trump, on a whim and a phone call to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, pulled out U.S. troops and gave the Turks the green light to invade Syria. In his news conference, the president joked at how minimal the cost was to the Kurds. Again, his ignorance was shocking.
The Turkish invasion has created 200,000 Kurdish refugees, emptied Kurdish cities and towns, and forced the Kurds to turn reluctantly away from America toward Russia and Syria. Our troop withdrawal, along with the loss of Syrian Kurdish help, will deprive us of critical intelligence we need to keep any future ISIS resurgence down.
This is why so many special forces and CIA operatives in Syria, the forces Trump did deign to praise, were dismayed by the troop withdrawal. Some told journalists they felt their withdrawal had betrayed allies they will need in the future.
Some of these operatives also complained that Trump's abrupt withdrawal order three weeks ago disrupted meticulous plans for the operation and made it more risky. Baghdadi's death, some military and counterintelligence sources told the New York Times, "occurred largely in spite of, and not because of, Mr. Trump's actions."
When a U.S. president praises our adversaries and undercuts our friends it doesn't bode well for the future. That was the subtext that ran through Trump's thumping self-celebration of Baghdadi's death.

Texto completo: Las autoridades fronterizas estadounidenses arrestaron el año pasado en la frontera a más niños no acompañados que en cualquier otro periodo registrado , según los datos publicados este martes. Esta cantidad supera incluso la alta cifra de menores que, durante la era Obama , trataban de cruzar a tierra estadounidense sin ningún adulto.
Los agentes migratorios capturaron a un total de 76,020 menores -la mayoría centroamericanos – que viajaban sin sus padres en el año fiscal que terminó en septiembre. De acuerdo a la información de la oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP, por sus siglas en inglés), esta cifra supone un aumento de un 52% respecto al año fiscal anterior.

The New York Times informa de que el crecimiento ha sido parecido en México . El gobierno del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, que encrudeció sus medidas migratorias tras las presiones y amenazas de Donald Trump, detuvo a 40,500 inmigrantes menores que se dirigían al norte sin compañía de adulto alguno. La sumas de las detenciones de niños en ambos países asciende a 115,000.
Casi 25 menores que habían puesto rumbo al norte dijeron en entrevistas con The Times conocer a los peligros que enfrentaban con el viaje y que; si los agarraban; podían acabar hacinados en instalaciones sucias de cualquiera de los dos lados de la frontera. Además, no son ajenos a los agresivos intentos de Trump de bloquear la inmigración que llega por la frontera sur. Aún así, decidieron correr el riesgo para escapar de la pobreza, la falta de oportunidades y violencia .

Charlie Puth Is Finally Comfortable in the Spotlight; The Grammy-nominated singer gets the call when Katy Perry and Ozzy Osborne need fresh ideas. Is his next move a country album?

Texto completo: It didn't take long for 27-year-old singer Charlie Puth to make peace with the fact that his radio-friendly debut album, 2016's Nine Track Mind, was largely a misfire. "That album... It hurts me," he says. "It was very rudimentary production, but it was me. [The album] was super rushed and didn't feel like me at all."
With the gift of perfect pitch—the ability to correctly identify the exact note of any sound he hears—and a Berklee College of Music education, Puth seemed destined for more than formulaic drivel. The New Jersey native got his start posting poppy covers to YouTube and broke out with "See You Again," a duet with Wiz Khalifa in 2015. Earning three Grammy nominations for the record, Puth now says he gave too much credence to industry executives in the aftermath of his success.
"I wouldn't blame them. I had no idea where I was going, so I took a bunch of suggestions," he says.
In a few years' time, Puth has tried to course-correct. Last year's Voicenotes was the commercial and critical project he says he wanted to make in the first place. The album was nominated for a 2019 Grammy in the Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical category, recognition of his technical precision as co-engineer on the project. He's released three singles over the past couple of months: "I Warned Myself," "Cheating on You" and "Mother," the latter a radio single.
Now intent on reconciling his ascent as a pop star with his ambition to be taken seriously as an artist with production chops, he's got another album's worth of material ready. Artists like Katy Perry and Ozzy Osbourne are calling him to work on their music, hoping his production skills will lend their new releases some fresh ideas.
"I would consider myself a record producer," he says. He adds that fellow hitmaker Benny Blanco, who has helped create songs for Ed Sheeran, Rihanna, and Justin Bieber, taught him that he should never take longer than 30 minutes creating a beat. "I don't want my songs to ever sound sloppy, I want to make sure they hit the right way. But I don't need to spend two months on a production," Puth says.
And though he's famous for big records with a light funk sheen, Puth says he wants to broaden his range—even if it means being less commercial. On a recent Instagram Live, he teased the prospect of recording a neo-soul project (he names expressive early-2000s artists Musiq Soulchild and Raphael Saadiq as his favorites), as well as a country album.
After peaking in popularity with "See You Again," the Wiz Khalifa duet that stayed No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks, and its follow-up "Marvin Gaye," which verged on cliche and also charted in the top 25, Nine Track Mind was quickly forced out by his record label (Atlantic Records declined to comment on the matter). But most of the album didn't reflect his true creative spirit. He delivered a series of overly emotional public performances, which peaked with an aggressive set at the family-friendly Jingle Ball in 2016. He explained to The New York Times in 2018 that loneliness and his struggles with anxiety led to his acting out. He retreated to the studio to work on his follow up.
"Voicenotes should have been my debut album," he says. "But at the end of the day, this stuff really isn't about me. If people really want to hear 'Marvin Gaye,' and I really don't like that song at all, I'll make an arrangement to make myself tolerate it just to make people happy. I'm happy to do that."
Puth, who currently lives in Los Angeles, has taken full advantage of the creative freedom that Voicenotes, one of the best-selling pop albums of 2018, has afforded him. This year, he's popped up on a remix of 5 Seconds of Summer's "Easier" and co-wrote and co-produced Katy Perry's songs "Small Talk" and "Harleys in Hawaii." His network has expanded, too: "Mother" came about when he was in the studio working with behind-the-scenes wunderkind Andrew Watt on Ozzy Osbourne's upcoming album along with Louis Bell, Ryan Tedder and Billy Walsh. Red Hot Chili Peppers' drummer Chad Smith, who was also in the studio playing on the Osbourne record, readily hopped on "Mother."
For now, he's focused on chasing his trio of singles with his third album. He says he has at least an album done, and that it's going to be more fun and less moody than Voicenotes, with surprising collaborations.
"What makes a good pop song is just a different way of saying something that's been said for so, so long," he says. "Bringing out an insecure feeling—we're all insecure in some way—and highlighting that and putting a beat to it and making the insecure feeling feel cool."

'I was concerned': Trump's top Ukraine expert to tell impeachment investigators he reported troubling conduct twice to superiors

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The White House's top expert on Ukraine twice notified superiors about concerns that the president and those working for him were linking foreign aid to Ukraine with investigations that would help President Donald Trump politically, a push that he said could undermine U. S. national security, according to an opening statement obtained by USA TODAY.
The testimony of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman before the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees Tuesday will mark the first time lawmakers investigating the impeachment inquiry will hear from someone who listened to Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — the call at the center of the impeachment investigation that included a Trump's request that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.
"I was concerned by the call," Vindman wrote in the opening statement. "I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U. S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U. S. government’s support of Ukraine. "

In the six-page opening statement, Vindman, a key member of the National Security Council, outlined his dedicated service to the country, including his two decades as an Army officer, which included a tour in Iraq where he was wounded in an IED attack and awarded a Purple Heart. He says his family fled the Soviet Union and immigrated to New York City in 1979, giving him a deep appreciation of the American dream.
"I am a patriot," he says in the statement. "And it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics. "
Vindman offered an overview of his role within the Trump administration in the testimony, including being tasked to attend Zelensky's inauguration in May, and details two specific events that he found concerning, "inappropriate" and led to him reporting the situation to the National Security Council's top lawyer.
The first was in July when a number of officials, including former National Security Advisor John Bolton, Ambassadors Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland — two key witnesses that have testified to lawmakers — and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who resigned earlier this month, met with Oleksandr Danylyuk, Ukraine's Secretary of National Security and Defense Council, according to the testimony.
The meeting in Washington was going well until the Ukrainians asked about a potential meeting between Trump and Zelensky, Vindman writes. That was when Sondland "started to speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the President. "
Bolton then cut the meeting short, according to the testimony. Vindman wrote that after the meeting there was a debriefing where he confronted Sondland, saying "his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push. "
It was after that meeting that Vindman reported his concerns to the National Security Council's chief lawyer.
Vindman said he reported a second concern after listening to Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, where the president talked about military aid for the country, then asked about investigations into Biden and 2016 election.
He said Ukraine launching such investigations would push partisan politics into helping Ukraine fend off Russia, which would "undermine U. S. national security. "
The New York Times first reported on Vindman's opening statement.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—A top official with the National Security Council plans to tell House impeachment investigators that he was concerned by President Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying that the president's request to have the Ukrainians investigate Joe Biden and his son may have been interpreted as a "partisan play."
Alexander Vindman, an Iraq war veteran who currently oversees Ukraine policy at the NSC, will be the first official with firsthand knowledge of the phone call at the heart of the impeachment inquiry to testify when he appears before House investigators on Tuesday.
According to a statement obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Vindman also plans to tell investigators that the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, told a Ukrainian delegation in early July that the government in Kyiv needed to deliver specific investigations to secure a meeting with Mr. Trump. The statement says that the July 10 meeting was cut short by then-national security adviser John Bolton, which corroborates with what others have testified to.
Mr. Bolton didn't respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Trump sought to play down the testimony Tuesday morning, tweeting : "Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call."
Mr. Trump added: "Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER! Ukrain said NO PRESSURE."
"Following this meeting, there was a scheduled debriefing during which Amb. Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma," the statement says. "I stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push."
The statement was earlier obtained by the New York Times.
Mr. Vindman's statement notes that he listened in on the call in the Situation Room with colleagues from the NSC and the office of the Vice President, adding, "I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine."
Mr. Sondland testified to House committees that he raised investigations in the July 10 meeting but has said he was not aware of concerns from NSC officials about his doing so, a person familiar with his testimony said.
An expert on Ukraine and Russia, Mr. Vindman represented the administration as the lead NSC official on Ukraine policy and advocated for warmer ties with Ukraine at a time when Mr. Trump had been inclined to foster closer ties with Russia. Mr. Vindman was part of the U.S. delegation that attended Mr. Zelensky's inauguration, along with Energy Secretary Rick Perry and ambassadors Kurt Volker, Joseph Pennington and Mr. Sondland.
The role of former Vice President Biden's son Hunter at energy company Burisma Holdings Ltd. has come under intense scrutiny following unsupported accusations by Mr. Trump that the Democratic front-runner for president improperly tried to help his son's business interests in Ukraine.
Mr. Trump, in a July 25 call, asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Mr. Zelensky, to "look into" Mr. Biden and his son and said he would direct Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, and Attorney General William Barr to contact Mr. Zelensky to help him in a possible investigation, according to a rough transcript released by the White House.

Before asking Ukraine to examine actions by Mr. Biden's son, Mr. Trump reminded Mr. Zelensky that the U.S. sends security aid to Ukraine, according to the transcript, which was released in late September.
Mr. Vindman says that an investigation into the Biden family and Burisma "would likely be interpreted as a partisan play" which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. As a result, he reported his concerns to the NSC's lead counsel.
In his prewritten testimony, Mr. Vindman also states that he is not the whistleblower whose official complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry, adding, "I do not know who the whistleblower is and I would not feel comfortable to speculate as to the identity of the whistleblower."
"I did convey certain concerns internally to National Security officials in accordance with my decades of experience and training, sense of duty, and obligation to operate within the chain of command," he adds.
The Ukraine Witnesses
* Oct. 3: Kurt Volker, former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, testifies and hands over text messages with other State Department officials that showed officials attempting to use a potential meeting between Mr. Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart as leverage to press Kyiv to investigate Joe Biden.

* Oct. 17: Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, criticizes President Trump over his efforts to enlist Ukraine in investigating a political rival and says he and other U.S. officials were "disappointed" by the president's directive to work with Mr. Giuliani on Ukraine matters.

Employees Ask Facebook to Reverse Policy on Political-Ad Fact Checking; A letter signed by 250 employees argues that candidates' ads should not be exempt from checks

Texto completo: A group of Facebook Inc. employees asked the company to reverse its policy of exempting political candidates' ads from its own fact-checking program, calling the controversial rules a betrayal of the social-media giant's values.
"Free speech and paid speech are not the same thing," the employees said in an open letter to Facebook, which was posted on the company's internal network. They argue that exempting candidates' ads from fact checking "allows politicians to weaponize our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy."
Signed by 250 employees as of Monday, the letter represents less than 1% of the company's 40,000-person staff but adds to the debate over Facebook's political advertising policies . The company has long avoided fact-checking political candidates' personal Facebook posts, but only clarified earlier this month that it would exempt campaign advertising from such review .
In response to the letter, reported earlier by the New York Times, Facebook said internal debate and criticism of its policies are welcome.
"Facebook's culture is built on openness so we appreciate our employees voicing their thoughts on this important topic," said spokeswoman Bertie Thomson. "We remain committed to not censoring political speech, and will continue exploring additional steps we can take to bring increased transparency to political ads."
The letter is the most recent example of employee activist efforts within major tech companies and social media platforms. Alphabet Inc.'s Google abandoned a contract with U.S. military last year in the wake of heavy employee opposition; Amazon.com Inc. has faced internal protests on climate-change; and companies including Microsoft Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc. have faced employee objections over their work with federal immigration enforcement agencies or contractors.
In the letter to Facebook, employees said the site's decision not to fact-check candidates' ads runs contrary to its two-year effort to fight misinformation on the platform and is confusing to the public.
News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Facebook.
In response to a question from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee last week, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg himself appeared hazy on whether the company would intervene if she targeted a Republican primary with ads falsely stating that one of the candidates supported the raft of progressive environmental proposals known as the Green New Deal .
"Congresswoman, I don't know the answer to that off the top of my head. I think probably?" Mr. Zuckerberg said.
Per Facebook's policies, the correct answer is that an ad containing such a falsehood would be allowed only if it were purchased by a politician running for office. An independent organization, capitalizing on Mr. Zuckerberg's lack of clarity, bought an advertisement worded precisely as described by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Because the outside group lacked the exemption afforded to politicians, it was flagged by a Facebook fact-checking partner, Lead Stories, and eventually taken down.
Beyond taking issue with the fact-checking exemption itself, the employees asked the company to better distinguish political ads from user-created content and to limit political advertisers' ability to address ads to narrowly focused or custom-designed audiences.
"Currently we restrict targeting for housing and education and credit verticals due to a history of discrimination," the letter said, recommending that political advertisers be similarly restrained.
"We look forward to working towards solutions together," the letter concludes. "This is still our company."

Shifting course, Democrats plan first floor vote on impeachment inquiry

Texto completo: The House plans to take its first formal vote Thursday on the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Democratic leaders said Monday, ushering in a new phase as they prepare to go public with their investigation into his dealings with Ukraine.
Democrats described the vote, in which they plan to “affirm” the inquiry, as a necessary next step to be able to push it forward, rather than a response to sustained criticism from Republicans and the White House, who have accused them of throwing out past impeachment precedents and denying the president due process rights.
But it will be the first time that the full House has gone on record with regard to an inquiry that has been underway since late September. And it comes after Democrats have insisted for weeks that they did not need a formal vote of the full House to authorize the proceedings.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the vote in a letter to colleagues Monday afternoon.
“This resolution establishes the procedure for hearings that are open to the American people, authorizes the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlines procedures to transfer evidence to the Judiciary Committee as it considers potential articles of impeachment, and sets forth due process rights for the president and his counsel,” Pelosi said in a statement.
Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., chairman of the House Rules Committee, said he would introduce the resolution, which has not yet been finalized, Tuesday. His panel plans to consider it Wednesday, followed by a vote of the full House on Thursday.
“We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,” Pelosi wrote.

Foley's mother grateful for US effort

Texto completo: Diane Foley, the mother of murdered war correspondent James Foley, said Sunday she was grateful to learn the US government was still searching for members of the group's leadership after news broke Sunday of the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group.
Baghdadi was the target of a US military raid in Syria, President Trump announced Sunday morning.
Foley, in a telephone interview shortly before Trump spoke, said the administration had given her a heads-up that an announcement was coming.
“I'm glad we are still on this issue," she said. “These folks are shrewd and will continue to pose a threat."
Foley's son James, a freelance war correspondent, was beheaded by members of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, in 2014, nearly two years after he was kidnapped in Syria. James Foley's execution was intended as retaliation for US military actions in Iraq around that time, the group said in a video posted online.
Foley, who lives in Rochester, N.H., commended the bravery of military members who carried out the operation against Baghdadi. But she said she would have preferred that Baghdadi had been taken alive so he could be tried in a US court.
“My preference is for all of these ISIS fighters and leaders to be held in custody and face trial," Foley said.
Later, on Sunday night, Foley said in an e-mail that Trump had called her in the late afternoon.
“I am grateful for that kindness and for finding Baghdadi," she said.
John Foley, Diane's husband, told WMUR-TV that the war on ISIS must continue.
“I believe ISIS is like grass," John Foley said. “You mow it, but it continues to grow. And I don't think that the elimination of al-Baghdadi is the final answer."
Trump told reporters Sunday that Baghdadi was targeted by US forces in Syria and died after fleeing into a tunnel with three of his children and detonating an explosive suicide vest.
“He was a sick and depraved man, and now he's gone," Trump said. “He died like a dog, he died like a coward."
Trump had teased a major development on Twitter Saturday, and multiple media outlets early Sunday reported Baghdadi's death.
Later Sunday morning, Trump told reporters during the press conference that the United States had brought the “world's number-one terrorist leader to justice."
The president referred to James Foley as one of four Americans killed by the terror group whose deaths “were especially heinous."
Earlier this month, Trump ordered the withdrawal of American troops from Syria's border with Turkey, which made room for the Turkish military to launch strikes in the region against Kurdish fighters who had been battling alongside US forces. The withdrawal also gave more than 100 Islamic State prisoners a chance to escape custody from Syrian prisons.
Officials were able to transfer two of Foley's son's alleged captors from a prison in Syria to one in Iraq following Turkey's incursion.
Foley said she has been waiting for the extradition of those men, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Amon Kotey, to face charges in US civilian courts. She said she believes that a fair court trial is the appropriate way to hold former Islamic State fighters accountable for their actions.
During her call with Trump Sunday, Foley said, she asked the president to bring both men to the United States for trial.
She said she also hopes that more will be done to bring home those still held hostage in Syria, and she worries about their safety given the turmoil that followed the American withdrawal.
Trump has since reconsidered a total withdrawal, and could leave about 200 troops in eastern Syria, The New York Times has reported.
Foley, who called on Trump to reverse his decision to leave Syria in an Oct. 10 opinion column she co-wrote for The Washington Post, praised the government for potentially changing course.
“I am glad that the government is reconsidering a total pullout," Foley said. “That leadership is needed [in the] hunt for the residual ISIS fighters."

Al-Baghdadi Is Dead. Extremism Lives On.

Texto completo: The killing of the founder and leader of the Islamic State by United States commandos operating in Syria should certainly further weaken the most vile and deadly Islamist movement to emerge in the Middle East in the modern era.
The world is certainly a better place with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi dead and a measure of justice meted out on behalf of all the women ISIS raped, all the journalists ISIS beheaded and the tens of thousands of Syrians and Iraqis it abused. Good for President Trump for ordering it, for the intelligence agents who set it up, for the allies who aided in it and for the Special Forces who executed it.
But this story is far from over, and it could have many unexpected implications. Let's start at home.
President Trump was effusive in his praise for the U.S. intelligence agencies who found and tracked al-Baghdadi to the lair in Syria where he blew himself up to avoid being captured. In his news conference, Trump went on and on about just how good the men and women in our intelligence agencies are.
Well, Mr. President, those are the same intelligence agencies who told you that Russia intervened in our last election in an effort to tip the vote to you and against Hillary Clinton (and are still intervening). When our intel agencies exposed that reality, you impugned their integrity and quality.
And the same intelligence agencies who tracked down al-Baghdadi are the same ones who produced two whistle-blowers high up in your White House -- who complained that you, Mr. Trump, abused the power of your office to get Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, touching off this impeachment inquiry.
And those same intelligence agencies whom you hailed as heroes for tracking down al-Baghdadi, Mr. Trump, are the same "deep state," the same agencies and whistle-blowers whom your White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, just smeared as "radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution."
So thank you, Mr. Trump, for clearing up this confusion. We now know that the same intelligence services who have been heroic in protecting us from those who want to attack our constitutional democracy from abroad are the same heroes who have stepped up to protect our constitutional democracy from within. Unlike you, Mr. Trump, they took seriously their oath to do both.
As for the future of the Middle East, let's not forget that ISIS was the Sunni Muslim jihadist organization that emerged after President Barack Obama's administration eliminated the previous holder of the worst-person-in-the-world title, Osama bin Laden. But al-Baghdadi's death -- a very good thing in and of itself -- is not the end of our troubles in and from the Middle East.
Trump's effort to play down the significance of President Obama's killing of bin Laden -- while playing up his killing of al-Baghdadi as the key to creating the peace to end all peace -- only shows how ignorant he is about the region.
ISIS emerged in 2014 as the product of three loose factions or movements, as I pointed out in a column back in 2015.
One faction comprised the foreign volunteers. Some were hardened jihadists, but many were losers, misfits, adventure seekers and young men who had never held power, a job or a girl's hand and they joined ISIS to get all three. ISIS offered a paycheck, power and sexual release to men and women coming from closed societies or cultures where none of that was available.
ISIS's second faction -- its brains and military backbone -- was composed of former Sunni Baathist army officers and local Iraqi Sunnis and tribes, who gave ISIS passive support. Iraqi Sunnis constitute about a third of Iraq's population. They had ruled Iraq for generations, and many Sunnis in the Iraqi military were enraged, humiliated and frustrated by how the U.S. invasion of Iraq had overturned that order and put the Iraqi Shiite majority in charge.
ISIS also derived a lot of passive support from just average Iraqi Sunnis after Iran and pro-Iranian Shiites in power in Baghdad, led by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki -- whom the Bush administration tragically installed -- used their power to further abuse Iraqi Sunnis and keep them from jobs and out of the military.
For many Iraqi Sunni villagers under ISIS control, ISIS was just less bad than the brutality and discrimination they experienced under Iraq's pro-Iranian Shiite-led government back then. Google "Iraqi Shiite militias and power drills" and you'll see that ISIS didn't invent torture in Iraq.
Fortunately, we and the Iraqis finally figured that out, and Iraq has a much better government today. But the U.S. keeps repeating the same mistake in the Middle East: overestimating the power of religious ideology and underappreciating the impact of bad governance.
As Sarah Chayes, who long worked in Afghanistan and has written an important book -- "Thieves of State: Why Corruption Threatens Global Security" -- puts it: "Nothing feeds extremism more than the in-your-face corruption and injustice" that some of America's closest Middle East allies administer daily to their people.
The third ISIS faction was composed of the true religious ideologues, led by al-Baghdadi. They have their own apocalyptic version of Islam. But it would not have resonated so far and wide were it not for the first two factors listed above.
And that leads us back to Trump and his foreign policy. Trump has never met a dictator he did not like. He is blind to the fact that the next al-Baghdadi is being incubated today in some prison in Egypt, where President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whom Trump once actually called "my favorite dictator," is not only rounding up violent Jihadists but liberal nonviolent journalists, activists and politicians. Their only crime is that they want to have a say in their country's future and help to create an environment where they can realize their full potential -- so they will not have to look for dignity, power, a job or a girl's hand from extremist groups like ISIS.
When Trump praises Baghdadi as his favorite victim and el-Sisi as his favorite dictator, all he is doing is walking in place. We're actually getting nowhere.
And that brings me back to Syria. Syrian Sunnis supported ISIS for the same reason Iraqi Sunnis did. Iran, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia, the Shiite-Alawite Syrian regime of Bashar Assad and Russia have all collaborated to create a pro-Iranian Shiite minority government in Damascus. Of course they gave Trump a free pass to kill Baghdadi! His death just makes it that much easier for them to rule Syria without sharing power with the Sunnis. As long as that's the case, there will be no stability there.
Finally, Trump kept going on and on in his news conference about how he, in his infinite wisdom, was keeping U.S. troops in Syria to protect the oil fields there so maybe U.S. oil companies could exploit them. He even boasted that while he was against the Iraq war, we should have taken over all of Iraq's oil fields to pay for it.
This is disgusting talk, and again, a prescription for trouble in the future. If America has any role in the Middle East today, it is not to protect the oil wells, but to protect and enhance what I call the "islands of decency."
These are places like Iraqi and Syrian Kurdistan, Jordan, the U.A.E., Oman, Lebanon and the frail democracies in Tunisia and Baghdad. None of these are developed democracies; Oman, Jordan and the U.A.E. are monarchies. But perfect is not on the menu in the Middle East right now. And these countries do promote more moderate versions of Islam and religious tolerance, they do empower their women and they do encourage modern education.
These are the necessary but not sufficient antidotes to ISIS. They are worth preserving and enhancing in hopes that they can develop one day into something better for all their peoples. Just look at the democracy protests in Lebanon. You can see where the young people want to go.
Only Trump would boast of defeating ISIS and thinking that all that needs to be done now is to protect the Middle East's oil wells and America's favorite dictators -- and not its wells of decency.

Texto completo: When New York Times bestselling author and award-winning sportswriter Joe Posnanski stood before a full house during the 2019 Booklovers’ Bash last weekend to share the primary motivation for writing his newest book, “The Life and Afterlife of Harry Houdini,” most people didn’t expect him to admit that he knew nothing about the magician when he settled on his subject matter.
It’s far more common for an author to write about a topic on which he or she is an expert; “write what you know” is usually the first piece of advice experienced writers share with aspiring ones.
Posnanski chose Houdini precisely for the opposite reason. Because his entire career has focused on writing about sports, he wanted to reignite his sense of wonder and curiosity by learning something new. This paradigm shift not only led him on a three-year research adventure about all things Houdini, he successfully regained a sense of wonder threatened by routine and predictability.
Wonder has been on my mind in the days since. It’s a powerful concept. A sense of wonder is defined in part by the Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction as the feeling of awakening or awe triggered by an expansion of one’s awareness of what is possible.
It’s the “whoa” you whisper to yourself when something amazing stops you in your tracks; the curiosity that leads you down a rabbit hole of online clicking that makes you forget all the other stuff you should be doing. Almost without fail, a sense of wonder leads to a sense of appreciation for other people’s great ideas, for the magic of nature, for the ability to challenge boundaries.
Its close cousin is the self-fulfilling prophecy, because once we realize what’s possible, it’s much easier to step up and into that new level of possibility, too.
I have to say, feeling inspired by and appreciative for the ingenuity of humans and the power of nature seems a heck of a lot better – and more productive – than feeling outraged by the inexplicability of humans and nature.
In this spirit, I conducted a non-scientific experiment on myself. I paid more attention to things that elicited my sense of wonder, and I allowed time to really enjoy the feeling of awe that followed. I was interested to know how this shift in perspective would affect my outlook. A few things that made the list:
The Peacherine Ragtime Orchestra – This Baltimore-based ragtime band performed at the Cheyenne Civic Center on Wednesday evening, and while I expected to enjoy it, I did not predict how much I would enjoy it. The 12-member orchestra was technically masterful in every way, but it was the fact they played the original live soundtracks, complete with sound effects, for three silent movies starring Laurel & Hardy, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton that astounded me.
I realized in the first five minutes that I’ve never experienced a silent movie properly – I’d been doing it all wrong. I’ve seen a few of the most famous ones, but I’ve never heard a live ragtime orchestra accompany a silent movie cue for cue, the way it was intended to be shown. Seen this way, the movies were actually laugh-out-loud funny and far more sophisticated than I had ever given them credit for. My heart expanded a size in appreciation for a nearly extinct art form I thought I understood, but clearly did not.
Rats Driving Cars – If you haven’t heard the news stories this week about the University of Richmond researchers who trained actual rats to drive actual tiny cars designed specifically for them, go look up a video clip right now. This successful project will lead to greater understanding of how learning affects – and is affected by – emotional health. Only someone with a well-developed sense of wonder and an even bigger imagination could dream up rats driving cars in the name of science.
Eliud Kipchoge – Kenyan long-distance runner Eliud Kipchoge ran a sub-two-hour marathon this month. That translates to running a mile under four minutes … 26 times in a row. Yes, he had super-shoes designed by Nike just for this feat. Yes, a world-class team of pacemakers ran with him the entire way. The naysayers said nay because of those conditions, but 26.2 miles is still an awfully long distance to put one foot in front of the other that fast. Human endeavor: whoa.
November is fast approaching; with the season of gratitude it brings, I encourage you to start your own “sense of wonder” list. Your appreciation for what’s possible – especially when it’s unexpected – will grow, and you just might find yourself in awe (and gratitude) a little more often. It’s a good feeling.

The Blade newsroom not for or against the President

Texto completo: IT IS IRONIC that most of the complaints I receive about The Blade concern stories that The Blade doesn't write.

You probably know where I'm going with this, but the actions by President Trump and the reporting about those actions spur more complaints to the newspaper than any other single topic.

Our grammatical mistakes may come in a close second.

Let me state at the beginning that The Blade no longer has reporters in Washington covering the White House and Congress. We haven't for many years.

The stories you read in The Blade about Mr. Trump and all the controversies swirling around him are written by reporters for the Associated Press, Reuters, The New York Times, the Washington Post, and other wire services The Blade pays for.

This is nothing new. For decades the newspaper has spent many hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to have national and international news stories sent to the Blade Building in downtown Toledo.

The term wire stories and wire service is an indication of the longevity of this practice - back to the age of the telegraph in the 1920s and 1930s.

I have only been at The Blade the past 40 years, but I'd bet that the editors in the 1920s were no more interested in publishing fake news any more than the editors I was trained under.

That is a charge I've heard many times over the past couple years.

The story you published today is nothing but a conspiracy theory based on fake news, one anonymous reader wrote to me recently. The story in question was about President Trump's dealings with the president of the Ukraine and whether he was trying to get Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Another reader felt we didn't jump on that story quick enough.

The Giuliani-Ukraine-Trump story was downplayed on Friday and not reported at all of Saturday or Sunday, Larry Rosenberg wrote to me. The Blade is not reporting a prominent domestic story with international ramifications. Isn't that a conscious fallacy by omission?

I know these are polarized times with the country seemingly split down the middle for or against Mr. Trump, but I hope you'll believe me when I say the Blade newsroom is not for or against the President. Our job is to publish stories about what he does and the reaction to that.

I will tell you that the night news desk editors, whose job it is to produce the newspaper on deadline at night, are under instructions from me to remove any editorial comments in wire stories about the President. That's not because we're trying to protect him, but because editorial comments should be on the editorial pages and not in news columns.

Other readers let me know when they think what we write is inaccurate when covering presidential politics, such the use of the word socialist.

A true socialist is someone who wants all of the business and workplaces to be owned and controlled by the state, Stewart Epstein informed me. Democrats who want our federal government to spend more on social programs to help the lower and middle classes as they struggle to survive and pay their bills are not 'socialists.' They are 'liberal/progressives' who want our market-based capitalist economic system to become MORE HUMANE.

And then there is Donald Gorrell of Sylvania who believes that Washington is run by incompetents and crooks.

What elected officials in Washington are doing and/or not doing is terrible and should all be fired, Mr. Gorrell writes to The Blade. Do I agree with our President on everything he is or has done? NO. And I sincerely doubt that anyone could please me entirely.

**************

Now for a couple grammar lessons thanks to Blade readers:

From Steven Kutcher: I believe that journalists have an obligation to use the English language correctly. Two times last week The Blade used the word siege in headline articles concerning military action by Turkey. Though the word sounds good it does not apply to facts on the ground.

Mr. Kutcher is correct. Siege is a military operation in which enemy forces surround a town or building, cutting off essential supplies. What Turkey reportedly did in northern Syria was to bomb villages and watch the Kurds flee.

And a personal thank you to Debbie Keller for pointing out a mistake in my last column: I was raised by a mom who was an English major and was our manner and grammar police. One of her pet peeves and now mine is not using an adverb correctly.

You stated, 'I can't believe we screwed this up so bad.' You screwed up badly, not bad.

Líder de ISIS fue traicionado por una de sus esposas

Texto completo: Un arresto en el verano fue crucial para conseguir la baja de Abu Bakr al Bagdadi, el líder de ISIS, este fin de semana.
De acuerdo con el New York Times, el plan para emboscar a Al Bagdadi comenzó en el verano cuando la CIA consiguió información sobre la ubicación del líder del supuesto califato gracias al arresto de una de sus esposas y un mensajero.
Relacionado: Trump cree que baja del líder de ISIS es mucho más grande que la de Osama Bin Laden
El interrogatorio a la mujer, que era de toda la confianza de Al Bagdadi, llevó a la CIA a unir fuerzas con iraquíes y kurdos para conseguir la ubicación específica. El Times asegura que los kurdos siguieron brindado información a Estados Unidos , sin importar que el presidente Donald Trump hubiera retirado a las tropas del norte de Siria para permitir una incursión turca.
Una fuente kurda dijo a EFE que habían estado coordinándose durante estos últimos meses con Washington, a quien agradeció su papel, pero el secretario de Defensa de Estados Unidos, Mark Esper , subrayó que la información acerca de la ubicación precisa de Al Bagdadi fue aportada por Turquía 48 horas antes de la misión.
Durante ella, los comandos estadounidenses atravesaron espacio aéreo ruso, por lo que Moscú fue avisado, y también le dio las gracias junto a Damasco .
Relacionado: Trump confirma que líder de ISIS murió en operativo en Siria: “Murió como un cobarde”
Idlib es el último feudo insurrecto en Siria en el que se han concentrado una miríada de grupos extremistas y que habían dado una vía a Al Bagdadi para refugiarse, entre los que destaca la facción Hurras al Din (Guardianes de la Religión), la imagen de la red extremista Al Qaeda en Siria.
Es el Organismo de Liberación del Levante , una alianza islamista en la que está incluida la exfilial siria de Al Qaeda, la que controla prácticamente todo Idlib, considerada “terrorista” por Damasco y Moscú, que desarrollan desde el 30 de abril una ofensiva contra ellos.

Foo Foo Fest Art, culture and so much more

Texto completo: Now in its sixth year, the Foo Foo Festival continues its sweeping survey of local arts, culture and entertainment. Spanning 12 days from Oct. 31-Nov. 11, the festival bridges incumbent events like the Blue Angels Homecoming show with newer ones like "StompFest" and "3D Printsacola."
"Pensacola is highly regarded in the arts and culture community and is quickly becoming the culture capital across the Southeast," said Maria Goldberg, Foo Foo Fest Committee Chair.
The festival is a flagship effort by Art, Culture, and Entertainment, Inc., or ACE. The non-profit group distributes federal, state, and local funding to local organizations and promotes "cultural tourism." "Foo Foo" refers to the impromptu musical parties that broke out on 19th century sailing ships. The name is also an apposite tie-in to the city's maritime history.
"We're excited to present another year of stellar and diverse experiences during this year's festival that will attract regional and national visitors alike," Goldberg continued.
Foo Foo events have either received grant funding through ACE or have applied to join the festival's promotional calendar as "Friends of Foo Foo."
Perhaps its main anchor is the Great Gulfcoast Arts Festival, Nov. 1-3, in Seville Square. Now in its 47th year, GGAF is a travel-worthy convention of over 200 juried artists and local performers. This year the festival will extend to Museum Plaza on Tarragona Street.
Nearby is "Fire and Rain," a colorful canopy that will drape overhead through several downtown blocks throughout the month of November. Billed as "Pensacola's biggest art installation to date," it winds from Southtowne to Artel Gallery.
Art and Science will converge for "3D Printsacola" on Nov. 1 at First City Art Center, 1060 N. Guillemard St. For this ambitious project, FCAC teamed up with the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition.
"We believe there are many connections between art and science, art and technology, and how machine-generative art is changing the way some artists are making work these days," explained Caitlin Rhea, FCAC's executive director.
The evening features Rodney Mullen, the "godfather of modern street skating," who will put 3D-printed concrete "skulptures" to the test.
For traditional print artists a workshop by New York Times Best-Selling author (and former Pensacolian) Joshilyn Jackson is offered from 1:30-5 p.m., Nov. 8, at the Studer Community Center, 220 W. Garden St. It follows from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Nov. 9, with the Pensacola Writing and Book Festival. Aspiring scribes are invited to pick the brains of published authors including romance novelist Lenora Worth.
Eleanor Randolph, another former Pensacolian, is having a sort of homecoming at 5:30 p.m., Nov. 9, at the Pensacola Museum of Art. She will sign her new book, "The Many Lives of Michael Bloomberg."
"This masterful work not only paints a riveting portrait of a fascinating man; it is an absolutely first-rate study of leadership in business, politics and philanthropy," lauded a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.
Randolph was on the New York Times editorial staff for 20 years after writing for other daily heavyweights like the St. Petersburg Times, Chicago Tribune, and the Washington Post. She got her start reporting for the Pensacola News Journal.

Texto completo: It's only a little over a month since an intelligence community whistleblower turned the Trump administration on its side; it may seem like more. At first, the story seemed straightforward: The informant charged that President Trump had pressured Ukraine's new president to investigate Joe Biden's son and blocked U.S. military aid to force the Ukrainian leader to do his bidding.
But the story has become more complicated along the way. Trump wasn't asking only for an inquiry into the Bidens. He also wanted Ukraine to look for evidence that might exonerate Russia from responsibility for the 2016 cyberattacks against the Democratic Party. He dispatched Atty. Gen. William Barr around the world to seek evidence that the Obama administration's investigation of his campaign was politically motivated. He said he still wants someone to find the Democratic Party's "missing" computer server, which isn't missing, and Hillary Clinton's lost emails, which no longer exist.
Here's one mystery in the case: How did poor, embattled Ukraine land in the middle of so many Trumpworld conspiracy theories about what happened in 2016?

Well, Ukraine is next to Russia -- and Vladimir Putin has never fully accepted Kyiv's desire to escape from Moscow's sphere of influence. Regaining sway there is arguably the Russian president's No. 1 foreign policy goal.
"I believe that Russians and Ukrainians are actually one people," Putin told filmmaker Oliver Stone in June. "One nation, in fact.... We have many things in common; we can use this as our competitive advantage during some form of integration."
Trump does not have a long history of dealing with Ukraine, but he does have a long record of admiration for Putin. In 2014, as he prepared his campaign, the future president praised the Russian's decision to seize Crimea, which has been part of Ukraine since 1954.
"He's done an amazing job," Trump said. "So smart."
When he arrived in the White House, the president inherited a policy of sanctions against Putin over the invasion. He didn't like it; he said it got in the way of better relations. Bipartisan majorities in Congress disagreed.
But Trump never abandoned his preference for Russia. When he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last month, Trump urged the Ukrainian to strike a quick compromise with Putin over eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed rebels have seized a chunk of territory.
Ukrainians noted that Trump didn't offer to support them as they bargained with their larger, more powerful neighbor. His natural sympathies, it appeared, were still with Putin, not Zelensky.
Meanwhile, the U.S. president has never given up his quest to overturn the intelligence community's finding that Russia attempted to help him win the 2016 election.
"It all goes back to his obsession with legitimacy," a former White House official told me last week. "He cannot stand the idea that his election might have been illegitimate."
That pursuit has enmeshed Ukraine as well, thanks to an alt-right conspiracy theory and a Russian propaganda campaign.
In 2016, immediately after the Democratic National Committee reported that its computers had been hacked, Russia's semiofficial television outlet RT charged that CrowdStrike, the private firm that analyzed the hack, was owned by an anti-Russian emigre.
Over time, some Trump supporters charged that CrowdStrike was controlled by a Ukrainian billionaire and had even spirited a DNC computer server to Kyiv.
There is no evidence that any of that is true. But the conspiracy theory made its way to Trump, who latched on to it.
After his meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Finland, in July 2018, Trump was asked whether he had admonished Russia to stay out of future U.S. elections. His response was odd: "I want to know, where is the server? And what is the server saying?"
Trump's personal attorney and private investigator, Rudolph W. Giuliani, appears to have fed the president's suspicion of Ukraine and its new president, Zelensky.
"Ukrainians helped the DNC and Hillary operatives to get, in some cases, false, dirty information about the Trump campaign," Giuliani said in May. "[Zelensky] is surrounded by people who are enemies of the president."
About the same time, the New York Times reported, Trump told aides that he didn't trust Zelensky's new government.
"They're terrible people," he said, according to the newspaper. "They're all corrupt and they tried to take me down."
That was the backdrop to Trump's seemingly odd request to Zelensky to investigate CrowdStrike in their now-famous July 25 telephone call.
"I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike," Trump said, according to the White House summary of the conversation. "The server, they say Ukraine has it."
There's even more at stake in this scandal than whether Trump used U.S. military aid as a lever for personal political gain and whether the House will consider that grounds for impeachment.
Ukraine's independence from Moscow is on the line too.
If Trump hands Putin a win in Ukraine, deliberately or inadvertently, the Russian president's return from his investment in the 2016 U.S. election may well be greater than even he dared to dream.

Portland Early Music Festival offers polished performances

Texto completo: The Portland Conservatory of Music has only a few hundred students, but several of Portland's best musicians have an association with the school, and for concertgoers, it is a fount of varied, polished and inexpensive performances (including the free weekly Noonday Concerts). But its most crucial offerings have been a pair of brief but important annual festivals that explore different ends of music's historical spectrum - the Portland Early Music Festival, in October, and the Back Cove Contemporary Music Festival, in May.
This year, the school changed its plan, opting to present these weekend-long festivals on alternate years, rather than annually. As someone who was hoping to see both festivals expand - a week each would be a good start - I find this disappointing news. But then, it's miraculous for a school of this size to present as many concerts as it does.
On Friday evening, the eighth installment of the weekend-long Portland Early Music Festival got underway at Woodfords Congregational Church, with a program devoted mostly to vocal works by Claudio Monteverdi, with a pair of illuminating lute pieces by his contemporaries, Pietro Paolo Melii and Johannes Kapsberger.
The singers, who all live and work in Maine, though a few have national or international careers, were sopranos Jennifer Bates and Christine Letcher, mezzo-soprano Andrea Graichen, tenor Bruce Fithian, and basses John David Adams and Patrick Volker. Timothy Burris, who directs the festival (and also runs the Portland Early Music series at the Cathedral of St. Luke's), provided the spare lute accompaniments to the Monteverdi works, and gave fluid accounts of the solo lute pieces.
Though the program was short - it ran just over an hour, without intermission - it offered an appealing overview of Monteverdi's career as a madrigalist, the earliest works, "Lamento d'Ariana" and "Zefiro torna e'bel tempo" dating to the "Sixth Book of Madrigals" (1614), and the latest (the duet "Pur ti meo") from Monteverdi's last surviving opera, "L'incoronazione di Poppea" (1643).
Only the pair of works from the "Sixth Book of Madrigals" demanded the full ensemble, and in both, the voices were well-balanced, though not quite the homogenous readings recordings have made listeners accustomed to.
That's not to say that the performances were unpolished. The singers wove their vocal lines together beautifully, and they were clearly mindful of the passions expressed in the texts of these bittersweet love songs.
But the performance also raised an interesting historical question about what the sound of the 17th century really was. In the homogenous approach cultivated today, individual vocal distinctiveness is smoothed over, in favor of a velvety, inextricably unified ensemble sound. Generally, that style of sound is the province of permanent ensembles with the rehearsal time necessary to produce that level of tightly compressed ensemble singing.
As choral sound goes, it can be thoroughly seductive, particularly in richly harmonized works like Monteverdi's. But this music was composed for both court ensembles and cultivated amateurs to sing at home, in those days before recordings. So it seems likely that what most 17th century listeners heard was a more casual sound, closer in both texture and spirit to what the festival's singers produced on Friday. The ensemble's sound was solid, but not so suave that you could not easily focus on the singers' individual qualities.
Those qualities were estimable. Fithian, whom I've heard more frequently as a conductor (he directs the St. Mary Schola), harpsichordist and organist than as a singer, brought a pleasant timbre to his thoughtfully shaped tenor lines, and the basses, who are heard regularly as soloists from within Portland's choirs, gave the ensembles a firm foundation.
Several singers enjoyed a brighter spotlight, in pieces for smaller groups. In "Si doce Ã¨'l tormento," another lovesick soliloquy, Bates produced a flexible, richly expressive sound, inflected with only a hint of vibrato. She offered a different side of her artistry in the flightier, more assertive "Quel sguardo sdegnosetto."
Bates and Letcher were well-matched in "Zefiro torna e disoavi accenti," which opened the program, and she and Graichen gave a magnificent account of "Pur ti miro," the third act duet between Nero and Poppea, from "Incoronazione." That was a clear highlight of the program, although the account of "Lamento della Ninfa," by Bates, Fithian, Adams and Volker, was a strong contender.

Texto completo: Oh, Anonymous. ... we hardly knew ye.
This past week it was revealed that the unnamed senior official in the Trump administration who penned a controversial (and not entirely helpful) 2016 op-ed in The New York Times would be making an ever bigger non-name for him- or herself with the release of “A Warning" — billed as “an unprecedented behind-the-scenes portrait of the Trump presidency."
That original op-ed, titled, “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration," unpacked, to an ultimately unsatisfying extent, the “test" facing Trump and his presidency: “The dilemma — which he does not fully grasp —," wrote Whoever, “is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations."
Putting momentarily aside the irreparable damage already sustained by the word “many" under this president, and the likelihood that many of Trump's senior officials now spend their days searching indeed.com, the credibility of the Anonymous author was instantly declared iffy by many Times readers. Not to mention the revelations therein hardly qualified for that word: “Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails, he engages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back."
Jeez, tell us something we don't know. (Like your name. That would be good.)
And now, with the tease of “A Warning" — set to arrive in November unless a troupe of Freedom Caucus jokers blockade every Barnes & Noble location with a pizza party — the idea seems to be that this 272-page pot of piping-hot White House tea can simply no longer be contained, the urgency of its message demonstrated by its mode of delivery.
For as everyone knows, in the Internet age, if you want to get time-sensitive, newsworthy information out to a public who desperately needs it (i.e. a “warning"), your best move is taking a few months to write, promote, and publish an unsigned book. It's a no-brainer. And I mean that as non-figuratively as possible.
And while the blower of this particular whistle has confirmed through representation that a “substantial" amount of the book's royalties will be donated to the White House Press Correspondents' Association, the assured future generosity of Anonymous hasn't stopped the Internet from dragging his or her lack of a name through the mud.
It's no surprise that an ambiance of cowardice suffuses the White House and its ostensibly nervous knuckle-chewing denizens. What is surprising is that whoever made it to this height and wrote this book (oh, hey Kellyanne) still thinks anonymity carries some inherent clout or cachet. Those days are gone; buried in an unmarked grave.
Certainly, some of the allure that anonymity once enjoyed is a vestige of history — or, prehistory — when anonymity was the natural state of any mark clawed onto a cave wall, or pressed into a clay tablet, or scratched upon some scroll bearing tales that formerly only existed as speech.
And sure, anonymity in the American political sphere also has a rich history. As one tweeter pointed out, “Common Sense was published anonymously. The Federalist Papers were published under a shared pseudonym. Many of the Founding Fathers were publishing broadsides against one another from time to time under pseudonyms. It's as American as apple pie."
Even as recently as 1996, when Newsweek writer Joe Klein was unmasked (thanks to some crack handwriting analysis by the Washington Post) as the author of the controversial (and equally shrug-worthy) Clintonian portrait “Primary Colors," he went from “For God's sake, definitely I didn't write it" to “I felt that there are times when I've had to lie to protect a source, and I put this in that category" in the course of a few short months. It was an act of bravery , you see. Not its polar opposite.
So, yes, technically there's a through-line that connects “Beowulf" with that note left on your windshield informing you that you suck at parking.
But the Internet, with its billions of unnamed accounts and armies of social media snipers, has done a real number on anonymity. We've seen it weaponized into guerrilla activism, with the amorphous group Anonymous (and its ungoverned offshoots) maintaining the most name-recognition, if you can call it that. We've seen anonymity put to cruel use on now defunct apps like Secret, Yik Yak, and Sarahah — favorites of bullies who lacked the fortitude to bully.
And authors who opt to go nameless now find themselves on equal footing with the hordes of anonymous bots and trolls clogging Twitter, the faceless commenters who traffic in untraceable abuse, and an unknowable number of other consciously unaccountable weenies. (Looking directly at you and not breaking eye contact, Pierre Delecto.)
That is, hiding in the shadows is not a good look for an aspiring author — let alone a hero. (Ever read “Beowulf"?)

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- My first job in journalism was as a clerk at The Washington Star. I fielded a lot of calls from readers threatening to cancel their subscriptions -- including, on occasion, my mom.
I never got upset about it. Their loss, I figured. I know, because I prowl through at least eight newspapers a day, that I feel about 1,000 percent smarter and more interesting afterward.
I've always noticed a huge difference in leaders who read the news carefully, like Barack Obama, an avid New York Times reader, and those, like Donald Trump, who fail to feed their brains properly. The nasty Narcissus looks at the papers not to broaden himself but for the most narrow of reasons: to hunt for his own name and to search, largely in vain, for any scrap of positive coverage.
Trump cheerleader Tomi Lahren recently tweeted a picture proving that the White House staff is still artificially sweetening what they show the boss. The president sent Lahren a printout of tweets -- including hers -- praising him for his Dallas rally, compiled by his aides to reinforce Trump's reality distortion field.
President Snowflake had a pout this past week and canceled the White House subscriptions to The Times and The Washington Post. He probably thinks the papers are still delivered by boys in tweed news caps tossing them over the fence in the general direction of the West Wing.
Get those damn papers off my lawn!
Stephanie Grisham, Trump's press secretary, imperiously announced that the White House would also strong-arm federal agencies to end their subscriptions to the papers, noting that this would be "a significant cost saving" to taxpayers.
Not as much, of course, as if Trump stopped spending tens of millions on golf outings after savaging his predecessor for excessively hitting the links. Besides, taxpayers would probably be happy to spend the money on newspapers if the president would stop staring at his name and educate himself on the globe.
The enormity of his stupidity caused him to accomplish the impossible: He managed to bollix up America's Middle East policy even more, after we had already shattered the region through ignorance and arrogance.
In dropping The Times and The Post, the president came across like all those liberals on Twitter who bristle with cancelitis. They're always huffing away from our paper only to sneak back a few days later.
Trump's move is not without precedent.
As Michael Grynbaum reported in The Times, J.F.K. was widely mocked when he canceled The New York Herald Tribune and said he would read The St. Louis Post-Dispatch instead. After sneaking in copies of The Tribune for a while, President Kennedy resumed openly reading it.
The same will happen with Trump. He can't quit us. The relationship of Donald and the media is the greatest love affair -- and mutual addiction -- of all time. When he cancels subscriptions, it's like an angry lover tearing up pictures of a woman he is obsessed with but cannot win over.
Newspapers are liquid history, with deadlines pressing and people trying to pull the wool over our eyes. God knows, we're not perfect. But we're definitely better arbiters of objective reality than Donald Trump, Lindsey Graham, Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise.
Given the perverted values we've seen in other institutions, such as Facebook, the Catholic Church, the Bush-Cheney White House and the Trump White House, it feels good to be part of an institution that aims to illuminate rather than obscure.
Speaking of spin, I've got a push alert for Kellyanne Conway: No matter how many reporters you dress down, your tortured triangle with George and Donald is a real story. No one in Washington has seen anything like it since the days of Martha Mitchell.
So, Mr. President, given that you are shorn from The Times and The Post, I feel an obligation to fill you in on what you're missing:
You're about to be impeached.
Nancy Pelosi is kicking your butt.
The Deep State is not only out to get you; it's gotten you.
The Republicans on the Hill who tried to crash the hearing -- even though their fellow Republicans were taking part -- looked like fanatical losers. Matt Gaetz compared his stunt to the Spartans and the movie "300," but he's no Gerard Butler and his pizza party was lame.
Your long-suffering Republican allies/hostages are finally getting tired of having to defend you all the time.
You're canny about media. You know that you can't hurt The Times and The Post by having a childish fit of pique; that just sells more newspapers.
The only way you could cut the clicks is if you calmed down, behaved properly and acted like a decent human being, so that there weren't always 20 breaking news stories every day about your conspiring and grifting and lying and lunacy.
And there's no chance of that, because then all eyes wouldn't be on you.
You'll sneak back and you know it.

Texto completo: 1. The President did solicit interference. "I would like you to do us a favor," Mr. Trump said in his call with Mr. Zelensky of Ukraine, according to the White House account of the call. 2. Giuliani and Barr were involved. Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky that Attorney General William Barr and the president's personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani would call him. 3. There was reason for alarm. The inspector general for the intelligence agencies, Michael Atkinson, confirmed in a Sept. 9 letter to Congress that the whistle-blower's complaint "met the definition of an urgent concern." 4. Yes, that's what he said. "There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution ... so if you can look into it ... I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike. ... The server, they say Ukraine has it," Mr. Trump said in the call, citing a conspiracy theory about the 2016 election. "That whole nonsense ended ... they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible." 5. White House officials knew the call was problematic. Officials raised these concerns with the National Security Council's chief lawyer, John Eisenberg, The Washington Post reported. 6. This is not proved. This has not been confirmed. T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, State Department counselor, has been subpoenaed to testify before Congress on Nov. 6. 7. A transcript was put in a highly classified computer system. Administration officials told reporters that National Security Council lawyers decided to place it there. 8. They coordinated closely with the Ukrainians. "Assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington," Kurt Volker, the State Department's former special envoy to Ukraine, texted Mr. Zelensky's aide Andriy Yermak on July 25. 9. Giuliani told Ukrainians what needed to be done. "Rudy and Yermak ... are going to get together when Rudy goes to Madrid in a couple of weeks," Mr. Volker texted on July 22. Three days earlier he texted: "Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation." 10. Giuliani reached out to senior Ukrainian officials. "Bohdan ... told me that they had heard from Mr. Giuliani that the phone call between the two presidents was unlikely to happen," William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, said in his opening statement to House investigators. 11. Ukrainian officials did travel to Washington. Ms. Hill told Mr. Taylor that when Mr. Yermak and another Ukrainian official met at the White House with the then-National Security Adviser John Bolton and others, Gordon Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, "had connected 'investigations' with an Oval Office meeting for President Zelenskyy, which so irritated Ambassador Bolton that he abruptly ended the meeting," Mr. Taylor said in his statement. 12. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was summarily recalled. "After being asked ... in early March to extend my tour until 2020, I was then abruptly told in late April to come back ... 'on the next plane' ... I met with the Deputy Secretary of State, who informed me of the curtailment of my term," Ms. Yovanovitch testified. 13. Yuriy Lutsenko, a Ukrainian prosecutor, undercut the ambassador. "The U.S. government chose to remove an Ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives," Ms. Yovanovitch testified. 14. Trump officials worried about Giuliani's behavior. Ms. Hill testified that Mr. Bolton said, "Giuliani's a hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up." 15. A White House meeting depended on Ukrainian political aid. In a July 10 meeting, Mr. Sondland said there was an agreement that Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump would meet at the White House if Ukraine began investigations sought by the White House, Ms. Hill testified. According to Mr. Taylor, an N.S.C. official, Tim Morrison, said, "Ambassador Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the security assistance money would not come until President Zelenskyy committed to pursue the Burisma investigation." 16. The administration turns colder toward Ukraine. Mr. Taylor said that in mid-August, he asked Mr. Morrison "if there had been a change in policy of strong support for Ukraine, to which he responded, 'it remains to be seen.' He also told me during this call that the 'President doesn't want to provide any assistance at all."' 17. More about the highly classified server. See No. 7. The Times reported on Sept. 27 that records of calls Mr. Trump made with President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia have also been put in that system. 18. Ukraine aid is frozen. In a video-conference call on July 18, Mr. Taylor said, "I heard a staff person from the Office of Management say ... her boss had instructed her not to approve any additional spending of security assistance for Ukraine until further notice." 19. The aid freeze was ordered by the President. "All that the OMB staff person said," according to Mr. Taylor, "was that the directive had come from the President."

Romney reflects on missing out on secretary of state: 'I would not have lasted as long as Rex Tillerson'

Texto completo: Sen. Mitt Romney commended President Trump on selecting someone other than him to be his secretary of state, joking that he may not have lasted more than a few weeks.
“The best personnel decision he made was not choosing me,” the Utah Republican told the New York Times.
“I would not have lasted as long as Rex Tillerson, and maybe a little longer than Anthony Scaramucci did,” he added, referring respectively to Trump’s first secretary of state and the White House communications director who was fired less than two weeks on the job.
Trump considered Romney to be the administration’s top diplomat, even though he was one of the president’s harshest critics during the 2016 presidential campaign. As payback for the criticism, Trump, who endorsed Romney in the 2012 election against President Barack Obama, has called Romney a “pompous ass” and said he should be impeached.
Romney’s wife, Ann, said her husband would have accepted the secretary of state job had Trump offered it to him instead of Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil.

Romney, 72, said in 2017 that he had even consulted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about the job.

Paul Krugman: The day the Trump boom died

Texto completo: Last spring, Donald Trump and the people around him probably thought they had a relatively clear path to reelection.
On one side, it looked as if Trump had weathered the threat of politically fatal scandal. The much-awaited Mueller report on Russian election intervention had landed with a dull thud; the details were damning, but it had basically no political impact.
At the same time, Trump was convinced that he could run on the basis of a booming economy. Never mind that his claims to have run up the best economic record in human history were easily refuted; the reality seemed good enough to sell as a big success story.
What a difference a few months make.
Everyone is following the impeachment story, and I don’t have much to add, except a warning: At every stage of this process, Republicans have proved willing to engage in stunningly bad behavior. Did anyone foresee Wednesday’s physical attempt to disrupt the House inquiry? The point is that as the net closes in, the GOP response is likely to be uglier than you can possibly imagine.
What’s getting less attention, understandably, is the way the Trump economic narrative is falling apart.
To be fair, the overall state of the economy is still pretty good. Unemployment is very low and job growth is continuing. And while there will eventually be a nationwide recession — the business cycle has not been abolished — it’s not at all clear that we’ll have one before next year’s election.
However, important parts of the economy are lagging. Manufacturing production is down over the past year; combined with weakness in shipping and very hard times in agriculture, around a fifth of the economy is effectively in recession. In particular, manufacturing employment has been falling in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, states that chose Trump by tiny margins in 2016, giving him a win in the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote.
And overall growth, while still positive, is definitely slowing: “nowcasts,” which use partial data to estimate what official economic data will say when it’s eventually released, suggest an economy growing at an unimpressive annual rate of less than 2%. Since elections turn more on the economy’s growth rate than on things like the level of unemployment — unemployment was still more than 7% when Ronald Reagan won his 1984 landslide — this is not good news for Republicans.
Probably even more significant, there has been a dramatic decline, almost a collapse, in business confidence.
You can see this collapse several ways. One is through surveys of business executives, who spent Trump’s first two years being very bullish, but have now become remarkably pessimistic.
You can also see it in the bond market, a much better indicator of economic expectations than the stock market. Long-term interest rates tend to be high when investors expect a booming economy, in which the Fed will tighten money to head off inflation; they tend to be low when investors expect protracted economic weakness and easy money as far as the eye can see.
And 10-year bond rates have plunged, from more than 3% last year to 1.75% as I write this. The last time we saw this kind of plunge was 2010-11, when investors finally realized that recovery from the Great Recession was going to be slow and painful, not a repeat of “morning in America.”
So what happened to the Trump boom? The collapse in confidence began late last year, when it became clear that Trump was serious about waging trade war on China; it continued as evidence accumulated that the 2017 tax cut was a big fizzle, doing basically nothing to boost business investment and providing at most a brief sugar high to overall growth.
But the truth is that even pessimists expected the tax cut to do more good, and the trade war less harm, than they did. Why have things turned out so poorly? One answer, to which I’ve subscribed, is that in addition to its direct impacts on U.S. exports and businesses that rely on Chinese suppliers, the trade war has created damaging uncertainty. Businesses that rely on global supply chains won’t invest for fear that the trade war will get even worse; but businesses that might move in to replace imports also won’t invest for fear that Trump will eventually back down.
I suspect, however, that there’s even more to the story. Business interests spent a long time in denial, but now even they are facing up to the reality that Trump and his team are very strange people who have no idea what they’re doing — and the uncertainty that reality implies.
I mean, considering that trade confrontation with China is the centerpiece of Trump’s economic policy, it’s not reassuring to learn that his trade war czar, Peter Navarro, has an imaginary friend — a source named “Ron Vara” whom he has repeatedly cited in his books, but who doesn’t exist, and whose name is in fact just an anagram of “Navarro.”
Next year’s election should be about Trump’s betrayal of his oath of office. Realistically, however, it also matters that the economy probably won’t be his friend.

Women across the country get an unwanted surprise in the mail from Utah company: You’re pregnant! (They’re not.)

Texto completo: Chelcie Gette’s mother called her early Tuesday to tell her she had gotten something in the mail. The two went on FaceTime and opened it together. “It was a cute little card congratulating me for my soon-to-be baby,” Gette, 27, said.
There was one hiccup. “I knew I was not pregnant, so it was very confusing,” Gette said. “My mom thought this was my way of telling her I was pregnant!”
It’s likely that thousands of women across the country in their mid-20s to early 30s received such a package this week: correspondence from a stranger congratulating them on their pregnancy, along with several gift cards for baby products. Many of the women who received it, though, weren’t pregnant.
The card was purple and had a cartoon avocado with a heart over its pit. It read: “Holy guacamole! You’re going to avo baby!” Inside was what looked like a handwritten note, signed with a heart from “Jenny B.” It said: “Congratulations!!! I’m so excited for you! I hope you like these.” Included were a handful of coupons, five gift cards that amounted to $245 and a receipt proving their value.
Lena Ghamrawi, a 27-year-old lawyer who lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, said she opened her own card when she got home from work Wednesday. She is a policy counsel at Future of Privacy Forum, a think tank in Washington focused on issues of data privacy, and also is not pregnant. Thinking it may have been a gift from a friend who mistakenly thought she was pregnant, Ghamrawi began searching her phone contacts for a Jenny B.
“Once I ruled that out, I thought, ‘OK, maybe it’s a group that’s against Planned Parenthood that’s trolling people’ — because I did make a donation recently to them,” she said.
When she fell short, she searched on Google and quickly came across a Reddit thread in which dozens of women said they had received the same package. Many warned against using the gift cards — it was all an elaborate scheme, they said.
But the gift cards are real. So is Jenny B.
The letters were a flawed direct mail marketing campaign for Mothers Lounge, a wholesale mother and baby product distributor with several brands, based in Pleasant Grove, Utah. Its products range from baby slings to car seat covers, breast pads and baby leggings. Jenny Bosco and her husband, Kaleb Pierce, started the company in 2005, according to public records.
In a statement, Scott Anderson, director of marketing at Mothers Lounge, called the outreach “heartfelt.”
Why had these women received the mailings? “The qualified recipients for this mailer have, at one point, subscribed to an opt-in list for maternity deals and coupons through a third party marketing company,” Anderson said. “All information from third party companies is only used internally for Mothers Lounge and is not sold or used for anything else other than the direct marketing of Mothers Lounge.”
The initiative did not go over so well with some of the “qualified recipients.” Some women — the exact number who received the mailings is unknown — grew suspicious when they couldn’t find a return address. Additionally, many reported that when they tried calling the toll-free number on the cards, the line went unanswered.
And then there were the gifts themselves. “The gift card does ‘work,’ but you still owe a small amount for shipping,” Gette, a musician in Nashville, Tennessee, said. “You would have to enter your credit card number for that.”
This isn’t the first time the company has sent out these cards. In February, they set off enough alarm bells for the Surry County sheriff’s office in Virginia that it posted a “scam alert” on Facebook. But the next day, Capt. Jayson Crawley received a call from someone who said he was Ben Pierce from Mothers Lounge. Pierce told him the mailers were not fake but a “promotional advertisement.”
Gette said the marketing attempt was flawed in that it came off as “predatory.”
Although the advances in targeting of digital advertising allow marketers to better identify their audiences, such efforts are not always totally successful. Identifying nonpregnant women as pregnant seems about as unsuccessful as possible.
Eric Anderson, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said that for decades companies have shared and sold consumer data for these purposes.
“Any time you buy something, you are allowing your name to be shared,” Anderson said. “It’s a quid pro quo — they share your information out to the pool, and by doing that, they get to request names themselves.”
Based on purchases, a company can make an assumption of attributes and interests of the customer in order to better target their product. The Mothers Lounge’s technique was unusual and in bad judgment, Anderson said.
“Of all the things you can target things on, this is on the list of things you should probably avoid,” he said.
The Better Business Bureau has given the company an F rating, according to a spokeswoman, and has published a warning about the company’s promotional mailings.
Halen Hall-Chisler’s letter was sent to her parents’ house in Marietta, Ohio. Last year Hall-Chisler, who is 26, had an abortion. That caused a rift in her relationship with her mother.
Receiving the congratulatory package made her feel uncomfortable. “It was a little scary,” said Hall-Chisler, who works in a doughnut shop in Portland, Maine. “Especially in my circumstance, it was addressed to me with a name I don’t normally go by, and not a lot of people know that is my first name.”
Claire Jiang, 24, said she had received a frantic text from her father asking if she was pregnant. Embarrassed, Jiang, who is an architect in New York, emphatically denied the accusation.
But she was nonetheless confused as to why she would have been on the mailing list. The only explanation, she thought, was that she had purchased a baby gift for a friend last year. But even then, she was not living at her parents’ address at the time.
Not nearly ready to start a family, Jiang was perplexed that she was the target demographic. Her first reaction was to say to her father: “Can you just throw them away? I don’t want to think about this.”
“What this is is a deceptive marketing practice,” said Ghamrawi, who planned to file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. “What this company is doing is assuming highly sensitive, personal information about me in a really intrusive way.”
The company risked sending the letters to women who were dealing with infertility or who had recently had a miscarriage. There was the possibility, Ghamrawi said, for all manner of unintended consequences, including family violence.
“If you think about the implications, it’s really irresponsible,” Ghamrawi said.

Texto completo: Carl Safina, 64, an ecologist at Stony Brook University on Long Island and a MacArthur “genius” grant winner, has written nine books about the human connection to the animal world. Coming next spring is “Becoming Wild,” on the culture of animals, and a young adult version of “Beyond Words,” on the capabilities of dogs and wolves.
We spoke over lunch in his Long Island garden, surrounded by his three dogs, some wild squirrels and a group of extremely tame hens. An edited and condensed version of our conversation follows.
Q: When a writer for the Sierra Club’s magazine recently put the words “animal” and “cognition” into Google Scholar, he was directed to almost 200,000 citations published in the past five years. Why the explosion of interest in this scientific area?
A: I think it’s happened because in recent years we’ve come to know much more about the inner activity of nonhuman minds.
We have tools today that didn’t exist 50 or even 10 years ago. There are researchers putting dogs into MRIs, and so it’s become possible to watch their brains do things. What we’re learning is that animals do have felt experiences and thus, I think, consciousness.
Q: What’s your definition of consciousness?
A: To me, consciousness is the thing that feels like something. It’s the sensation of experiencing the input from your sense organs. We’re learning that a lot of animals - dogs, elephants, other primates - have it.
Q: How else has research on animal behavior improved?
A: Well, until the 1950s and the 1960s, the study of animal behavior wasn’t seen as real science. Until Jane Goodall, Iain Douglas-Hamilton and George Schaller began publishing, there were few studies. They were among the first to watch wild animals for the purpose of describing their behavior. Before, if you wanted to study elephants, you shot them and pulled their molars out to see how old they were.
Thanks to these pioneers, we’ve learned that wild animals do complicated things. Many recognize the individuals around them - even solitary animals, like mountain lions. There usually is a male mountain lion with a large territory who visits a few females inhabiting the territory. The females all know each other. The adjacent males know who their neighbors are.
Who knew that dolphins could recognize each other after a long separation? Yet, scientists report that there was a dolphin in an aquarium who hadn’t seen another captive dolphin in 20 years. When they were reunited, there was immediate recognition.
Frans de Waal’s latest book, “Mama’s Last Hug,” chronicles the emotional deathbed reunion of an aged zoo chimpanzee and primatologist Jan van Hooff, who had worked with her for many years. Though Mama is listless, when van Hooff approaches her after a long separation, she recognizes him and reaches out to touch him.
Chimpanzees, dolphins, elephants - they’ve all demonstrated signs of recognizing individuals. Videos show that their recognition is not mechanical, not a chemical match with a stored memory bank. It is often accompanied by shows of emotion, which proves to me that the experience is felt.
Q: Has the internet widened our understanding of the animal world?
A: I’d say so. Almost everyone nowadays has a video camera on them all the time, and animal behaviors get recorded that we haven’t seen before. The other day, someone sent me a video where someone was backing up their car and a puppy went behind it. Another dog came streaking out at high speed, snatching the puppy away.
Thanks to the ubiquity of these videos, we’re seeing evidence that the envelope of what animals can do is much bigger than we thought. That leads me to wonder: Why, despite increasing evidence, do some people deny that animals have emotions or feel pain?
Q: What’s your guess?
A: I think it’s because it’s easier to hurt them if you think of them as dumb brutes. Not long ago, I was on a boat with some nice people who spear swordfish for a living. They sneak up to swordfish sleeping near the surface of the water and harpoon them, and then the fish just go crazy and kind of explode. When I asked, “Do the fish feel pain?” the answer was, “They don’t feel anything.”
Now, it’s been proven experimentally that fish feel pain. I think they feel, at least, panic. They clearly are not having a good time when they are hooked. But if you think of yourself as a good person, you don’t want to believe you’re causing suffering. It’s easier to believe that there’s no pain.
Q: As a child, did you have pets?
A: I did. I spent my first 10 years in Brooklyn, where I had the kind of pets you’d buy in a store - a parakeet, little turtles.
From the time I was 7, I had homing pigeons. I learned about life, with a capital “L,” from them. The pigeons figured out who they were going to mate with. They’d be out flying around during the day and they’d come home, feed their babies and go to sleep. Watching them go about their lives, you saw them do a lot of the things that humans do. It was there right in front of your eyes.
Then, I went to college, and I learned that my childhood observations were not allowed. They were “anthropomorphic.” But the more I see of the new neuroscience and neurochemistry, I see a lot of overlap. All of life is literally kin. I first learned that from my Brooklyn pigeons.
Q: You live with three dogs. What have you learned from them?
A: Among things, that they are capable of anticipation. For instance, they show much excitement when I simply touch my car keys, which might well signal that they are going to some place interesting, like the beach. That proves that they have imagination and even memory.
Another thing - and this shouldn’t surprise - they can be quite emotional. Some years ago, I lived with someone with a dog. Before we broke up, we argued a lot. Once, we took her dog to the beach, and we started bickering there. That dog just basically collapsed into a pile of leaves and would not get up. She did not want to be with us. And we weren’t even yelling at her. She just did not want to be a part of an unhappy scene.
That showed me that they can have a real-time valuation of their experiences. They know what they prefer to avoid.
Q: The psychologist who puts dogs into MRIs, Dr. Gregory Berns, wrote a book in 2013 titled “How Dogs Love Us.” Do you think your dogs do?
A: That’s easy. Yes. And I don’t need to scan their brain activity to know this. They show it in their actions and the choices they make. Our dogs sleep on the floor in our bedroom just to be near us.
We’ve never given them any treats in that room. The only thing they get for the effort of climbing the stairs is proximity to us. At dawn, two of the three jump on the bed. Jude, the third, has a knee problem, and he can’t. When we wake up, it’s always all tongues and tails and “Oh happy day!”
During the day, they roam free in the house and the yard. If I’m writing or working outside, they’re never more than a hundred feet from me. That’s their choice.
My point is that they seek us out just to be near us. And what is love’s fundamental emotion? It’s the desire to be near loved ones. So yes, dogs can love their humans.

Khan Academy founder inspires Hawaii teachers at conference

Texto completo: Salman Khan, a former hedge fund analyst, started tutoring his cousin by phone in 2004 when she was 12 years old and struggling in math.
Soon other relatives wanted his long-distance help. Khan began making short, lively videos to walk them through whatever concept was stumping them. He put them on YouTube, and before long, people who weren’t family members started tuning in to the minilessons.
Today, Khan Academy, a free educational website, attracts 19 million learners a month from Maine to Mongolia, including Hawaii. Based in Mountain View, Calif., the nonprofit has users in nearly every country in the world, accessing videos and curriculum in 40 languages. It was built with the help of 14,000 volunteers and is philanthropically funded, fueled by donations.
“It’s all not for profit, no one owns Khan Academy and it’s all for free,” the founder and CEO told local educators in a keynote speech at the recent Schools of the Future Conference at the Hawai‘i Convention Center. “It’s completely noncommercial. … Our mission is to cover all the core subjects, from pre-K all the way to college.”
The lessons at Khan Academy allow learners to work at their own pace with no stigma, he said. In classrooms, students might not master every skill on time, but teachers usually have to move instruction forward on a set schedule, leaving some kids with gaps in understanding.
“Those gaps accumulate,” Khan said, particularly in math. “A lot of kids hit a wall in algebra class. It’s not because they are not bright; it’s because of those little gaps.”
His cousin, for example, had convinced herself she was no good at math, but after a bit of targeted long-distance help, she moved from a remedial class to an advanced one in her New Orleans school.
In the early days, messages from grateful strangers who stumbled upon his videos gave Khan motivation to keep going with the project.
“I had a mother say both her sons had a learning disability, and because of this content they were able to keep up with their class,” he said. “She told me she and her family were praying for me every night.”
He decided to quit his day job to found Khan Academy in 2008, relying on his wife’s income. “Remember,” he said by way of explanation, “I was an analyst in a hedge fund — I was not used to people praying for me.”
More than 2,100 educators from across the state attended the Schools of the Future Conference, Oct. 3-4, which featured numerous speakers and about 150 breakout sessions. It was sponsored by the Hawaii Association of Independent Schools, Department of Education, Pillars of Peace Hawaii and Hawaii Society for Technology in Education.
Some attendees had heard of Khan Academy and used it with their students, while others were discovering it for the first time.
“There were points during his talk that I cried,” said Tracy Jones, a sixth grade teacher at August Ahrens School in Waipahu.“The kids were so excited about their learning. I had heard of Khan but never really explored it. At the first break I just jumped on there and signed up.”
Her colleague Janelle Bailey, who teaches first grade, agreed: “I was definitely inspired by his speech, and to see the different types of children that’s he’s reaching across the world is amazing.”
Children such as a girl from halfway across the world who posted a cheery video message that Khan showed conferees. “I am Zaya from Mongolia,” she said. “Your videos are so interesting and funny. Make more lessons.”
Khan said he assumed she was upper middle class since her English was quite good and she had internet access. But he found out otherwise.
“It turns out there was a group of volunteers from Cisco Systems who were using their vacation time to go to Mongolia and set up computer labs with internet in orphanages,” Khan said. “Zaya was one of those orphans.”
“What’s been even more incredible since then is that Zaya has graduated from high school and she’s become the top contributor to Khan Academy in the Mongolian language,” he said.
Khan Academy’s ultimate goal is to offer a “free, world-class education to anyone anywhere,” but rather than replacing teachers, it offers tools for students as well as educators, according to its founder.
“If students can get micro-tutorials in their own time and pace, it frees up the classroom to go deeper, for Socratic dialogue, to do peer-to-peer instruction,” he said.
Vice Principal William Olk of Central Middle School in downtown Honolulu said his school uses Khan Academy in algebra classes and for small-group instruction. Central’s principal, Anne Marie Murphy, asked Khan to consider adding some content in Chuukese.
“The majority of our children at our school are Micronesian and speak Chuukese,” Olk said. “He had not even heard of it, so he’s going to look into it, which is exciting.”
Today, major donors to Khan Academy include the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, Bank of America, College Board and the Omidyar Fund. When Bill Gates’ representative first reached out to him, Khan recalls, “they were surprised that I was one guy operating out of my house.”
Today the Khan Academy team spans the globe.
“I get disproportionate credit for it,” Khan said. “We have over 200 full-time folks in our offices, a lot of current and ex-teachers, engineers, designers helping make this happen. We’ve had tens of thousands of teachers … helping us implement this, learning what works, what doesn’t work. There’s hundreds of thousands of people who’ve donated.”
One of his favorite success stories is a girl from Afghanistan named Sultana. When the Taliban took over her village, she was forbidden from going to school. Her brother gave her a computer with internet access, and she began learning English, then moved on to math and physics with help from Khan Academy.
She decided she wanted to become a physics researcher in the United States, and an online friend in Iowa advised her to take the SAT and try for a scholarship. But the exam isn’t offered in Afghanistan.
“She lies to her parents and smuggles herself across the border from Afghanistan to Pakistan, one of the most dangerous borders in the world, a 30-hour journey, just to take the SAT,” Khan recounted. “She does shockingly well for someone who frankly never had any formal schooling.”
New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof spotlighted her case in a 2016 column that helped Sultana gain political asylum in the United States. She is now studying quantum computing but keeps a low profile because she fears for the safety of her family back home, Khan said.
“So if any of you have 16-year-olds who are complaining about having to get up on a Saturday morning,” he told teachers at the conference, “tell them this story.”

Texto completo: David Brooks decides that a "bad option is better than a suicidal one" and would vote for Ms. Warren. Readers offer their reactions.
To the Editor:
Re "If It's Trump vs. Warren, Then What?" (column, Oct. 18):
David Brooks makes some excellent points. As a Republican, I favor many of President Trump's actions, such as tariffs on China and border controls. But as an American, I cannot bear any more of his juvenile nonsense. I would rather almost anyone else as the next president, including (gasp!) Elizabeth Warren.
The best thing would be to impeach and remove this president, well before the election, so that the Republicans have an opportunity to put up a candidate who could continue some of Mr. Trump's policies without his ridiculous and dangerous actions and those very silly tweets. I have had enough of this.
Robert Hackenburg
Mastic, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Dear Mr. Brooks,
It may not be as nerve-racking as you think to vote for Elizabeth Warren. Just remember, the newly elected President Warren will still have to go through Congress to enact her ultraprogressive programs. For example, at the end of the legislative sausage-making we'll wind up with "Warrencare" just as President Obama wound up with Obamacare, a watered-down version of his original idea, but way better than what we had before. And so it will go with all of Ms. Warren's very aspirational plans.
Isn't it great that our Constitution's framers set up three branches of government? I do love our system.
Catherine Clark
Summerland Key, Fla.
To the Editor:
David Brooks analyzes the dilemma facing reasonable Democrats perfectly. I am reminded that in an early debate the moderator noted that since former Representative John Delaney (standing next to Elizabeth Warren) has a net worth of over $ 50 million, he would have to pay Ms. Warren's proposed wealth tax. Immediately, Ms. Warren is seen rubbing her hands together with a big smile.
This was clearly meant as a joke, but Republicans will run this clip throughout the campaign, claiming, "Warren is greedy; she wants to raise your taxes." The point that she would not raise everyone's taxes would unfortunately be lost.
She may mean well, but with these types of mannerisms and her argumentative style, I don't believe she can be elected.
James E. McNulty
Boca Raton, Fla.
The writer is a professor of finance at Florida Atlantic University.
To the Editor:
Elizabeth Warren's policies may seem radical within the American political spectrum, but they are standard, centrist course for most stable and moderately responsible democracies throughout the world. Whether it's a responsible climate plan, sane gun restrictions, or equitable solutions to health care or student debt, most functioning democracies are already inhabiting this "far left" universe.

Texto completo: What is happening at the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board should alarm everyone. The Trump administration is eroding its independence.
In Washington, they often say that personnel is policy. When the president appoints someone to lead and staff a department, agency or board, that is often the surest way for him to control it.
By that rule of thumb, what is happening at the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board -- the body tasked with auditing the auditors -- should alarm the investing public and anyone who cares about objective and experienced oversight of the audit profession.
President Trump's appointed chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, this month announced that he had replaced a well-regarded and experienced member of the accounting board, Kathleen Hamm, with Rebekah Goshorn Jurata, a policy aide and Republican political regular who had been serving on Mr. Trump's National Economic Council.
In addition, Mr. Clayton has placed S.E.C. Commissioner Hester Peirce, a regulation skeptic, in charge of coordination efforts with the board -- a signal that the S.E.C. is seeking to pull it into its efforts to weaken requirements for audits of internal controls at public companies. These requirements have proved to be an effective bulwark against sloppiness and fraud, saving the investing public hundreds of millions of dollars.
In these two moves, Chairman Clayton demonstrates far too much political deference to the White House.
The P.C.A.O.B.'s work deserves to be overseen by independent experts -- the stakes are too great to have even one seat on the board occupied by someone who lacks the requisite experience or insight.
For example, all five board members should have direct experience with the audit process -- whether as auditors themselves or as members of an audit committee -- or meaningful work drafting and rolling out securities regulation. Ms. Jurata's qualifications are chiefly political. Ms. Hamm, the commissioner she will replace, had not only the requisite experience for the role but also significant understanding of cybersecurity issues -- an emerging and critical area of weakness in our nation's securities regulation. Now that portfolio may go unfilled.
As with other independent agencies and functions within the federal government, even politically appointed leaders like Chairman Clayton must always weigh political loyalties against the mission of the agency they are sworn to lead.
In the case of the P.C.A.O.B., this is a relatively little-known agency tasked with an awesome responsibility: to bring some measure of accountability to a profession whose work is not only at the core of our free market system but also requires oversight and correction. After all, the Big Four audit firms still make mistakes -- the deficiency rate of their audits inspected by the P.C.A.O.B. is roughly 30 percent, according to accounting board figures reviewed by a former S.E.C. chief accountant, Lynn Turner.
Remember, the P.C.A.O.B. was set up in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom auditing disasters. Before the board's creation in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, there was little oversight of the audit profession at all. Auditors fought its creation and settled for it as an alternative to outright government oversight of the profession. The P.C.A.O.B. is a hybrid: It is a private-sector, self-funded (through fees paid by audited companies) nonprofit. And in the end, the S.E.C. has to approve any regulations approved by the accounting board.
That's a lot of political oversight for a nonpolitical board, and even so, the auditing profession has sought to check the P.C.A.O.B.'s powers, as it did in 2012, as the board's chairman at the time, James Doty, cited auditor quality problems following the 2007-09 financial crisis.
Chairman Clayton of the S.E.C. is weakening the accounting board at a particularly critical time: Even sophisticated venture capital and private equity investors are regularly surprised by the shoddy practices at pre-I.P.O. companies they oversee closely, like WeWork. What chance do ordinary investors have if auditor quality is not checked closely?
The P.C.A.O.B. is the only body that has the power to force auditors to explain their work and justify their findings. In our market system, investors have to trust that the independent auditor is truly independent -- and the accounting board must enforce that standard.
Yet the P.C.A.O.B. is doing less oversight and inspection work than it once did, and key positions at the agency are unfilled. Morale is reportedly low.
And then there's the more prosaic but no less important work of the board. Members of the auditing profession would love nothing more than to see their P.C.A.O.B. audit quality inspections get a little softer and more deferential. They wouldn't mind having a friendlier ear on the board when it comes to patching up the holes that the P.C.A.O.B.'s inspectors expose -- what is called the remediation process. They would love to have a solid majority of board members ready to vote on any new carve-out of audit requirements for companies that have a good story to tell (except when it comes to their income statements).
In short, what's at risk isn't a specific regulatory function of the P.C.A.O.B.; it's the independence and the credibility of the board and its staff as a whole. If the Trump White House's goal is to strip the P.C.A.O.B. of its power, it doesn't have to write new rules or pass new laws. It has only to nominate board members who don't want to exercise the power they have. That's all it takes -- and I worry it's happening right before our very eyes.
Mr. Levitt was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1993 to 2001.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Facebook officially launched its new News tab service on Friday and created new controversy by revealing that Breitbart News will be among the news outlets contributing to its latest foray into online news publication.
"Given that Facebook is putting actual news outlets in the same category as Breitbart, actual news outlets should consider quickly withdrawing from the program," said Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America, a liberal nonprofit media watchdog.
At an event in New York launching the project, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended Breitbart's inclusion: "You want to include a breadth of content to make sure all different topics can be covered."
Other participants include The Washington Post, the New York Times, News Corp. , BuzzFeed News, Business Insider, Bloomberg News, Fox News, NBCUniversal, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.
Breitbart was founded by ring-wing commentator Andrew Breitbart in 2007, and it gained a reputation over the years for championing fringe causes. Its former executive chairman was Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to President Trump.
Word that Breitbart is among the outlets whose work will be included in Facebook's new News tab is likely only to heighten criticism about the way Facebook responds to political issues. In recent weeks, the website has been lambasted for policies that critics say allow politicians to lie in their ads and do not require that clearly false material posted on the platform be removed.
The new controversy came on a day intended to mark a new chapter in the relationship between news outlets and the behemoth tech platforms that historically have not paid for the journalistic content they republish. As part of its News tab, Facebook has agreed to compensate at least some news organizations as part of a specialized feature meant to steer users toward curated national and local news stories.
The News tab marks the latest iteration of Facebook's approach to online news. Before January 2018, the company had been a leading distributor of news, but that role was dogged by the presence in its news feed of false and misleading information, as well as by allegations that its news feed and other features tilted toward liberal viewpoints. So last year the company shifted its focus to promote posts from users' friends and family members, but the revamped news feed also hurt traffic for many news outlets that had tailored their offerings to appeal to Facebook's audience.
Zuckerberg did not go into specifics about how different publishers would be compensated, and media analysts expressed skepticism that the arrangement will help the small and medium-size local outlets that have been most seriously undercut by the rise of online news distribution.
"The vast majority of local news outlets are not included, and that is part of the news ecosystem that's most at risk," said David Chavern, the president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, a trade association of news publishers.
Chavern called Facebook's agreement to pay at least some news outlets for their content a step in the right direction, noting that tech platforms have been "uniquely unwilling to pay for news and quality journalism."
It was unclear whether other platforms would follow Facebook. In a statement, Google spokeswoman Maggie Shiels said the company had worked "for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to publishers world wide."
"Every month we send more than 24 [billion] clicks to publishers websites," she said. "This content discovery adds up to real business value for publishers." She added that publishers that use Google's tools to monetize content receive 70 percent of ad revenue and 85 to 95 percent of subscription revenue, depending on the platform.
In June, a study by the News Media Alliance found that Google reaped an estimated $4.7 billion of revenue in 2018 from scraping news publishers' content - without paying the publishers for that use. The study found that news is a key driver of user engagement on Google's products.
Meanwhile, the news industry has taken massive hits from declines in print advertising and competition from digital platforms for online ad revenue.
The News tab is available to more than 200,000 Facebook users in the United States, with a broader rollout planned for early next year. The new service, Facebook executives say, should make it easier for users to find the day's major headlines and stories tailored to specific topics or locales.
The initiative could reach 20 million to 30 million people over a few years, Zuckerberg said, and will eventually include a wider set of local and international publishers. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the decision to pay some publishers was unlikely to revive the news industry fully.
Zuckerberg also insisted that the team of journalists curating Facebook News' top stories will not shy away from critical coverage of him or Facebook.

Texto completo: Retired four-star general Barry McCaffrey condemned the White House for canceling subscriptions to the Washington Post and the New York Times.
On Wednesday, President Trump directed the White House to cancel subscriptions to the publications due to their coverage of his administration.
"All these people doing it for the New York Times, which is a fake newspaper, we don’t even want it in the White House anymore. We’re gonna probably terminate that and the Washington Post. They’re fake," Trump said.
On Thursday, Trump instructed other federal agencies to follow suit and terminate their subscriptions to the two newspapers as well.
McCaffrey called Trump’s decision a “watershed moment” for the United States and compared the president to Benito Mussolini, saying, "This is deadly serious. This is Mussolini."
Tweet
Mussolini, a fascist, used the press to push propaganda and censored unflattering reports while leading Italy prior to World War II.
McCaffrey served in President Bill Clinton’s administration and was director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

Facebook Chief Mark Zuckerberg Urges Tech Rivals to Pay for News; Social giant launches news service featuring array of news outlets and pays to license content

Texto completo: Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the social-media giant's decision to pay media outlets who participate in its news service will give a much-needed boost to the publishing industry and provides a model other internet companies should follow.
Multiple major news publishers from the Washington Post to Fox News to The Wall Street Journal have signed on to the service, which launched Friday with a limited test audience of 200,000 users in the U.S. and will be rolled out more broadly early next year.
Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook's service could have a positive impact on big and small publishers alike, but can't solve the media industry's deep woes on its own.
"I think every internet platform has a responsibility to help fund and support news," he said at an event in New York where he discussed the service with Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp, which owns the Journal. "Hopefully others will follow the model we are helping to set up."
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think this effort by Facebook will help counteract the misinformation that spreads on its platform? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
BuzzFeed editor in chief Ben Smith said Facebook's licensing strategy "is part of a really positive trend that will put a lot of pressure on Google and others to pay publishers."
In a statement, a spokeswoman for Alphabet Inc.'s Google said the company already plays a key role in helping news outlets monetize online content through the traffic its search engine sends to their sites and revenue generated through Google's ad platforms, which most publishers rely on.
"Every month we send more than 24 billion clicks to publishers' websites," the statement said. "Publishers around the world can use Google tools for monetizing their content, and when they do, they receive over 70% of the ad revenue."
Facebook has said it plans to include news from as many as 200 publications, although many won't receive licensing fees, the Journal has reported . Among those that are paid, the fees may vary considerably. In its discussions ahead of the launch, Facebook had offered hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for smaller publishers, a few million for bigger ones, and substantially more for the very largest outlets, according to people familiar with those talks.
The move to pay for news comes as the big tech platforms have come under growing regulatory scrutiny. Google has resisted paying publishers but recently announced changes to how it ranks stories on its news page to better promote original content, addressing another long-running complaint from publishers.
The new service marked a key shift, said Mr. Thomson, who has been sharply critical of Facebook and Google in the past for issues including their opaque algorithms, digital advertising dominance and for not paying for news on their platforms.
"Great journalism will only be sustainable at scale if there is a fundamental change in the landscape like this," he said. Mr. Thomson said Facebook's move was "a powerful precedent that will echo around editorial departments."
News Corp's deal with Facebook—which covers the New York Post and Dow Jones publications such as The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch and Barron's—will generate fees reaching into the double-digit millions of dollars annually, people familiar with the agreement said. A News Corp spokesman declined to comment.
Other outlets that agreed to participate include USA Today-owner, Gannett Co., the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, Condé Nast, NBC News, ABC News, Bloomberg Media, BuzzFeed News and Business Insider. Facebook hasn't disclosed financial terms of its arrangements with publishers.
Facebook, which has been accused of bias by conservatives in the past, sought to include a diversity of viewpoints among the outlets that will be featured, although it said they must meet certain standards of trustworthiness. While the conspiracy-theory website Infowars won't be included, headlines from far-right website Breitbart might appear.
When asked about Breitbart, Mr. Zuckerberg declined to speak about specific media sources, but said, "having someone be in there doesn't necessarily mean the curators will choose to highlight them."
While Facebook will have the ability to choose any headline from media outlets that have joined, only a small number would appear in the feed—some chosen by human curation and others by Facebook's algorithms. When users click on a link within Facebook News, they will be sent to the publisher's site.
Licensing fees have been viewed as a potentially valuable source of revenue for publishers struggling to compete for digital-ad dollars against Facebook and Google, the so-called duopoly that together commands nearly 60% of the U.S. market. Many publishers are trying to develop other revenue streams, such as user subscriptions, events and content licensing.
Earlier this year, Apple announced a partnership with more than 300 magazines and several digital media outlets and newspapers, including the Journal, for a $9.99 a month subscription news bundle called Apple News+. As part of the deal, publishers would split 50% of the revenue based on readership of their stories.
Curating a news section is a shift for Facebook, which until now has mainly been a platform for users to share news articles with each other. "People want and benefit from personalized experiences on Facebook, but we know there is reporting that transcends individual experience. We want to support both," Campbell Brown, Facebook's vice president for news partnerships, wrote in a blog post.
During the trial run, Facebook said it plans to showcase news from local publications in major metro areas like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Philadelphia, Houston, Washington, Miami, Atlanta and Boston. The news section will eventually include news from Facebook's local news service, Today In.

You can own memorabilia from space legend

Texto completo: A fresh chance to pick up a piece of Neil Armstrong memorabilia rolls up Friday when a Dallas auction house opens bidding on the fourth parcel of rare goods the space hero's sons have put up for sale.
The auctions, which have raised roughly $12 million so far, concerned some people close to the late astronaut – by nature a private person who stopped signing autographs when he learned people sold them.
In July, the astronaut's personal lawyer, Ross Wales, told the New York Times the auctions ran counter to that spirit: Armstrong "just didn't like to be made a fuss over."
But one of Armstrong's two sons, Mark, outlined in an email to The Enquirer the dozens of donations and contributions he and his brother have made of their father's possessions.
"Contrary to what you may have heard from others, my brother and I have been very sensitive to this issue since my father's passing," he wrote.
The Wapakoneta native was the first man on the moon. The auctions of his belongings have coincided with the yearlong celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing July 20, 1969.
Since October 2018, Heritage Auctions of Dallas has conducted three auctions of possessions that Rick and Mark Armstrong inherited from their parents, including hundreds of items from their father's astronaut career.
Rick Armstrong of Mason, the astronaut's elder son, declined to discuss the auctions.
In two emails, younger son Mark Armstrong of West Chester Township told The Enquirer he and wife Wendy plan to use a portion of their auction proceeds to build a charitable organization called Vantage Earth Foundation focused on the fate of the planet.
Aerospace historian James R. Hansen published his definitive biography, "First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong," in 2005, and the book became a 2018 movie.
"My concern as a historian is that I would want to know if there are any historically significant documents," Hansen said, such as a letter to Armstrong from Charles Lindbergh, the first man to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1927.
Armstrong gave 450 boxes of his papers to his alma mater, Purdue University. In October 2018, the collection's archivist wrote a letter to the Times that the Armstrong auctions were "problematic." The archivist didn't respond to emails for comment.
Mark Armstrong's email outlined dozens of donations and contributions he and his brother have made of their father's possessions. He said they also have ensured that auctioned items have been cataloged for public review.
The Lindbergh letter, for example, has been on loan since June 2017 to the San Diego Air and Space Museum, he said, and will not be in the auction.
In May, the brothers donated the Explorers Club flag "that our father flew on Apollo 11" to the Explorers Club in New York.
About a month ago, Mark Armstrong said, he and his brother made a donation of items to the University of Cincinnati, where their father taught for decades.
Among the goods is a 1971 letter from a key House leader thanking the astronaut for his service to the nation: "Surely NASA's loss is the University of Cincinnati's gain."
In 1978, President Jimmy Carter awarded the first Congressional Space Medal of Honor to Armstrong. That honor now is displayed at the "Destination Moon" exhibit of the Cincinnati Museum Center. Mark Armstrong said he and his brother have offered the medal permanently to the Smithsonian.
This gold medal that flew aboard Apollo 11 half a century ago sold at auction in July for $2.05 million.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
"But Her Emails ..." (editorial, Oct. 23):
I am disappointed that The Times did not use the opportunity to apologize for its obsessive coverage of this Hillary Clinton nonscandal in 2016. According to an article in the Columbia Journalism Review, "in just six days, The New York Times ran as many cover stories about Hillary Clinton's emails as they did about all policy issues combined in the 69 days leading up to the election."
Mrs. Clinton lost the election for myriad reasons, but it did not help that The Times's coverage of this issue reinforced many voters' suspicions that she was untrustworthy. Jeffrey Toobin, chief legal analyst for CNN, apologized this week for hyping the email story during that crucial moment. If The Times wants to regain the trust of its readers heading into 2020, it should do the same.

Texto completo: Should Washington have done more to encourage foreign governments to examine the business activities of Hunter Biden? Hanging out the Biden shingle in jurisdictions where Barack Obama's vice president was leading U.S. policy appears to have been a more lucrative enterprise than previously believed.
Laura Strickler and Rich Schapiro report for NBC News:
In the final year of the Obama administration, an American lawyer traveled to Romania to meet with a businessman accused of orchestrating a corrupt land deal.
The businessman was Gabriel "Puiu" Popoviciu, a wealthy Romanian real estate tycoon. The lawyer brought in to advise him was Hunter Biden, the son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Hunter Biden's work for Popoviciu in 2016 went unreported at the time, but Joe Biden's involvement in Romania was very much public. The vice president was among the leading voices pushing the government to crack down on corruption.
Will we now be treated to an explanation of Hunter Biden's vast expertise in the area of Romanian real estate law and corruption statutes? This column will go out on a limb and suggest that his knowledge of Bucharest property markets was not all that much greater than his familiarity with Ukrainian gas deposits. NBC elaborates:
There's no evidence that Hunter or his father acted improperly or violated any laws. But the arrangement, government ethics experts say, raises concerns that Hunter Biden was used as a prop in Popoviciu's effort to dodge criminal prosecution.
"We don't know what [Hunter Biden] was paid or what he was paid for but it does raise questions of whether this Romanian individual facing criminal charges was actually paying for a connection to the American vice president," said Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor who specializes in government ethics.
For a Romanian businessman with legal troubles, renting a Biden might have seemed like a good deal even if it was not expected to result in a U.S. vice presidential favor or a golfing photo suitable for framing. The mere presence of a Biden on the team—while another Biden is forcefully representing the world's superpower in demanding Romanian reforms—could be a strong signal that one intends to mount an aggressive defense.
In this case it seems that local authorities either didn't receive such a message or they ignored it. Earlier this year, in a story largely dedicated to Hunter Biden's other foreign "business" ventures, the New York Times noted :
In addition to his work in Ukraine for the energy company Burisma, Hunter Biden advised a Romanian businessman with ties to the United States, Gabriel Popoviciu, whose real estate dealings had come under investigation, according to people familiar with the arrangement, which has not been previously reported. The investigation, which came as the United States and its allies were pushing Romania to clamp down on corruption, led to Mr. Popoviciu's conviction and a prison sentence.
What kind of message did Hunter Biden's work send to Romanians about the United States?
This column may ultimately owe Hunter Biden an apology for assuming that he was not as adept as the Clinton family in monetizing his brand name.
For now there's a question of whether the Biden family drew the line at China, Romania and Ukraine. If Joe Biden wants to continue to run for President, it seems reasonable for voters to ask for a full accounting of his family's business operations worldwide.

Meanwhile back in America, Democrats in the House are searching for evidence that President Donald Trump unduly pressured the Ukrainian government to examine Biden actions which the Bidens have promised they will never do again .

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The White House is planning to instruct federal agencies to not renew their subscriptions to the New York Times and the Washington Post, administration officials said, escalating President Trump's attacks on the media outlets.
"Not renewing subscriptions across all federal agencies will be a significant cost saving—hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars will be saved," White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in an email Thursday.
Ms. Grisham declined to provide further details, and it wasn't immediately clear how the White House intended to compel agencies to cancel the subscriptions or how soon the order would take effect. The White House was still working on implementing the directive as of Thursday morning, an administration official said.
Spokeswomen for the Times and the Post declined to comment.
The decision comes days after Mr. Trump told his staff to cancel the White House's print subscriptions to the Post and the Times after expressing frustration with their coverage.
"We don't even want it in the White House anymore," Mr. Trump said of the Times during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity that aired Monday night. "We're going to probably terminate that and the Washington Post. They're fake."
Print editions of the Times and the Post weren't among the newspapers delivered to the White House on Thursday, a White House official said.
The president has repeatedly railed against and sought to discredit the newspapers' coverage of his administration, including its dealings with Ukraine and the resulting impeachment inquiry in the House. On Twitter and during campaign rallies, Mr. Trump has attacked the news media, calling it the "enemy of the people" and dismissing some of the country's most venerable journalism outlets as "fake news."
In June, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that a Times story represented a "virtual act of Treason." The publisher of the New York Times, A.G. Sulzberger, responded with an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal , saying the "new attack crosses a dangerous line in the president's campaign against a free and independent press."
Mr. Trump is an avid consumer of the news, and he regularly reads the Times and the Post, according to aides who privately acknowledged that they expect him to continue doing so despite the directive.
"I have no doubt the hard-working reporters of the New York Times and Washington Post will continue to do quality journalism regardless of whether the president acknowledges he reads them," said Jonathan Karl, the president of the White House Correspondents' Association and chief White House correspondent for ABC News.
"Pretending to ignore the work of a free press won't make the news go away or stop reporters from informing the public and holding those in power accountable," Mr. Karl added.
It wasn't immediately known how many subscriptions to the Times and the Post the federal government has. Federal employees are eligible for free digital subscriptions to the Post using their government email addresses.
Officials at the General Services Administration and the White House Office of Management and Budget didn't immediately provide data about the total number of subscriptions.
Canceling the subscriptions could limit officials' access to vital information that could assist them in doing their jobs.

Pelosi's Impeachment Blunder

Texto completo: Nancy Pelosi had the Democrats' impeachment strategy right the first time: Don't do it. But apparently even a lifetime in the mud-filled trenches of politics wasn't enough to toughen the House speaker against the Democratic left's compulsion to impeach Donald Trump.
Anyone of any political stripe knows that the most psychologically distressed Democrats have wanted to impeach this guy, somehow just get rid of him, from day one.
Before Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, the Trump takedown was supposed to result from the Russian-collusion narrative, which got up to speed in January 2017 and then steamrolled across the country for two years of media leaks and the Mueller investigation, ultimately and fantastically going nowhere.
Within a day of the Mueller report's release, dismissing the Russian-collusion story lines, the opposition pivoted to the obstruction-of-justice narrative. Somehow, the pivoters must have assumed that the American people, after enduring the Mueller odyssey, would not notice that this extraordinarily disruptive investigation had come to nothing. And that people would saddle up to join the next get-Trump posse. That didn't work.
We'll pause in our own narrative to posit a de minimis level of legitimacy to what they've done. If the opposition party and, in our unique times, the opposition press want to spend what capital and credibility they have in a round-the-clock effort to take down a sitting president, that's their prerogative. Nothing in the Constitution says elected officials are obliged to do anything productive.
But translating the public's votes into a permanent presidential takedown had better work, because if they don't pull off impeachment and drive Donald Trump out of public life next year, the losses for the Democrats and the media will be devastating. It's the familiar do-or-die stakes of trying to take out the king.
Because Donald Trump loves living dangerously, he and the increasingly mysterious Rudy Giuliani handed his opponents the unexpected excitement of the Ukraine-Biden narrative -- and at last an opening for impeachment. The New York Times, delirious at the prospect, has even created an ominous little logo for its coverage, typically several pages a day -- "The 45th President: Impeachment."
Maybe it really will be the third time's the charm for the Trump-elimination forces, but the impeachment project looks like it's starting to go wobbly.
For starters, it's still just sort-of an impeachment. There's been no vote in the House and no sign the Judiciary Committee is drawing up articles of impeachment, as in the past. Instead, Adam Schiff's intelligence committee is interviewing Ukraine-related State Department officials -- in secret hearings. It resembles a show trial, with the "public" parts emerging as selective leaks to the impeachment press.
But the most telling impeachment development this week wasn't any paraphrased testimony from Mr. Schiff's private hearings. It was the news that Speaker Pelosi's impeachment timetable has been delayed "to sharpen their case" for doing it.
It is now evident that a vote to impeach President Trump isn't likely to occur before Thanksgiving, as many assumed, but will slip to December. Then, of course, the trial phase will pass to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Mr. McConnell reportedly wanted it all over by the end of the year, but what's the rush? The Trump trial could run through January -- 31 priceless campaign days before the Democratic Party's intensely competitive primaries. The Iowa caucus vote is Feb. 3, then comes New Hampshire's primary on Feb. 11; Nevada's caucuses are Feb. 22; and the crucially important South Carolina primary arrives Feb. 29.
Instead of competing for their party's nomination, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Michael Bennet will spend invaluable campaign time planted on Capitol Hill during the days that the Pelosi-Schiff Trump trial drones on. Sens. Sanders and Harris can't call Mr. Trump the "most corrupt president" in the history of the country and then skip out on the trial of public enemy No. 1 to campaign in a downstate Iowa diner.
Joe Biden, Mayor Pete, and Hillary's new friend Rep. Tulsi Gabbard get to romp daily through the primary states, but who's going to notice with the Trump impeachment trial siphoning away the nation's media's attention?
Surely Nancy Pelosi knew when she stood firm against opening the impeachment dam that the interests of her party's anti-Trump compulsives -- nearly all from safe seats -- and her party's broader election interests were not aligned.
The left has always believed that some deus ex machina, such as Robert Mueller or a nonstop storm of negative press stories, would magically make the Trump presidency just go away -- rather than the more plausible likelihood that the relentlessly combustible Mr. Trump would eventually discredit himself in the eyes of most voters.
The American left throughout its existence has had a deep mistrust of the U.S. system, so rather than wait until November 2020 for voters to sort all this out, we get this crypto-impeachment. Like the sure-thing election of 2016, it too could backfire.

How the Democrats Will Keep Texas Red

Texto completo: Turning Texas blue has become the Democrats' Holy Grail -- and the media is eager to see them quest after it. "Is Texas finally turning blue?" asked the Washington Post. The New York Times answered by explaining "why Texas is nearing battleground status." Politico says it's already done: "Texas Republicans brace for 2020 drubbing."
The idea that Texas will vote Democratic next year mostly stems from the results of last fall's midterms. Democrats picked up two congressional seats and made gains in the state Legislature, and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz defeated Democrat Robert Francis O'Rourke by only 2.6 points. From this, many Democrats project a further inexorable decline in the Texas GOP's fortunes, flipping the state's 38 electoral votes blue.
Whoa there, pardner! That assumes Texas Republicans won't get their act together. They will. With Sen. John Cornyn (who leads the state ticket next year) and Gov. Greg Abbott (who vanquished his opponent last year by 13.3 points) focused on re-energizing GOP efforts to register and turn out voters, Republican complacency in Texas is the last thing Democrats can count on.
More important, Democrats will likely nominate a presidential candidate with a deeply anti-Texas platform on energy. Every major contender promises to end the use of fossil fuels within a decade or two -- or in former Vice President Joe Biden's case, three. "I guarantee you we're going to end fossil fuels," he said, "before 2050, God willing." If fulfilled, that promise would kill the prosperity of Texas.
On one energy issue, Mr. Biden is the only non-extremist of the bunch. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris all support a ban on fracking, the technological breakthrough that made the U.S. not only energy independent, but also the world's largest oil and gas producer.
Every major Democratic hopeful pledges to halt oil and gas leases on federal lands and in federal waters, with Ms. Warren promising to sign such an executive order on her first day as president. This would hit hard at the economies of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and North Dakota, where there's a lot of drilling on federal lands. While the only federal lands in Texas are parks and military bases, Texas companies are the biggest players in the Gulf of Mexico's federal waters. Ending drilling there would devastate Houston and southeast Texas.
Imagine the impact on Texas families if these policies are implemented. The oil and gas industry employs nearly 350,000 Texans, while 100,000 more work in refineries and chemical plants, earning higher pay than the state average. These roughnecks, welders, drivers, engineers, chemists and mechanics will react badly -- very badly -- to Democrats gunning for their jobs.
Zoom out a bit more. Wherever energy is pulled out of the ground, there are many others who work in construction, run cash registers, clerk at the bank, sell cars and wait tables who know the energy industry has given their communities a huge boost of prosperity in recent years. These Texans won't like Democrats vowing to end the use of fossil fuels, leaving tumbleweeds to roll down their towns' empty streets. That's the case not only in the West Texas oil patch, but also in East Texas and heavily Hispanic South Texas.
In the last fiscal year, the Texas oil and gas industry paid $14 billion in state and local taxes and royalties, including $1.2 billion to school districts and $366.5 million to counties. Royalty payments for drilling on state lands helped make Texas's Permanent School Fund, which supports K-12 public education, the world's largest educational endowment at $44 billion. Royalties to the Permanent University Fund are so large that, starting next fall, the fund will cover full tuition and fees at the University of Texas at Austin for all students from families with annual incomes of less than $65,000. If Democrats shut off the energy tap, more than jobs will be lost. This revenue will shrivel up, and so will its statewide benefits.
And for what? The U.S. has led the world in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in recent decades, mostly by using energy more efficiently and drawing more of its energy from less-carbon-intensive natural gas. So why should Texans pay for the failures of China, India, Russia and the rest of the world to match America's progress on climate?
Energy-state Republicans in red Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and North Dakota, as well as purple Pennsylvania, Colorado and New Mexico must now make a forceful case that the Democratic energy agenda strikes at the heart of their states' prosperity. If they do, Texas won't be all that's red in 2020.

Texto completo: Turning Texas blue has become the Democrats' Holy Grail—and the media is eager to see them quest after it. "Is Texas finally turning blue?" asked the Washington Post. The New York Times answered by explaining "why Texas is nearing battleground status." Politico says it's already done: "Texas Republicans brace for 2020 drubbing."
The idea that Texas will vote Democratic next year mostly stems from the results of last fall's midterms. Democrats picked up two congressional seats and made gains in the state Legislature, and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz defeated Democrat Robert Francis O'Rourke by only 2.6 points. From this, many Democrats project a further inexorable decline in the Texas GOP's fortunes, flipping the state's 38 electoral votes blue.
Whoa there, pardner! That assumes Texas Republicans won't get their act together. They will. With Sen. John Cornyn (who leads the state ticket next year) and Gov. Greg Abbott (who vanquished his opponent last year by 13.3 points) focused on re-energizing GOP efforts to register and turn out voters, Republican complacency in Texas is the last thing Democrats can count on.
More important, Democrats will likely nominate a presidential candidate with a deeply anti-Texas platform on energy. Every major contender promises to end the use of fossil fuels within a decade or two—or in former Vice President Joe Biden's case, three. "I guarantee you we're going to end fossil fuels," he said, "before 2050, God willing." If fulfilled, that promise would kill the prosperity of Texas.
On one energy issue, Mr. Biden is the only non-extremist of the bunch. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris all support a ban on fracking, the technological breakthrough that made the U.S. not only energy independent, but also the world's largest oil and gas producer.
Every major Democratic hopeful pledges to halt oil and gas leases on federal lands and in federal waters, with Ms. Warren promising to sign such an executive order on her first day as president.

Pelosi's Impeachment Blunder; The Speaker knows the interests of her anti-Trump compulsives and the Democratic Party are not aligned.

Texto completo: Nancy Pelosi had the Democrats' impeachment strategy right the first time: Don't do it. But apparently even a lifetime in the mud-filled trenches of politics wasn't enough to toughen the House speaker against the Democratic left's compulsion to impeach Donald Trump.
Anyone of any political stripe knows that the most psychologically distressed Democrats have wanted to impeach this guy, somehow just get rid of him, from day one.
Before Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, the Trump takedown was supposed to result from the Russian-collusion narrative, which got up to speed in January 2017 and then steamrolled across the country for two years of media leaks and the Mueller investigation, ultimately and fantastically going nowhere.
Within a day of the Mueller report's release, dismissing the Russian-collusion story lines, the opposition pivoted to the obstruction-of-justice narrative. Somehow, the pivoters must have assumed that the American people, after enduring the Mueller odyssey, would not notice that this extraordinarily disruptive investigation had come to nothing. And that people would saddle up to join the next get-Trump posse. That didn't work.
We'll pause in our own narrative to posit a de minimis level of legitimacy to what they've done. If the opposition party and, in our unique times, the opposition press want to spend what capital and credibility they have in a round-the-clock effort to take down a sitting president, that's their prerogative. Nothing in the Constitution says elected officials are obliged to do anything productive.
But translating the public's votes into a permanent presidential takedown had better work, because if they don't pull off impeachment and drive Donald Trump out of public life next year, the losses for the Democrats and the media will be devastating. It's the familiar do-or-die stakes of trying to take out the king.
Because Donald Trump loves living dangerously, he and the increasingly mysterious Rudy Giuliani handed his opponents the unexpected excitement of the Ukraine-Biden narrative—and at last an opening for impeachment. The New York Times, delirious at the prospect, has even created an ominous little logo for its coverage, typically several pages a day—"The 45th President: Impeachment."
Maybe it really will be the third time's the charm for the Trump-elimination forces, but the impeachment project looks like it's starting to go wobbly.
For starters, it's still just sort-of an impeachment. There's been no vote in the House and no sign the Judiciary Committee is drawing up articles of impeachment, as in the past. Instead, Adam Schiff's intelligence committee is interviewing Ukraine-related State Department officials—in secret hearings. It resembles a show trial, with the "public" parts emerging as selective leaks to the impeachment press.
But the most telling impeachment development this week wasn't any paraphrased testimony from Mr. Schiff's private hearings. It was the news that Speaker Pelosi's impeachment timetable has been delayed "to sharpen their case" for doing it.
It is now evident that a vote to impeach President Trump isn't likely to occur before Thanksgiving, as many assumed, but will slip to December. Then, of course, the trial phase will pass to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Mr. McConnell reportedly wanted it all over by the end of the year, but what's the rush? The Trump trial could run through January—31 priceless campaign days before the Democratic Party's intensely competitive primaries. The Iowa caucus vote is Feb. 3, then comes New Hampshire's primary on Feb. 11; Nevada's caucuses are Feb. 22; and the crucially important South Carolina primary arrives Feb. 29.
Instead of competing for their party's nomination, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Michael Bennet will spend invaluable campaign time planted on Capitol Hill during the days that the Pelosi-Schiff Trump trial drones on. Sens. Sanders and Harris can't call Mr. Trump the "most corrupt president" in the history of the country and then skip out on the trial of public enemy No. 1 to campaign in a downstate Iowa diner.
Joe Biden, Mayor Pete, and Hillary's new friend Rep. Tulsi Gabbard get to romp daily through the primary states, but who's going to notice with the Trump impeachment trial siphoning away the nation's media's attention?
Surely Nancy Pelosi knew when she stood firm against opening the impeachment dam that the interests of her party's anti-Trump compulsives—nearly all from safe seats—and her party's broader election interests were not aligned.
The left has always believed that some deus ex machina, such as Robert Mueller or a nonstop storm of negative press stories, would magically make the Trump presidency just go away—rather than the more plausible likelihood that the relentlessly combustible Mr. Trump would eventually discredit himself in the eyes of most voters.
The American left throughout its existence has had a deep mistrust of the U.S. system, so rather than wait until November 2020 for voters to sort all this out, we get this crypto-impeachment. Like the sure-thing election of 2016, it too could backfire.

Xi Cannot Stop Shaq; The dictator can only try to use state-run media to contain him.

Texto completo: Retired National Basketball Association star Shaquille O'Neal has been doing business in China for years. But he's not going to remain silent to please the world's largest police state. On Tuesday night the hoops legend supported not just free speech in general but specifically speech defending the people of Hong Kong.
China's dictatorship has been limiting Chinese broadcasts of NBA games ever since Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted—and then deleted—his support for Hong Kong freedom earlier this month. Hong Kongers have been demanding that the Chinese government allow basic liberties. They were disappointed when current NBA star LeBron James opined that Mr. Morey "wasn't educated" on the subject.
But now a former NBA star is standing taller than ever. On the U.S. cable network TNT on Tuesday, Mr. O'Neal helped kick off the NBA season with a message that is bound to cost him some overseas revenue—and win him even more fans among those who cherish liberty. The Hall of Famer noted that China cannot force Americans to stop expressing our beliefs as a condition of commerce:
... as American people we do a lot of business in China and they know and understand our values and we understand their values. And one of our best values here in America is free speech. We're allowed to say what we want to say and we are allowed to speak up about injustices and that's just how it goes. And if people don't understand that, that's something that they have to deal with.
... Daryl Morey was right. Whenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say, 'That's not right.' And that's what he did... When it comes to business, sometimes you have to tiptoe around things, but again, they understand our values. … We have the right to speak, especially with social media. We're going to say whatever we want to say, when we want to say it.
The Allahpundit column at HotAir.com observes:
His point is simple. We understand China's values and look the other way at them, why can't they do the same for us? If LeBron and [NBA Commissioner] Adam Silver can shrug off mass internment of religious minorities in concentration camps, the ChiCom government might reasonably be expected to shrug off one g-ddamned tweet by a team executive in support of Hong Kong. The reason this NBA/China standoff resonates is precisely because Americans on both sides of the aisle worry that Chinese economic power is pressuring American corporations like the NBA into following Chinese standards of free speech. .. the reason this has become a minor international incident isn't because Morey made it one but because China did. They could have ignored his pro-Hong-Kong tweet. Instead they chose to seize on it and bludgeon the league with it to send the message that further dissent won't be tolerated.
... Shaq wants a live-and-let-live approach where China does what it wants and Americans say what they want and both sides live with it. China says no. Either Americans tacitly approve of their totalitarianism by maintaining total silence about it or they don't do business with China.
In the Washington Post, Cindy Boren notes the commercial punishment in China imposed this week by the government:
State television chose not to air the first night's games and Tencent, the streaming partner of the league and ESPN, showed only the Lakers-Clippers game, according to the sports network.
As for Mr. O'Neal's appearance on American television, Matt Wilstein's report in the Daily Beast suggests that Mr. O'Neal's colleagues don't all share his commitment to free speech:
Shortly after the segment aired, the official NBA on TNT Twitter account posted a tweet that read, "Inside the NBA discusses recent surrounding the NBA and China" and included a video clip of the moment. But moments later, it appears to have been quickly deleted.
Morey also quickly deleted his original tweet, which read simply, "Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong." But that did not stop China from suspending all ties with the Houston Rockets franchise and threatening the league's ability to broadcast games in that massive international market.
KNBC's Michael Duarte reports on the NBA's opening night game in Los Angeles between the Clippers and Mr. James's Lakers:
As fans walked past the statues of past legends Jerry West, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Shaquille O'Neal, a reminder of the league's current controversy was just steps away... Outside Staples Center, pro Hong Kong protesters passed out T-shirts to fans reading: "Fight for freedom, Stand with Hong Kong."
As a retired player it's unlikely Mr. O'Neal can command the endorsement sums of a current star. But he's putting at risk a commercial relationship that has been significant. In 2006, a Chinese sportswear company erected a 50-foot statue of him in a Beijing park. Two years later Pete Thamel wrote in the New York Times about the NBA's huge fan base in China:
Heidi Ueberroth, the N.B.A.'s president for global marketing partnerships and international business operations, recalled visiting the city of Guilin in the mid-1990s on a weekend trip while in China on business. Nobody knew she was affiliated with the N.B.A., but she remembered a young and energetic tour guide's introduction of the city as, ''The sister city of Orlando, Fla., the home of Shaquille O'Neal.''

Perhaps One Could Fashion a Giant and Delicious Statue "America is sitting on a mountain of uneaten bacon... Hog producers started building up their herds in anticipation of more demand for meat imports from China... The U.S. herd swelled to 77.7 million head. as of Sept. 1, a record for the month and the highest since 1943... So far, that's mostly led to an excess for U.S. supplies. But the glut could be short-lived if recent Chinese buying is any indication. Export sales of American pork have soared to weekly records, buoyed by purchases from the Asian country," Bloomberg, Oct. 22
Fortunately, Bad Help Is Hard to Find "A string of hitmen who repeatedly subcontracted a murder to each other -- then failed to go through with the job -- have been jailed in China. The hapless assassins kept passing on the contract -- each time taking a cut of the cash -- in the hope that someone lower down the chain would actually carry out the killing," AFP, Oct. 23

Texto completo: Netflix's new Shakespearean drama The King tells the story of an unwilling Henry V, played by Timothée Chalamet, who goes to war against a villainous French Dauphin (Robert Pattinson). While royal infighting and a muddy battle occupy much of the movie, another war rages in real life: who had the better hair?
Was it Chalamet, of whose circular chop co-star Joel Edgerton joked, "We put a breakfast bowl on his head and just went for it"? Or Pattinson, whose long, Elizabethan-surfer locks delighted fans more accustomed to his real-life close trim?
After Chalamet fans first saw his new hair while the actor was promoting Beautiful Boy, many expressed mixed feelings over the actor losing his shaggier chin-length bob. GQ called the new look "the bowl cut that broke a million hearts." When The King trailer debuted, a second wave of attention (and memes ) came with it. "Someone has to say it… Timothée Chalamet bowl cut lowkey hot?" read one tweet. "Timothée Chalamet's bowl cut is this year's Bradley Cooper's Jackson Maine's tan and beard," another user said of Cooper's disheveled outlaw makeover for 2018's A Star is Born that spawned many a Halloween costume.
The tweets about Pattinson's dirty blond waves were so numerous, multiple outlets posted round-ups . "*Storms into hair salon* GIVE ME THE ROBERT PATTINSON," joked the writer Anne T. Donahue.
When we first meet Prince Hal, his look is "almost Timothée as we know him—like a beautiful sex symbol," says Alessandro Bertolazzi, the Oscar-winning hair and makeup artist who created the actors' hair and previously worked on movies like Suicide Squad and Skyfall. Chalamet is initially wearing a billowing shirt with his long, unruly hair falling in his face. He looks like a 15th-century rock star. The team kept his existing, shaggy mop and put heavier product into it to evoke the pre-personal-hygiene era—but to mark Chalamet's official transformation into Henry V, Bertolazzi referenced paintings of the king at London's National Portrait Gallery. "When he arrives in his coat with his armor, with his beautiful haircut, he becomes stronger and more powerful," Bertolazzi says.
For Pattinson, a matching bowl cut wouldn't have been historically accurate. In 1415, the year the film's depiction of the Battle of Agincourt took place, France was already experiencing its Renaissance. Members of French royalty would likely opt for something more romantic, less severe. Plus, as the New York Times reported , Pattinson said he wanted to "play a princess, too," after seeing photos of his co-star Lily-Rose Depp as Catherine.
Bertolazzi experimented heavily. A braid was under consideration at one point, but deemed too much. When the actor put on the shoulder length, wavy blond wig he wears in the movie, they knew right away. "Sometimes if you do something really wrong, something you never expect to work, it can be amazing," says Bertolazzi. He then used soap and water to make the wig heavier. "Not too fluffy," he says. "You have to remember the Middle Ages were a dirty, sick period."
Bertolazzi says he's surprised by how much attention the hairstyles have received. "We're just following the rules about what the paintings show about the Middle Ages," he says. "Okay, it probably doesn't look so cool—but it has to be like that if you want to do something real."

Texto completo: When, at Mamie Till's insistence, the coffin was opened, she saw her son's right eyeball sitting on his cheek, dangling by the optic nerve. Let that single grisly detail stand in for all the rest. Let it speak to the savagery two white men unleashed upon the body of a 14-year-old black boy named Emmett Till.
On Saturday, a new marker was dedicated at the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi, from which his body was fished in August 1955. This is the fourth such memorial to Till, a Chicago boy who was kidnapped, tortured and murdered for supposedly getting fresh with a white woman at a local store.
The first marker wasn't installed until 2008. It disappeared. The next two were shot full of holes. The new one is said to be bulletproof, with protective glass and reinforced steel. It weighs 500 pounds and will reportedly be monitored by video cameras transmitting to the internet.
Even so, one wonders how long it will last. Where race is concerned, after all, white resistance to memory is often mulish. Black resistance too, sometimes. As Jessie Jaynes-Diming, a member of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, recently told NPR, "Whites and blacks came to our meetings and (said), 'Why are you all bringing this up? Why don't y'all let that die?' "
John Whitten would agree. A former county prosecutor, he was 7 years old when his namesake father defended the killers in court. Till, he told NPR, "came down here and got in trouble - overstepped his bounds to a degree some folks thought. And they cured him of his problems. I think all these folks are stirring crap up. Every day, somebody's dragging up the race card. Somebody saying we have racial disparity here. If nobody would stir that damn pile of stuff up, it wouldn't stink."
It is, yes, a crude and atavistic assessment. But, though others would likely use more oblique language, Whitten speaks the hearts of many white people when he says these are things we shouldn't "stir." For example, he speaks for Newt Gingrich who, in August, denounced a New York Times project on the history of slavery as "a lie."
And for the Alabama nurse who complained last year to Britain's Guardian newspaper that a new lynching memorial is "just stirring up something."
If some African Americans resist these stories because of the pain, many whites resist them because of the stain - the smudge on self-image, the blot on conscience, the blemish on the mythology of white virtue and innocence. They feel indicted by memory, so they try to kill it. "It's hard not to be embarrassed," a then-20-year-old white guy named Ryan Price told me in 2011. We had just sat through a documentary, "The Murder of Emmett Till."
In watching the movie, he said, "You get to the point where you almost want to change your skin color so you can show how much you care about issues of race, how much you care about the overt hatred and vitriolic discrimination of the past and today. Of course, you can't change your skin color, but you can be an ally to those who are marginalized in society, and that's something it really spurs me to do."
That young man's words inspired me - not only his willingness to grapple honestly with his feelings, but his determination to use those feelings for good. If more of us had courage like his, a simple commemorative sign would not have to be bulletproof or weigh 500 pounds. And history would not be a threat but, as he puts it, a spur. Unfortunately, too many of us have not courage, but cowardice.
They seek to murder memory. But you see, memory fights back.
So maybe they should make peace with it instead.

Texto completo: With an aggressive forehand and an arsenal of lobs, drop shots and slices, he was one of Spain's most prominent tennis players and the oldest man to win a singles title at the French Open.
Andrés Gimeno, a lanky Spanish tennis player who in 1972 became the oldest man to win the men's singles championship at the French Open, died on Oct. 9 in Barcelona. He was 82.
The Spanish tennis federation said the cause was cancer.
A genial sportsman with a graceful style, Gimeno (pronounced hee-MAY-no) came to prominence in the 1950s, using an arsenal of drop shots and lobs that disrupted power players, especially on clay courts.
"Andrés didn't hit the ball with a lot of spin, like many Spanish players do now, but he had an aggressive, flat forehand, and a backhand that was more of a slice most of the time," Stan Smith, a frequent opponent of Gimeno's, said by phone.
By 1972, as he neared his 35th birthday, the closest Gimeno had come to winning a Grand Slam title was losing to Rod Laver in the final of the 1969 Australian Open.
Seeded sixth at the 1972 French Open, Gimeno defeated Smith in the quarterfinals, the Soviet Alex Metreveli in the semifinals and the Frenchmen Patrick Proisy in the finals. Gimeno won the championship match point with his lob -- his most potent weapon on that rainy June 4 at Roland Garros Stadium.
At 34 years and 306 days, Gimeno remains the oldest man to win the French Open men's title. The second oldest, Ken Rosewall, was 33 years and 220 days when he won in 1968.
Gimeno was born on Aug. 3, 1937, in Barcelona, where, with the encouragement and coaching of his father, Esteban, he began his path to a tennis career. He trained at a club in Barcelona and, at 17, won a national doubles championship with Juan Manuel. At 21, he played in the first of several Davis Cups for Spain.
After winning several amateur tournaments in Europe, Gimeno turned professional in 1960. He and other leading players, including Laver, Rosewall and Lew Hoad, played a circuit of pro tournaments but were not allowed to compete in Grand Slams like the French Open and Wimbledon because they were no longer amateurs.
But when the Open Era started in 1968, pros were allowed to play with amateurs. That year, in the first United States Open of the new era, Gimeno and Arthur Ashe lost in the doubles finals to Smith and Bob Lutz.
Six months later, Gimeno played Ashe in the finals at a tournament at Madison Square Garden.
"Strong, a retriever with classic stroking, Gimeno is the ultimate wall that returns everything," Robert Lipsyte wrote in his sports column in The New York Times. "He must be overpowered to be beaten." Although Lipsyte said that Gimeno was not especially exciting, "weekend players could probably learn more from him than any other leading professional."
Gimeno won the match and left Manhattan with a winner's check of $ 5,290.62 (the equivalent of about $ 38.000 today). He won several other tournaments in the United States and Europe through 1972.
In another strong performances at a Grand Slam before he won the French Open, Gimeno lost in the semifinals of Wimbledon to John Newcombe in 1970.
Gimeno retired in 1973 and became a TV commentator and coach and opened a tennis club in Barcelona. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2009.
Two years later, during the Spanish economic crisis, he said that he had lost nearly all his money. A group of Spanish players, including Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer, raised money for him by playing in an exhibition tournament.
His survivors include his wife, Cristina Carulla; two sons, Andres Jr. and Alejo; and three grandchildren.

The Democratic Primary's God Deficit

Texto completo: The candidates' reticence about religion is excessive and unwise.
The most recent Democratic debate lasted three hours and, according to one transcript I checked, exceeded 30,000 words.
Almost none of them were about religion.
God came up only in throwaway phrases. "God bless Kamala," said Cory Booker, praising Kamala Harris for discussing reproductive rights. Joe Biden scattered "for God's sake" and "God forbid" like croutons on his word salads. Tulsi Gabbard, explaining the meaning of "aloha," noted that "we're all God's children."
When Booker fleetingly mentioned his participation in a bipartisan Bible study group, I snapped to attention. That was the closest the debate came to acknowledging the importance of faith in many people's lives.
While the percentage of Americans who don't identify with any religion has grown significantly over the past decade -- to 26 percent from 17 percent, according to a sweeping survey by the Pew Research Center -- it's still the case that more than half of Americans say that they pray daily and 45 percent attend religious services at least once a month.
But you wouldn't know it to tune into the Democratic primary.
If many Republican candidates travel far out of their way, toward the bogs of histrionics and hypocrisy, to recruit the Almighty into electoral service, many Democrats steer clear of religion. That's partly understandable, even admirable: In light of the rightful separation of church and state, they don't want to be seen as spotlighting or peddling any one creed.
But it's not necessary, and it's not smart.

President Trump and his Republican allies are poised to paint Democrats as unhinged lefties not only in terms of health care and taxes but also in terms of cultural issues, including abortion and L.G.B.T.Q. rights.
And some Democratic presidential candidates are already playing into their hands. Beto O'Rourke, for example, recently seemed to call for religious groups that don't support marriage equality to lose their tax-exempt status, an outlier position that the president immediately seized on and railed against. (O'Rourke's aides later insisted that he was misunderstood.)
Democrats would make it harder for Trump to vilify them as enemies of so-called traditional values if they talked a bit more about spirituality and religion -- including, if applicable, their own.
That might not matter in the bluest parts of the bluest states, said Mike McCurry, a Democratic consultant who served as the White House press secretary under President Bill Clinton and now teaches at the Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington. But, he added, "I sure as hell believe that it would work in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and that's what it's all going to come down to."
The church-state divide shouldn't dissuade the candidates, McCurry told me. "That's such a misreading of what the political DNA of America is," he said. "We have had religion woven into our political structures and our political debate from the very beginning."
Besides, he added, a Democrat who speaks persuasively about religion has a potentially huge tactical advantage: "Think ahead to the general election. If you're talking about faith in an authentic, genuine way, imagine the contrast if you're running against Donald Trump, who has absolutely none of that vocabulary." While the president may have the farthest reaches of the religious right locked down, many Americans of faith are appalled by him.
And he's vulnerable not just because of his personal history and public demeanor, which amount to a raging bonfire of the pieties. He also has governed in ways that contradict the principles of charity and mercy that are central to many religions.
Pete Buttigieg took gorgeously effective note of this in the Democrats' first debate, in June, referring to the Trump administration's treatment of migrants at the border.
"The Republican Party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion," he observed. "But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it." And any political party that suggests that "God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents -- that God would condone putting children in cages -- has lost all claim to ever use religious language again."
Buttigieg, a churchgoing Episcopalian, refuses to cede religion to Republicans or let them use it as some crude moral cudgel. He weaves it into discussions of his marriage to another man. "Nothing has made me feel more connected, more able to be true, however imperfectly, to my faith than the experience of putting myself second," he said at a CNN town hall this month. "That came with committing my life to my husband, Chasten."
He's not the only Democratic presidential candidate with religion in his history and on his mind. He's just unusual in his readiness to mention it.
In the Democratic debates, Elizabeth Warren, a Methodist, has repeatedly reflected on her past as a teacher. But she has never taken the few extra syllables to note that she taught Sunday school.
In terms of connecting with as much of the electorate as possible, that's a mistake. And in terms of the president's nonexistent moral fluency, it's a blown opportunity.

Texto completo: An anonymous writer described as a senior Trump administration official whose op-ed piece in the New York Times last year caused a firestorm has written a book called "A Warning" slated to hit bookshelves on Nov. 19.
The publisher, Twelve, an imprint of Lagardère SCA's Hachette Book Group, described the book as "an unprecedented behind-the-scenes portrait of the Trump presidency."
The op-ed piece , which ran in September 2018, was headlined "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration." In the essay, the author said that he wanted the administration "to succeed" but added that "the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic."
After the op-ed was published, President Trump described the author as "gutless" and called on the Times to "turn him/her over to government at once!" The White House repeatedly urged the Justice Department to launch a probe to identify the writer.
The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Twelve said in a news release that the author didn't receive an advance for the book and that the author intends to "substantially" donate any royalties to nonprofit groups that "focus on government accountability and on supporting those who stand up for the truth in repressive countries around the world." The publisher said the author would continue to remain anonymous.
Javelin, a literary agency in Alexandria, Va., sold the book on behalf of the author to Twelve. It couldn't be learned whether the author is still working in the Trump administration. A spokesman for the agency declined to comment on any aspects of the author's identity.
One bookseller said he had already placed a major order for the forthcoming book but that it was too early to predict how it would sell.
"We haven't been given any information," said Bradley Graham, co-owner of the Politics and Prose bookstore in Washington, D.C. "We just can't tell at this time how much of a splash it will make without knowing more about what it will say."

Texto completo: Ever since Hillary Clinton suggested Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian "asset," the Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii has been on the attack. But she ought to consider the remarks an in-kind contribution. Because before Mrs. Clinton's ham-handed insertion of herself into the 2020 Democratic race, Ms. Gabbard's campaign for president was going nowhere.
The big challenge before Ms. Gabbard now is whether she will make it into the next Democratic debate on Nov. 20 in Atlanta. She has yet to meet the polling requirements: either 3% support in four Democratic National Committee approved national polls, or 5% in two DNC-approved polls from states with early primaries (Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada).
Ms. Gabbard has had trouble cracking 2% in most polls, and her debate performance last Tuesday hasn't moved the needle. A FiveThirtyEight.com analysis put her at the bottom of the pack of all the Democratic candidates who made it to the stage, and noted her postdebate net favorability had dropped further into negative numbers.
Nor is her alleged stooging for Moscow Democrats' only issue with Ms. Gabbard. In her call to bring the troops home, many hear echoes of Donald Trump; her support for a ban on third-trimester abortions breaks with the party's abortion absolutism; notwithstanding an apology, her past opposition to same-sex marriage has led to charges of homophobia; and her threat to boycott last week's debate after alleging its corporate sponsors (CNN and the New York Times) worked with Democratic Party officials to "rig" the election had the Times writing how her political contribution was "injecting a bit of chaos" into the race.
Enter Mrs. Clinton. Speaking Thursday with former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe for his "Campaign HQ" podcast, Mrs. Clinton offered that Ms. Gabbard is a tool of Moscow. Though she didn't mention her by name, the reference was unmistakable:
"I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate," Mrs. Clinton said. "She's a favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far."
Mrs. Clinton went on to say that Jill Stein, who ran in 2016 on the Green Party ticket, is "also a Russian asset." She later said she meant the Republicans were grooming the third-party candidate, but the use of the word "also" to describe Ms. Stein as a Russian asset shows that isn't true.
Call it Hillary Classic. Start with an outrageous charge, backed with zero evidence, against a combat veteran who still serves as a major in the Army National Guard. Use an interview about the 2020 election to try to settle an old score, in this case Ms. Gabbard's 2016 resignation as vice chairman of the DNC and her endorsement of Bernie Sanders after she'd complained publicly the party was limiting debates, which was thought to favor Mrs. Clinton. Finally, yet again blame your loss to Mr. Trump on the Russians rather than accept that you were a lousy candidate.
Ms. Gabbard minced no words in response. She launched a tweetstorm that began, "Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain."
On Sunday she escalated. In a video she accused Mrs. Clinton of a "new McCarthyism" and asked for help in taking back the party from Mrs. Clinton and "her rich and powerful friends." "If they can falsely portray me as a traitor," Ms. Gabbard warned, "then they can do it to anyone."
It's making for interesting bedfellows. Most Democratic defenses of Ms. Gabbard have come from the minor candidates, such as Beto O'Rourke and Marianne Williamson. They are also coming from Republicans. At his cabinet meeting Monday, President Trump declared that Mrs. Clinton believes "anybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent."
Some anti-Trumpers are coming to her side as well. Rep. Justin Amash, the Michigan congressman who recently left the GOP, tweeted that whatever else may be unclear, "the thing we know for sure is that Hillary Clinton is a Donald Trump asset." Meanwhile the Associated Press ran a story Monday with the headline, "Tulsi Gabbard elevated in Iowa by Clinton spat."
This week will probably tell whether Ms. Gabbard's nuclear response to Mrs. Clinton will give her the boost in polling she needs to get herself into the next Democratic debate, or whether their dispute will merely give conservative radio something to chew on for the next few days. But if the controversy does elevate her to the next debate, it won't be just Tulsi Gabbard on that stage in Atlanta. With her will come a question on which almost all her fellow candidates would rather pass: About the high price the party continues to pay for Hillary Clinton and her fantasy that all her electoral troubles came from Russian agents.

A Twitter Ally That Romney Could Rely On

Texto completo: The senator acknowledged that he had an account, which he used to monitor political conversations online and defend himself.
Mitt Romney, the senator from Utah, former Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor, is also, apparently, the man behind a Twitter account that uses the moniker "Pierre Delecto."
Mr. Romney on Sunday admitted to McKay Coppins, a writer at The Atlantic, that he was responsible for the social media account, which he uses to covertly monitor political discourse and occasionally defend himself. It's unclear what, if anything, Pierre Delecto is a reference to.
Several events preceded the admission.
First, The Atlantic published on Sunday a profile of Mr. Romney, one of the few prominent Republican lawmakers to criticize President Trump over his efforts to press Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals. Those efforts form the basis of an impeachment investigation by the House.
Mr. Trump lashed out in response this month, calling the senator on Twitter a "pompous 'ass' who has been fighting me from the beginning." In one tweet, the president used the hashtag "#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY."
In the Atlantic profile, Mr. Romney admitted to having what he called a "lurker account" -- essentially a profile under a different name that he operated in secret to monitor the political conversation. But he declined to divulge the name associated with the account.
The admission spurred curiosity, particularly that of the online newsmagazine Slate.
Slate theorized that Pierre Delecto, or Twitter user @qaws9876, was Mr. Romney after it discovered the account among the Twitter followers of one of his grandchildren.
Slate's Ashley Feinberg found that Pierre Delecto's first follower was Mr. Romney's oldest son, Tagg. The account was created in 2011, shortly after Mr. Romney announced his intention to run for president. The account also followed all of Mr. Romney's children who are on Twitter and several former advisers, according to Slate.
The account also posted several telling replies to Romney-related tweets, which were captured by screenshot before the account was made private on Sunday night.
In one tweet from May, Jennifer Rubin, a conservative blogger at The Washington Post, said Mr. Romney's strategy on Mr. Trump was "non-confrontation verging on spinelessness."
"Jennifer, you need to take a breath," Pierre Delecto replied. "Maybe you can then acknowledge the people who agree with you in large measure even if not in every measure."
The Slate article prompted many on social media to surmise that if Pierre Delecto was in fact Mr. Romney, he had concocted one of the most extraordinary pseudonymous social media accounts for a public official ever (besting the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey's onetime moniker of Reinhold Niebuhr).
After Slate published its article, Mr. Coppins circled back with Mr. Romney to ask if he was indeed "Pierre Delecto."
"Just spoke to @MittRomney on the phone, and asked him about Pierre Delecto," Mr. Coppins said in a tweet. "His only response: "C'est moi."'
A spokeswoman for Mr. Romney did not directly answer questions about the account on Sunday night. But in an email, the spokeswoman sent a link to the tweet from Mr. Coppins describing Mr. Romney's admission.

Elizabeth Warren threatens Israel with aid cutoff but slammed Trump for cutting off aid to Palestinians

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren has threatened that as president she would consider cutting off U.S. aid to Israel if the country moves against a two-state solution, but last year, she condemned President Trump for cutting off aid to intransigent Palestinians.
On Saturday, the Democratic front-runner said regarding aid to Israel, "Right now, [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu says that he is going to take Israel in a direction of increasing settlements. That does not move us toward a two-state solution."
She added, "It is the official policy of the United States of America to support a two-state solution, and if Israel is moving in the opposite direction, then everything is on the table."
The phrase "all options are on the table" was frequently used by politicians as a way of saying they would consider military action to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon if other options failed. Now, here's Warren taking that tone against a long-standing U.S. ally.
Warren's harsh words toward Israel stand in stark contrast to her previous condemnation of Trump's cutoff of aid to Palestinians.
Trump has come under fire from the Left after making several moves to unwind aid to the Palestinians, who have consistently rejected opportunities for a two-state solution and created obstacles to a negotiated settlement while continuing their campaign of terrorism. The terrorist group Hamas controls Gaza, where missiles are fired into Israel, and the supposedly moderate Palestinian Authority has a program that pays salaries to imprisoned Palestinian terrorists and to the families of terrorists who get killed.
As one part of Trump's campaign, his administration last year cut off more than $500 million in aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). The agency has operated under an unprecedented definition that grants automatic refugee status to descendants of refugees rather than those who directly fled their homes as a result of a conflict, thus greatly inflating the number of Palestinians who are granted such status.
In September 2019, Warren joined dozens of Senate Democrats in condemning the move in a letter, stating, "We are deeply concerned that your strategy of attempting to force the Palestinian Authority to the negotiating table by withholding humanitarian assistance from women and children is misguided and destined to backfire."
Though the senators portrayed the UNRWA as nothing more than an honest provider of humanitarian aid, the reality is not so benign. The organization has long-funded textbooks in Palestinian classrooms that are littered with anti-Israel bias, a problem that has persisted despite claims the problem had been dealt with. More recently, an internal ethics report detailed a series of disturbing allegations against senior UNRWA management, including "sexual misconduct, nepotism, retaliation, discrimination and other abuses of authority, for personal gain, to suppress legitimate dissent, and to otherwise achieve their personal objectives."
It would be one thing if Warren were talking in a broader fashion about cutting foreign aid (an argument, that, say, Sen. Rand Paul might make). But instead, she is singling out Israel, even though the aid to Israel has to be spent on U.S. equipment, facilitates military cooperation, and does not involve any sort of commitment of U.S. troops.
That Warren would find it so objectionable to push the U.N. and Palestinians to change but would be so forthright about threatening aid to a close ally is an indication of how prevalent anti-Israel sentiment is within the Democratic Party. It's clear that Warren feels that to satisfy her base, she needs to signal a willingness to bring down the hammer on Israel.

No More 'Marshall Plans'; When America rebuilt Europe, it also built a pernicious cliché.

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren proposes a "Green Marshall Plan," which would lend $100 billion to foreign governments to purchase "clean" energy products made in the U.S. Julián Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio, wants "a 21st century 'Marshall Plan' for Central America." Columbia economist Glenn Hubbard likens President Trump's $50 billion Mideast peace plan to the Marshall Plan.
It's time to stop with these latter-day Marshall Plans. As the only nation-rebuilding effort perceived to have been successful, the 71-year-old plan has become the go-to association for policy entrepreneurs everywhere. Without substantive detail—almost invariably absent—these neo-Marshall Plans are sure to fail.
Appeals to the Marshall Plan cloak designs for massive government spending. No matter the cause's worth, no matter the plan's feasibility, this analogy provides an easy off-the-shelf sales pitch.
The real Marshall Plan of 1948 provided grants and loans to speed Europe's economic recovery after World War II. Although named for Secretary of State George Marshall, the plan's real author was Will Clayton, an international financier and former cotton trader. Debate persists about whether the Marshall Plan was motivated by humanitarian concerns, self-interest or anti-communism. To varying degrees, it was all of the above. Although scholars quibble about the plan's effectiveness and context, the American public remembers it as a triumph. But many forget why it succeeded—not merely due to its ambition or price tag but, critically, because of good political and economic institutions in recipient countries.
The Marshall Plan often resurfaces in periods of crisis. In 1958 Bruno Kreisky, a socialist who went on to become chancellor of Austria, proposed a "Marshall Plan for the Third World." In 1999 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appealed for a "Marshall Plan for the Balkans."
After 9/11, proponents of aid to Arab countries turned to the analogy. "The security of the United States now depends upon achieving throughout the Arab and Islamic World what the Marshall Plan achieved in Europe," wrote Richard Sokolsky and Joseph McMillan in the New York Times. President George W. Bush invoked the Marshall Plan while spending $20 billion to reconstruct Iraq after the 2003 invasion, and liberal critics like Susan Rice argued it wasn't generous enough.
More recently, the musician Bono proposed a Marshall Plan for refugees in 2016. Commentators writing everywhere from Bloomberg to the Jakarta Post have implausibly christened the $575 billion Belt and Road Initiative "China's Marshall Plan." Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has trumpeted a $30 billion "Marshall Plan" for Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
The original Marshall Plan's success now confers instant legitimacy on knockoffs of dubious merit. Without regard for accountability, administrative concerns, loan default, corruption, oversight, appropriate measures of success, or recipient-country history, all of these counterfeit Marshall Plans risk building up only one thing: the federal deficit.

Texto completo: We dare not fail this test of our constitutional government.
For weeks Donald Trump and his defenders have insisted that his decision to hold up aid to Ukraine was not dependent on that nation investigating Trump's political opponents in the United States. They all insisted that there was no quid pro quo.
But, last week the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, lifted the veil on that lie, confirming during a televised briefing that there was indeed a quid pro quo. As The New York Times reported, "Mr. Mulvaney told journalists ... that the aid was withheld in part until Ukraine investigated an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for hacking Democratic Party emails in 2016 -- a theory that would show that Mr. Trump was elected without Russian help."
Since making this shocking statement, Mulvaney has been struggling to clean it up, to tell the world that he didn't say what he clearly said.
And, in the moment of making the statement, Mulvaney proudly proclaimed: "I have news for everybody: Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy."
No, Trump world, we are not just going to get over it, not now or ever.
Trump's strategy is simple: Be brazen. Conduct your corruption in plain sight. And, it follows a simple logic: If it were wrong, I would be ashamed of it and attempt to conceal it. The fact that I haven't attempted to shroud it is proof of its virtue.
That is what's maddening about the Trump presidency: how much harm has been done as America looked on, with full awareness of the damage, and Trump has yet to be held accountable for any of it.
But that time is drawing to an end.
Wrong is wrong, whether you parade it or put it away. In fact, it is the flaunting of wrongdoing that should carry more of a penalty, not less of one. We can't allow our numbness to make this normal. It isn't.
This impeachment inquiry is the best thing Congress has done to help the country in years. Some worry that an impeachment would tear the country apart. To the contrary, I believe that it will bring the country together. A majority of Americans will recognize and rally around a common set of facts, a common truth, and reject Trump's attempt to bend reality.
A Pew Research Poll released last week found that 58 percent of Americans, including a quarter of Republicans, believe that Trump has done things that are grounds for impeachment.
No matter how much he says that the call he made to the president of Ukraine was perfect, no matter how much he attacks the whistle-blower, no matter how much he lies, most Americans see through it and are appalled by it.
And now that Mulvaney has made the disastrous mistake of actually telling the truth, some Republicans are even signaling that they are open to at least entertaining a vote to impeach the president.
This is another step that is important to the repairing of the country. It's not that I believe that the Senate would be in any danger of actually voting to convict and remove Trump. It's that we need to know that at least some of these Republican men and women who make our laws are not totally craven and devoid of morality.
And, Republicans and independents need to know that holding Trump accountable is not a sour grapes pursuit to relitigate 2016, or born out of maddening personal hatred of the man himself.
This is far bigger than all that. Trump is a stress test on our system and constitutional government and we dare not fail. Trump must be held accountable not only because his corruption dictates it, but also because we must demonstrate that accountability is possible.
If Americans chose to just "get over it" as Mulvaney demanded, the power of the president to degrade, corrupt and evade the system would be enshrined. Trumpism would mar the future.
That can't happen. Trump wrongdoing in the Ukraine case is clear. (I would argue that it's clear in other areas as well.)
Republican Congressman Francis Rooney of Florida made it clear that he's not ruling out the possibility of supporting impeachment. Sunday on CNN he told Jake Tapper that Mulvaney's attempt to walk back his admission was a farce, saying: "I don't see how you walk back something that's clear. I would say game, set, match on that."
And, as The Washington Post reported:
"Rooney told reporters Friday when asked about the political consequences of potentially impeaching Trump that he wanted 'to get the facts and do the right thing because I'll be looking at my children a lot longer than I'm looking to anybody in this building.' "
Each of us will have to look at our children, to look at ourselves in the mirror and be held accountable for how we responded to the threat Trump poses.
As the late Elijah Cummings put it:
"When we're dancing with the angels, the question will be asked: In 2019, what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact?"

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump is considering whether to keep a few hundred U.S. troops in northeast Syria after the bulk of the American force leaves, a move that would be another twist in years of policy gyrations over the country, according to U.S. officials.
A principal mission of the residual force would be to prevent President Bashar al-Assad's troops or Russian forces from taking control of Syria's oil fields, which are mainly in Kurdish-held territory in the northeast part of the country.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper, speaking Monday at a news briefing at U.S. military headquarters in Kabul, Afghanistan, said administration officials have discussed keeping a residual force in northeast Syria to "deny access to the oil fields" to groups like the Islamic State.
The defense chief said the Pentagon hadn't presented a specific plan to the president and wouldn't say how many troops would stay or for how long.
"We presently have troops in a couple of cities that are located right near that area," Mr. Esper said. "The purpose is to deny access, specifically revenue, to ISIS and any other groups that may want to seek that revenue to enable their own malign activities."
The idea was presented to Mr. Trump last week by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), who has vigorously opposed the president's initial decision to remove all of the 1,000 troops the U.S. has in northeast Syria.
Military officials said the Pentagon supports a plan to leave as many as 300 special operations forces to carry out that mission. The idea also has support in the State Department, according to people familiar with the issue.
In addition to keeping Syria's oil fields out of Russian hands, the troops could help the U.S. maintain a relationship with the Syrian Kurds and exert a modicum of influence in the region as Washington tried to encourage the Turks and the Kurds to maintain their shaky cease-fire.
Any U.S. troop presence would be protected by American air power.
The White House declined to comment. Mr. Trump appeared to allude to the idea on Friday and Sunday when he wrote in Twitter messages that the U.S. had "secured the Oil."
The plan, analysts say, might also give Mr. Trump a way to blunt criticism from members of both parties in Congress that he is abandoning the Kurds and handing the country over the Assad regime and the Russians.
Mr. Trump's interest in the plan was first reported by the New York Times.
A decision to maintain a small military presence would be the latest turn in a long saga in which Mr. Trump has pressed for more than a year for all American forces to leave Syria, only to be persuaded by top aides and Republican allies in Congress to slow the pace of that withdrawal or to leave some portion of the force in place.
Following a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 6, Mr. Trump directed a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria with the exception of a small complement of American troops at the al Tanf garrison in southeast Syria near the Jordanian and Iraqi borders. There are about 150 U.S. troops at al Tanf now, and U.S. military officials think the garrison could be used to host additional troops after the bulk of American forces leave northeast Syria.
If Mr. Trump approves the new plan, it would mean that the U.S. would have two geographically dispersed small complements of forces in northern and southern Syria.
Mr. Graham said Sunday that his latest discussions with Mr. Trump had eased his earlier concerns over the White House Syria policy. He said in an appearance on Fox News that he is "increasingly optimistic that we can have some historic solutions" in the country.
According to Mr. Graham, the administration is considering a broad plan under which there would be demilitarized zone occupied by international forces, but not Americans, to provide stability and that would be protected by air power.
It isn't known which nations, if any, would be willing to contribute forces for such a mission, and U.S. officials offered no details.
Mr. Graham also said he thought the U.S. and Kurds could work together to improve Syria's oil fields in the eastern part of the country so that the Kurds could derive revenue from them. "President Trump is thinking outside the box," he said.
The idea of working with the Kurds to develop their oil-exporting potential has been considered by U.S. officials before but hasn't been pursued, partly because Mr. Trump appeared to be intent on removing U.S. troops from Syria.
There are a number of impediments to carrying out the idea. A big one is maintaining security in a broad area with a small number of troops, though proponents say U.S. air power could make up for the small number of personnel on the ground.
Another challenge is how to export the oil that is produced in northeast Syria. Exporting the oil through Turkey is a political nonstarter. Nor would the U.S. appear to have any interest in giving the Assad regime or Russia a role in exporting the oil.
That means the oil would need to be exported through northern Iraq. Iraq's willingness to participate in such a venture isn't known, though northern Iraq is administered by Iraqi Kurds.

Texto completo: To many people, Anthony Bourdain was more than a chef. He was a world traveler and storyteller with a passion for music, watches and art spanning all cultures and regions. Bourdain admirers can now take a glimpse into his diverse life interests at Savannah's Everard Auctions and Appraisals.
Located at 2436 Waters Ave., the auction house has 10 items on display from Bourdain's personal collection that are part of the Property from the Collection of Anthony Bourdain, a 215-piece online auction hosted by Lark Mason Associates through iGavel Auctions.
"The objects are stories in themselves and they tell a lot about his life and in them sending us a group of these items they tried to represent different areas," said Amanda Everard, president of the Savannah auction house.
The items on display at Everard include several cufflink sets, sunglasses, an African carved wood figure, Ralph Steadman print, Jacques Pepin painting, tribal pigmented wood mask, a Verve cardboard record case with a collection of vinyl records, Latin American carved wood figure of a pre-Colombian warrior and a Tom Ford tuxedo.
"He really enjoyed things that were well-made and had a story to them," Everard said.
The online auction runs through Oct. 30 and is divided into categories that reflect Bourdain's wide variety of interests: film, art, cooking, travel, writing and world culture.
Some of the highlights of the overall collection include a custom steel-and-meteorite chef's knife crafted for Bourdain by master bladesmith Bob Kramer. As of Thursday, the knife was the highest-priced item with a leading bid of $21,000.
"He also used it and that was the cool thing. He didn't just have objects around that he wasn't going to enjoy and use," Everard said of the knife, which is on display in New York.
Other notable items include a chrome duck press from the Paris episode of Bourdain's show "The Layover," which aired from 2011-13 on Travel Channel, with a bid of $9,250. A group of early writings by Bourdain includes the original idea for his New York Times best-selling book "Kitchen Confidential," which has a bid of $4,100. A white chef's jacket worn by Bourdain for a cameo in the film "The Big Short" is listed for $1,300.
If you can't spare thousands of dollars for a bit of Bourdain history, there are several items, including an Alfred Brown blazer, Tom Ford suit and various pieces of furniture, that as of Thursday were listed for under $200.
"It's a little bit of everything. He was such an interesting guy," Everard said.
"The objects that were chosen to be sold really tell his story, and he was a great storyteller. That's what drew us all in."
For Everard, a pair of silver skull cufflinks that is being sold alongside another pair of silver disk cufflinks stands out among the pieces on display at the auction house.
"They're so persona," she said of the cufflink set, which has a current bid of $950.
"Things that you wear on your person, it says something. It's sort of a glimpse into the person."
All items from the collection, including the ones on display in Savannah, can be bid on at igavelauctions.com through Oct. 30. You can view the 10 items at Everard by appointment through Oct. 25 or at a public viewing scheduled for Oct. 28-30.
"We feel really lucky to be the ones here who get to take this on and bring it to people here locally," Everard said of Bourdain's collection.
"Because he traveled and was so famous he was given hundreds of things over the years, so the things that actually made it into his home are things that he cared about and they meant something to him."
A portion of the auction's proceeds will benefit the Anthony Bourdain Legacy Scholarship at his alma mater, the Culinary Institute of America. The scholarship was established to support students pursuing a semester abroad or taking part in one of the college's global cuisines and cultures international programs.
The remaining proceeds will go to Bourdain's estate. Bourdain died in 2018 in Paris. He was 61.

Trump in tailspin — and dragging country down with him

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The most powerful office in the world is occupied — and being abused — by a man who is entirely unfit and is spinning dangerously out of control. Everyone needs to stop pretending otherwise.
And it's all getting worse.
President Trump's train wreck of a performance Wednesday, at a meeting with congressional leaders, represented a new low on a scale that seems to have no bottom. “I pray for the president all the time ... I think now, we have to pray for his health,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said later, because “this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.”
Trump began by complaining about having to attend a meeting initiated by his own White House aides, according to published accounts. The subject was Trump's sudden decision to move U.S. military personnel in Syria aside, allowing Turkish troops and affiliated militias to sweep across the border and attack the Kurds, who had been loyal U.S. allies.
Trump then tried to make the case that he did not actually condone the Turkish invasion. Attendees were given copies of a truly bizarre and alarming letter Trump had sent to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 9. Just four short paragraphs long, the letter begins, “Let's work out a good deal!” It ends by telling Erdogan, “History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I will call you later.”
That is how the president of the United States communicated with a powerful foreign leader at a moment of crisis. We have all witnessed more sophisticated attempts at persuasion on kindergarten playgrounds. Erdogan reportedly threw the letter in the trash.
At the White House meeting, Trump went on to denigrate James Mattis, the decorated and highly esteemed Marine Corps general who served as Trump's defense secretary before resigning last year over Syria policy. Mattis is “the world's most overrated general,” Trump announced, according to The New York Times. “You know why? He wasn't tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.”
Anyone in touch with reality knows that none of this is true. The territory held by ISIS — the Islamic State — was reclaimed by Kurdish fighters with the aid and guidance of U.S. troops and intelligence operatives. Shortly before the meeting, the House voted 354-60 to condemn Trump's abandonment of the Kurds, with most Republicans joining their Democratic colleagues in expressing outrage.
Perhaps that vote was what set Trump off. “You're just a politician,” he told Pelosi. Then he amended his assessment: “You're not a politician, you're a third-rate politician.”
That's what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York heard; Pelosi thought she heard him say “third-grade politician.” In any event, she and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer rose to their feet and walked out.
They pressed Trump and his aides to explain what the plan was for fighting the Islamic State now that the Kurdish firewall is gone. They didn't get an answer because there is no plan. The president doesn't have the foggiest idea what he is doing.
Trump is in so far over his head that he doesn't know which way is up. He also is intellectually, psychologically and morally unsuitable for the high office he holds. Those two problems — incompetence and unfitness — reinforce each other, in the worst possible way, and have sent the presidency into a tailspin that puts the nation and the world in mounting peril.
Impeachment is no longer optional, given what we already know about Trump's dealings with Ukraine. But the prospect of facing a Senate trial — for which Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is already making plans — can only boost Trump's anxiety. His outbursts and tweetstorms are becoming more frequent and less tethered to the world of facts, events and consequences. Madness is a term laypeople use, not doctors. We must use it now.
I once was confident that our institutions and processes were durable enough to easily survive Trump. Now, I'm less sure. “Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!” — a letter saying these things, on behalf of the United States government, was actually sent to the government of Turkey. Good lord.
Senators, pay attention. You may prefer to let voters judge Trump in next year's election. But you must realize, at this point, that we may not have that long.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — With three polls showing her in the lead, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., may soon eclipse former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. That’s great news for Republicans, because Warren has a problem: The central message of her campaign is that the economy is working for the very wealthy but it is not working for ordinary Americans. Unfortunately for her, ordinary Americans disagree.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2657222" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Marc-Thiessen-color-2018-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="235" />
A Marist poll asked voters whether “the economy is working well for you personally.” Nearly two-thirds of Americans said yes. This includes large majorities in almost every demographic group. Sixty-seven percent of college graduates and 64% of those without a college education say the economy is working for them. So do 68% of whites, and 61% of nonwhite people. So do Americans of every generation: 63% of Generation Z and millennials; 69% of Generation X; 63% of baby boomers; and 69% of Greatest Generation and Silent Generation voters. So do supermajorities in every region in the country: 60% in the West, 65% in the Northeast, 67% in the Midwest, and 68% in the South. So do most voters in every type of American community: 63% of both big and small city voters; 64% of small-town voters; 66% of rural voters; and 72% of suburban voters. Most everyone, it seems, says the economy is working for them.
The only groups who disagree, Marist found, are progressives (59%), Democratic women (55%) and those who are liberal or very liberal (55%). So, when Warren declares that President Trump is “part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else,” it resonates with almost no one except those on the political left.
There is a good reason for that. Unemployment is near a record low, and the United States has about 1.6 million more job openings than unemployed people to fill them. Not only are jobs plentiful, but wages are rising. And the New York Times reported in May that “over the past year, low-wage workers have experienced the fastest pay increases.” Americans don’t just think they are doing better in the Trump economy, they are doing better. Little wonder Democrats barely mentioned the economy in Tuesday’s debate.
This progress is bad news for Warren. Why on Earth would Americans rally to her call for “big structural change” to the economy when they say the economy is working for them? Especially when they learn the structural changes Warren is proposing would cost tens of trillions of dollars and — whether she admits it or not — would require them to pay more in taxes?
Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Riedl recently added up the price tag for Warren’s proposals, and the numbers are staggering: $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years for Medicare-for-all; $2 trillion for Social Security expansion; $3 trillion for climate change and environmental policies; $2 trillion free college and student loan forgiveness; and another $1 trillion for initiatives that include free child care and housing. “Total cost: $38 trillion to $48 trillion,” Riedl says. And that’s before calculating the cost of offering free government health care to illegal immigrants, which Warren supports. There’s no way to pay for that miasma of spending with Warren’s wealth tax; it will require massive middle-class tax increases.
No wonder the so-called moderates were going after Warren so hard at Tuesday’s debate; they know it would be a disaster if she were to capture the Democratic nomination. To win in 2020, Democrats need to win over voters who like Trump’s policies but don’t like Trump. They can’t do that by telling these voters they are wrong about the economy working for them, and that they need to make peace with socialism. Instead, they need to convince voters that they can dump Trump and still keep their prosperity.
If Democrats nominate Warren, they will give voters suffering from Trump exhaustion no safe harbor. Her nomination would turn the election into an existential threat to the American economy. And since Warren said Tuesday that, if she is elected, and Democrats take back the Senate, they will “repeal the filibuster,” she will be able to pass her radical agenda by simple majority vote. That means Trump’s message — “whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me” — will ring true for millions of Americans whose votes might otherwise be up for grabs.

Texto completo: Changing your mind is hard. Changing your worldview is almost impossible.
The 1619 Project, created by the Pulitzer Center and The New York Times, aims to change our worldview about the United States by identifying our founding date as 1619, the year the first enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia.
We are used to thinking of our founding as necessarily involving documents signed by wealthy white men, asserting our right to independence and then framing our government. The 1619 Project challenges us to look at the organic birth of our nation as the moment when a group of European men decided that they could treat a group of African people as property, not human beings.
And thus was the United States of America birthed as a nation that permanently consigned people from Africa to immutable slave status, based on their skin pigmentation and geographic origin. Historically, slaves had always had a way out of slavery through serving a designated number of years, purchasing their freedom or being freed by their owners for any number of reasons. Enslaved people from Africa in the United States had no way out. They still do not, and they are still reaping the whirlwind that those European men started in 1619.
So where does this previously unacknowledged information about the birth of the American idea leave white Americans and their view of our country's beginnings? As we struggle with our country's racial history, we are trapped in a state of cognitive dissonance. What began in 1776 and what began in 1619?
The official declaration of independence from England occurred in 1776, and all of the iconic celebrations of July 4 emerged from that declaration. The foundation of social and economic relations between two groups of people, the owners/founders and the owned/enslaved, began in 1619. The United States would not have happened without the labor of people who were kidnapped from Africa and transported under brutal conditions to the Western hemisphere.
"Out of slavery - and the anti-Black racism it required - grew nearly everything that has truly made America exceptional: its economic might, its industrial power, its electoral system, diet and popular music, the inequities of its public health and education, its astonishing penchant for violence, the example it sets for the world as a land of freedom and equality, its slang, its legal system and the endemic racial fears and hatred that continue to plague it to this day," according to The Times.
Racism was constructed by the original slaveholders to justify enslavement. By 1776, slavery was well established. When the authors of the Declaration wrote that all men were created equal, they did not include men from Africa. When the Constitution was ratified, persons of African origin were consigned to property status. An entire population of Africans and their descendants have been fighting ever since to regain their legal status as human beings, citizens and equal persons under the law.
Reframing the world view of many white Americans in the light of this information requires enormous courage. If we retain the perspective that this reframing is a zero-sum game, our habitual violence and interracial hostility will continue unabated.
We cannot allow ourselves to think about the information presented in The 1619 Project as anything other than a serious effort to correct historical inaccuracies, confusions and deliberate attempts to mislead all of us. If we do that, and this document receives the widest possible consideration, we may be able to transform the worldview of Americans to a broader, more just and inclusive notion of who we are.

POLITICS: Trump-backing PAC opts not to go all in on Georgia 6th: Despite longtime GOP ties, 6th looks ever less Republican.

Texto completo: Lucy McBath entered Congress after winning a tight race in 2018 over then-U.S. Rep. Karen Handel. Only 1.02 percentage points separated McBath and Handel in Georgia's 6th Congressional District, a matter of 3,264 votes.
Conventional thinking would say McBath, a Democrat from Marietta, is in for another tight contest, possibly a rematch with Handel.
But what does the big money say? There may be safer bets.
America First Policies, a political action committee that supports Republican President Donald Trump, has announced a $1 million campaign -- using television and Facebook ads, plus text messages--to pressure 28 "swing legislators on an impeachment vote." A majority of the money will go toward the Facebook ads and text messages to spur voters to call their representatives in Congress, including McBath.
But TV will be the most high-profile part of the effort, and when it comes to McBath, America First is saying maybe later. It's aiming its TV ads at three other Democratic lawmakers, U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, now serving his fourth term in the U.S. House; U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer of Iowa, who first won election in 2018; and U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, a former CIA spy and another first-term member of Congress.
That's not to say McBath hasn't faced pressure on impeachment. Trump supporters have demonstrated outside her Sandy Springs office. Others have gathered there to stage counterdemonstrations.
America First's decision, however, may be less a comment on McBath than it is on the 6th District. Despite its longtime ties to the GOP, having been represented in Congress by the trio of Newt Gingrich, Johnny Isakson and Tom Price, the 6th is looking less and less Republican.
Age and level of education are now among the most significant factors in determining U.S. elections, and in the 6th District, they trend well for Democrats. The district is younger and better-educated than Cartwright's, Finkenauer's and Spanberger's districts.
The youngest of the three targeted districts is Finkenauer's Iowa 1st, where 26.4%of the population is over age 54. In the 6th District, 25.5% of the population falls in that category.
The real difference is education. The best-educated of the targeted districts is Spanberger's Virginia 7th, where 40.5%of its residents age 24 and over hold at least a bachelor's degree.
That's no contest for the 6th District, which has the sixth-highest level of education in the country, with 63.5% of its residents age 24 and over possessing a bachelor's degree or better.
That's something for the smart money to consider.
Cancel with care: This past week's Democratic presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio, spotlighted that state's canceling of voter registrations, a topic familiar to many Georgia election officials.
Court rulings in Ohio have been cited in Georgia cases because both states take a "use it or lose it" approach in removing "inactive" voters from voting lists. Georgia removed more than 1.4 million voter registrations from 2010 to 2018, while Republican Brian Kemp, in his role as secretary of state, was Georgia's top elections official. It becameanissuelastyearwhen Kemp ran successfully for governor against Democrat Stacey Abrams.
Proponents say the cancellations are necessary to remove voters who have died or moved. Critics say the policy is overly broad, affecting voters who often don't know about their unregistered status until Election Day.
The New York Times looked at how officials in Ohio addressed the critics' objections.
"This year," the Times wrote, "a group of elected officials in the state, mostly all moderate Republicans, tried to answer the concerns with an experiment of their own: Rather than purge the voter rolls behind closed doors as had been done in the past, the government released the full list of those to be removed this summer, and gave the list to advocacy groups. The groups said they found the list was riddled with errors.
"The result:Around 40,000 people, nearly one in five names on the list, shouldn't have been on it, the state determined. And it only found out before anyone was actually turned away at a polling place largely because of volunteer sleuthing."
Georgia eased its voter regulations somewhat during this year's legislative session.
Under House Bill 316, the same legislation that authorized the purchase of new voting machines for the state, voter registrations cannot be canceled for inactivity for eight or nine years, two years longer than under the previous state law. Also, voters must be mailed a notification 30 to 60 days before their registrations are canceled.
A victory for Hice: When the U.S.House voted this past week to curtail federal benefits provided to former U.S. presidents, it marked a win for U.S. Rep. Jody Hice, R-Monroe.
Hice sponsored the measure, which would limit the former presidents' future pensions, the annuities provided to surviving spouses and their annual allowances.
"In recent years, former presidents have had no shortage of lucrative opportunities upon leaving office," Hice said when he introduced the bill earlier this year. "Despite this, taxpayers are still footing the bill for the official expenditures of former commanders in chief."
The bill was a bipartisan effort, and its co-sponsor was U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland. Hice had tangled in the past with Cummings, who led investigations into Trump's activities as chairman of the House Oversight Committee. Cummings died the day after the presidential pension bill won House approval.
The bill now goes to the U.S. Senate, where companion legislation was proposed by U.S. Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Maggie Hassan, D-N.H.
Trump gets Abrams wrong: Trump once wrote in a tweet that Abrams "will have a terrific political future!"
But based on what he says about her on the campaign stump, he doesn't seem to know her too well.
Abrams came up repeatedly during a recent Trump event in Louisiana. The president referred several times to last year's campaign for governor between her and Kemp. He got a lot wrong. Here are a few of the biggest errors:
|Trump said that, while Abrams had "every
star"Democrat rally to her side, "all Brian Kemp had was Donald Trump." Maybe it's a matter of what Trump considers to be a "star," but several big-name Republicans came to Georgia to back Kemp. That included Trump's own vice president, Mike Pence.
|The president also said he attracted "55,000 people at that rally" for Kemp at an airport outside of Macon the Sunday before the election. Kemp's campaign disagreed. It put the attendance closer to 10,000 people.
|Finally, he said Kemp won the race by 2.5 percentage points. His math was a little off. Kemp won by less than 1.5 percentage points in Georgia's closest race for governor in decades.

Texto completo: A second complaint came as the mixed martial arts star waited to see whether prosecutors would charge him in another case.
Conor McGregor, one of the biggest stars of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, is being investigated over a sexual assault allegation, the second such case in less than 12 months, according to people familiar with the matter.
The most recent allegation relates to a complaint that a woman in her 20s was sexually assaulted in a vehicle parked outside a Dublin pub last week, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of Irish laws surrounding investigations. McGregor, a 31-year-old mixed martial arts fighter who is one of the world's highest-paid athletes, has not been charged, and the police have yet to interview him about the allegation. He was already waiting to hear whether he would be charged following a complaint that he assaulted a woman in Dublin last December.
The police passed the findings of the investigation in the first case to Ireland's prosecutor's office earlier this year. McGregor was arrested in January, questioned by law enforcement authorities and released pending further investigation, per the usual protocol in criminal investigations in Ireland and much of the rest of Europe, where a formal charge does not necessarily follow an arrest.
The allegations have not been proved, and the existence of the investigations does not imply that McGregor is guilty of any crime.
"Conor McGregor is frequently the subject of rumors," a publicist for the fighter said in an emailed statement. "He emphatically denies any report accusing him of sexual assault."
A lawyer for McGregor in Dublin did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Born in a tough, working-class section of Dublin, McGregor has helped propel U.F.C.'s popularity worldwide, though he has been involved in a flurry of police cases throughout his career.
Flanked by two bodyguards, McGregor appeared in court last week to answer charges of assaulting an elderly man at a pub in April. That case is still pending, with another hearing scheduled for next month. Security footage purporting to show the incident was leaked to the celebrity news website TMZ.
McGregor has participated in only one U.F.C. fight since 2016, a defeat last October to Khabib Nurmagomedov that ended in disgrace when a brawl broke out between their rival camps at the end of the fight. McGregor announced his retirement from the sport in March, only to hint several times that he would get back into the ring. The UF.C., which did not respond to a request for comment from The New York Times, has not announced any upcoming bouts featuring McGregor.
The Irish news media have reported on both sexual assault cases but without naming McGregor. Laws in Ireland restrict the news media from identifying individuals charged with rape unless they are convicted, which has not happened in either instance. News outlets reporting the identity of a suspect before a charge often face costly libel and breach of privacy lawsuits in Ireland. Publication after a charge is filed could lead to a more serious contempt of court indictment.
Newspapers and broadcasters have instead linked the two cases and typically described the suspect as a famous or well-known Irish sports star. Ireland's police service, known as the Garda, declined to comment on the profession of the person accused of the second assault.
"Investigations ongoing and no arrests at this time," a Garda statement said. "Owing to the nature of the investigation we will not be commenting further at this time."
McGregor's rapid rise from a destitute mixed martial arts fighter living with his mother to the U.F.C.'s most-prized asset has become one of the biggest stories in Ireland in the past decade. McGregor has largely enjoyed the attention, regularly taking to social media to brag and to show the fruits of his newfound wealth, which peaked in August 2017 when he participated in one of the most lucrative boxing matches -- a loss to the undefeated boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr.
McGregor, nicknamed The Notorious, has cultivated a bad boy reputation through over-the-top behavior that has on some occasions led to brushes with the law.
Last July, he pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct after he threw a hand truck at a bus carrying Nurmagomedov and other fighters returning to their hotel from Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Two fighters were injured by shattered glass.
Although he has not fought for a year, McGregor continues to be one of the U.F.C.'s most talked-about stars. He has a close relationship with the organization's president, Dana White, who this week ruled out a December fight -- hinted at by McGregor -- between the Irishman and the featherweight Frankie Edgar. White has been more tight-lipped when it comes to commenting on the allegations facing McGregor.
In August, five months after The New York Times first named McGregor in connection with the first sexual assault allegation, White said he knew "zero" about it, before adding: "To be honest with you, the back-and-forth that I've had with him about that is that it's not him -- it's somebody else. So I don't know."

Texto completo: Readers discuss an article about how darker-skinned southern Italians faced racism a century ago and had to struggle for acceptance.
To the Editor:
Re "How Italians Became 'White,"' by Brent Staples (Sunday Review, Oct. 13):
My very white Italian-American children find it hard to believe when I tell them that their four great-grandparents who immigrated to the United States from Sicily in the early 1900s were the brown people of their era. My paternal grandmother, Jennie, would say, "They called us bad names."
In the 1960s, when I was in high school on Long Island, we had a system of somewhat impenetrable cliques arranged by ethnicity, and I hung out with the Italian kids. I learned from the kids whose families had come from northern Italy that as a Sicilian I was less than O.K. A couple of the boys occasionally lobbed the "N" word at me. My white American children, born in a post-assimilation era, can't imagine that world.
In my family the immigrant experience, with all of its troubles and glory, shaped a family narrative embracing social equality that lives on in ensuing generations. My grandmother's staunch belief that "we are all God's children" rings just as true today.

To the Editor:
I think that Brent Staples exaggerates the extent to which Americans viewed Italians through the lens of "racism." There was plenty of skepticism and fear as millions of impoverished people -- Italian and otherwise -- poured into American cities. With them came crowding, crime, filth, disease, nondemocratic political ideas and social chaos. Urban places had not developed the physical and institutional infrastructure to accommodate this influx of needy people.
Yes, there were unfortunate events like the lynching in New Orleans and plenty of condescension toward swarthy "dagos." However, over all, American communities absorbed Italians, educated their children, provided jobs and supported their entrepreneurial efforts as small-business owners. The vast majority of Italian-Americans viewed these opportunities with gratitude, worked extremely hard and took meticulous care of their homes and families.
The results of their resilience are obvious today. As a descendant of these extraordinary people, I don't buy your victim narrative. Italian-Americans were beneficiaries of America's democratic capitalist system and pluralistic culture, not victims of it.
Laura Compagni-Sabella
Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.
To the Editor:
What a short memory Americans have of their own immigrant experience. With very few exceptions, every family came here from somewhere else and went through, to one degree or another, some challenges, bumps and bruises on their way to becoming American. But it's a bit like Snapchat, where their collective memories dissolve.
Without a trace of self-awareness, they just point at newcomers and shout: "We must raise the drawbridge! Keep them out! They are too different!" More than likely, someone (or many someones) was saying the same thing about them or their forebears when they came here.
America is -- and always has been -- a powerful, even irresistible idea that draws people to it. Understanding the meaning of America fully -- and adjusting to it -- takes some time. Freedoms are easier to grasp than responsibilities. Opportunities are more exciting and grab attention faster than do barriers and challenges. But, with some time and work, almost everyone "becomes" American and feels rewarded for the investment.
Gene Boccialetti
New York
To the Editor:
Both of my paternal grandparents were born in Ireland and emigrated to the United States around 1900. I remember their describing "Irish Need Not Apply" signs and being discriminated against in many ways. Their story is quite similar to what you have described for Italians.
As a country we have a very checkered history of our treatment of anyone not of British ancestry. Asians, Africans, South Americans, Southern Europeans, Eastern Europeans, Irish, Catholics, Muslims, Jews, Hindi -- all were treated as inferiors at one time (most still are).
Only when the accents disappeared and it became impossible to tell that someone was Italian or Irish were we "accepted" as white. Unfortunately, many still fall under the label of "them" -- inferior and to be feared.
President Trump has done a very effective job of bringing out into the open how deep and alive racism still is in America. For a "Christian" nation we fall quite short of the values that Christianity stands for; we have a lot of repair and repentance to do, a lot of forgiveness to be earned.
John Twomey

To the Editor:
Even as a third-generation half-Italian-American, I still feel a surge of nausea whenever faced with choosing an "ethnicity" on official forms or job applications. The only choice allowed for my mixed European heritage is "white," but checking it feels like a betrayal of my ancestors and a forced whitewashing of this country's true microdiversity.
I resent, every time, that my identity will be assumed into a featureless, monolithic bloc of whiteness and ascribed to an established majority I neither identify with nor aspire to. And leaving the box unchecked in protest feels even worse, like choosing voluntary self-erasure over involuntary state erasure.
Paul Leo
New York
To the Editor:
My father, whose parentage was Irish and Italian (two immigrant groups that were each reviled at some time), instilled a pride in us about our southern Italian ancestry. He didn't talk about the discrimination, perhaps because he was of the generation that produced Italian-American entertainers like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Tony Bennett. Much had improved by the mid-20th century.
With this in mind, I was mortified when Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, made his recent remarks about who should be emigrating to the United States and what the Statue of Liberty should say today ("Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet"). Is he unaware of (or in denial about) the history of his own ancestors in this country? We Italian-Americans were once as poor, wretched and hated as many of the asylum seekers trying to come to the United States today.
Mary Gordon Rossano
Wilmore, Ky.
To the Editor:
Your article cites Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, but he was not alone in the prejudice against Italians from the south of Italy in the late 19th and early 20th century. His hated rival, Woodrow Wilson, wrote in his 1902 "History of the American People": "Throughout the [19th] century men of the sturdy stock of the north of Europe had made up the main strain of foreign blood ... but now there came the multitudes of men of the lowest classes from the south of Italy and men of the meaner sort out of Hungary and Poland, men out of the ranks where there was neither skill nor energy nor any initiative of quick intelligence ... as if the countries of the south of Europe were disburdening themselves of the more sordid and hapless elements of their population."
H.D.S. Greenway

The writer is a former editorial page editor of The Boston Globe.
To the Editor:
Bravo, excellent piece! Its point is that Italians were the scary foreigners to be feared not so long ago. As an Italian-American, I am greatly troubled by how far too many of those who share my heritage support the current president's anti-immigration policies.
Had he been elected in 1916 instead of 2016, I assure you that he would have been denouncing Italians as the dangerous immigrants to be kept out.
Frank L. Cocozzelli

To the Editor:
America has never been a melting pot. Your third-grade teacher was wrong about that. It was and continues to be a boiling cauldron. And every new generation needs to learn old lessons.

Texto completo: Her novels, short stories and poetry were dense with lush and spellbinding imagery. As a teacher, one former student said, "She lived and died by the word."
Kate Braverman, a brash and theatrically dramatic writer whose novels, short stories and poetry were dense with lush and spellbinding imagery, died on Oct. 12 at her home in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 70.
Her daughter, Gabrielle Goldstein, said the cause was cardiac arrest.
Outspoken and outrageous, Ms. Braverman brought a ferocious energy to books like "Lithium for Medea" (1979), with their focus on women on society's margins.
"Ms. Braverman possesses a magical, incantatory voice and the ability to loft ordinary lives into the heightened world of myth," Michiko Kakutani wrote in her New York Times review of "Palm Latitudes" (1988), a novel about three women in a Los Angeles barrio, including La Puta de la Luna, the most famous prostitute in the neighborhood.
"The night will be as all others, treacherous, studded with disguised traps and graves," Ms. Braverman wrote of La Puta. "She will survive it. There will be gold and the danger of barter with strangers, foreigners with metallic mouths of invisible eaten coins and greed, with mouths that are miniature replicas of the city, voids, empty, less than mud or clay, which are fundamental."
Ms. Braverman -- who struggled with addictions to cocaine in the 1970s and '80s and to heroin in the 1990s -- found purpose in writing. It was more than a mission; it was a mystical conjuring that brought her characters to vivid life. Stories, she said, revealed themselves to her on the page in an almost cinematic fashion.
"It's not a flat surface but three-dimensional, with an audio track, scents, seasons, an entire substrata of sound and cadence," she told Bella Online, a women's publication, in 2018, in explaining her attraction to writing. "The page is a unique kingdom, vast, mysterious and eccentrically indigenous. It's like a dance, you do some and it does some. To have the page open itself, to shed its skin and allow you to autopsy the living and the dead, is an inexplicable experience."
She harbored no doubts that her fiction had elevated her into an exalted place in literature beside men like Saul Bellow, Joseph Conrad, Philip Roth, Ernest Hemingway and Norman Mailer.
"I should not be compared to other women," she said in 2006 in an interview on "San Francisco/unscripted," a local television show. "I do not write or live like a woman. I'm a complete outlaw in my sensibility and in my demand that women be given total access to the page, which they are not."
But, she conceded, "Sylvia Plath, 50 years later, is still not really in the canon because she dared to complain about the 'smog of cooking, the smog of hell."'
Kate Ellen Braverman was born on Feb. 5, 1949, in Philadelphia. Her mother, Millicent (Glubt) Braverman, co-owned a public relations agency, and her father, Irving, was a contractor. The family moved to Los Angeles when Kate was a child.
Kate envisioned herself as a writer from a young age and joined a writing workshop at U.C.L.A. when she was 15. When she was 16 she left home for Berkeley, where she attended high school. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a bachelor's degree in anthropology. (She earned a master's in English from Sonoma State University in the 1980s.)
In 1971 she moved back to Los Angeles, where she was a founder of the Venice Poetry Workshop. Returning to her adopted hometown reignited feelings of alienation, loneliness and loathing for the city that she described, in a 2006 interview with The San Francisco Chronicle, as a "gulag with palm trees."
She felt like a permanent outsider in Los Angeles, which she said lacked an intellectual community that recognized or appreciated her. She told The Chronicle, "I was continually having to translate myself into a local dialect that I barely spoke."
Yet she stayed there, writing more stories, poems and novels, including "Wonders of the West" (1993) and "The Incantation of Frida K." (2001), an imagined memoir of the painter Frida Kahlo, looking back at her life on her sickbed.
Reviewing the Kahlo book for NPR, the novelist Alan Cheuse said, "As with Kahlo herself, women are Braverman's great subject, but she also riffs in remarkably beautiful passages on the nature of cities and on the effects of drugs."
She became a writing teacher at the U.C.L.A. Extension Writers' Program and, in the 1990s, held workshops at her home. Her students included Janet Fitch, the author of the novel "White Oleander" (1999), and Samantha Dunn, the author of the novel "Failing Paris" (1999).
In phone interviews, both women described a high-octane and uncompromising teacher who inspired them to add propulsive power to their work. But they also said she could be tough on the students; some of them, Ms. Fitch said, wept in their cars outside Ms. Braverman's house after being criticized.
"She lived and died by the word," Ms. Dunn said. "If you were writing anything less than incendiary prose, you weren't living up to the challenge of the word."
Ms. Fitch recalled: "Her voice is constantly in my head. When something was particularly well phrased, she'd go, 'Yum, yum,' and when I write, I sometimes say, 'Yum, yum."'
Nearly 20 years after her last class, Ms. Dunn received a letter from Ms. Braverman that reminded her of her unyielding approach to literature.
"You thought writing a reasonable profession," Ms. Braverman wrote. "You thought you could wear linen and gloves. You didn't realize the habitual hazards of this art form, the contagious derangement, the exposure and subsequent addiction to toxins, the delirium of thirty hours in stark communion with a self that is insatiable for discovery."
She left Los Angeles for Alfred, N.Y., in 1995 with her second husband, Alan Goldstein, and her daughter. But after about seven years there in western New York, she moved again, to San Francisco, with Mr. Goldstein. There she found an artistic community that she felt was more welcoming to her than Los Angeles had been.
In 2006, she published "Frantic Transmissions to and From Los Angeles: An Accidental Memoir" (2006), which looked back at her life in the city she had long reviled.
Her publisher, Graywolf Press, awarded her its first nonfiction prize for that book, but she refused to accept it because, she said, the book's ending had been censored.
She accepted other honors, including an O. Henry Award in 1992. In 2004 she received the Raymond Carver Editor's Choice award and the Christopher Isherwood Foundation Fellowship.
Ms. Goldstein, her daughter, is her only immediate survivor. Her marriages to Donald McKenzie and Mr. Goldstein ended in divorce.
Ms. Braverman moved to Santa Fe about a decade ago. Her short-story collection "A Good Day for Seppuku" was published in 2018.
"Braverman pressurizes psychic landscapes into heated fields of organic matter, glowing or rotting," Katy Waldman wrote in her review of that book in The New Yorker.
Michael Clark, a longtime friend, said that a year ago Ms. Braverman told him that she was no longer writing. That retirement appeared to last less than two weeks.
"She was a dynamo and kept on writing, no matter what," Mr. Clark said by phone. "She called me 10 days ago and said, 'I have to stop, I've finished a draft and I'm exhausted."'

Texto completo: Being a woman of 50 or more has always been a kind of drag, really. We keenly understand that we are invisible in public unless we have enormous fame that surrounds us like an omnipresent picture frame, or are muttering loudly on the street. Yet being, um, older (and there is always that "um") can allow a woman the freedom to be herself and enjoy what is left of her life.
I'm being serious. For succor, I recommend Gail Collins's new book, "No Stopping Us Now," subtitled, "The Adventures of Older Women in American History." Collins, an opinion writer (and formerly the first female editorial page editor) at the New York Times, is a cheerful companion through the decades. Right from the introduction, the reader understands Collins's point of view: A woman can be kind, intelligent, hard-working and successful, but we're always going to wonder if she's coloring her hair, or has gained or lost a little weight. Nevertheless, there are dozens upon dozens of heroic stories of remarkable women in this book that will be new to the average reader. And though you may already be an expert on Eleanor Roosevelt, I was not, and thus I could be surprised by Collins's take that, as she traveled nonstop, speaking and writing on all manner of important issues, Roosevelt "was possibly having the most extraordinary middle age of any woman in American history."
This is a history book, a sprightly one. But since it begins in 1630, the narrative starts on a grim note. Middle-aged women were likely to have gaping holes in their gums where their teeth used to reside. (Personally, I'm pretty convinced that I would have died from a hit-and-run horse, as I can barely see without my 20th-century inventions, contact lenses.) Life in the early years of our country saw few comforts, and sadly one often outlived several of one's own children. Medical treatments were limited to bloodletting, homemade remedies and sometimes opium.
You recall from your American history class long ago that independent-thinking women in the pre-Revolutionary War years might be taken for witches. An Englishman visiting the colonies in 1646, Collins writes, "deplored the way in which 'every old woman with a wrinkled face, a furr'd brow, a hairy lip, a gobber tooth, a squint eye, a squeaking voice, or a scolding tongue . . . is not only suspected but pronounced for a witch."
With that warning, if women wanted to pretty themselves up they had to be rich enough to use the family bacon. I mean this literally, as Collins explains that applying bacon to one's face was said to prevent wrinkles. However, in most communities, makeup and hair dye were shunned as misleading, dishonest and reflecting the bad character of a woman trying to fool a man into marrying her.
Most women didn't have many or any career options. However, once they had launched all their children and ditched the housework, many older women won respect - the old-fashioned way. They were midwives and ministers, writers and editors. Take for instance, the author of "The Frugal Housewife," Lydia Maria Child, whose story is woven throughout these pages. She was perhaps the first-ever influencer, and though female, she traveled the country spreading her opinions on matters of dress, decorum and stain removal. (Child had another hit in 1865 with "Looking Toward Sunset," a meditation on aging.) One gets the impression that throughout the 18th and 19th centuries women were crisscrossing the country giving "talks" in parlors and auditoriums, telling their fervid audiences how to be.
One thing they could not be was too youthful. It was deceitful and unseemly. Collins quotes the author Robert Tomes, who wrote "The Bazar Book of Decorum": "Old people of the best breeding now seldom resort to the hair-dresser to refurbish their shattered and decaying frames." Since many evenings in town involved going to parties with dancing, the old people were best served - according to society - by sitting quietly in a corner, cognizant of their own obvious decline. When lovely, healthy, married women were seen enjoying themselves, well, that was almost vulgar. "To dress cheerfully and becomingly is considered as an attempt to affect youth; to converse gaily an unsuitable effort to attract admirers. There is really no limit to the ungracious things said," complained the married Caroline Kirkland.
The painful adherence to beauty standards that created the corset and later the girdle gets its due in Collins's history. Although a Brooklyn gynecologist in 1910 suggested that it was dangerous for women to wear corsets, around the same time an editorial in Harper's Bazaar suggested that eliminating this item of "foundation" would be regrettable for the older woman: "an ill-advised experiment . . . if she wishes to look neat and trim and well-groomed."
In the 1920s, youth was a queen in a short flapper dress. "The whole nation got the idea: the younger generation intended to live life full-force and, of course, never get old." The amount of fabric needed to make the average woman's outfit had dropped from a voluminous 19 1/4 yards to a trim seven yards. Americans now had movies and movie stars to emulate, as well as beauty and fashion magazines filled with ads. Collins writes that there were 7,000 beauty products on the market by 1927, and the ads she quotes are harshly phrased, terrorizing their customers into buying their wares. Naturally, corsets were required for the modern silhouette. And they continued to be worn, though they were harder to buy, during World War II, when rubber was needed for the war effort. Women were urged for the first time to locate their abdominal muscles and exercise them to flatten their tummies if the manufacturing of these foundations were to take a hiatus. (Women complained. There was a backlash, and the government rethought a restriction on sales, deciding that girdles were helpful to the many women working in factories.)
"No Stopping Us Now" devotes much more time and space to politics and good works. From America's first female senator, Jeannette Rankin of Montana, to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, American women devoted themselves for years and years to winning the vote and equality under the law. Women were the trailblazers of the civil rights movement as well. Many of the pioneering women we used to read about - Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Jane Addams, Alice Paul, Carrie Chapman Catt and others - were the mothers of both movements, some starting settlement houses for the poor.
We gals have made a ton of progress over the 389 years covered in Collins's book. We may one day even conquer the White House. But my favorite story belongs to Frances Willard, a leader of the temperance movement, whose interests included suffrage and "health reform." Willard learned to ride a bicycle at the wobbly old age of 53 and then wrote about it: "The most remarkable, ingenious and inspiring motor ever yet devised upon this planet." She became a devoted cyclist and advocate for the exercise and the experience. The year was 1895.

Texto completo: A New Hampshire church will resume services Sunday morning, a week after a shooting during a wedding last Saturday that left a bishop seriously wounded.
New England Pentecostal Ministries in Pelham, N.H., will reopen for services at 11 a.m. Sunday, though Sunday school classes are cancelled, the church announced on its website.
“During this time we understand there are a number of questions and concerns, and our goal is to remain on one accord. This is the time to band together in unity through praise and worship in the Lord, along with fasting and prayer," the statement from the church said.
Dale Holloway, 37, was arrested last Saturday after police said he barged into the church during a wedding and shot Bishop Stanley Choate in the chest and the bride, Claire McMullen, in the arm, before Holloway was tackled to the ground by wedding guests.
Holloway had been released from a Massachusetts prison less than a year ago for beating his estranged girlfriend.
The statement warned that police will be in the parking lot Sunday morning for security, but said churchgoers should not be alarmed.

Texto completo: It's never the wrong time to do the right thing.
Everyman Theatre is showing Radio Golf, the final play in renowned playwright August Wilson's 10-play opus, 'The American Century Cycle.' Radio Golf brings the "crackle of a comedy with old-fashioned melodrama," according to the New York Times, and highlights the challenges faced by modern-day African Americans straddling the line between monetary success and cultural assimilation.
The play opened Oct. 15 and runs through Nov. 17 at Everyman Theatre, located in the up-and-coming Market Center District of Downtown Baltimore. This is the fourth August Wilson production from Everyman, after Fences (2002 and 2015) and Gem of the Ocean (2008). The Harlem Classical Theatre's Associate Artistic Director Carl Cofield makes his Everyman directorial debut with this play.
Radio Golf tells the story of Harmond Wilks, played by Jamil Mangan, a young African-American real estate developer running for Mayor of Pittsburgh in 1997. He opens a campaign office in the heart of Pittsburgh's Hill District, his childhood neighborhood that's fallen into disrepair.
Together with his business partner Roosevelt, played by Jason B. Mcintosh, and wife Mame, a resident company member Dawn Ursula, Harmond's grand plan to develop a neglected block in order to erect a high-rise apartment complex - complete with a Whole Foods and Starbucks - is challenged by two members of the Hill community, Sterling, played by Anton Floyd, and Elder Joseph Barlow, played by Charles Dumas. Harmond must face his uncovered past and weigh the impact and true costs of his personal progress if he chooses to ignore his heritage and legacy.
"Although Radio Golf is set in 1997, August Wilson saw into the future and started this conversation around life in America for upper-class Black folk," Director Carl Cofield said. "How important is success if you're denying and destroying your family's history and culture in order to get it? It's a modern examination of what the American
Dream means today, and has huge resonance in Baltimore and other urban centers."
Because the themes of neighborhood revitalization and cultural crossover directly affect both the Market Center, Bomo area, and Baltimore at large, Everyman is hosting multiple events that will engage community partners and begin to breach these topics in order to start a dialogue between neighbors and engaged Baltimore supporters. These include a neighborhood cleanup day and community panel discussions.
"We specifically chose to bring Radio Golf to Baltimore because of the mirror it holds up to our neighborhood and how it reflects some of the greatest challenges that Baltimore faces today," says Everyman Founding Artistic Director Vincent M. Lancisi. "August Wilson is one of the most revered playwrights of our age. His legacy of chronicling the American century decade by decade has left us with a treasure trove of great stories. Radio Golf is one that is immediate, relevant, and funny all at the same time."
Radio Golf runs from Oct. 15 - Nov. 17 and you can purchase your tickets online at everymantheatre. org, by phone at (410) 752 -2208, or at the Everyman Theatre Box Office at 315 W. Fayette St., Baltimore, Md.

Media meltdowns and political polarization: Joel Kotkin

Texto completo: The mainstream media increasing appears much like the classic tale of the boy who cried wolf so often that when the wolf showed up no one believed him.
Similarly, since the bust of the Mueller report, and the evaporation of countless other “blockbuster” exposés, the media’s credibility in the ongoing impeachment saga is now widely doubted, even if this time they may actually be right about presidential misdeeds.
This divide can be seen in public perceptions of the news media. Although somewhat improved from its low point in 2016, only 40 percent of Americans, according to Gallup, trust the media, compared to over 50 percent in 1999. As befits the media’s increasingly partisan stance, the small improvement over 2016 comes almost entirely from Democrats. Only 15% of Republicans and barely a third of independents now trust media compared to nearly 70% of Democrats.
Once the news business had enough sense of propriety and professionalism to at least maintain an appearance of objectivity. There’s ample reason, as Glenn Reynolds suggests, to see many mainstream journalists as little more than “Democrats with bylines,” willing participants in what long-time leftist and fiercely anti-Trump reporter Matt Taibbi describes as the upper bureaucracy’s “permanent coup” against Trump. If this “coup” now actually succeeds, it will be one that will simply accentuate hostility to the media among a large segment of the population.
Media faces an economic crisis
No president has suffered such total opposition from powerful media. In his first year in office, stories about Trump were 62 percent negative, notes Pew, almost three the rate for Obama and more than twice that for George W. Bush, certainly no media favorite. His positive coverage was barely 5 percent, one eighth that enjoyed by President Obama. Some have thrived from naked partisanship, including an increasingly aggressive series of pro-Trump outlets. The New York Times, de facto leader of the anti-Trump media lynch mob, has seen its subscriptions burgeon, notably online.
But the Times enjoys a unique status with upper-class, educated readers. In contrast the mass audience seems to be turned off with the non-stop political haranguing. The almost comically anti-Trump CNN has seen its ratings drop so far that it now trails not only primetime leaders Fox, but has fallen to 15th behind ESPN, Hallmark Channel, History, TBS and others. Overall, all forms of media — television, radio, newspapers — have been suffered double-digit drops since 2016, according to Pew.
The timing couldn’t be worse, given the economic decline of traditional media stemming from the shift to online. Google alone made $4.7 billion last year from news publishers whose industry continues to shrink, losing an estimated 40 percent of its 2001 job base.
The collapse is most evident on the local level, including local television stations whose ratings have plummeted. Over 1,800 local papers have gone out of existence since 2004, notes a recent University of North Carolina study, and many more have stripped their staffing levels, creating numerous “news deserts” across the country.
The decline in local coverage, suggests the Nieman Lab at Harvard, has been filled by national partisan online media, giving ever more influence to media based in New York, Washington and San Francisco.
The new sociology of media
In the past independent, or at least quirky, voices could emerge from the hinterlands. When I was a young reporter, papers like the Kansas City Star, the Louisville Courier and the old Los Angeles Herald Examiner were well-staffed, great dailies that not only covered news, but often with a very different perspective than the large coastal media.
Even in places like New York and Washington, the editorial workforce has been transformed, in part because of high housing costs. The journalist of the 1980s was often a middle-class homeowner who could afford to live in the suburbs of New York and Washington. My neighbor at the Washington Post was a hard-drinking Italian working-class guy whose brother was a Baltimore cop.
Today that kind of working-class journalist has been replaced by younger reporters who often hail from elite universities. These young journalists, as Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes noted, did not have to cover city councils and other boring local minutiae, leaping directly from graduate school into major newspapers and radio and television outlets. They may be good test-takers, but literally know nothing about the real world that people unlike themselves inhabit.
Overall, the new breed of reporters almost universally follow the progressive party line. In 2018, barely 7 percent of U.S. reporters identified themselves as Republicans; some 97 percent of journalists’ political donations go to Democrats.
But the new class order in journalism is not just a problem for conservatives. The gaping chasm between the elite journalists and working-class people, suggest left-leaning sociologists John Russo and Sheri Linkon, leads reporters to blame small-town residents and rural people for Trump without taking time to actually examine their voting behavior, life experience and attitudes.
Ahead: A troubled future
It was widely hoped the internet would forge an ever more diverse media. Yet, so far, we see a sad trend to homogeneity. This is likely to get worse as the tech oligarchs expand their control of media pipelines and continue to purchase major publications that were once proud exemplars of independent American journalism.
This takeover could become downright scary, particularly if there is a change of parties in Washington. There are growing calls, notably in The New York Times, to have Washington limit media that might appeal to the unhinged elements of the alt-right; progressives in some states, including New Jersey, have even called for the creation of state-supported media, not exactly something healthy for a democracy built on free speech and open discussion.
Many in media hope non-stop impeachment coverage, or continued unraveling of Trump’s inner circle, will both revive their fortunes and expel the hated Trump. The murky events in Ukraine also could undermine the credibility of the fledgling pro-Trump media, which could lead to even greater media homogeneity.
The emerging impeachment saga is likely to accelerate not only the alienation of much of the population from the press, but also create challenges for our democracy. With the demise of press diversity and openness, readers will be increasingly faced with a media that barely hides its prejudices, but instead offers largely alternative realities that may be only occasionally real and rarely edifying.

Texto completo: The New York Times aseguró que Iván Archivaldo Guzmán alias ‘El Chapito’, hermanastro de Ovidio Guzmán López , alias ‘ El Ratón ‘ o ‘ El Nuevo Ratón ‘ fue quien encabezó el rescate del también hijo del narcotraficante Joaquín ‘ El Chapo ‘ Guzmán , exlíder del Cártel de Sinaloa (CDS).
A decir de la publicación, ‘El Chapito’ habría sido detenido inicialmente pero pudo escapar según fuentes pues un grupo de sicarios superó a las fuerzas militares mexicanas.

Leer más: Liberan a Ovidio Guzmán, hijo de El Chapo, poco después de anunciar su captura
‘Una vez libre, el hermano mayor orquestó una asombrosa muestra de fuerza para conseguir la liberación de su hermano, Ovidio’, se lee en la nota en del New York Times en inglés.
‘La acción no sólo consistió en tomar como rehenes a los soldados, sino en secuestrar a sus familias, de acuerdo con las dos personas informadas sobre el asunto, quienes no estaban autorizadas a hablar públicamente’, señaló el periódico.
Según versiones que circularon el día de lo ocurrido pero que no han sido desmentidas ni confirmadas por autoridades, sicarios del Cártel de Sinaloa tenían la orden de asesinar a familiares de elementos castrenses, de los cuales habían obtenido direcciones en caso de que no se llegara a ningún acuerdo para la liberación del hijo de ‘ El Chapo ‘ Guzmán .
Y aunque dichas versiones no han sido confirmadas, basta con recordar las declaraciones del propio presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador ( AMLO ) quien aseguró que respalda a quienes tomaron la decisión de liberar a Ovidio Guzmán López pues estaban en riesgo las vidas de muchos seres humanos, ‘porque no se trata de masacres pues eso ya se terminó’.
Recordemos que el pasado 17 de junio, Ovidio Guzmán , alias ‘ El Ratón ‘, fue detenido por autoridades federales en la capital de Sinaloa, Culiacán, lo que provocó una serie de balaceras y hechos violentos donde se reportó un saldo de 8 muertos, 16 heridos y 51 reos prófugos.

Texto completo: A woman plunged several feet into an open construction zone pit on a Midtown sidewalk Friday afternoon, authorities said.
Emergency responders swarmed to the scene at Eighth Ave. and W. 35th St. about 2:45 p.m. to pull the woman out of the concrete crater, two blocks from Penn Station.
Medics took her to Bellevue Hospital with injuries that were not considered life-threatening.
Witnesses said the hole was covered, but the woman fell through the lid.
"[The cover] flipped and she dropped like a bag of sand. Like it was trapdoor," wrote New York Times Editor Christopher Mele on Twitter. "She was like two paces ahead of me."
Mele said that the woman "dropped like five feet."
"(It) looked like she hit the back of her head but never lost consciousness but still scary," he wrote.
On Tuesday, Verizon utility workers discovered the decomposed body of a homeless man inside a manhole near Columbus Circle.
The man was later identified by police as Cesar Gabriel Cortez, 41, of Georgia. The city medical examiner will determine the cause of his death.

Texto completo: 'Tis the season for fake spiders, light-up ghosts, tiny candy bars, and tacky costumes. All that Halloween stuff can make your bank account balance look downright scary! So, let's talk about three simple tips for saving money on Halloween.
1. Don't buy name-brand candy
There was a time in my life when I was overly concerned with being the "cool" house on the block. You know, the one with the really legit, exciting candy at Halloween — maybe even some full-size candy bars.
But when I saw the price tag at the store, that need to impress the neighbors left quick. I thought, Nope! Sorry, cute neighbor kids. You're getting the generic brand. I can buy a huge bag of it for half the price!
If you're on a tight budget, don't feel pressured to splurge and get the expensive candy. The kids will get plenty, and they'll all be on sugar highs anyway, so they'll never know the difference.
2. Scale back on Halloween parties
Halloween parties are pretty elaborate these days with huge spreads of food, amazing costumes, and even signature cocktails. If you're hosting or attending one, just be wise with what you spend. After all, Halloween is just one day!
If you're hosting, ask your guests to bring a dish to share. Set a budget for yourself on party supplies and decorations, and stick to it!
If you're attending someone else's party, don't feel pressured to bring the fanciest bottle of wine or go overboard with buying the most impressive costume. You don't want to go into November stressed out about overspending on this one day.
3. You can decide not to celebrate Halloween
Okay, I honestly don't love Halloween. Not for any spiritual or moral reason, it's simply because I'm not creative. And I'm terrible at coming up with costumes! Thankfully, my girls usually want to be princesses. That's something Amazon can fix. But I dread the day when they want something more imaginative. I'm not the mom who just whips up a costume out of odds and ends in my craft closet.
But guess what? No one says we must celebrate Halloween. There's no shame or guilt in a graceful no if Halloween doesn't fit your budget this year. If you sit this holiday out, you'll save so much money on candy, costumes, and ugly plastic partywear. Plus, you'll save time and energy. You can always jump back in next year, when you have room in your budget.

EXCHANGE --- Business &amp; Finance News: Journal Publisher Reaches Deal to Put News on Facebook

Texto completo: News Corp reached a deal to let Facebook Inc. feature headlines from The Wall Street Journal and other Dow Jones media properties, as well as the New York Post, in the social-media giant's news section, the companies said.
Other publications that have agreed to participate include the Washington Post, BuzzFeed News and Business Insider, people familiar with the matter said. The New York Times has been in talks with Facebook, but a spokeswoman for the paper declined to comment on whether it had reached a deal.
The deal, for which News Corp will be paid a licensing fee, presented some obstacles due to the Journal's digital subscription business model, people familiar with the matter said. Now that the issue has been settled, the way is cleared for the product to launch as early as the end of the month. Financial terms weren't disclosed.
The licensing fees Facebook is offering range from the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for smaller publishers to a few million for bigger ones, and substantially higher than that for the very largest outlets, according to people familiar with the matter.
"People want to see high-quality news on Facebook," said Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive. "I'm excited we'll have the opportunity to include award-winning journalism from The Wall Street Journal [and other U.S. News Corp properties] in our news tab."
Facebook has sought to include news from about 200 different publications, although it is offering to pay only about a quarter of the news organizations that will be involved, people familiar with the matter have said.
The News Corp arrangement would allow headlines from properties in its Dow Jones unit, including the Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch, Financial News and Mansion Global, as well as the New York Post, to appear in the Facebook news section, linking to the publications' sites.
For nonsubscribers, links to Journal stories that are behind the site's paywall would trigger a prompt for the reader to sign up.
Certain headlines appearing in Facebook's news section will be curated by editors, while others will be selected by the company's algorithm, people familiar with the matter said. The "Top News" section will feature about 10 headlines selected by human editors. Subsections such as sports or entertainment and a "suggested for you" section will be selected by algorithm. The feed won't include any advertising, the people said.
The move to pay for news comes as the big tech platforms have come under growing legal and regulatory scrutiny. Alphabet Inc.'s Google has resisted paying publishers but recently announced changes to how it ranks stories on its news page to better promote original content, another long-running complaint from publishers.
News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and BuzzFeed Chief Executive Jonah Peretti have both called on Facebook and Google to pay organizations that provide quality news.
"Facebook deserves credit for recognizing the principle of journalistic provenance," News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson said Friday. "Mark Zuckerberg seems personally and professionally committed to ensuring that high-quality journalism has a viable, valued future."

ONLY IN THE AJC STONE MOUNTAIN: Street with KKK link slated to be renamed

Texto completo: As a little girl, before the roads were paved, Lydia Shumake made a lot of happy memories on a street that bore a controversial name.
For decades, her aunt and cousin's home in the city of Stone Mountain bordered Venable Street, named for the family that used to own Stone Mountain and had strong ties to the Ku Klux Klan, according to archives and records. Venable Street runs for four blocks through Shermantown, the historically African American part of the city of Stone Mountain, where Shumake often visited her family while growing up.
Spearheaded by members of the Shermantown community, a push to counter the negative stigma that accompanies the Venable name has gained steam in recent months. The Stone Mountain City Council is set to vote Nov. 7 to rename Venable Street to Eva Mamie Lane -- named after Shumake's aunt and cousin, Eva Jewell Greene and Mamie Ella Lane.
The mother and daughter were considered pillars of the Stone Mountain community, known for their outreach efforts, the leadership-based organizations they founded and the charity they provided to those in need. Greene died in 2006 at age 85, and her daughter died earlier this year at 77.
"My aunt and my cousin have given their lives and made an impact for that community," Shumake said. "It shows it's a new day coming in Stone Mountain, that they're getting rid of all that negativity."
'We have moved forward'
The name change would rename the entire length of Venable Street, which is less than half a mile long on the east side of the small city. From the corner near where Greene and Lane lived, the top of Stone Mountain is visible above the trees.
It's unclear exactly when the street was named and whether it was named after a specific member of the Venable family. Brothers William and Samuel Venable previously owned Stone Mountain, which they used as a granite quarry. They gave the Klan permission to meet at the mountain, where the group staged a cross burning and "rebirth" in 1915, according to Atlanta Journal-Constitution archives.When the Venables sold the property to the state in the 1950s, it was designated to become a memorial to the Confederacy.
Decades later, James Venable became the Imperial Wizard of the National Knights of the Klan for nearly 25 years -- a fact noted in his obituary that ran in the New York Times. He was also a mayor of Stone Mountain, using the nearby land for annual Klan rallies, newspaper stories stated.
Shermantown residents remember seeing the KKK march through town in the 1960s on its way to the mountain.
"We would have to get in the house,"Shumake said. "We would have to hide down on that floor."
Residents and leaders in Stone Mountain -- which is now about two-thirds black -- said changing the street name is a way to shed the negative stigma that accompanies the city's history. The past links to hatred and racism, they said, do not represent the welcoming and diverse spirit of the city today. It also follows a pattern in communities across DeKalb County of reckoning with past acts of racism and highlighting the positive contributions of African Americans.
"This will help people to see the positive side of what has happened in the community," said Vivian Moore, a longtime family friend who treated Greene as her own mother. "And how much we have moved forward."
Paving the way
Eva Jewell Greene and Mamie Ella Lane were not elected officials, and their names probably do not ring a bell for most metro Atlanta residents. But in Stone Mountain and the surrounding neighborhood, they were leaders and organizers.
Many remember the mother-daughter duo for the outreach organizations they founded and led: the DeKalb Economic Opportunity Authority, the Stone Mountain Negro Civic League, the DeKalb Neighborhood Leadership Institute and the Georgia Citizens Coalition on Hunger.
The family lived in a modest one-story home next to a building that Greene's husband, Henry, used as a shop and grill. In 1963, Lane turned the building -- at the corner of Venable and Third streets -- into the House of Bethel Prayer Chapel. There, she held prayer groups every Tuesday and did outreach ministry.
The two women were strong community advocates. Family and friends say Greene, whom many called "Mother Greene," helped to eventually get the roads paved in the neighborhood. Around Shermantown, they used their personal relationships to help their neighbors, often opening up their home to people who needed a place to stay.
"This is where my aunt did most of her prayer teaching and studying," Shumake said while cleaning out her aunt and cousin's old living room. The home, built in 1933, is still packed with books and fine china.
She remembers visiting here during the summer, on weekends or on holidays. She loved her aunt's biscuits and rolls, eating them around the dining room table with her cousin. Greene, serving the meals, was insistent on formality and table manners when they dined on the china plates.
The story goes that many area politicians, such as the late Sheriff-elect Derwin Brown, would not launch a run for office before first visiting the house and getting a blessing from Greene and Lane.
Moore enjoyed visiting their home simply to "sit with them and just listen to the stories they told." Moore credits "Mother Greene" with teaching her about outreach and community organizing.
"Mamie was right by her side. Wherever Mother went, Mamie's right there," Moore said. When Greene died, her daughter took over a lot of her work.
'Spirit of reconciliation' Ahead of the Nov. 7 vote, city
officials seem generally supportive of the street name change. Several City Council members knew both women personally.
"They were very great folks," Mayor Patricia Wheeler said, remembering when Greene would often call her out of the blue and ask her to meet to discuss a city issue. "She was a wonderful, pleasant person and is still missed a great deal. She and her daughter both."
At a recent public hearing on the measure, eight people spoke about how "Eva Mamie Lane" would appropriately honor the two beloved figures, while moving on from the negative implications attached to the Venable name.
Lance Hammonds, a vice president for the DeKalb branch of the NAACP, told the council that the proposal follows a "spirit of reconciliation" happening across the county. That includes the plaque recently installed next to the Confederate monument in Decatur Square, intended to provide a more accurate account of history and the purpose of the monument.
"The Venable Street name is rooted in hate," Hammonds said. "The city of Stone Mountain has an opportunity to choose how it wants to represent itself to the world. You can choose a symbol of hate and terror, or you can choose symbols of love and reconciliation."
Four rows back at the meeting, Shumake looked on proudly as the goodwill of her aunt and cousin were repeatedly lauded. The legacy would live on.

Texto completo: 2019 is the year of the woman. Or so it certainly seems from the line-up for the 28th edition of the Book Festival of the Marcus Jewish Community Center of Atlanta (MJCCA), taking place across two weeks this year from Oct. 30 to Nov. 18. As always, readings, panels, and author talks represent a broad range of genres and diverse subjects, but for whatever reason, women and women's issues seem to have taken an especially prominent role in this year's festival.
"It honestly wasn't that much by design," says Festival Director Pam Morton. "But we definitely feel like that's been a trending topic."
Each year, organizers take a broad look at authors and titles they think could be a match for Atlanta audiences at the popular annual event. And as Morton suggests, organizers also try to keep an eye on current events and the issues at the center of widespread community conversations.
At each festival, certain trends emerge, and the 28th festival shaped up with an extraordinary number of women authors and notable speakers. A headlining appearance by former presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and a talk by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jodi Kantor, whose reports on Harvey Weinstein kicked off the #MeToo movement, will help set the tone.
Clinton will appear at the festival on Nov. 18 at 6:30 p.m. along with her daughter Chelsea to discuss their new book "The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Storiesof Courageand Resilience"in conversation Dr. ValerieMontgomeryRice, President and Dean of Morehouse School of Medicine. In their first book together, the mother and daughter co-authors celebrate the women who have inspired them throughout their lives and careers. Profiles include 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, civil rights activist Dorothy Height, writer Rachel Carson, LGBTQ trailblazer Edie Windsor, historian Mary Beard and swimmer Diana Nyad.
One of the most prominent stories involving women in recent years was the news of Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment and abuse. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jodi Kantor, who along with fellow reporter Megan Twohey broke the story for the New York Times, will discuss the new book "She Said" in conversation with Times Bureau Chief Kim Severson on Nov. 5 at 7:30 p.m. In the book, Kantor reveals how the two reporters broke the story and also delves into the consequences of reporting on the #MeToo movement, in addition to describing the difficult journeys of the women who spoke up.
Also bound to be popular with festival-goers is the Nov. 17 appearance of Nikki Haley, former governor of South Carolina and former United States ambassador to the United Nations, at 7:30 p.m. Haley's new memoir "With All Due Respect" offers a first-hand perspective and a behind-the-scenes account of her tenure in the Trump administration.
On Nov. 6 at 7:30 p.m. Pat Mitchell will speak about her book "Becoming a Dangerous Woman." Mitchell's book tells the true story of her journey from being raised on a cotton farm in rural Georgia to becoming a prominent TV and film producer and the first female CEO of PBS and president of CNN Productions.
On Nov. 8 at noon, popular New York style icon Tziporah Salamon offers a very different event, a first for the MJCCA Book Fest, a one-woman stage show in which she tells the story of her Hungarian parents who survived the Holocaust by fleeing to Israel, then New York.
One of today's most acclaimed novelists, Alice Hoffman, speaks about her latest novel "The World That We Knew," a tale of a mother and daughter that unfolds against the backdrop of Europe during the Nazi regime and World War II, on Nov. 10 at 3:30 p.m. in conversation with writer and former AJC contributor Greg Changnon.
Other notable women authors this year include Bari Weiss, speaking about her new book "How to Fight Anti-Semitism" on Nov. 16 at 8 p.m., and author Heather Morris speaking about the follow-up to her bestselling novel "The Tattooist of Auschwitz" titled "Cilka's Journey" on Nov. 4 at noon. Abby Chava Stein will discuss her journey from being born male in a dynastic rabbinical family in a Hasidic Jewish community in Brooklyn to transitioning to female covered in her book "Becoming Eve" on Nov. 14 at 7:30 p.m., and historian Julie Salamon presents her new book about the 1985 terrorist killing of Leon Klinghoffer titled "An Innocent Bystander" on Nov. 4 at 7:30 p.m.
Although women seem to have taken center stage this year, there are still plenty of headlining events by male authors. On Nov. 9 at 8 p.m., former federal prosecutor Preet Bharara discusses his new book on the legal system "Doing Justice: A Prosecutor's Thoughts on Crime, Punishment, and the Rule of Law" in conversation with Atlanta journalist Bill Nigut.

Texto completo: An incredible story of amnesia and family trauma hits Netflix, and the tale of Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn's friendship airs on Lifetime.
What's Streaming
TELL ME WHO I AM Stream on Netflix. At age 18, Alex Lewis woke up from a weeklong coma to discover that he had survived a devastating motorcycle accident, but lost most of his memory. At the hospital, he realizes he can't remember who he is, how to walk or anything about his past -- but he recognizes his identical twin brother, Marcus. This documentary follows the story of Alex's recovery with Marcus as his guide, filling him in on the details of his childhood. But roughly a decade later, after the twins' mother dies, Alex starts to question whether the childhood Marcus reconstructed for him was truthful, going on to uncover childhood trauma that he and his brother experienced before the accident. In his review for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny wrote that although the brothers recounted their story in a 2013 memoir, the film "functions as a continuation of the book, and ends in a staggering sequence in which Marcus is finally able to relay the whole truth to his brother."
THE BLOB Stream on Criterion Channel. Sometimes, there's nothing scarier than something that can't be explained, and that's at the heart of what's terrorizing a rural Pennsylvania town in this 1958 horror film. "Well it's kind of like ... it's kind of like a mass; it keeps getting bigger and bigger," the protagonist, Steve (Steve McQueen), says as he struggles to describe it to the local police. As Steve tries to warn the town, the gelatinous villain goes on to gobble up the local mechanic and invade the movie theater. Then people discover its weakness. While the film was not particularly well received by critics at the time, it has become a cult classic that has inspired a festival in Phoenixville, Pa., one of the filming locations.
LOOKING FOR ALASKA Stream on Hulu. Charlie Plummer stars in this television adaptation of John Green's book that's based on the author's experiences at boarding school in Alabama. Miles (Plummer), a transfer student at Culver Creek Preparatory High School, ingratiates himself with a gang of new friends, and becomes captivated by Alaska (Kristine Froseth), a fellow classmate who's coping with her mother's death. The eight-part limited series follows their relationship, and the unexpected tragedy that affects Miles and his new friends.
What's on TV
PATSY & LORETTA 8 p.m. on Lifetime. Two Broadway stars portray country music stars in this Lifetime movie about Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn's friendship. Already well established in her career, Cline (Megan Hilty) takes a young Lynn (Jessie Mueller) under her wing, helping her navigate the male-dominated Nashville music industry. They soon become close friends, touring together and working to balance their family lives with life on the road. Callie Khouri, who wrote "Thelma & Louise" and created the TV series "Nashville," directs.

Texto completo: America's dual faith in individual liberty and democracy is under attack by the president's populism.
As the author of a recent book titled "What Was Liberalism?," I have been chided by critics for joining a chorus of doomsayers. The stock of liberalism certainly looked low in 2016, when I began my research: Donald Trump was elected president and the British decided to leave the European Union. But Mr. Trump's approval ratings have never climbed above the mid-40s, while the British seem to be regretting their rash decision. The popularity of nativist and reactionary parties in Europe has receded from its high-water mark of two or three years ago. So many liberal Democrats have decided to run against Mr. Trump that they can't fit in one room.
If a liberal is simply someone who agrees with the traditional Democratic platform, then it's safe to say that the rumors of liberalism's demise are, at the very least, premature. Nor, despite Mr. Trump's relentless insistence that the party has surrendered its agenda to the left-wing "Squad," have most liberals abandoned their core faith in free markets or their instinctive patriotism. The ranks of the slightly-left-of-center have, if anything, grown under Trump.
But there is an older understanding of liberalism that is deeply endangered, that will not revive on its own, that will be rescued only through conscious choices by liberals themselves.
What I have in mind is a liberalism more of means than of ends, a belief that individual and minority-group rights can be protected only in a society governed by the rule of law, neutral institutions and secular, rational debate. This broader doctrine, which encompasses both the modern left and the modern right, has a disputed genealogy. Some begin their story with John Locke, with the idea of government created by individuals for their own benefit. Others begin with Adam Smith, the first exponent of the doctrine of the free market.
I start with James Madison, who was as committed as either Locke or Smith to the supremacy of individual liberty but was acutely aware of the inherent tension between liberty and democracy. Madison recognized that "the people" can be as tyrannical as a monarch. It is not enough, he wrote in Federalist 51, "to guard the society against the oppression of the rulers"; it is equally necessary "to guard one part of the society against the oppression of the other part." What we now call a "liberal democracy" is a state where majoritarianism is tempered by a respect for individual rights as well as the rights of political or ethnic minorities.
The opposite of liberalism is not conservatism, as we understand the term in modern America, but populism. The illiberal populism of Donald Trump, Hungary's Viktor Orban or Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, each of whom was more or less fairly elected, entails the cynical and reckless use of the mechanisms of democracy to disenfranchise political minorities, politicize the state, stigmatize immigrants and other "outsiders," and diminish civil liberties. Populists address an exclusionary "us." As Mr. Trump himself once put it with rare clarity, "The only important thing is the unification of the people -- because the other people don't mean anything." Populism is democracy without liberalism.
We suffer from a confusion of terms, and not only in regard to liberalism. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are routinely referred to as "populists," including in this newspaper, presumably because they assail the rich. But so did Theodore Roosevelt. In his day, as in ours, the rich vacuumed up almost all the value produced by the economy. Does pointing that out make you a populist? Does denying that claim, or endorsing the virtues of gross inequality, mean that you are not a populist? The thought is absurd. None of the Democratic candidates would talk about, or treat, "the people" as Mr. Trump has done. They are not populists. Are they liberals? Bernie Sanders -- who calls himself a socialist, opposes free trade and shows very little regard for the working of the free market -- is not. I have my doubts about Elizabeth Warren. But they're not populists either.
Today, paradoxically, it is not liberals but conservatives who endanger liberalism. The secular, free-market conservatives who voted for Ronald Reagan accepted the basic apparatus of a liberal society. But Mr. Reagan also welcomed into the party extremists and conservative evangelicals who thought about politics in far more absolute terms. Over time, those groups took over the host body of the Republicans, leaving us with an illiberal party that represents half the country. Today's Republican leaders, with the vehement support of their base, have threatened the autonomy of the federal and state judiciary, treated intelligence and law-enforcement agencies as instruments of the "deep state," attacked the press and pulled down the empire of science, reason and fact into the mire of "fake news."
It may be that a combination of the impending impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump and a Democratic victory in 2020 will break the illiberal fever. Certainly any imaginable Democratic victor would put an end to attacks on the government and the press. But it is not, in the end, the formal rules and institutions that sustain liberal democracy. It is the widespread faith in them, what we call "norms." Forty years of swelling illiberalism on the right -- and some reciprocal illiberalism on the left -- have deeply corroded that faith.
So what can a Democratic president do to restore liberal norms? The resentment that Mr. Trump has exploited is plainly rooted in decades of middle-class stagnation and rising inequality. A left-of-center candidate like Elizabeth Warren would drain the toxins with bold moves to lower the cost of public goods like education and health care and yank the billionaires down from their stratosphere.
Liberals would like to consign the whole problem to economics, the language of which is second nature to them. Reaching into the national culture runs against the grain of their policy-oriented ethos. And didn't Barack Obama spend eight years trying to bridge the divide between red and blue America, only to find it deeper at the end than it had been at the beginning? As intellectually conscientious a president as we are ever likely to have, Mr. Obama rarely strayed from the language of reason -- but he left behind a nation consumed by unreason.
Yet to abandon that effort is to accept a new version of "us" and "them," but with the Trumpian terms reversed. Modern liberalism came into being with Franklin Roosevelt, who forged a collective language of "we" without abandoning the "I" of individual liberty to which Madison and Jefferson had devoted themselves. Polarization has persuaded growing numbers of people on the left that the national "we" is a fiction propagated by straight white men. They would challenge Mr. Trump's white-identity politics with an "other identity" politics that emphasizes the intrinsic difference of historically marginalized groups, whether African-Americans or L.G.B.T.Q. persons, rather than their right to full membership in the national community. This is a recipe for endless cultural warfare, and it will not be easy, especially for an ideologically driven figure like Senator Warren, to resist that tidal pull.
In a rare slip that exposed his true feelings, Mr. Obama once said that "bitter" people "cling to guns or religion," or racism, xenophobia or protectionism, "as a way to explain their frustrations." The clear implication is that while liberal values like diversity, unlimited personal autonomy and secularism are universal, conservative values are a kind of pathology. Most liberals, at least under truth serum, would probably say the same.
A Democratic president, whatever his or her actual feelings, will have to take conservative values more seriously, as long as they share the same liberal root system. Democrats on the left hardly believe that only bitter people want to restrict free trade. They should accept that the same is true of people who want to see limits on immigration or balk at the modern politics of gender.
The poisons that now corrupt our national bloodstream will not be washed clean by a Democratic victory in 2020. That would only mark the beginning of liberal renewal.

Texto completo: Lizzo's breakthrough tune, "Truth Hurts," which spent six weeks on top of Billboard's Hot 100 chart this year, features the signature line: "I just took a DNA test/ Turns out I'm 100 percent that b----." The lyric originated from a 2017 tweet by singer Mina Lioness and was turned into a meme, which was then used in Lizzo's song "Healthy," created in 2017.
The songwriting brothers Justin and Jeremiah Raisen, who worked on "Healthy," claim say they deserve writing credit on "Truth Hurts" since the song borrows from "Healthy," a tune they co-wrote.
The songwriters credited on "Truth Hurts" are Lizzo, Ricky Reed, Tele and Jesse Saint John. "Truth Hurts" was originally released in September 2017 but got a boost this year after it was featured in the Netflix film "Someone Great."
"After reaching out to Ricky Reed and Lizzo's team about fixing it, we put the song in dispute in 2017 when it came out," Justin Raisen wrote Tuesday on Instagram. "We've tried to sort this out quietly for the last two years ... but were shut down every time."
Lizzo's lawyer Cynthia Arato said in a statement: "They did not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else to create this song, and they did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago."
The New York Times reported that the Raisens rescinded an earlier claim over "Truth Hurts" through their publisher, Kobalt.
"The last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo's momentum and movement as a cultural figure. If we believe in what she's preaching, believing in ourselves & our own voices is something we thought she'd understand," Justin Raisen wrote.

How San Francisco Is Killing Its Restaurants

Texto completo: San Francisco was once known for trendy restaurants with lines out the door. Today, the city's restaurateurs are concerned with keeping their doors open at all. Restaurant closings outpace openings by 9%, according to Yelp data analyzed by the Golden Gate Restaurant Association. In a recent meeting with the Board of Supervisors, one industry veteran said: "We need to do something now, or we will be gone."
How did the outlook for a top restaurant city get so bleak? As Hemingway wrote of bankruptcy, it happened "gradually and then suddenly."
Start with labor costs, which the San Francisco Chronicle identified as "the biggest factor." In 2003 residents passed an initiative that set the minimum wage almost $2 above the state level and then linked it to rise with inflation. A decade later, another initiative incrementally lifted the wage floor to $15 an hour by 2018. On top of this, the city has separate ordinances regulating paid sick leave, employee health-care spending and workplace scheduling.
These costs are magnified by a quirk in California law that prohibits tip income from counting toward a restaurant employee's hourly-wage requirement. An employee who earns several hundred dollars in tips on Friday night is considered no different from a dishwasher who earns none -- even though tips are taxed as income by state and federal authorities. Restaurant owners must pay ever-higher hourly wages to top-earning employees whose take-home pay far exceeds minimum wage.
In their recent meeting with the supervisors, San Francisco's small-restaurant owners enumerated a long list of other problems. Rising rents, exacerbated by the city's hostility to new development, burden employers and employees alike. Requirements for permits can keep restaurants closed for months. The owner of one Hayes Valley spot described her frustration: "I have a small restaurant, and it took two years to open -- a good eight months for permitting." She adds that "I don't even really want to expand anymore, even though it will double my business."
Restaurants have few options to offset these costs. The Chronicle reported in 2016 that prices at the city's signature restaurants "have risen, on average, 26 percent since 2010 and 52 percent since 2005." Tourists and tech employees have shouldered some of the burden through higher prices. But even the city's well-to-do residents and visitors have been stretched far enough to reduce their consumption.
The New York Times reported last year that some of the city's restaurants have adopted a "fine casual" business model. Customers find their own tables, fill their own water glasses and get their own drink refills -- which allows the restaurant to keep labor costs and prices down by staffing fewer tipped employees. Research backs this up: A forthcoming study from economists at Miami University and Trinity University finds that full-service restaurants hire nearly 18% fewer tipped servers, as a share of employment, in expensive markets.
When all options have been exhausted, many restaurants are forced to close, a frequent occurrence in San Francisco. (My organization has chronicled many of these closings at FacesOf15.com.) According to the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, San Francisco lost nearly 1,000 full-service restaurant jobs last year. Annual employment growth in the industry has declined every year since 2012, and turned negative the past two years.
Testifying before the supervisors last month, one San Francisco chef warned that the city is becoming a "nonviable" market for restaurant growth. Don't tell that to the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, most of whom support raising the national minimum wage to the same level that helped wreck San Francisco's restaurant market. The city's left-of-center legislators have yet to address the hostile policy environment, but Congress should treat San Francisco as a cautionary tale rather than a model to emulate.

Texto completo: With three polls showing her in the lead, Sen. Elizabeth Warren may soon eclipse former Vice President Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. That's great news for Republicans, because Warren has a problem: The central message of her campaign is that the economy is working for the very wealthy but it is not working for ordinary Americans. Unfortunately for her, ordinary Americans disagree.
A Marist poll asked voters whether "the economy is working well for you personally." Nearly two-thirds of Americans said "yes." This includes large majorities in almost every demographic group. Sixty- seven percent of college graduates and 64 percent of those without a college education say the economy is working for them. So do 68 percent of whites, and 61 percent of nonwhite people. So do Americans of every generation. So do supermajorities in every region in the country.
The only groups who disagree, Marist found, are progressives (59 percent), Democratic women (55 percent) and those who are liberal or very liberal (55 percent). So, when Warren declares that President Trump is "part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else," it resonates with almost no one except those on the political left.
There is a good reason for that. Unemployment is near a record low, and the United States has about 1.6 million more job openings than unemployed people to fill them. Not only are jobs plentiful, but wages are rising. And The New York Times reported in May that "over the past year, low-wage workers have experienced the fastest pay increases." Americans don't just think they are doing better in the Trump economy, they are doing better. Little wonder Democrats barely mentioned the economy in Tuesday's debate.
This progress is bad news for Warren. Why on earth would Americans rally to her call for "big structural change" to the economy when they say the economy is working for them? Especially when they learn the structural changes Warren is proposing would cost tens of trillions of dollars and - whether she admits it or not - would require them to pay more in taxes?
Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Riedl recently added up the price tag for Warren's proposals: $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years for "Medicare for All"; $2 trillion for Social Security expansion; $3 trillion for climate change and environmental policies; $2 trillion for free college and student loan forgiveness; and another $1 trillion for initiatives that include free child care and housing. "Total cost: $38 trillion to $48 trillion," Riedl says. There's no way to pay for that miasma of spending with Warren's wealth tax; it will require massive middle-class tax increases.
No wonder the so-called moderates were going after Warren at Tuesday's debate; they know it would be a disaster if she were to capture the Democratic nomination. To win in 2020, Democrats need to win over voters who like Trump's policies but don't like Trump. They can't do that by telling these voters they are wrong about the economy working for them. Instead, they need to convince voters that they can dump Trump and still keep their prosperity.
If Democrats nominate Warren, they will give voters suffering from Trump exhaustion no safe harbor. Her nomination would turn the election into an existential threat to the American economy. And since Warren said Tuesday that if she is elected, and Democrats take back the Senate, they will "repeal the filibuster," she will be able to pass her radical agenda by simple majority vote. That means Trump's message - "whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me" - will ring true for millions of Americans whose votes might otherwise be up for grabs.

In a relationship with 'Modern Love'

Texto completo: Television review
MODERN LOVE
Starring: Anne Hathaway, Cristin Milioti, Tina Fey, Dev Patel, Julia Garner, John Slattery, Andrew Scott, Andy Garcia, Shea Whigham, Laurentiu Possa, Catherine Keener
On: Amazon, first season available Friday
In the first episode of the likable new anthology series “Modern Love," Cristin Milioti plays Maggie, a single New Yorker whose apartment doorman acts like a guard. When she arrives home with dates, the stiffly uniformed Guzmin — played with a masterfully cryptic deadpan by Laurentiu Possa — stands like a sentry at the building entrance, his disapproval clear. His protectiveness appears threatening, like he's a mobster. We never see Maggie's parents, as the half-hour called “When the Doorman Is Your Main Man" unfolds amid the city grid; just Guzmin, his severe cap, and his portentous face.
I love it that the Amazon series, available Friday, starts off with a tale that's not about conventional romance. While the eight half-hours of “Modern Love" have the sparkling feel of urban romantic comedy, they're about the very many faces of love out there in the world — between lovers, yes, but also between friends, between people tossed together by circumstance, between a birth mother and the gay couple adopting her baby. “When the Doorman Is Your Main Man" shows, with wry warmth, how you can find fierce devotion and shelter in unexpected corners of a cold, bustling city of strangers. You can't always predict who is going to fill a familial role in your life, and in your heart.
The adaptation of the New York Times column of the same name was created by Irish writer-director John Carney of “Once" and “Sing Street," and he brings just the right touch to almost every episode (he wrote and directed most; the other writers and directors include Sharon Horgan, Emmy Rossum, and Dan Savage). OK, so there's a bit of corniness here and there; the charm of the whole project makes its excesses tolerable, as does the swiftness of the storytelling. Carney & Co. consistently keep the focus on the protagonist's point of view, without elaborate side detours or embellishment, just like in the newspaper columns. Each half-hour knows exactly what it's about and goes there elegantly. You could say that the show is the “Twilight Zone" of love, without all the science fiction, oppressive doom, and broken watches, of course. It's a collection of small stories that share a broad theme, as well as a city that only seems to hinder love.
There were two episodes that didn't take off for me, for one reason or another. Much as I enjoyed watching Tina Fey and John Slattery as a couple on the verge of splitting, the static episode, called “Rallying to Keep the Game Alive," relies too heavily on the tennis metaphor that, in the original newspaper piece by Ann Leary, wife of Denis Leary, works well. And an episode in which a young woman (Julia Garner) seeks approval — but not romance — from a much-older man, fails, to a cringing effect, to make its meaning clear. That's the nature of anthology shows; they are usually uneven, and you get to start afresh with each new chapter. And unlike Amazon's “The Romanoffs," Matthew Weiner's extremely uneven anthology of hour-long-plus episodes, the misses pass by briskly.
The only truly edgy episode is called “Take Me as I Am, Whoever I Am," and it stars Anne Hathaway as a bipolar woman named Lexi who has kept her diagnosis to herself. We see her dancing and singing glamorously in choreographed scenes set in the supermarket, as she rides a manic phase. And then we see her unable to get out of bed, lying her way through absences at work, profoundly depressed. Can Lexi ever find love? Will she explain to the man she just met the reason for her erratic behavior? I found the episode absorbing and moving, as a woman braving her illness alone reaches her breaking point. I also liked a far lower-stakes episode starring Dev Patel as a tech wiz and Catherine Keener as the magazine interviewer who schools him on lost love and regret.
By now it's probably clear that “Modern Love" is not for viewers who can't suspend their cynicism for a few hours. There is plenty of earnestness afoot, even when it's lurking just under the surface, and there are a few happy endings, too. For me, it felt like a holiday from all the more demanding narratives on TV right now, a pleasing distraction from brooding superheroes, toxic media moguls, and an endless number of crimes that always need solving.

1,713 Huge Boilers In Public Housing, And Winter Looms

Texto completo: The seven steel boilers should have been replaced years ago.
Instead, they continue to sputter inside a cavernous brick building, producing steam that travels through a maze of old pipes providing heat and hot water to the Breukelen Houses in Canarsie, Brooklyn, a public housing complex where 3,500 people live.
On a recent morning, a masked welder squeezed into the dark chamber of boiler No. 7. One of its metal plates had corroded, and the boiler, built in 1985, needed to be patched up with a new one. Nearby stood a new 15-foot-long steel tank that collects water for the boilers to heat back to steam; it was free of punctures or leaks.
"The old one was completely rotting," said Anthony Picciano, a superintendent who oversees heating plants in Brooklyn developments run by the New York City Housing Authority, or NYCHA.
As winter approaches, the city is racing to ready boilers in the nation's largest public housing system, where widespread heat outages have repeatedly left many of its 400,000 low-income residents shivering in their homes. Many of the boilers are old; some were built in the 1950s. With temperatures dropping, the fragile, antiquated heating network imperils a large portion of public housing residents: children, older residents and people with health conditions.
Providing consistent heat is only one challenge in a long list of woes for the agency, which oversees 176,000 subsidized apartments. NYCHA is under the supervision of a federal monitor after federal prosecutors accused it of years of mismanagement. In addition to heating inadequacies, the agency has a history of failing to rid its apartments of mold and lead paint.
More than half of the housing authority's 1,713 boilers -- some made by companies that no longer exist -- are more than 20 years old, the typical life span of a boiler.
Following years of underfunding and poor maintenance, nearly half are in critical condition and need major repairs or replacement.
Pipes that circulate steam to apartments are crumbling, aging buildings are poorly insulated and radiators need to be overhauled.
Replicating changes implemented last winter, the agency has set up a centralized command center to respond to outages more quickly and has staffed technicians around the clock. NYCHA recently submitted a 10-year plan to the federal monitor outlining how it plans to replace its worst boilers.
The agency plans to recruit an additional 70 heating plant technicians, significantly more than last winter, but still 100 workers shy of the number it ideally needs, said Joey Koch, a senior vice president at the authority. The new technicians are not new hires but caretakers who are being promoted.
"We're reading data in a different kind of a way," Ms. Koch said. "We've started really tracing the causes of the problem so that we can accurately fix them, thinking strategically about where to invest whatever money we get, whether it's capital or expense dollars."
Two winters ago, a spell of bone-chilling temperatures exposed the vulnerabilities of NYCHA's decrepit boilers: More than 80 percent of residents experienced at least one outage and were left to fend off the cold by boiling water or opening gas ovens. The agency's then-chairwoman, Shola Olatoye, resigned several months later, following punishing headlines and a scathing City Council hearing at which she refused to apologize.
Housing officials said they made strides last winter, even though more than 131,000 apartments lost heat or hot water at least once. There were fewer heat outages reported last winter than during the previous one, and the average time to restore heat went down from 30 hours to eight hours, officials said.
But as it started to get cold again, those improvements meant little to residents of the Breukelen Houses. It was among the developments with the most outages last winter.
Residents there had no heat or hot water 25 times from Oct. 1, 2018, to May 1, 2019 -- the city's heat season.
During the heat season, landlords are legally required to maintain inside temperatures at a minimum of 68 degrees if the temperature outside falls below 55 degrees. Regardless of outside temperature, apartments must be at least 62 degrees inside at night.
Even with electronic sensors that record temperatures at a handful of developments, federal prosecutors found that NYCHA's own records show temperatures routinely drop below the legal minimum at thousands of apartments.
"NYCHA is crippling the same people, the same tenants, who have been paying their rent and coming home to a frozen apartment, which is not so much illegal as it is unsafe," said Calvin Dumgo, 59, a lifetime resident and former tenant association president of the 31-building development.
As a result, Breukelen residents threatened to withhold rent last winter.
Earlier this year, NYCHA told the office of Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn, that new boilers wouldn't be installed until at least 2023, according to emails reviewed by The New York Times. However, Barbara Brancaccio, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that there was not a concrete date for the new boilers.
Last Friday, as outside temperatures hovered in the low 60s and dropped to the mid 50s at night, residents said they were beginning to feel cold inside their homes.
"Even my dogs have sweaters on today," said Alexandra del Castillo, 48, a school bus driver and mother of two who has lived at the Breukelen Houses for 22 years. "We withstand too much cold here," she said, adding that her family typically relies on two electric space heaters, not the apartment's radiators.
It probably doesn't help that more than half of NYCHA's buildings, like those at the Breukelen Houses, were built in the 1950s or earlier. Their insulation and piping systems are below today's standard for new construction, causing heat leaks and inefficiencies. It's also why residents at some developments often speak of a different problem: apartments so overheated that people end up opening windows in the middle of winter.
Identifying the source of an outage can be complex. It could come from a breakdown in a boiler room, a leak in the pipes that send steam to buildings or a failure in the vertical risers that carry heat up to homes -- all of which can set off a domino effect and make the entire system collapse.
"One of the things I think folks don't understand is the chance of a component failure anywhere along that chain," said Gregory Russ, the agency's recently appointed chairman. "Any of those component failures, depending on what it is, can lead to a heat outage in a building. It's not simply that the boiler isn't firing."
Moving forward, Mr. Russ said he was looking to holistically assess buildings to address not only old boilers but other factors that could make buildings greener and more efficient. Some experts and environmental groups have suggested that the most sustainable and cost-effective solution is moving away from steam heating, an energy-inefficient and fossil-fuel-heavy method that is the century-old norm in most of the city.
Many of those investments, however, would require significant funding which NYCHA doesn't have: Its buildings need more than $ 32 billion to overhaul elevators, roofs and apartment interiors.
In looking forward, the housing authority could learn from its past.
Some of NYCHA's most reliable boilers are also its oldest: Three hulking boilers beneath the Berry Houses, an eight-building development on Staten Island that only experienced one outage last winter, have roared to life every day since 1954.
How have the 20-foot boilers, which were manufactured by Fitzgibbons, a now-defunct boiler company from upstate New York, endured? Possibly because "some old things were built better than your newer stuff," said Gary Dubner, a heat plant technician at the development.
Then there's the fact that Mr. Dubner and his colleague, Brian Dwyer, have cared for the boilers every day for the past 25 years, consistently treating the water with the right chemicals so the machinery doesn't rot.
Mr. Dubner has forged a deep connection with the boilers: Even before he opens the door to the boiler room each morning, he can tell if there's a problem just by the sound they're making. High turnover of technicians at other locations, he said, was something NYCHA could address to retain workers who know the equipment intimately.
On a recent visit, the two men had already spent three days prepping each boiler for winter, taking them apart and cleaning out the soot and built-up scale.
"How do they still work?" Mr. Dubner said. "By loving care."

Texto completo: El jefe interino del gabinete del presidente Donald Trump, Mick Mulvaney, reconoció este jueves en una conferencia de prensa que Estados Unidos detuvo la ayuda a Ucrania después de solicitar a este país que investigara a un servidor del Comité Nacional Demócrata . Mulvaney quitó hierro al asunto y negó que esta solicitud tuviera relación alguna con Joe Biden o su hijo Hunter.
“ Lo hacemos todo el tiempo con nuestra política exterior “, dijo el jefe de gabinete para justificar que el gobierno haya s olicitado a Ucrania algo a cambio (quid pro quo) de la ayuda estadounidense a otros países . Mulvaney se refirió específicamente al pedido de Trump para que su homólogo ucraniano investigara a un servidor del Comité Demócrata Nacional (CDN) .

“¿Me habló (Trump) en el pasado sobre la corrupción relacionada al servidor de CND? Absolutamente. No hay duda de eso. Y por eso fue que frenamos el dinero”, dijo Mulvaney a los periodistas de la Casa Blanca. El jefe del gabinete de la Casa Blanca dijo también que una de las principales preocupaciones de Trump era “ investigar qué fue lo que ocurrió en 2016 “, en referencia a la corrupción en Ucrania.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, effectively confirmed the main premise of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry on Thursday, telling reporters that aid was held back from Ukraine in part to prod the country to investigate Democrats https://t.co/Uep9uueYlf
— The New York Times (@nytimes) October 17, 2019
Mulvaney reconocía con sus palabras que Trump había detenido la ayuda a Ucrania, en parte, para presionar al país a investigar al servidor demócrata . Sin embargo, poco después Mulvaney se retractó de sus palabras y dijo que el corte de la financiación no condicionaba a Ucrania a indagar una supuesta interferencia en las elecciones de 2016 y acusó a la prensa de “malinterpretar” sus palabras para “avanzar en una caza de bruja […] contra el presidente Trump”.
“Déjenme ser claro, no hubo absolutamente ningún quid pro quo entre la ayuda militar ucraniana y cualquier investigación sobre las elecciones de 2016″, aclaró a posteriori. “El presidente nunca me pidió retener nada de dinero hasta que los ucranianos hicieran algo relacionado con el servidor”. Mulvaney insistió en explicar que la única razón por la que detuvieron los fondos de seguridad fue para revisar que otras naciones estaban implicadas en acabar con la corrupción.

Texto completo: In September 2019, actress Linda Hamilton — best known for her portrayal of Sarah Connor in the Terminator films — revealed to The New York Times that she’d been practicing celibacy for 15 years. Not surprisingly, this piqued the public’s interest.
Here was this celebrity, openly embracing the choice not to have sex. Not for religious reasons, but simply because it is her choice. So, this got us thinking: Everyone always talks about the health benefits of having sex, but are there benefits of abstaining from it as well?
To find out, we reached out to a few sex and health experts, whose answers might surprise you. Whether you’ve intentionally sworn off sex or you’re just in a dry spell, prepare to have your feelings about celibacy bolstered by the ways being celibate can boost your health.
1. IT GIVES YOU MORE MENTAL FOCUS AND CLARITY
There are actually a few purely practical health benefits to being celibate. Adina Mahalli, a certified relationship consultant and sexual health expert for Maple Holistics, discussed with us how not having sex frees up your focus.
“Sex is great, but thinking about it all the time can easily cloud your judgment and inhibit logical and clear thinking. The common saying ‘thinking with your little head instead of your big head’ demonstrates this issue. Sex is an incredibly complicated and deep act that affects people’s emotional state, brain chemistry and hormones,” explained Mahalli, adding, “Abstaining from sex can help people who are looking to make more logical judgements in their lives or to think more clearly. ”
Per Mahalli, it only takes a few months of being celibate (including masturbation) for your sex drive to drop enough to increase your ability to look at situations more logically. “Abstinence is also a way to help realign your emotions, brain chemistry and hormone levels if you feel that something may be wrong in any of those areas. This physiological alignment, mental clarity and logical thinking can benefit you in multiple areas in your life — work, social life and even help you find a suitable partner,” said Mahalli.
2. IT ALLOWS YOU TO BUILD A MORE MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP FOUNDATION
And speaking of relationships, Mahalli points out that being celibate while in a relationship can strengthen it. “When getting into a new relationship, sex can easily cloud your perception of your new partner because of oxytocin release (the love chemical) in the brain,” she said. “This chemical is released but is slowed after about six months, which is why the vast majority of relationships either end or begin to develop issues at this time. ”

3. BEING CELIBATE EXEMPLIFIES A TYPE OF CONSENSUAL SEX LIFE
What’s also interesting to note is that not being celibate and being sex-positive are not mutually exclusive. Dr. Carol Queen — author of The Sex & Pleasure Book: Good Vibrations Guide to Sex for Everyone, as well as a staff sexologist and curator of the Antique Vibrator Museum — elaborated on this point.
“The important element here is that the celibate person has chosen to be celibate. Sex-positive doesn’t mean that everyone is having a ton of sex — it means that each person should be able to create the [consensual] sex life that’s right for them unimpeded by outside restrictions, which includes the option of celibacy,” said Dr. Queen.
4. CELIBACY CAN PROMOTE POSITIVE SELF-ESTEEM AND SELF-CARE
Real talk: Sex can complicate everything — having one (or more) sexual partners can have myriad effects on a person’s well-being, some more desirable than others. As Dr. Queen explained, “Partners can affect one’s finances, mental health, ability to make one’s own choices. For some people, a journey toward optimal well-being will include taking at least some time away from these kinds of connections. There may be positive self-esteem implications of taking oneself off the market, too, in the sense that some people measure their self-worth partly according to how successfully they can attract partners or sexual interest. ”
5. SOLO EXPERIENCES HAVE MANY OF THE PERKS OF PARTNERED SEX
Dr. Queen also clarified that there is a difference between having no sexual experiences of any kind (including masturbation) and having no partnered sex. While some of the perceived health benefits mentioned here are only related to partnered sex, if your celibacy includes solo sexual experience, you’re also getting many of the health benefits ascribed to sex.

6. BEING CELIBATE (FOR A TIME) CAN INCREASE YOUR ENJOYMENT
So, let’s say your celibacy is just temporary — whether self-imposed or you sort of stumbled into it. Should you decide at some point you would like to move toward an active sex life, your time being celibate could have a rather positive effect. “Taking a break from sex helps restore your enjoyment of the act, as well as your appreciation of all your non-sexual and pre-sexual interactions,” Ken Blackman, the principal engineer behind OM (orgasmic meditation), told us.
Blackman has an easy-to-understand analogy to help explain, saying, “Having sex whenever your desire rises above, say, a three out of 10, is like eating an entire meal whenever your hunger rises above a three out of 10. Not only do you get bloated, but you lose your capacity to savor the meal. It becomes harder and harder to really enjoy each bite as a sensual experience. ”
Basically, absence makes the heart (or, ahem, whatever) grow fonder. “Giving yourself some time to remember what it feels like to want sex, and really savoring that feeling of desire, will heighten your senses, make you more present, and boost your enjoyment of the entire experience, from flirting to touching,” said Blackman, offering one final piece of advice for those transitioning toward a more sexual life: The longer you don’t have sex, the more intense your enjoyment will be when — or if — you do.

How San Francisco Is Killing Its Restaurants; Labor costs and regulation are ruining a once-thriving industry. Congress should take it as a cautionary tale.

Texto completo: San Francisco was once known for trendy restaurants with lines out the door. Today, the city's restaurateurs are concerned with keeping their doors open at all. Restaurant closings outpace openings by 9%, according to Yelp data analyzed by the Golden Gate Restaurant Association. In a recent meeting with the Board of Supervisors, one industry veteran said: "We need to do something now, or we will be gone."
How did the outlook for a top restaurant city get so bleak? As Hemingway wrote of bankruptcy, it happened "gradually and then suddenly."
Start with labor costs, which the San Francisco Chronicle identified as "the biggest factor." In 2003 residents passed an initiative that set the minimum wage almost $2 above the state level and then linked it to rise with inflation. A decade later, another initiative incrementally lifted the wage floor to $15 an hour by 2018. On top of this, the city has separate ordinances regulating paid sick leave, employee health-care spending and workplace scheduling.
These costs are magnified by a quirk in California law that prohibits tip income from counting toward a restaurant employee's hourly-wage requirement. An employee who earns several hundred dollars in tips on Friday night is considered no different from a dishwasher who earns none—even though tips are taxed as income by state and federal authorities. Restaurant owners must pay ever-higher hourly wages to top-earning employees whose take-home pay far exceeds minimum wage.
In their recent meeting with the supervisors, San Francisco's small-restaurant owners enumerated a long list of other problems. Rising rents, exacerbated by the city's hostility to new development, burden employers and employees alike. Requirements for permits can keep restaurants closed for months. The owner of one Hayes Valley spot described her frustration: "I have a small restaurant, and it took two years to open—a good eight months for permitting." She adds that "I don't even really want to expand anymore, even though it will double my business."
Restaurants have few options to offset these costs. The Chronicle reported in 2016 that prices at the city's signature restaurants "have risen, on average, 26 percent since 2010 and 52 percent since 2005." Tourists and tech employees have shouldered some of the burden through higher prices. But even the city's well-to-do residents and visitors have been stretched far enough to reduce their consumption.
The New York Times reported last year that some of the city's restaurants have adopted a "fine casual" business model. Customers find their own tables, fill their own water glasses and get their own drink refills—which allows the restaurant to keep labor costs and prices down by staffing fewer tipped employees. Research backs this up: A forthcoming study from economists at Miami University and Trinity University finds that full-service restaurants hire nearly 18% fewer tipped servers, as a share of employment, in expensive markets.
When all options have been exhausted, many restaurants are forced to close, a frequent occurrence in San Francisco. (My organization has chronicled many of these closings at FacesOf15.com.) According to the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, San Francisco lost nearly 1,000 full-service restaurant jobs last year. Annual employment growth in the industry has declined every year since 2012, and turned negative the past two years.
Testifying before the supervisors last month, one San Francisco chef warned that the city is becoming a "nonviable" market for restaurant growth. Don't tell that to the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, most of whom support raising the national minimum wage to the same level that helped wreck San Francisco's restaurant market. The city's left-of-center legislators have yet to address the hostile policy environment, but Congress should treat San Francisco as a cautionary tale rather than a model to emulate.
Mr. Saltsman is managing director of the Employment Policies Institute, which receives some support from restaurants.

Warren, Biden, Sanders and Big Rock Candy Mountain

Texto completo: Watching the Democratic presidential candidate debate -- with Elizabeth Warren promising government health care for all without saying she'll tax the middle class to pay for it -- was like staring from a distance at the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
You don't know the Big Rock Candy Mountain? That's the gorgeous Democratic Socialist paradise where everything is free.
"Where the handouts grow on bushes ... And the sun shines every day/ On the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees/ The lemonade springs where the bluebird sings/ In the Big Rock Candy Mountains."
It sounds so nice, like Democratic economic policy written for modern Americans who've been trained to despise the freedom offered by capitalism, while yearning for free stuff promised by the federal masters.
It's an old hobo (can I still use that word?) song about a dreamy place where the cops have wooden legs, guard dogs have rubber teeth and the hens lay soft-boiled eggs all day.
But I concentrated on what the candidates were saying, and it completely harshed my mellow.
It wasn't that they rained hate on President Donald Trump. The debate sponsors, CNN and The New York Times, are cheerleaders in the anti-Trump resistance. And all performed as expected. The one thing they stand for, clearly, is they hate Trump.
But I had hoped we'd hear a bit more about what distinguishes one candidate from another on policy. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a military veteran, tried to go there, mocking CNN and the Times and fellow Democrats for pushing the conflict in Syria, which she described as another "regime change war."
Gabbard's attempt was admirable, but doomed. The last thing Democrats and the Beltway media want to be reminded of is that on Syria, they're now in bed with those "Never Trump" pro-war Republican neocons.
And so, a dense anti-Trumpian fog descended upon the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Warren, the Massachusetts senator, refused to say if the middle class would end up paying for her monster federal government Medicare plan for all. And that's not the only problem with the plan -- it would kick some 150 million Americans off their private health care insurance.
Asked whether she'd tax the middle class to pay for her plan, Warren dodged, pivoted, danced, but didn't answer. She wasn't pressed enough.
It's as if the entire Democratic Beltway Media Hive has come to realize -- perhaps through the release of hive-friendly pheromones -- that former front-runner Joe Biden is done and Warren must be protected, even from herself.
At least Sen. Bernie Sanders didn't dodge. He climbed the Big Rock Candy Mountain years ago, planted his flag and waited for the entire Democratic Party to move hard left and join him. He's 78 and just had a heart attack, but he stood strong. Sanders is the one authentic candidate in the bunch. He admits what he is: He's a socialist.
"At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up," said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. "And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice."
Voters already know the middle class always gets the bill.
In a question written as if to please CNN boss Jeff Zucker, Anderson Cooper asked Biden about his son Hunter.
"Mr. Vice President," said Cooper, "President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out there's no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you."
That's not completely true. It was categorically wrong for then-Vice President Biden -- as the Obama administration point man to Ukraine and China -- to have his son Hunter cashing in on business deals in both countries, including $50,000 a month from Ukrainian gas company Burisma.
I don't know if it was a crime, but it was a clear conflict of interest. The legendary Chicago boss Richard J. Daley leveraged his clout to help his sons. When asked about it, Daley told reporters to kiss his mistletoe. But Daley didn't say mistletoe.
"Having said that, on Sunday, you announced that if you're president, no one in your family or associated with you will be involved in any foreign businesses," Cooper continued. "My question is, if it's not OK for a president's family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it OK for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden?"
Biden looked to his left and his right as if afraid. He's no Dick Daley.
"Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong," Biden said, going on to babble about George Washington worrying about foreign influence in elections and then, of course, Trump.
Cooper pressed on.
"Look, my son's statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine," Biden said.
Joe, you did talk to your son. Hunter admitted as much years ago. Even now, with the other candidates avoiding the Hunter issue lest they be accused of pro-Trumpian leanings, Joe must realize that he won't be the Democratic nominee. It's being given to Warren.
Yet before he walks off the stage for the last time, wouldn't it be nice if Joe Biden sings to the nation he loves, in the song the Democrats now sing, in a fine clear voice?
"There's a lake of stew/ And of whiskey, too/ You can paddle all around 'em/ In a big canoe/ In the Big Rock Candy Mountains."

'Street' smarts about a foster care crisis

Texto completo: When "Sesame Street" adds a character and a story line to its fabled neighborhood, people notice. In May, the show's creators introduced Karli, a Muppet in foster care, and this month they revealed the reason for her situation: Her mom struggles with substance abuse.
In supplemental "Sesame Street in the Community" videos available online, Elmo's dad explains to him that "Karli's mother has a disease called addiction. Addiction makes people feel like they need a grown-up drink called alcohol or another kind of drug to feel OK. That can make a person act strange in ways they can't control." Elmo and Karli, a green plush 6 1/2-year-old with yellow ostrich feather pigtails, talk about "grown-up problems" and how sharing can help if you're sad or scared.
Karli's separation from her mom might seem too harsh for the "Sesame Street" audience, but because the videos are available online only, parents and caregivers can decide if kids should see them.

In fact, the programming does us all a favor with its honest depiction of what fractures families. Substance abuse is the primary reason for the foster care crisis in this country. And "Sesame Street's" spotlight on it could help redirect our cities and states toward a better approach to confronting it.
Last year, a record 440,000 children were in foster care in the U.S. "Neglect" is the most common reason for removing kids from their families, but it is a very vague category. And too many people assume that neglect means poverty.
As a columnist for the Arizona Republic wrote: "[The Department of Child Safety] removes the most kids from high poverty ZIP codes. That's no coincidence." A caseworker who was featured in the HBO documentary "Foster," about child welfare in Los Angeles County, told Rise Magazine, "This is not a child safety crisis. It's a poverty crisis, a racism crisis." The New York Times ran an article called "Live in a Poor Neighborhood? Better Be a Perfect Parent."
And yet the data don't line up. Child poverty has reached historic lows in recent years in the U.S., while the number of children removed from their families is growing. On the other hand, government figures clearly show that counties with high rates of drug overdose deaths and hospitalizations also have high rates of severe child welfare cases. At a recent conference sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin, federal and state officials estimated that more than 80% of the nation's foster care cases involved substance abuse.
Unfortunately, specific data linking child welfare cause and effect are inconsistent and somewhat contradictory. Why is it, for instance, that California reports to the federal government its removals due to substance abuse at slightly more than 10% for kids over the age of 1 while in Colorado that number is close to 70%? Or why is Louisiana listing substance abuse as a factor in 8% of cases for kids under the age of 1 when Kentucky lists it in half of its cases?
Even within single states the numbers look fishy. In 2010, Arizona listed parental substance abuse in 34% of its child welfare cases, but in 2013 it was only 6%. It seems unlikely that the shift would be that abrupt. And what the heck is going on in New Hampshire, which has a drug overdose death rate that's 70% higher than the national average but reports drugs as a contributing factor in only about 2% of its foster care cases?
In fact, the "threshold" for reporting drug use as a factor in foster care varies significantly state by state. Some require a formal diagnosis, some rely on investigator suspicion. Some states allow investigators to pick multiple factors; others ask workers to limit it to one.
Without a consistent standard -- and therefore better data -- it's hard to move public policy toward a real fix for the surge in foster care cases. A general improvement in "safety net" services won't keep children from neglect and abuse if the true cause is parental drug use. If kids are in homes where the heat isn't on during the winter, or where the refrigerator is empty, or if they are sent to school inappropriately dressed (all triggers for child welfare agencies to intervene), is it because their family is poor or because drug problems stop parents from doing basic things to care for their children?
In the "Sesame Street" videos, we find out that Karli's mother is getting treatment, and foster care is demystified. Elmo and the rest of the neighborhood's adults, kids and Muppets help Karli cope with what she calls her "big feelings." The story line is designed to help build resilience in kids and families, but it can also point child welfare agencies toward a more accurate and specific analysis of their mounting crisis.
If we want to see a decline in the numbers of kids removed from their families and placed in foster care, it pays to follow time-honored "Sesame Street" lessons: Be honest and learn to count.

Texto completo: The fourth Democratic presidential primary debate drew an average audience of 8.3 million viewers for CNN on Tuesday, the smallest TV audience for the 2020 White House contenders.
The figure from Nielsen is a well below the 8.7 million who watched the first round of CNN's July 30 debate. The decline is likely because of stronger competition in prime time, including a National League Championship Series game on TBS, at which the Washington Nationals earned their first trip to the World Series in franchise history.
The debate also had an average streaming audience of 449,000 viewers on the websites of CNN and the New York Times, which teamed with the cable news channel on the event.

The TV audience level was down 22% from the 10.7 million who watched the second round of the second Democratic primary debate on CNN. The largest audience for a Democratic debate in the 2020 campaign cycle is 18.1 million viewers who watched the second round of the first Democratic debate simulcast across NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo on June 27.
The last debate on Sept. 12, which aired on ABC and Univision, had an audience of 14 million viewers.
Nevertheless, CNN's audience for the Democratic candidates competing to face President Trump in the 2020 election remains higher than most debates in pre-2016 campaign seasons at such an early stage. In the years before Trump turbocharged the ratings during the 2016 race, the largest audience for a primary debate before the Iowa caucuses were held was the 9.3 million who watched Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama face off in January 2008.
The three-hour event held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, was the first since Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has emerged as a front-runner. She spent much of the night parrying questions on how her administration would fund her proposals of Medicare for all and free tuition at public colleges.
The 12 candidates on CNN's stage was a record number for a primary debate. ABC's debate had 10 candidates, and the previous events held on NBC and CNN split up the qualifying contenders over two nights.
The lineup included former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, businessman Tom Steyer and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

Last night's Democratic debate proved that it's going to be very difficult to defeat Trump

Texto completo: Maybe after Tuesday night’s debate it will have finally sunk in that Democrats are going to have a very, very, very hard time winning the presidency next year.
It was an embarrassment to watch Sen. Kamala Harris, who was once considered a serious contender for the nomination, drone on about how the president of the United States should be “taken down” from Twitter. She apparently thought it would be a standout moment to “urge” Sen. Elizabeth Warren to join her in that campaign-defining cause.
Warren, having branded herself as the ultimate liberal truth-teller, wouldn’t admit that her dreamy healthcare policy proposal would absolutely require a tax increase on middle-income households. “Costs will go down” was her answer every time she was asked about that inescapable fact, almost as if someone had pulled a string on her back to make the sound.
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg sounded like he might have been onto something when he dismissed every single Democrat proposal on gun control. But then he offered his own unique one: “We have to just get something done.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders literally had a brush with death and is now acting like nothing’s wrong. Joe Biden pretended his son Hunter’s business dealings in Ukraine, which just happened to coincide with his own political engagement there, is nothing, even though Hunter had just said earlier the same day that it was done with “poor judgement.”
Are any of these people listening to themselves?
If I were head of the DNC I would be absolutely soiling my pants. The party is rudderless, and the first contest of the primary is just four months away.
Democrats are no better off today than they were in the 2016 election, but they might take some comfort in knowing that the shoe was once on the other foot.
This same show played out in 2012, when Republicans were certain that beating President Obama would be a breeze. That was delusional thinking then and it’s delusional to think it about President Trump now.
Trump may have shaken the conventional wisdom on politics, but some things really will never change. Incumbency counts for a lot. That's bad news for Democrats, but hopefully they’re seeing things a little more clearly after last night.

Why Pete Buttigieg's moment could last well past the debate

Texto completo: By most accounts, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had a great debate Tuesday night. So did Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
But unlike Klobuchar and virtually all other Democratic presidential candidates, Buttigieg has built out a campaign infrastructure that could, in theory, help him sustain momentum from his highly praised performance.
Buttigieg has a large campaign presence in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire so he could quickly translate his star turn into something more tangible and lasting.
In raw terms, this means that Buttigieg has the money, the staff, the data, and the endorsements to rapidly expand his reach.
He had $23.4 million in the bank at the end of last month, more than twice what Biden did. He has hundreds of people on staff.
The 37-year-old's campaign offices have lists of potential supporters to reach out to Wednesday and beyond, and can ask them to show up and make calls to other voters.
Klobuchar, by way of comparision, doesn't have any of this. It means whatever momentum she has could be fleeting.
Bolstered by his success in fundraising in the first half of the year, Buttigieg spent the summer building out a campaign infrastructure.
In New Hampshire, for example, Buttigieg has 13 offices, more than any other campaign. (Senator Elizabeth Warren is in second with 10 offices.) In those Buttigieg offices, there are 64 staff members, with 57 of them slotted for direct voter contact, according to the campaign. A few campaigns have more staff on the ground in the state, but they tend to be in roles that are not in direct contact with voters.
Buttigieg also has the highest number of offices in Iowa, 22, again slightly edging out Warren, according to a recent New York Times analysis. Buttigieg's campaign says they have more than 100 staffers on the ground there. It has also been running television ads in the Hawkeye State for a month.
There is a reason why all of this matters.
History has shown that while it is easy for candidates to have “a moment," it is very hard for them to sustain the moment. In 2008 and 2012, Republicans Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum may have won the Iowa Caucuses, but they didn't have anything to help them in the following states to keep it going. This is where the spade work in the early primary states can help the most.
Just consider Senator Kamala Harris of California. She was riding high after her June debate performance. Polls quickly found her to be a top-tier candidate.
But Harris spent considerably less time in Iowa and New Hampshire than other major candidates and made building out her infrastructure, staff, and endorsements less of a priority. Within a month, she was fading.
As it stands, there are 19 Democratic presidential candidates running for president. On the ground in the early states, just a few candidates have built an infrastructure able to capitalize on any momentum. And among that group, no candidate is better built as a “growth stock" than Buttigieg, who has sat just outside of the top tier of candidates, including Warren, former vice president Joe Biden, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Tuesday's debate marks the second burst of mometum for Buttigieg. In March, he came out of obscurity during a CNN town hall in Texas where he attacked Vice President Mike Pence's views on homosexuality. Following that performance, Buttigieg was a hot ticket on the campaign trail, but his staff didn't yet have the capacity to grab personal data from the huge crowds swarming his events.
This time around, however, it is different. Buttigieg needs to find a way to get into the top tier and improve his standing among female voters and people of color. It's unclear if Team Buttigieg can pull that off. But they are uniquely set up to give it a shot.

We Still Blame George W. Bush; The New York Times and the unrelenting assault on the legitimacy of American constitutional governance.

Texto completo: Yesterday this column noted that judicial radicalism is increasingly embraced by establishment Democrats. At last night's Democratic debate, presidential candidates kicked around the idea of restructuring the Supreme Court by adding new Justices or perhaps forcing out current ones via term limits.
The general idea is to change the judiciary until it produces their desired political results. To his credit, former Vice President Joe Biden warned his fellow Democrats against attempting to pack the court with ideological allies, as it would surely reduce the public's respect for legal decisions.
But unfortunately the idea probably isn't going away. David Leonhardt, a relative moderate among the leftists at the New York Times opinion pages,
recently expressed a view held by many elected Democrats when he wrote that "the country has reached the point where once-unthinkable solutions are worth debating." Added the Timesman:
I don't like the idea of court packing, which I think could lead to never-ending escalation between the parties and the potential breakdown of the judicial system. But I also find the status quo unacceptable: A court majority of dubious democratic legitimacy that sometimes acts as a kind of partisan super legislature...
And remember: Every 5-4 decision that breaks along partisan lines likely would have gone the other way if Senate Republicans hadn't stolen a seat from Obama.
By "stolen," Mr. Leonhardt means that in the appropriate exercise of its constitutional role in 2016, the Senate did not consent to President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland.
And of course Mr. Leonhardt's smear goes much further, as he called the entire majority of the Supreme Court "of dubious democratic legitimacy." Here's his argument:
Four of the nine current Supreme Court justices have been named by presidents who took office despite losing the popular vote.
Two of those four justices were named by a president whose victory was clinched when the Supreme Court ordered a halt to vote counting.
He's talking about Justices who were appointed by duly-elected Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump—and then confirmed by the Senate. To make his argument, the Times columnist appears to be clinging to Constitutionally irrelevant nationwide popular vote totals to denigrate winning campaigns by Messrs. Bush and Trump.
It's corrosive enough for our politics when partisans refuse to accept the legitimate results of elections. But the Leonhardt critique is also highly misleading.
It's true that George W. Bush won the Electoral College vote and therefore the Presidency in 2000. It's true that in 2000 he received fewer votes nationwide than his opponent. It's also true that in 2000 the Supreme Court ruled that a Democratic effort to apply different vote-counting standards in different parts of Florida was not constitutional, which allowed the Florida secretary of state's certification of a Bush victory to stand.
But the two Bush appointees whom Mr. Leonhardt seeks to smear were appointed in 2005, a year after Mr. Bush had won re-election. In that 2004 contest, Mr. Bush not only won a decisive victory on the only scoreboard that counts—at the Electoral College—Mr. Bush also won on the scoreboard that Mr. Leonhardt claims ought to count. Nationwide, Mr. Bush surpassed his opponent by more than 3 million votes.
During the 2000s, this column's most celebrated alumnus created the gag headline, "We Blame George W. Bush." It was intended to poke fun at the media habit of blaming America's 43rd President even for problems he could not possibly have caused.
Now the left won't even give George W. Bush credit for the votes he clearly earned.

Lawmakers call for probe of College Board data sales

Resumen: SPRINGFIELD — Nine Democratic lawmakers are calling on Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul to investigate the business practices of the College Board and sale of data it collects from students who take the SAT and PSAT exams. The College Board’s practice of selling student data through its program called Student Search Service was the subject of national news reports by The New York Times and Washington Post, among others. The lawmakers said the practice of selling student data might violate at least two state laws, the Student Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits businesses that provide online services to schools from selling or leasing student data, and the Children’s Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act, which bars sale of data of children under 16 without parental consent.

Texto completo: SPRINGFIELD — Nine Democratic lawmakers are calling on Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul to investigate the business practices of the College Board and sale of data it collects from students who take the SAT and PSAT exams.
The action comes about a week before high school students throughout the state are due to take the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test, or PSAT, which among other things is used to determine eligibility for National Merit Scholarships.
Next spring, high school juniors throughout the state will take the SAT, a college-entrance exam that the state mandates as part of its school accountability program.
The College Board’s practice of selling student data through its program called Student Search Service was the subject of national news reports by The New York Times and Washington Post, among others.
In May, a representative from the College Board, Todd Iverson, confirmed to the state Senate Judiciary Committee that the company sells access to data from Illinois students for 45 cents per student. That testimony came as the panel was considering legislation to strengthen the state’s Student Online Personal Protection Act.
But Sara Sympson, a spokeswoman for the College Board, said in an email Thursday the nonprofit company does not "sell" the data but, rather, makes the information available "under strict licensing agreements with colleges, scholarship partners, and nonprofit organizations."
The program is voluntary, she said, and students must "affirmatively declare" they want to have conversations with schools and scholarship providers.
Those who access the data, she said, must adhere to precise rules that require the data be used for only noncommercial, education-related purposes. They also must agree not to share student information with third parties, other than mail service providers and other contractors, and they must destroy the data once their agreement expires.
"Students and their families need information to help them navigate the winding and complicated path to college and career," Sympson said. "Student Search fills that need, providing information that can support their transition to college, particularly for historically underrepresented student populations who are already disproportionately unlikely to apply, enroll, and graduate from college."
But the group of lawmakers urging Raoul to investigate argued that the College Board is less than transparent about the program.
"Although the College Board asks students for their consent (including those under age 18) for disclosing their data to colleges, universities and scholarship providers, they do not inform either students or parents that they will be providing the data to these organizations in exchange for a monetary payment," the lawmakers said in a letter to Raoul.
The data involved in the program includes not just students’ test scores, but also information they provide on survey questionnaires that accompany those exams, such as their academic interests and their activities in high school. Colleges, universities and scholarship programs buy the data to identify prospective students.
The lawmakers also noted the College Board is a significant vendor for the state. It has a $29 million contract with the Illinois State Board of Education for the SAT and PSAT exams, and last year it was paid more than $2 million to cover fees for Advanced Placement Tests for low-income students.
The lawmakers said the practice of selling student data might violate at least two state laws, the Student Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits businesses that provide online services to schools from selling or leasing student data, and the Children’s Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act, which bars sale of data of children under 16 without parental consent.
The letter was signed by Democratic Sens. Cristina Castro, of Elgin; Robert Martwick, of Chicago; Laura Murphy, of Des Plaines; and Robert Peters, of Chicago. Democratic Reps. Robyn Gabel, of Evanston and Will Guzzardi, Lindsey LaPointe, Aaron Ortiz and Ann Williams, all of Chicago, also signed on.
A spokeswoman for Raoul said in an email the office is aware of the lawmakers’ concerns and is looking into the matter.
Cassie Creswell, who heads the advocacy group Illinois Families for Public Schools, said in an interview that Raoul’s office has worked with students and parents to fill out consumer complaint forms so the office can begin an investigation.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Rudy Giuliani, by his own admission, reached out to Ukraine to unearth damaging information about President Donald Trump's potential presidential rival – mixing roles of personal attorney and unofficial diplomat.
Depending on the time of day and who he's talking to, Giuliani is an attorney advising Trump on legal matters. An unofficial envoy corresponding with foreign leaders. A cable news attack dog. A freelance investigator.
Now Giuliani finds himself in a difficult position. Two associates, who tried to help him get Ukrainian officials to investigate one of Trump's political rivals, have been arrested on campaign finance charges. Prosecutors are examining Giuliani's business dealings in that country. And Democrats have accused him of violating lobbying laws by acting as an unregistered agent for a foreign government.
Giuliani has said he's an attorney for Trump as well as the two men now in federal custody. But experts say he can't rely on attorney-client privilege to completely shield himself from answering questions from Congress or prosecutors.
In short, Giuliani can't have it both ways, said Josh Rosenstein, a Washington, D. C. , lawyer who advises clients on foreign lobbying laws.
More: Federal investigators have been looking into Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine since early 2019
“Either he is admitting that he was somehow an unofficial emissary of the U. S. government operating outside legal channels and directed by the president to engage in the sort of activity at the root of the impeachment inquiry," Rosenstein said, "or he was acting as an unregistered agent of foreign principals and potentially assisting them in violating campaign finance laws. "
It’s too early to gauge what Giuliani’s legal exposure might be, experts say – if there is any at all. The opacity and fluidity of his relationship with the president has raised challenging questions about what Giuliani can and cannot reveal to congressional and criminal investigators.
But it's clear that Giuliani is the latest person in Trump's orbit to come under scrutiny by federal authorities. Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, once said he would take a bullet for his boss. Now he is serving three years in prison.
Giuliani has cast any scrutiny as likely politically motivated and said he is not in any legal jeopardy. "Did nothing wrong," he said Tuesday, hours after he defied a congressional subpoena for documents related to his dealings in Ukraine.
The president has come to Giuliani's defense, tamping down speculations that his standing might be in peril.
Is Giuliani a 'foreign agent'?: Trump-Ukraine scandal puts spotlight on Rudy Giuliani's business ties.
Giuliani is central figure in inquiries by Congress, prosecutors
Giuliani seems to begin his days much like the president does: with a series of tweets in the wee hours of the morning, often in the same bombastic tone.
He castigates the media, attacks the impeachment inquiry, discredits the whistleblower whose allegations fueled it, pushes baseless claims about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, and peddles the conspiracy theory that Ukraine – not Russia – interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Democrats.
Giuliani, however, has been distinctly mum about the arrests last week of two of his associates, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan of funneling foreign money to American political campaigns. Two other men were charged as well.
Arrest made: Fourth suspect surrenders in campaign-finance case tied to Rudolph Giuliani associates
Prosecutors allege that Parnas and Fruman gave $5,400 to a U. S. congressman and pledged to raise another $20,000 as they sought his help in removing Marie Yovanovitch as U. S. ambassador to Ukraine.
That congressman is former U. S. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, who wrote a letter to U. S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging Yovanovitch's removal. After Parnas and Fruman were arrested, Sessions said he didn't know about the alleged scheme and would donate their contributions to charity.
That investigation appears to have extended to Giuliani.
Kenneth McCallion, a New York lawyer who has represented several Ukrainian clients, told USA TODAY that federal authorities questioned him in early 2019 about Giuliani's activities in Ukraine.
Giuliani said Tuesday he had "no such knowledge" of a federal inquiry involving him.
The New York Times has reported that prosecutors in the U. S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York – the office Giuliani led in the 1980s – are investigating whether he violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, in his dealings with Ukraine. The Times reported that the investigation into Giuliani is tied to the criminal case against Parnas and Fruman.
FARA requires Americans who work on behalf of foreign entities to register their activities with the Justice Department.
The focus of the investigation, according to the Times, is Giuliani’s efforts to “undermine” Yovanovitch, as part of a campaign to get Ukraine to help Trump politically.
A spokeswoman for the U. S. attorney's office in the Southern District of New York said she cannot confirm whether Giuliani is under investigation, but the probe into Parnas and Fruman is ongoing.
Burisma and Biden: Trump's conspiracy theories thrive in Ukraine, where a young democracy battles corruption and distrust
Federal prosecutors have ramped up their enforcement of FARA, a law meant to identify foreign actors attempting to influence U. S. policy.
Giuliani and his consulting firm have had clients from Latin America to eastern Europe. In an interview with The New York Times, a wealthy developer from the city of Kharkiv in Ukraine described Giuliani as a "lobbyist" who would burnish his city's reputation in the U. S.
The Justice Department has shown a willingness to prosecute high-profile figures with ties to foreign countries. Among them are two men who once were in Trump’s inner circle: Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser who is awaiting sentencing, and Paul Manafort, the former campaign chairman who's serving seven and a half years in prison.
Giuliani has rejected accusations that he has violated FARA, saying he was working on behalf of Trump, not a foreign entity.
But that claim, legal experts say, could put Giuliani in a bind.
Either he acknowledges advancing Ukrainian interests in his effort to discredit Yovanovitch, or he says he was working at Trump's behest, which furthers the impeachment inquiry, said Matthew Sanderson, a Washington, D. C. , lawyer who advises clients on FARA.
The arrests of Fruman and Parnas also could pose legal risks for Giuliani.
“The risk is all your communications and activities with these people will be exposed, probably, and investigated,” said Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor in New York. “There’s a significant chance that people who know a lot about things they did with Mr. Giuliani may at some point in the future decide to be debriefed by the government. ”
Any legal risk to Giuliani, though, remains hypothetical because so little is known about what evidence the investigators have found, Cotter said.
Giuliani has declined to discuss his dealings with Parnas and Fruman, saying the duo were his clients "on two separate things," and much of their communication is privileged. He said he has to talk to them to figure out what's confidential and what's not.

The shifting nature of the Trump-Giuliani relationship
The nature of Giuliani’s work for the president is murky, experts say, in part because Giuliani himself has described it in different ways. This raises questions about whether he could assert attorney-client privilege during the impeachment inquiry and what limits there could be to that privilege.
For example, Giuliani has identified himself as the president’s lawyer, as he did in an interview with Fox News on Sept. 26. But he has also asserted he is not acting as Trump’s lawyer, as he did in an interview with The Atlantic the same day.
Other times, he’s appeared to act as an unofficial envoy, telling Fox News' Sean Hannity that he spoke to the Ukrainians at the request of the State Department. "I wasn't operating on my own," he said.
In that case, conversations between him and Trump may not be protected, experts say. Communication between an attorney and his client is protected only if they pertain to the issue for which the attorney was hired.
Giuliani joined Trump's legal team in 2018 amid former special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. With the Mueller investigation over, experts say it's now unclear what legal work, if any, Giuliani is doing for Trump.
“The nature and exact extent of their relationship is in question,” said Paul Rosenzweig, a former prosecutor under independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
Giuliani's defense: Trump backs Rudy Giuliani after report says president's lawyer is under investigation
Giuliani can't avoid testifying in impeachment inquiry, experts say
Still, Rosenzweig said there is no way Giuliani can use attorney-client privilege to shield himself entirely from testifying in impeachment proceedings. "The only thing it will accomplish – and it probably will succeed to some extent – is to delay his testimony,” he said.
Attorney-client privilege is limited to confidential communications between a client and that person’s attorney. Lawyers can’t claim privilege to protect themselves from what they said while representing their clients. Only clients can decide if they want their dealings to be confidential.
That means the privilege does not apply to conversations or correspondence Giuliani had with foreign leaders or State Department officials in the course of his dealings in Ukraine, experts say.
“The conduct at issue – pushing arguments about potential corruption to foreign officials – does not appear to involve providing confidential legal advice," John Bies, chief counsel at American Oversight, a nonprofit focused on government accountability, wrote on the Lawfare blog.
"It is not even clear that Giuliani’s conduct constitutes legal work performed in his capacity as Trump’s attorney, even if it were charitably viewed as something other than political campaign work,” he wrote.
Bies, a former Justice Department official in the Obama administration, agreed there is no indication that Trump sought legal advice from Giuliani. Instead, Trump directed him "to undertake other (nonlegal) activities" on his behalf, Bies wrote.
“Directives of this sort, of course, would not be privileged,” he wrote.
Giuliani pushed back against the notion that attorney-client privilege wouldn't apply, telling Fox News' Laura Ingraham that if the work he did was to "obtain evidence in order to exonerate your client, it damn well does apply. "
There's one other thing not protected by attorney-client privilege, Rosenzweig said: communication regarding future crimes, either by the client or the attorney.
If attorney-client protections fail, Giuliani cannot assert executive privilege. “Giuliani, so far as I know, holds no executive rank” in the Trump administration, Rosenzweig said.
Many of the recent headlines about Giuliani have drawn parallels with Cohen, who also held dual roles for Trump: attorney and, in his own words, fixer. Cohen pleaded guilty last year to several crimes, including arranging hush-money payments to women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump.
The roles the two men played show the president’s desire for someone who can both be a lawyer and a political henchman, Cotter said.
“Both attorneys … have engaged in actions that seem, to me, beyond the bounds and ethics of a lawyer,” Cotter said, “but they do them anyway. ”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- During President Trump's tenure in office, both his chief of staff and his national security adviser have listened to most scheduled calls with foreign leaders, according to current and former White House officials. During the phone conversation this summer that sparked an impeachment inquiry, neither of the two key advisers was on the line.
The two aides who missed the call -- Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton -- represented two poles of a fierce internal White House debate over an issue now at the center of a House impeachment inquiry: Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
This account is based on interviews with current White House officials, former administration officials, and people familiar with testimony given during the House's investigation of the president.
Mr. Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff and director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, carried out the president's order to suspend nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. Mr. Bolton, who has since resigned as national security adviser, protested the move and -- before the hold on the money was lifted -- promised Ukrainian officials during a visit to Kyiv in August that the U.S. wouldn't revoke it.
Mr. Bolton raised alarms after Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, brought up investigations the president wanted Ukraine to pursue in a July 10 meeting at the White House with senior Ukrainian officials, according to testimony from a witness in the House impeachment probe. Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's lawyer, had for months been pressing Ukraine on the president's behalf to mount investigations into Democrat Joe Biden and his son as well as into possible 2016 election interference. Those efforts have become a central focus of the House impeachment inquiry.
Two months earlier, Mr. Mulvaney organized a meeting at the White House between the president and the U.S. delegation that had traveled to Ukraine for Volodymyr Zelensky's inauguration, according to Rep. Gerry Connolly's (D., Va.) account of the testimony of a State Department witness. In that meeting, the president asked Mr. Sondland and other U.S. officials to work with Mr. Giuliani to address Mr. Trump's reservations about meeting with the Ukrainian president. Mr. Mulvaney raised no flags about that request.
When it came time for the July 25 phone call, Mr. Mulvaney's office helped schedule it, as it would for any foreign-leader call.
The call was billed as a simple congratulatory call about Ukrainian parliamentary elections. Mr. Mulvaney viewed it as routine and instead attended a breakfast with Vice President Mike Pence and Robert Lighthizer, the president's top trade adviser. Mr. Mulvaney sent his own national security adviser, deputy chief of staff Rob Blair, to monitor the president's call, and Mr. Blair raised no alarms about the call afterward.
Mr. Bolton closely tracked planning for the call. He told administration officials who were pushing for it that there was no reason to have the call because there was nothing substantive to discuss. He then pushed to delay it from happening before Ukraine's elections on July 21, a move he told officials would be inappropriate.
In a call with Energy Secretary Rick Perry on July 11, a day after the meeting with senior Ukrainian officials, Mr. Perry urged Mr. Bolton to schedule a call between Messrs. Trump and Zelensky. Mr. Perry said he, Mr. Sondland and U.S. envoy for Ukraine negotiations Kurt Volker wanted a call before the parliamentary elections to counter Russian influence and help build the relationship with Mr. Zelensky.
Mr. Bolton ultimately cleared the path for the call when he submitted the official National Security Council scheduling memo. The NSC under Mr. Bolton had also submitted scheduling memos for Mr. Trump's first conversation with Mr. Zelensky in April, and another for an official invitation for Mr. Zelensky to visit the White House. That meeting hasn't been scheduled.
At the time of the July 25 call, there were strains on the relationship between the president and Mr. Bolton. The two men disagreed on the president's approach with North Korea and his interest in meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.
Mr. Bolton sent his deputy, Charles Kupperman, to listen in to the call rather than attending himself. White House officials who worked closely with Mr. Bolton interpreted his absence as a signal of his frustration over the suspended Ukraine aid.
The White House has begun a review into how the president's call was handled, people familiar with the process said. The inquiry includes the decision by John Eisenberg, a lawyer on the NSC, to place records of the call into a classified computer system typically reserved for the government's most precious secrets, the people said.
Mr. Mulvaney is supportive of the probe, which was first reported by the New York Times, the people said.
The White House didn't respond to a request for comment, and an NSC spokesman declined to comment.

Texto completo: The Pentagon will have to disassemble combat bases that were built to stay for a mission that was supposed to last, and protect the troops as they withdraw amid a chaotic battlefield.
President Trump's decision -- made in the span of a week -- to withdraw about 1,000 American troops from northern Syria caught the Pentagon, and the forces on the ground, off guard.
To carry out the "endless wars" since Sept. 11, 2001, which Mr. Trump has vowed to wrap up, the American military has perfected the ability to build complex logistics pipelines that can funnel everything from armored vehicles to satellite internet access to gym equipment directly to combat outposts throughout the Middle East.
Now, American troops are making a hasty withdrawal from Syria -- under pressure from encroaching Turkish proxy forces, Russian aircraft and columns armored by the Syrian government. This means the Pentagon will have to disassemble combat bases and other infrastructure that were built to stay for a mission that was supposed to last, all while protecting the troops as they withdraw amid a chaotic battlefield.
Where did U.S. troops operate before the Turkish offensive?
Before the Turkish offensive, American troops, mostly Special Operations forces, operated in an archipelago of about a dozen bases and outposts across northeastern Syria, mostly living alongside their Syrian Kurdish partners. They were divided into two main headquarters, known by their cardinal directions, East and West.
The outposts are often a mixture of blast-resistant walls known as Hesco barriers, rudimentary structures and all-weather tents. The large air base in the city of Kobani is replete with a small tent city and some container housing units.
The western headquarters, known as Advanced Operational Base West, oversaw roughly half a dozen smaller outposts that covered cities like Manbij and Raqqa. About 500 troops are dedicated to the area partly overseen by A.O.B. West.
The eastern headquarters, known as A.O.B. East, is closer to the Iraqi border and helps monitor some of the roughly 500 troops in that area around the Euphrates River Valley, with several smaller outposts around Deir al-Zour and some near the Iraq-Syria border in towns like Bukamal and Hajin. The number of forces in the east, however, is fluid, as units frequently move between Syria and Iraq.
Where are those troops moving now?
As the troops withdraw, they first will collapse inward by abandoning the outposts closest to the line of advancing foreign troops, in this case the Turkish military and its ill-disciplined Syrian militia proxies, along with Russian and Syrian government forces. That strategy was made clear in a video posted online Tuesday, showing a Russian journalist standing in an abandoned American outpost west of Manbij and closest to Syrian government troops.
Col. Myles B. Caggins III, a spokesman for the American-led coalition based in Baghdad, confirmed on Twitter on Tuesday, "We are out of Manbij."
The troops are likely to be repositioned to Iraq or potentially to Jordan. Some may return to the United States, officials said.
What routes will the troops use in exiting Syria?
The western and eastern headquarters are likely to withdraw independently of each other. In the west, American forces will, according to American military officials, probably leave through the Kobani airfield, known as the Kobani Landing Zone. That base, with its long dirt runaway, can support C-17 transport aircraft and has a large Air Force contingent of maintenance staff. In the east, those forces will most likely exit overland and into Iraq in convoys, with some traveling via helicopter airlift.
Are there risks in the withdrawal?
The risk of confrontation with the medley of different ground forces -- both state-led and proxy -- is undoubtedly higher than it was several weeks ago.
Convoys moving through contested territory and aircraft making repeated landings all might contribute to an accidental confrontation or a staged attack, especially from any Islamic State leftovers that might want to take advantage of the sudden withdrawal.
One of the biggest risks to the remaining American troops as they pull back will most likely be attacks from a Turkish-backed Syrian militia called the Free Syrian Army, which has spearheaded the Turkish offensive in many places along the border. Those troops are supported by Turkish Army artillery and mortar fire, and Turkish Air Force strikes.
American officials say these Turkish-backed militia are less disciplined than regular Turkish soldiers, and deliberately or inadvertently have fired on retreating American troops. Another emerging threat comes from Islamic State fighters, who had gone underground after the defeat of the final shards of the terror group's caliphate, or religious state, in northern Syria this year.
The hasty, risky nature of the withdrawal might actually require that the number of American troops in Syria be increased, at least temporarily. The military's Central Command is preparing to send hundreds of additional American forces to help secure bases where American Special Forces have been operating with their Syrian Kurdish partners -- many of whom have now left to fight the Turks -- and safely evacuate those Americans in the coming weeks.
"We are repositioning additional forces in the region to assist with force protection as necessary," Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told reporters on Friday at the Pentagon.
In a sign of the concern over the safety of the remaining American troops in Syria, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke Monday with his Russian counterpart about the deteriorating security in the country's northeast.
And last Friday, the American military logged an attempt to attack a Marine KC-130 transport aircraft landing in Kobani with "surface-to-air fire," according to military documents obtained by The New York Times. The aircraft discharged flares as a defensive measure. The flight was unharmed and continued its approach, landing at the airfield.
Will any American troops stay in Syria?
Yes, there are roughly 150 troops at al-Tanf, a small base in southern Syria near the Jordanian border. While billed as a Special Operations mission to train local forces and go after the Islamic State, the base serves as a tollbooth of sorts for Iranian, Russian and Syrian forces in the region that have to navigate around its kilometers-wide defense bubble. The presence of American forces there gives the United States visibility on the movement and actions of those other military forces.
On the Jordanian side of the border, the American military keeps a quick reaction force staged there, including extra troops and artillery, in case anything were to go awry at the al-Tanf base.
The base also watches over a nearby refugee camp that is run by the United Nations.
What U.S. combat equipment will be left behind?
That is unclear. Some of the various bases' hard structures, tents, tables, gym equipment and larger construction machinery might be left behind. What won't be abandoned is anything sensitive, such as radios, weapons, armored vehicles and important documents.
American military officials say the hastier the withdrawal, the more equipment will be left behind or have to be destroyed. Much depends on the security conditions on the ground.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—During President Trump's tenure in office, both his chief of staff and his national security adviser have listened to most scheduled calls with foreign leaders, according to current and former White House officials. During the phone conversation this summer that sparked an impeachment inquiry , neither of the two key advisers was on the line.
The two aides who missed the call—Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton—represented two poles of a fierce internal White House debate over an issue now at the center of a House impeachment inquiry:
Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
This account is based on interviews with current White House officials, former administration officials, and people familiar with testimony given during the House's investigation of the president.
Mr. Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff and director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, carried out the president's order to suspend nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. Mr. Bolton, who has since resigned as national security adviser, protested the move and—before the hold on the money was lifted—promised Ukrainian officials during a visit to Kyiv in August that the U.S. wouldn't revoke it.
Mr. Bolton raised alarms after the U.S. ambassador to the European Union brought up investigations the president wanted Ukraine to pursue in a July 10 meeting at the White House with senior Ukrainian officials, according to testimony from a witness in the House impeachment probe. Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's lawyer, had for months been pressing Ukraine on the president's behalf to mount investigations into Democrat Joe Biden and his son as well as into possible 2016 election interference. Those efforts have become a central focus of the House impeachment inquiry.
Two months earlier, Mr. Mulvaney organized a meeting at the White House between the president and the U.S. delegation that had traveled to Ukraine for Volodymyr Zelensky's inauguration, according to Rep. Gerry Connolly's (D., Va.) account of the testimony of a State Department witness. In that meeting, the president asked the same ambassador, Gordon Sondland, and other U.S. officials to work with Mr. Giuliani to address Mr. Trump's reservations about meeting with the Ukrainian president. Mr. Mulvaney raised no flags about that request.
When it came time for the July 25 phone call, Mr. Mulvaney's office helped schedule it, as it would for any foreign-leader call.
The call was billed as a simple congratulatory call about the Ukrainian parliamentary elections. Mr. Mulvaney viewed it as routine and instead attended a breakfast with Vice President Mike Pence and Robert Lighthizer, the president's top trade adviser. Mr. Mulvaney sent his own national security adviser, deputy chief of staff Rob Blair, to monitor the president's call, and Mr. Blair raised no alarms about the call afterward.
Mr. Bolton closely tracked planning for the call. He told administration officials who were pushing for it that there was no reason to have the call because there was nothing substantive to discuss. He then pushed to delay it from happening before Ukraine's parliamentary elections on July 21. Holding it earlier, he told officials, would be inappropriate.
In a call with Energy Secretary Rick Perry on July 11, a day after the meeting with senior Ukrainian officials, Mr. Perry urged Mr. Bolton to schedule a call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Perry said he, Mr. Sondland and U.S. envoy for Ukraine negotiations Kurt Volker wanted a call before the parliamentary elections to counter Russian influence and help build the relationship with Mr. Zelensky. He told Mr. Bolton they were assured that Mr. Zelensky wouldn't prove an obstacle to any investigations into alleged corruption.
Inside the White House, Messrs. Perry and Sondland were viewed as the biggest proponents of a July call between the two presidents. They told White House officials that it was important to establish a close relationship with Mr. Zelensky to encourage Ukraine's energy independence and help push the country away from Russia and closer to the West.
Mr. Bolton ultimately cleared the path for the call when he submitted the official National Security Council scheduling memo. The NSC under Mr. Bolton had also submitted scheduling memos for Mr. Trump's first conversation with Mr. Zelensky in April, and another for an official invitation for Mr. Zelensky to visit the White House. That meeting hasn't been scheduled.
But Mr. Trump was lukewarm to the request to speak to Mr. Zelensky a second time. He told one official that he didn't think a call with Mr. Zelensky was worth interrupting the weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. The phone call was delayed for another day because the White House had blocked off time for a potential phone conversation between Mr. Trump and the prime minister of Sweden about the rapper A$AP Rocky, whose arrest in Stockholm the president had made a priority to monitor.
At the time of the July 25 call, there were strains on the relationship between the president and Mr. Bolton. The two men disagreed on the president's approach with North Korea and his interest in meeting with Iran President Hassan Rouhani. Iran policy was the source of a heated argument in London in June between Mr. Bolton and Mr. Mulvaney, who accused Mr. Bolton of trying to start a war and veering from Mr. Trump's preferred path.
Mr. Bolton was ousted from the White House amid disputes over the president's pursuit of a meeting with the Taliban at Camp David and his willingness to ease sanctions on Tehran to secure a meeting with Mr. Rouhani. His departure was about six weeks after the president's call with Mr. Zelensky.
Mr. Bolton was traveling in Asia on July 23 and 24, but was back in Washington at the time of the Ukraine call. NSC staff asked to hold off on Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky until Mr. Bolton returned from the trip.
But ultimately, Mr. Bolton sent his deputy, Charles Kupperman, to listen in to the July 25 call rather than attending himself, as he consistently did on other scheduled calls with foreign leaders.
White House officials who worked closely with Mr. Bolton interpreted his absence as a signal of his frustration over the suspended Ukraine aid.
The list of those listening on that call—Mr. Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence's national security adviser Keith Kellogg, Mr. Kupperman, Mr. Blair, among others—helps to fill out an understanding of a conversation that is now under scrutiny. The presence of Messrs. Kupperman and Blair, and Mr. Mulvaney's absence, haven't previously been reported.
Before the July 25 call, Mr. Bolton argued with the president that any disruption in aid would leave Kyiv and the rest of Europe vulnerable to Russian aggression. One White House aide said that argument became heated on Mr. Bolton's side. After the call, advocates for the aid within the White House and on Capitol Hill pushed for the president to reconsider.
The White House lifted the hold on Sept. 12, two days after Mr. Bolton's departure.
The White House has begun a review into how the president's July 25 call to the Ukrainian leader was handled, people familiar with the process said. The inquiry, led by the White House Counsel's Office, is seeking to establish how administration officials handled the call, including the decision by John Eisenberg, a lawyer at the NSC, to place records of the call into a classified computer system typically reserved for the government's most precious secrets, the people said.
Mr. Mulvaney is supportive of the probe—which was first reported by the New York Times—the people said. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment and the NSC spokesman declined to comment.

Vehicle pollution keeps growing

Texto completo: Pollution from auto emissions has gone up 55 percent in the Tampa Bay area since 1990, according to a nationwide analysis the New York Times published last week.

The numbers are nearly the same or worse for other parts of the state during that time period: a 53 percent increase in the Jacksonville area; 58 percent in the Dade-Broward region; 61 percent in the Sarasota-Bradenton area; 98 percent in the Orlando region; and a whopping 126 percent in Naples.

In some areas the increase is partly due to population growth, but in others the per capita amount of pollution has increased as well. In the Tampa Bay area, the amount of vehicle-related pollution produced per person has gone up by 4 percent since 1990.

The newspaper noted that these figures  based on data collected by Boston University  are important because transportation is the largest source of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the United States today and the bulk of those emissions come from driving in our cities and suburbs. About 60 percent of the vehicle emissions come from the nations 250 million passenger vehicles, with 23 percent from commercial truck traffic.

Pinellas and Hillsborough counties used to be among the six Florida counties that required drivers to bring their vehicles in for an annual emissions inspection every year. In addition to a cursory safety check, inspectors were looking for cars that were belching smoke like a Rust Belt factory. The other counties were Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Duval.

Florida was required to launch the emissions inspection program in 1991, after those six regions flunked federal smog standards. Every year inspec

tors spotted thousands of vehicles that couldnt pass muster. In 1999, for instance, the inspectors ordered 25,941 drivers to repair their vehicles or scrap their beaters.

But motorists disliked sitting in long lines and breathing the noxious fumes while waiting their turn to fork over money for the inspection. In 2000, the Legislature and then-Gov. Jeb Bush teamed up to eliminate the inspections entirely. They declared it to be both expensive  costing a total of $52 million a year  and unneeded, given that the Environmental Protection Agency under Florida native Carol Browner said the states air had gotten cleaner.

The vehicle inspection program is not an efficient tool for reducing pollution and is an unnecessary burden to motorists, Bush said then. Preliminary approval by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has confirmed that emission testing is not necessary to maintain air quality standards in all the Florida counties they have reviewed.

Efforts by the American Lung Association and civic and environmental groups failed to sway the politicians who were happy to support a deregulation move that saved people both money and aggravation.

But 19 years later, Its hard to argue that our air wouldnt be cleaner here in Florida today if we still had emissions testing, said Mark Ferrulo of Progress Florida, who in 2000 was leading one of the civic groups trying to save the program.

Bush, in an email to the Tampa Bay Times, defended ending the program.

The emissions testing was not so consumer friendly, it cost too much, Bush wrote. We saved millions each year for Florida. I am proud of getting that done and there is no evidence that it had any influence on increased emissions since they were growing before the action taken. But I do know that used car owners were delighted that they didnt have to go through the agony of inspections.

For Tampa Bay, auto emissions are more than just an air pollution problem. According to Maya Burke of the Tampa Bay Estuary Program, what comes out of drivers tailpipes ends up settling into the water and polluting that too.

Its one of our primary sources of nitrogen pollution, Burke said. The quasi-governmental organizations most recent report on the bay shows vehicle emissions account for 17 percent of all the nitrogen in the bay.

Originally wastewater flowing into the bay and power plant smoke accounted for a greater percentage of the pollution problem, she said. But over the years local governments have cut back on the wastewater dumping and added scrubbers to power plant smokestacks. Meanwhile, the auto emissions continued apace, and gradually became a larger percentage of the problem, she explained.

We try to tell people that air quality equals water quality, Burke said. All that pollution in the air comes back in the form of nitrogen that lands in the bay.

Nitrogen pollution fuels algae blooms such as Red Tide when it drifts near shore and can also cause sea grass die-offs.

Florida is considered one of the states that is most vulnerable to climate change because its a peninsula surrounded by water and the land is flatter than Kansas, meaning sea level rise will go farther inland faster.

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential debate being held tonight — Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019 — in a suburb near Ohio’s capital will bring back a candidate who has been absent from the stage for a while and introduce one who has never before been seen on the party’s debate lineup.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard failed to qualify for the September debate but will be back on stage tonight after meeting the Democratic National Committee’s qualifications:
* Earning at least 2% support in four DNC-approved polls
* Receiving contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors
* Of those donors, at least 400 each must come from 20 different states
Also making that cut will be first-time presidential debater Tom Steyer of California. The billionaire hedge fund founder is known for his large contributions to environmental causes and political campaigns.
Along with those two will be the 10 candidates you would expect to see on the stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, listed alphabetically:
* Former Vice President Joe Biden
* New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker
* South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg
* Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro
* California Sen. Kamala Harris
* Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar
* Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke
* Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders
* Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren
* Businessman Andrew Yang

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential debate being held tonight — Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019 — in a suburb near Ohio’s capital will bring back a candidate who has been absent from the stage for a while and introduce one who has never before been seen on the party’s debate lineup.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard failed to qualify for the September debate but will be back on stage tonight after meeting the Democratic National Committee’s qualifications:
* Earning at least 2% support in four DNC-approved polls
* Receiving contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors
* Of those donors, at least 400 each must come from 20 different states
Also making that cut will be first-time presidential debater Tom Steyer of California. The billionaire hedge fund founder is known for his large contributions to environmental causes and political campaigns.
Along with those two will be the 10 candidates you would expect to see on the stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, listed alphabetically:
* Former Vice President Joe Biden
* New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker
* South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg
* Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro
* California Sen. Kamala Harris
* Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar
* Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke
* Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders
* Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren
* Businessman Andrew Yang
Tonight’s debate from 5 to 8 p.m. Pacific time is sponsored by the New York Times and CNN and will be carried on the cable network. The moderators are CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper, and New York Times editor Marc Lacey.

Beto O’Rourke on taking AR-15s from gun owners: ‘I believe that they will do the right thing’

Texto completo: Beto O'Rourke said the key enforcement mechanism for his proposed AR-15 confiscation is a belief that the American people will participate.
During the fourth round of Democratic presidential debates, O'Rourke was asked how he would deliver on a promise he made during the last round of debates to confiscate "weapons of war" from American gun owners given that it is unknown how many guns are in the country and who owns them.
CNN host Anderson Cooper noted that O'Rourke has promised to fine gun owners who don't participate in a mandatory buyback but asked how he could ensure that all AR-15s and similar weapons were off the streets, as he has promised police would not be going "door-to-door."
O'Rourke claimed those who brandish their weapons will face legal action, but most, he believes, will be turned over from Americans.
"If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public to brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, there will be other consequences from law enforcement," said O'Rourke.
He continued, "But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law. I believe in this country. I believe in my fellow Americans. I believe that they will do the right thing."

O'Rourke also used the debate stage to go after his fellow Democrats who have called for a ban on the sales of AR-15s but have stopped short of calling for a full ownership ban.
"So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging with 16 million AR-15s and AK-47s out there, they are also too dangerous to own," said O'Rourke.

Nixon, Grant, and Buchanan are off the hook: Trump ‘most corrupt’ president in history, according to 2020 Democrats

Texto completo: President Trump is everything to the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.

He is even the “most corrupt” president in the history of the United States, according to Sens. Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden.

“In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country. It is not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller report. I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause,” said Sanders at the outset of Tuesday’s Democratic debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.

Biden later added that Trump "is the most corrupt president in modern history and, I think, all of our history.”

“[Trump] is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had,” said Harris.

This should come as a great relief to former Presidents James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, Warren Harding, and even Richard Nixon. Yes, according to the 2020 candidates, Trump is worse than even Nixon, who you might remember resigned rather than be impeached over a little something called Watergate.

Buchanan’s gross mismanagement, incompetence, and general corruption as president was the final straw that launched the U.S. into civil war, claiming the lives of an estimated 620,000 Americans. A special committee ruled in 1860 that Buchanan’s administration was the most corrupt in history.

Johnson regularly flouted laws passed by Congress. He frequently challenged Congress’ legal authority. Johnson also sacked federal officials without seeking consent from Congress. All this led to his eventual impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1868. Johnson was acquitted that same year, mostly because the charges, which were political, did not come close to meeting the threshold for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” After Johnson left office, the U.S. was plunged into the worst recession in its history.

Grant’s tenure in the White House is notable only because it was so corrupt.
Then there is Harding, who is probably the reigning champion in the nepotism category. He filled his White House with friends and family, many of whom lined their pockets with unethical, or likely illegal, kickbacks. The worst of it was when it was revealed that members of Harding’s administration took bribes from private companies in return for leases to drill on public lands.
Then there is Nixon, who was a walking, talking caricature of corruption. From Watergate to illegal bombing campaigns in Cambodia to sabotaging the Vietnam peace talks to win his presidential election bid to holding an "enemies list," America’s 37th president had it all.

Sanders actually said with a straight face Tuesday evening that Trump is worse than all of this because of possible emoluments clause violations.

Please. Get a hold of yourself, people.

Nixon will likely go on holding the distinction of being the worst commander in chief in history, even after Trump and his cohort are long gone.

Trump’s hands certainly seem dirty. There certainly seems to be a lot of smoke where Democrats and their allies in the press say there is a fire. But let’s wait on handing the Trump White House first-place trophy for “most corrupt.”

That is not for us to decide for now. Only time can do that.

Elizabeth Warren's stubborn dishonesty on raising middle-class taxes

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren deservedly drew heat from several rivals over her stubborn refusal to acknowledge that implementing a $32 trillion plan to provide free health insurance to everybody would require increasing middle-class taxes. But since she keeps trying to make the same bad argument, it's worth reviewing what's so dishonest about it.
Warren, whenever she's asked about whether middle-class taxes would go up, argues that costs would only go up for corporations and the wealthy, but "costs would go down for the middle class."
Essentially, she's trying to make the case that because middle-class Americans would be getting free healthcare, their costs would go down overall. But Sen. Bernie Sanders, who actually wrote the bill she's endorsing, makes a similar argument about middle-class Americans being better off on net under his plan (without premiums, deductibles, or co-payments), but he acknowledges that the middle class would still pay more in taxes.
It's one thing to argue that people are getting a better deal by sending money to the government in exchange for services. It's another to refuse to acknowledge they are paying taxes. For instance, people may believe that paying property taxes and sending their kids to public school is a good deal on net. But they still think of property taxes as taxes and increases in property taxes as tax increases. They don't say that they aren't actually paying taxes, because otherwise they'd have to pay to educate their kids, or that property taxes didn't go up because the percentage increase in tuition at a local private school was even higher.
Even looking at things on a net tradeoff basis, however, Warren's numbers don't add up. An analysis of the 2016 Sanders campaign proposal from the liberal Urban Institute took into account that much of the $32 trillion price tag would result from the federal government absorbing many costs currently being paid by states and the private sector. But the analysis still found that the plan would increase overall health spending in the U.S by $6.6 trillion over a decade.
The largest revenue raiser Warren has proposed during her campaign is a $2.75 trillion wealth tax, or less than half this amount. Put aside the fact that European countries have abandoned wealth taxes because they haven't worked, and that there is significant reason for skepticism that it will raise as much as promised. Warren has already pledged to use the wealth tax to pay for universal child care, universal pre-K, raising child care worker pay, free college, and canceling student loan debt.
The clearest proof that middle-class taxes will have to go up is that other countries with socialized health insurance systems along the lines of what Warren is advocating have higher middle-class taxes than the U.S., and often national sales taxes, or VAT taxes (which are especially punishing for those with lower incomes who have to spend most of their income).
Warren wants us to envy the social welfare systems of other countries while ignoring their tax systems.

What is it with the Cuomo brothers and the N-word?

Texto completo: CNN anchor Andrew Cuomo claimed in August that his unflattering nickname “Fredo,” which is derived from the Godfather series, is “like the N-word” for Italian Americans.
This is obviously not true. But do you know what is like the N-word? The N-word, which the CNN host’s brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, dropped Tuesday during a live radio interview.
The governor’s remarks came amid the broader context of him complaining about the New York Times, which he claims does not know what it is talking about when it reports that his administration “pulled off a fiscal sleight of hand, delaying $1.7 billion in scheduled Medicaid payments by three days — effectively pushing the cost to the following year’s budget.”
“To tell you the truth,” Cuomo said, “I don’t even, I don’t understand that fully.”
His host, WAMC's Alan Chartock, joked, “Well, if the Times said it so, it must be so, right?”
“Oh, well, yeah,” groused the governor. “Oh, Times also said in an article the other day, apropos of nothing, they were talking about — going back the Italian-Americans because you now have me. They used an expression that southern Italians were called. I believe they were saying southern Italians, Sicilians — I am half Sicilian — were called, quote-unquote, and pardon my language, but I am just quoting the Times, ‘[N-word] wops.’ N-word wops as a derogatory comment.”
The New York Times article to which Cuomo is referring is an Oct. 12 op-ed titled, “How Italians Became ‘White.'" It includes the following passage:
Racist dogma about Southern Italians found fertile soil in the United States. As the historian Jennifer Guglielmo writes, the newcomers encountered waves of books, magazines and newspapers that “bombarded Americans with images of Italians as racially suspect.” They were sometimes shut out of schools, movie houses and labor unions, or consigned to church pews set aside for black people. They were described in the press as “swarthy,” “kinky haired” members of a criminal race and derided in the streets with epithets like “dago,” “guinea” — a term of derision applied to enslaved Africans and their descendants — and more familiarly racist insults like “white [N-word]” and “[N-word] wop.”
Cuomo had at least three separate racist insults from which to choose and he quoted on live radio the one slur that combines two separate racial epithets. Solid work, my man.
The governor continued Tuesday, railing against the failing New York Times, saying, “When I said that ‘wop’ was a derogatory comment, that is when the Times Union told me, ‘No, you should look in Wikipedia. ‘Wop’ really meant a ‘dandy.’”
“I am sure that’s what they was saying to me back in Queens -- ‘You’re a dandy!’ – when they looked at me with scorn, and gave me a hand gesture and called me a ‘wop.’ So, that’s the New York Times,” he added.
A quick word of clarification: If you are confused by the governor’s reference to the Times Union during his tirade about the New York Times, you should be. They are two separate New York-based news entities. Cuomo conflated the New York Times’ Oct. 12 article with an Aug. 16 Times Union op-ed, which argued that “wop” is actually derived from the word “guappo,” which is Italian for “dude” or “dandy,” as opposed to “without papers,” as the governor claims.
To recap: You have the governor of New York using the N-word for no good reason on live radio. You have his little brother claiming “Fredo” is like the N-word for Italian Americans. This same little brother, by the way, also once said that the term “fake news” is “the equivalent of the N-word for journalists.”
All of this is to say: What is it with the Cuomos and that word?

Texto completo: Kamala Harris claimed that President Trump has already confessed to committing a crime and that he should be impeached.
Harris appeared at the fourth Democratic presidential primary debate on Tuesday night with 11 other candidates. The joint CNN/New York Times debate kicked off with questions to the candidates over possible impeachment and removal from office.
Harris began the debate claiming that the evidence already compiled against Trump is enough to justify impeachment.
"It's just being observant, because he has committed crimes in plain sight," Harris said. "He has consistently, since he won, been selling out the American people. He's been selling out working people. He's been selling out our values. He's been selling out national security."
"On this issue with Ukraine, he has been selling out our democracy," Harris said. "Congress must act. The reality of it is that I don’t think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it."iFrame Object

Texto completo: This column is not the first to notice that Democratic politicians seem to spend about half the day accusing President Trump of trashing vaguely defined Constitutional norms—and the other half explaining how they plan to trash enumerated Constitutional rights. As for the latter activity, Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate is another opportunity for candidates to show how much damage they intend to inflict on the first two Amendments. Now prominent activists are demanding that candidates promise to be more radical than America's 44th President.
Seung Min Kim writes in the Washington Post today:
Democratic presidential contenders are coming under increased pressure from their base to take a page from Donald Trump's 2016 playbook and release a shortlist of potential Supreme Court nominees — one part of a larger strategy from party activists to make the courts a central issue in the 2020 race.
Demand Justice, a group founded to counteract the conservative wing's decades-long advantage over liberals in judicial fights, will release a list of 32 suggested Supreme Court nominees for any future Democratic president as they ramp up their push for the 2020 contenders to do the same.
The slate of potential high court picks includes current and former members of Congress, top litigators battling the Trump administration's initiatives in court, professors at the nation's top law schools and public defenders. Eight are sitting judges. They have established track records in liberal causes that Demand Justice hopes will energize the liberal base.
What's interesting is that Demand Justice is not a Sandernista fringe group. It's run by Brian Fallon, who has impeccable Democratic establishment credentials according to the group's website :
Fallon worked as the Director of Public Affairs for the U.S. Department of Justice during the Obama administration. Prior to that, he was a top aide in the United States Senate, working for New York Democrat Chuck Schumer.
In 2016, Fallon served as the National Press Secretary for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. He appears frequently on MSNBC and CNN to discuss national politics from a progressive perspective.
Fallon is a 2003 graduate of Harvard College.
It's also interesting, as a commentary on how far and how fast his party has been moving leftward, that he and his "progressive" friends don't seem to trust most of the people his old boss appointed to the federal bench. "Justice on Trial" co-author Carrie Severino notes on Twitter :
Amazing: there must be hundreds of federal judges Obama put on the courts, and only 4 make this list. This list would have been way too liberal for Obama.
...Only 8 of the 32 potential nominees on this list have judicial experience. Which makes sense - they're looking for activists, not judges.
The bet here is that voters still prefer a President who's looking for judges.

Executive Producers of The Impeachment Show
"Why can't we see the witnesses testify?," writes Noah Weiland in the New York Times. Mr. Weiland then does his best to answer the question:
My colleague Nick Fandos, who was on Capitol Hill today, explained to me why Democrats are doing so much out of public view:
The Democrats are trying to collect as much information as possible as quickly as possible. Big made-for-TV hearings are a chaotic and clunky way to try to build a body of evidence. They allow witnesses to line up their stories in advance and could easily backfire on Democrats trying to build a public narrative in real time.
Most congressional veterans would tell you that from a fact-finding point of view, you are better off following the Watergate model: Investigate in private first, then choreograph a series of public hearings that recreate for the public what the investigation found. Republicans, nevertheless, are accusing Democrats of impeaching a president in secret.
Are Republicans really the only ones bothered by Democrats "doing so much out of public view" to "build a public narrative" and then "choreograph a series of public hearings"?

LeBron's Favorite Dictator
China's communist strongman Xi Jinping is surely enjoying comments from NBA star LeBron James discouraging criticism of Mr. Xi's regime. The BBC reports that the Beijing tyrant is also doing his part to discourage free speech:
China's president has issued a warning against dissent, saying any attempt to divide China will end in "bodies smashed and bones ground to powder".
Xi Jinping's comments came during a state visit to Nepal on Sunday, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said.
He didn't mention any particular region but it was seen as a warning to Hong Kong, where anti-Beijing protests have been ongoing for months.
"Anyone who attempts to split any region from China will perish," said Mr Xi, according to the BBC. Adds government-run China Daily:
Those who engage in separatist activities in any part of China will be smashed into pieces, Xi said, adding that external support for separatists will be seen by the Chinese people as delusional.
Is it delusional to believe the NBA will not enhance its global brand by seeking to please dictators?

Repulsive video satire of rampaging Trump a sign of our sick political times Orlando Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: The sickening decline of politics in 2019 continued this weekend with the showing at a right-wing conference of a video that depicted President Donald Trump massacring a church full of people.
The scene was lifted from the film, "Kingsman: The Secret Service," during which Colin Firth - his mind altered by a SIM card signal - uses guns and stabbing objects to kill people in a Kentucky church.
In the edited version of that scene, Trump's face is on Firth's body, and the faces of his victims are replaced by various news outlets' logos or people the president has denounced (a sizable group, that).
Trump appears to have played no role in all of this, and a spokeswoman said Monday morning that he had not seen it but, "based on everything he had heard, he strongly condemns this video."
It seems odd the president hasn't yet seen it, considering the amount of time he spends on Twitter, but OK.
We would prefer to hear this in the president's own voice, considering he hasn't shied away from embracing violence in the past.
Examples? In 2017, he posted another video, this time an old clip of the real Donald Trump attacking someone during a WrestleMania event. The video he tweeted superimposed CNN's logo over his victim's face. Har, har.
In 2018, he praised a Montana congressman who pleaded guilty to attacking a reporter, saying, "Any guy that can do a body slam, he's my guy."
In 2016, he asked supporters at a rally to "knock the hell" out of protesters, promising to pay the attackers' legal bills.
Until this weekend, the "Kingsman" video resided in a corner of YouTube for more than a year, viewed more than 170,000 times by people who get their jollies from such things.
Then someone decided to show it at AMPfest19, a conservative gathering at the Trump National Doral resort in Miami. The conference featured a lengthy list of speakers, including Donald Trump Jr. and Florida's own U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz and Mike Haridopolos, the one-time president of the state Senate.
The conference had lined up a number of misfits, cranks and extremists to discuss such topics as "Unmasking the Russian Hoax," "Education Indoctrination: How the Left Has Poisoned Our Schools," and "The Left's LGBT Manipulation."
Speakers included Dinesh D'Souza, James O'Keefe, Jack Posobiec, Laura Loomer and a person who calls himself Carpe Donktum, who confirmed to the Washington Post that the video's creator was someone who contributes to his MemeWorld site.
Carpe Donktum was Trump's guest in the Oval Office in July. That bears repeating: A guy called Carpe Donktum had a 20-minute meeting with the president of the United States.
We don't know several key details in this story, which was first reported by The New York Times, like who was responsible for showing this video, the time and the location the video was shown, or how many people saw it.
We do know that the organizer of AMPfest19, or American Priority, posted a statement saying he knew nothing about the video and did not sanction it. Was American Priority shocked? Absolutely, but not by the video.
Organizer Alex Phillips wrote that it was "shocking the New York Times would not report on any of the sanctioned events in the article."
If that - and not the graphic depiction of violence against the media and political enemies - is what shocks American Priority, the event should get some new priorities.
Trump didn't tell someone to make this video. He didn't have to. His unceasing attacks on anyone who crosses him have granted soft permission for Americans to act on their worst impulses.
When they do, the president makes a few perfunctory, half-hearted remarks, then returns to the attack mode that amuses and entertains so many of his supporters.
Trump could use his platform to promote American unity, but that's not part of his DNA.
Someday this nation will rediscover its basic decency. Someday can't come soon enough.

Main Street: Bill Barr 'Gets' Religion

Texto completo: For Notre Dame fans, this football weekend was a twofer. Not only did the Irish beat a longtime rival, the University of Southern California, on Saturday, the campus was treated to a sight it had never before seen: the attorney general of the United States, at a pregame tailgater, serenading faculty, students and fans with his bagpipes.
Turns out that was William Barr's second performance on campus. The first came at the law school Friday, when he delivered a bracing speech on the role of religion in the American story of freedom.
The attorney general advanced two broad propositions. First, the waning of religion's influence in American life has left more of her citizens vulnerable to what Tocqueville called the "soft despotism" of government dependency. Second, today's secularists are decidedly not of the live-and-let-live variety.
"The secular project has itself become a religion, pursued with religious fervor," he said. "It is taking on all the trappings of religion, including inquisitions and excommunication. Those who defy the creed risk a figurative burning at the stake -- social, educational and professional ostracism and exclusion waged through lawsuits and savage social media campaigns."
Right out of central casting, critics stepped forward to prove his point. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman accused Mr. Barr of "religious bigotry" and described his words as a "pogrom type speech."
Political ethicist and professional attention seeker Richard Painter tapped out a series of even more furious tweets, here calling the speech the latest episode of "The Handmaid's Tale," there suggesting Mr. Barr isn't much of a Christian, here again saying Mr. Barr sounded like "vintage Goebbels." Over at MSNBC, meanwhile, retired Army Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, once chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, told Joy Reid the attorney general is "Torquemada in a business suit," a reference to the Spanish Inquisition's grand inquisitor.
This is what we have come to expect when someone in public life mentions religion in a positive light. Many didn't like Mr. Barr's blaming secularism for social pathologies such as drug addiction, family breakdown and increasing numbers of angry and alienated young males. Yet few engaged his more arresting contention, which is that all these problems have spiritual roots. Whereas religion addresses such challenges by stressing personal responsibility, Mr. Barr argued, the state's answer is merely to try to alleviate "bad consequences."
"So the reaction to growing illegitimacy is not sexual responsibility, but abortion," he said. "The reaction to drug addiction is safe injection sites. The solution to the breakdown of the family is for the state to set itself up as an ersatz husband for the single mother and an ersatz father for the children. The call comes for more and more social programs to deal with this wreckage -- and while we think we're solving problems, we are underwriting them."
Vincent Phillip Munoz, a Notre Dame professor, notes there was nothing particularly Catholic about this speech. Like Washington in his Farewell Address, he says, Mr. Barr focused on the irreplaceable role of religion in cultivating the morality citizens need to be capable of self-government.
"The speech wasn't first and foremost about religious freedom," says Mr. Munoz. "It was about the human and social consequences of the new secular morality, and what happens when the state views its citizens not only in purely material terms, but as subjects who can't really govern themselves."
Even those who strongly disagree with Mr. Barr ought to have found this an invitation for thoughtful and vigorous debate. But rather than engage, some imply there is something unseemly about an attorney general's even speaking at a Catholic university. Given the hostility that holding such a conversation engenders on campuses today, perhaps America can count itself fortunate it still has a university where this can happen.
Carter Snead, the law professor who invited Mr. Barr, puts it this way: "At Notre Dame, we are not afraid to explore the hard questions about God, religion and America together in friendship, especially on those matters about which people strongly disagree."
Mr. Barr's argument has been echoed throughout American history: "Our Constitution was made for only for a moral and religious people" (John Adams). "Liberty cannot be established without morality, nor morality without faith" (Tocqueville). "In teaching this democratic faith to American children, we need the sustaining, buttressing aid of those great ethical religious teachings which are the heritage of our modern civilization. For 'not upon strength nor upon power, but upon the spirit of God' shall our democracy be founded" (FDR). And so on.
That so many would become unhinged by Mr. Barr's relatively modest contribution to the genre is highly revealing of the absolutism of secularist opponents determined to marginalize and destroy anyone who dares dissent from their own uncompromising orthodoxy.

Warren escalates Facebook fight with ad targeting Zuckerberg

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has escalated her tiff with Facebook by running an ad — on Facebook — taking aim at its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. It's the latest example of growing resentment of Big Tech by Republicans and Democrats alike.
The list of grievances is long: Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are too big and powerful. They're bad for privacy, public discourse, democracy, and small business. They're spying on us, contributing to economic inequality, and hooking us and our children on addictive, useless services. The companies, of course, object to these characterizations.
Warren, who in March proposed breaking up big tech companies, began running a text ad on Facebook last Thursday to take aim at Zuckerberg.
"Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election," the ad reads. It then goes on to say that while this isn't true, Zuckerberg has "given Donald Trump free rein to lie" on Facebook.
Warren's ad is taking issue with Facebook's policy of not fact-checking politicians' speech or ads, the way it has outside parties fact-check news stories and other posts. Facebook has refused to remove a misleading video ad from President Trump's campaign targeting Democrat Joe Biden.
Facebook responded to Warren's move by tweeting Saturday that the Federal Communications Commission "doesn't want broadcast companies censoring candidates' speech. We agree it's better to let voters — not companies — decide."

Census Bureau seeks state data, citizenship information
The US Census Bureau is asking states for drivers' license records that typically include citizenship data and has made a new request for information on recipients of government assistance, alarming some civil rights advocates.
The two approaches come amid President Trump's efforts to make citizenship a key aspect of federal information-gathering in the runup to the 2020 Census, despite this year's Supreme Court ruling that a specific citizenship question can't be included.
Civil rights advocates worry that the wider net being cast by the Trump administration for such information could chill Latino participation in the population count, which will determine how many congressional seats each state gets and guide the allocation of federal funding. The census results also will be used to redraw state and local electoral maps.
Specialists caution that inaccuracies in state motor vehicle records also make them a poor choice for tracking citizenship, if that is the bureau's goal.
After the Supreme Court ruling, Trump signed an executive order in July requiring the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, to collect records on citizenship from federal agencies and increase efforts "to obtain State administrative records concerning citizenship."
The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators said most, if not all, states recently received requests for information including citizenship status, race, birthdates, and addresses. The association has advised members to consult their privacy officers, and "each state is making their own determination how to respond," spokeswoman Claire Jeffrey said in an e-mail.

The United States essentially turned its back on Ukraine amid the impeachment inquiry, TV host Dmitry Kiselyov said in his weekly show. Then, Washington abandoned the Syrian Kurds. “The Kurds themselves again picked the wrong patron," Kiselyov said. “The United States, of course, is an unreliable partner."
As the Middle East reels from President Trump's erratic foreign policy, Russia is savoring a fresh chance to build its status as a resurgent world power and cast itself as a force for stability. The withdrawal of US troops from northeastern Syria, coupled with Turkey's incursion, is allowing Russia to play the part of responsible peacemaker.
It's too soon to tell whether Russia will be able to manage the new volatility in Syria, just as it's not clear if the impeachment furor over Ukraine will help the Kremlin's interests in Eastern Europe. But as Russian President Vladimir Putin landed in Saudi Arabia Monday for a state visit to one of America's most important allies, it appeared clear that Trump's moves in recent months were helping him make the case that Moscow, not Washington, was the more dependable actor on the world stage.
Putin appears to be betting that he can boost Russia's global standing by playing to other countries' individual interests in a world in which the Trump administration's moves have left many traditional US allies in dismay.
“Russia will never be friends with one country against another," Putin said in an interview with two Arab news networks and the Kremlin-controlled channel RT Arabic that aired Sunday. “We build bilateral relations that rely on positive trends generated by our contacts; we do not build alliances against anyone."

Trump says he'll look into case after Fox appearance
President Trump says he'll "be looking into" the case of a US financial adviser charged with killing a hotel worker while on a family vacation in Anguilla after the man's wife appeared on the "Fox & Friends" morning show and urged Trump to intervene.
Trump tweeted shortly after the segment that, "Something looks and sounds very wrong."
He says: "I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved!"
Scott Hapgood and his family were on vacation when they say a hotel worker showed up at their room unannounced and demanded money before attacking them on April 13.
An autopsy report shows the victim, 27-year-old Kenny Mitchel of Dominica, died of positional asphyxia and received blunt force injuries to his torso and other areas.

Texto completo: Even in the midst of an impeachment inquiry, President Trump’s decision to pull U.S. troops from northern Syria, enabling a Turkish offensive against Kurdish fighters, has prompted howls of protest — including from prominent Republicans who otherwise can barely bring themselves to utter a critical word.
The critics have a point. There are good reasons to wring one’s hands, but there is also a cogent “America First” argument to be made in favor of withdrawal — even if declaring policy with a surprise tweet isn’t the way to go about it. There is a third way to look at it, as well: The cynic’s view of how America often conducts foreign policy.
So overall, which viewpoint has the most merit? Let’s go with the cynical one.
The hand-wringers’ list of worries is well documented, and it was summed up by conservative columnist Bret Stephens in the New York Times. The first concern is the moral cost of abandoning an ally: Allowing Turkey to invade leaves the Kurds, who did America’s dirty work fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, to face a vastly superior force alone.
But the move also damages Washington’s reputation as an ally; gives the Islamic State a chance to regroup; encourages Iran and Russia (which, a New York Times investigation shows, is bombing hospitals in Syria); and it gives Turkey’s increasingly authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a chance to strengthen his hand domestically. Also: It may increase the possibility of a conflict between Iran and Israel.
Evangelical Christian leaders, who normally are big Trump backers, also are upset. Pat Robertson declared that Trump risks “losing the mandate of heaven” by abandoning the Kurds. Wow.
(For an explanation of the long-running conflict between the Turkish government and Kurdish groups, check out this Council on Foreign Relations primer.)
A lot of the criticism is accurate, and it is likely to be reflected in an overwhelming, bipartisan effort in Congress to impose sanctions on Turkey for its military action. It comes at a time of political peril for Trump. Even if the Lindsey Grahams of this world won’t criticize him over the Ukraine scandal, this will fuel their private doubts about Trump’s temperament and leadership.
Trump doesn’t appear to care. Pulling back in Syria is popular with the part of his base that loves the “America First” message, and it allows Trump to portray himself as someone willing to make tough decisions.
U.S. policy on Syria has been a muddle throughout the eight-year civil war. The United States either didn’t have much of a chance to influence events there, or didn’t care enough to try. In addition to hunting Islamic State figures, U.S. forces have been making a difference around the margins — balancing the Iranians and Russians and keeping the Turks and Kurds apart — not pushing events toward a solution. Without a solution, it’s easy to see American troops doing much the same thing in Syria for a long time to come — precisely the kind of deployment Trump wants to end. You could cast Trump’s pullback as what happens when a superpower gets tired. It reduces commitments. People get hurt. This time, it’s the Kurds.
But if America is rethinking its role, it would best move slowly and only after making sure everyone knew where Washington’s new boundaries were. That didn’t happen.
Plus, if the president truly believes that “going into the Middle East is one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country,” why, exactly, are more troops heading to the region? The Pentagon announced Friday it is sending additional forces to Saudi Arabia, bringing to 3,000 the number dispatched since an attack on Saudi oil facilities last month. Overall, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said 14,000 U.S. troops had been added to the region since May, according to Politico.
Policy toward both Syria and Saudi Arabia is in part about confronting Iran. But let’s give the cynics their due. The United States cares more about Saudi Arabia, which has a lot of oil, than Syria, which has much less. That calculation is even more true for Trump. The Saudis know how to flatter him, and — despite the objections of Congress — they’ve made him complicit in their humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen. In turn, Trump has shielded them from fallout in the death and dismemberment of dissident Jamal Khashoggi.
Everyone knows this isn’t the first time the United States encouraged the Kurds, and then stood by and watched them die. It happened at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991, as well. So why did they trust the Americans this time? Because, says Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, the Kurds have little choice: “The United States is powerful and can afford to be duplicitous, whereas the Kurds are weak and are thus forced to be credulous.”
Trump’s decision could — probably will — harm U.S. interests. On Sunday, the Kurds cut a deal with the Syrian government, which is propped up by Iran and Russia.
This may also prove to be one more example of the kind of calculation the United States often makes. And what might most distinguish it is not the withdrawal itself, but the typically shambolic way a president impressed by his own “great and unmatched wisdom” went about it.

Where’s the whistleblower? Key GOP questions about Schiff’s contact may never be answered

Texto completo: House Republicans are eager to ask the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry a variety of questions about the scope and frequency of his contact with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.
They also want to know about the California Democrat's role in orchestrating the complaint alleging President Trump sought Ukraine’s help investigating Joe Biden.
But it is appearing more likely Republicans will never have the chance to ask the whistleblower any questions at all about how closely he worked with Schiff’s team.
“At some point, both Schiff and the whistleblower came to the conclusion that his personal testimony stands to do more harm than good to both of them,” a Republican source who requested anonymity told the Washington Examiner.
Republicans planned to ask the whistleblower a long list of questions about his contact with Schiff. Among the questions is whether Schiff directed the whistleblower to file his complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, which gave Schiff’s committee official jurisdiction over the matter and provided a platform for them to launch an impeachment inquiry.
Schiff hasn’t made an announcement about the whistleblower’s appearance but it is looking increasingly likely he won’t be testifying at all, even though Democrats had once deemed his testimony crucial to their probe into Trump’s conduct during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Suddenly, the whistleblower has become irrelevant.
“Given that we already have the call record, we don't need the whistleblower who wasn't on the call to tell us what took place during the call,” Schiff told CBS News on Sunday. “We have the best evidence of that.”
Schiff has over the past two weeks gradually veered away from his effort to interview the whistleblower citing the need to protect the person’s safety and anonymity.
But just weeks earlier, House Intelligence Committee Democrats were adamant about interviewing the whistleblower, even though he did not have first hand knowledge of the July 25 call.
Democrats demanded acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire promise to allow the testimony before House lawmakers conducting the impeachment probe.
“I was very pleased that the Director gave his personal assurance that that whistleblower would not only be protected, but when that whistleblower comes before our committee, and all that is remaining is to get the security clearances for his or her counsel, that when that whistleblower comes before our committee, there won't be any Department of Justice minder, no White House minder — no one to sit next to that whistleblower and try to circumscribe, redact anything that whistleblower has to say as it pertains to misconduct by the president or anyone around him,” Schiff told CNN last month.
Schiff became less enthusiastic about hearing from the whistleblower following his admission on Oct. 2, provided by his press team directly to the New York Times, that his top staff on the intelligence panel had, in fact, been in contact with the whistleblower prior to the whistleblower filing a formal complaint about the call with the intelligence community inspector general.
Schiff’s admission contrasted his earlier claim that the panel had no communication at all with the whistleblower.
And it drew sharp criticism from Republicans who cited it as evidence Schiff has been dishonest about his role in orchestrating the whistleblower complaint and subsequent leaks to the media.
“So the whistleblower was communicating with team Adam Schiff behind the scenes?” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee member Mark Meadows, a Republican from North Carolina, said. “Well. This explains a lot, indeed.”
Schiff has insisted he had no personal contact with the whistleblower and that only his staff handled the communication with the whistleblower, who approached the panel days before lodging the official complaint.
“As Chairman Schiff has made clear, he does not know the identity of the whistleblower, has had no communication with them or their attorney, and did not view the whistleblower’s complaint until the day prior to the hearing with the director of national intelligence, when the office of the director of national intelligence finally provided it to the committee,” Schiff spokesman Patrick Boland told the Washington Examiner.
Republicans believe the whistleblower’s contact with Schiff’s team was more significant than he has disclosed and say the GOP lawmakers on the panel would have compelled the whistleblower to testify about that contact.
“Republicans are convinced that the contacts between Schiff, his staff, and the whistleblower were much more extensive than reported,” the GOP source said.“If we get a second round of media stories about Schiff being deceptive again, that would be really damaging to Schiff,” the GOP source said. “He doesn’t want to have to answer those questions.”
Schiff has for weeks been building the case that the whistleblower believes his anonymity and safety would be threatened if he appears before the committee.
Democrats cite Trump’s comments calling the whistleblower’s account of the call “a fraud” and the whistleblower’s lawyers wrote to Congress and called Trump’s comments about the whistleblower “dangerous for our client and any other whistleblowers.”
Schiff, speaking to CBS News Sunday, said his priority is making sure “the whistleblower is protected,” now that other whistleblowers are surfacing and that the original whistleblower’s testimony “may not be necessary.”
For Republicans, it will end any chance of finding out what guidance, if any, Schiff offered the whistleblower, when and how the whistleblower first contacted Schiff’s staff, whether the staff consulted with Schiff before advising the whistleblower, and what advice Schiff may have provided and whether they leaked any of the information to the media.
“Schiff has never given a full account of it, so about the only way we could get that information is to question the whistleblower directly,” the GOP source told the Washington Examiner. “Now, conveniently, Schiff is closing off that possibility.”

Purple &amp; Bold: China, the NBA and the limits of basketball diplomacy

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the Monday, Oct. 14 edition of the Purple & Bold Lakers newsletter. To receive breaking Lakers news and the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.
The NBA has a program called Basketball Without Borders, a community service initiative that has run camps in 27 different countries over the last two decades. The dream goes something like this: Through the game of basketball, diverse cultures can find some common ground.
But the world as we know it has borders — not just geopolitical lines on a map, but borders of ideology and values. And never have the limits of NBA diplomacy become more apparent than last week.
The Lakers and Nets unwittingly put themselves in the midst of an international incident this week because of a tweet. It’s a weird situation, especially given that the Chinese response has felt particularly outsized, but it’s highlighted what the limitations are for a game to be a unifying force in a world with endlessly complex divisions.
The NBA became so aware of the thorny nature of the politics of the situation that they shut down media availability for the entire trip. The Athletic reported that players, most prominently LeBron James, were wary of the onus for the NBA’s response to China’s actions being put on them, and asked to not be made available for questions. Rather than putting players in position to say something harmful either abroad or at home (like James Harden awkwardly apologizing to China for his general manager’s tweet), the NBA and the player’s association wanted avoid commentary “in real time,” at least until everyone was safely home.
It should be noted here that China is a country that tightly controls and restricts visas: Journalists, for example, require multiple references to just get in. Multiple times, the government kept the NBA in the dark as to whether they would even be allowed to participate in their events. A situation where the Chinese government harassed or detained a player for something they said while visiting abroad could have felt like a very real threat to the traveling contingent. If that’s the case, Adam Silver probably made a wise choice to keep them out of the line of fire.
But now that everyone is safely home, where does it go from here? The NBA would probably prefer this situation quietly goes away, and that they can continue their lucrative contracts in a country where basketball has been increasingly popular. The New York Times reported last week that the Chinese government was toning down rhetoric against the NBA — which make sense because the incident has drawn attention to their authoritarian handling of the Hong Kong protests. It’s bad diplomacy to cut off a league that’s well-liked in the country, disappointing fans locally and making observers abroad question whether they should do business there.
But it seems difficult to imagine this will go away soon. Next year, the NBA will be pressed to continue exhibition games in China: Which teams are going to want to go? Which teams are going to want their players subjected to questions about what it’s like to be the first teams to play since the international incident that briefly flared up tensions between the NBA and China? What do they think of how China handles Hong Kong (because in a year, a lack of knowledge on the situation will be a less convincing case)?
In absence of the voices of players and other NBA personnel who actually went to China, Steve Kerr’s voice stood out among people stateside who spoke on the issue. Well, “spoke” might be a strong word, but Kerr offered that it’s easier for NBA players and coaches to speak on social issues that are close to home. That’s understandable, and it does seem like an unfair burden to expect the NBA to set the example for all US-Chinese relations in all cases.
But it’s also true that the NBA’s reputation as a league that’s outspoken and unafraid to speak the truth on important issues is taking some hits.
As Kerr put it: “Using the game as a force for the greater good. I think those things are important, those values are important. Obviously, there are tremendous financial forces at play here — so how you reconcile all that, I don’t know.”
No one else in the NBA appears to know either.
In the interest of examining the issue, I’m dropping a lot of related reading down in the links.
BUT WHY TONIGHT?
If you’re surprised to see a Lakers-Warriors home game less than 72 hours after the Lakers last played in China, it’s hard to imagine that the Lakers are thrilled about it either.
It’s unclear if players will miss the game due to fatigue. It’s easy to imagine LeBron James, for example, sitting this one out, especially if Anthony Davis is unable to play following his MRI on his sprained thumb. Preseason games, it should be noted, are firmly under control of teams. But it’s also true that any team going to China is hard-pressed to squeeze six preseason games into its schedule.
Frank Vogel said earlier this month that he would be judicious when it came to divvying up time for the long preseason schedule: “I think they made a wise decision a couple years back to reduce it from 8 preseason games to six. Potentially could go even further down to four. I think each coach has an obligation to their team to make sure they’re being smart with their vets. Make sure they’re getting enough reps to learn their new teammates and the system. Get sharp, ready to play, but not overdo it.”

Texto completo: The terrains of acceptability and respectability have shifted under the American conservative.
That which was once forbidden is now embraced. That which they once condemned, they cheer. Conservatism has been unveiled in all its craven glory. No longer is it shrouded behind morality, small government, traditional values and spending concerns.
President Donald Trump is the new doctrine, and Republicans bought it. There is no amount of cruelty or crudeness he can display that Republicans won’t cheer and defend. His corruption has become theirs.
And, it is possible that Trump is growing bolder in his coarseness, and it is revealed that there is precious little that will shake loose his base and its blind devotion to him.
Last week, Trump went on more profanity-laced tirades. At a campaign rally in Minnesota, Trump said of Joe Biden: “He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama’s ass.”
Let’s ignore for the moment that one could not find a more obsequious vice president than Mike Pence, a man who looks at Trump like he’s made of rainbows and cotton candy.
Let’s instead focus on the coding of the charge against Biden, whether Trump is conscious of it or not, whether it was intentional or not.
The insult invokes a fear and disdain that white racists have had throughout American history: The subjugation of the white man to the black one.
Indeed, Jim Crow was born out of a fear of “Negro domination” in which white Southerners were deadly afraid that they could be forced to live under black rule in the wake of the Civil War.
This was a real possibility. In the 1870 census, the first after the enslaved were emancipated, several Southern states were majority black and several others were within striking distance of that marker.
And many Southerners despised Northern liberals for seeming to encourage the ascendance of black people in the South.
So, Southern states, beginning with Mississippi, called constitutional conventions to write white supremacy into the DNA of those states.
The subjugation of Biden, the Northern white liberal, to the black man is not only a symbol but an omen. The white supremacists see this as a particular kind of racial betrayal and racial subjugation that can never be made normal.
To them, these white men and women who would happily play second fiddle to a black man — or white feminist, or someone who is Hispanic or Arab, or someone who is LGBTQ — is engaged in surrender of the white racist patriarchy. It is a sign of weakened, misplaced affections, and a lust of annihilation. These white liberals to them are N-word lovers.
That is why Obama stays on the tip of Trump’s tongue. The invocation of him is a hot-wire shorthand that gives an emotional charge to his statements that his audience receives intuitively. The racism is coded, received, without the burden of delivery.
The disdain for and distrust of Obama is still strong and abiding.
Conservatives scoured every facet of his life looking for a scandal and found none. They picked at every imaginary faux pas — wearing a tan suit, putting his feet on the desk, putting mustard on his burger — and yet they not only defend Trump’s truly vulgar behaviors, they cheer them.
Sarah Palin made a whole campaign out of saying that Obama “pals around with terrorists,” while Trump quite literally cozies up to murderous dictators and brags about the love letters he exchanges with one.
Republicans see nothing wrong here. Trump is a rich white man defending white supremacy and white nationalism. For him, the rules are different. For him, certain dispensations must be given.
According to Politico:
“One of Donald Trump’s most prominent Christian supporters will argue in a book due out before the 2020 general election that American evangelicals ‘have a moral obligation to enthusiastically back’ the president.”
How can that be?
Pat Robertson, upset last week over Trump’s unconscionable abandoning of the Kurds in northern Syria, said: “The president of the United States is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen.”
As if he had a mandate from heaven.
The way that the Religious Right has bent and distorted biblical doctrine to support this vulgar man is absolutely obscene. It makes a mockery of their faith and their supposed philosophies.
The moment that Trump insisted on separating immigrant children from their families, locking those children in cages and arguing in court against having to provide soap and toothbrushes to those children, or against turning off the lights so that they could sleep, should have been the red line to any true Christian — or for any human being with a shred of compassion, regardless of faith. But it wasn’t. So, now I no longer know what to call these people.
Righteousness simply can’t be this transactional and situational. What is the point of your books of rules if you will gladly oblige a man who flaunts them? Either morality has meaning or it doesn’t.

Texto completo: For Notre Dame fans, this football weekend was a twofer. Not only did the Irish beat a longtime rival, the University of Southern California, on Saturday, the campus was treated to a sight it had never before seen: the attorney general of the United States, at a pregame tailgater, serenading faculty, students and fans with his bagpipes.
Turns out that was William Barr's second performance on campus. The first came at the law school Friday, when he delivered a bracing speech on the role of religion in the American story of freedom.
The attorney general advanced two broad propositions. First, the waning of religion's influence in American life has left more of her citizens vulnerable to what Tocqueville called the "soft despotism" of government dependency. Second, today's secularists are decidedly not of the live-and-let-live variety.
"The secular project has itself become a religion, pursued with religious fervor," he said. "It is taking on all the trappings of religion, including inquisitions and excommunication. Those who defy the creed risk a figurative burning at the stake—social, educational and professional ostracism and exclusion waged through lawsuits and savage social media campaigns."
Right out of central casting, critics stepped forward to prove his point. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman accused Mr. Barr of "religious bigotry" and described his words as a "pogrom type speech."
Political ethicist and professional attention seeker Richard Painter tapped out a series of even more furious tweets, here calling the speech the latest episode of "The Handmaid's Tale," there suggesting Mr. Barr isn't much of a Christian, here again saying Mr. Barr sounded like "vintage Goebbels." Over at MSNBC, meanwhile, retired Army Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, once chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, told Joy Reid the attorney general is "Torquemada in a business suit," a reference to the Spanish Inquisition's grand inquisitor.
This is what we have come to expect when someone in public life mentions religion in a positive light. Many didn't like Mr. Barr's blaming secularism for social pathologies such as drug addiction, family breakdown and increasing numbers of angry and alienated young males. Yet few engaged his more arresting contention, which is that all these problems have spiritual roots. Whereas religion addresses such challenges by stressing personal responsibility, Mr. Barr argued, the state's answer is merely to try to alleviate "bad consequences."
"So the reaction to growing illegitimacy is not sexual responsibility, but abortion," he said. "The reaction to drug addiction is safe injection sites. The solution to the breakdown of the family is for the state to set itself up as an ersatz husband for the single mother and an ersatz father for the children. The call comes for more and more social programs to deal with this wreckage—and while we think we're solving problems, we are underwriting them."
Vincent Phillip Muñoz, a Notre Dame professor, notes there was nothing particularly Catholic about this speech. Like Washington in his Farewell Address, he says, Mr. Barr focused on the irreplaceable role of religion in cultivating the morality citizens need to be capable of self-government.
"The speech wasn't first and foremost about religious freedom," says Mr. Muñoz. "It was about the human and social consequences of the new secular morality, and what happens when the state views its citizens not only in purely material terms, but as subjects who can't really govern themselves."
Even those who strongly disagree with Mr. Barr ought to have found this an invitation for thoughtful and vigorous debate. But rather than engage, some imply there is something unseemly about an attorney general's even speaking at a Catholic university. Given the hostility that holding such a conversation engenders on campuses today, perhaps America can count itself fortunate it still has a university where this can happen.
Carter Snead, the law professor who invited Mr. Barr, puts it this way: "At Notre Dame, we are not afraid to explore the hard questions about God, religion and America together in friendship, especially on those matters about which people strongly disagree."
Mr. Barr's argument has been echoed throughout American history: "Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people" (John Adams). "Liberty cannot be established without morality, nor morality without faith" (Tocqueville). "In teaching this democratic faith to American children, we need the sustaining, buttressing aid of those great ethical religious teachings which are the heritage of our modern civilization. For 'not upon strength nor upon power, but upon the spirit of God' shall our democracy be founded" (FDR). And so on.
That so many would become unhinged by Mr. Barr's relatively modest contribution to the genre is highly revealing of the absolutism of secularist opponents determined to marginalize and destroy anyone who dares dissent from their own uncompromising orthodoxy.

'Berners for Yang:' Why Some Young Voters Back a New Democratic Outsider; Andrew Yang's presence in the race could pose a hurdle for Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: LAS VEGAS—A Democratic presidential candidate—running against the establishment and raising millions for his campaign online—drew hundreds of young voters to a union hall here, pitching a radical idea to remake the U.S. economy.
The candidate wasn't Bernie Sanders, but Andrew Yang could benefit from the comparison.
Mr. Yang, a tech entrepreneur, is the new antiestablishment candidate, according to his backers, known as the "Yang Gang," many of whom supported Mr. Sanders in 2016. They are attracted to the idea at the core of his campaign: giving all Americans a payment of $1,000 a month. Mr. Yang says this "freedom dividend" would offset the loss of jobs from automation, which he says is the most urgent crisis Americans are facing.
Mr. Yang, who started as a virtual unknown, raised $10 million in the last quarter. He is now polling in sixth place at an average of 3%—ahead of a dozen other candidates, including current and former elected officials, but well behind Mr. Sanders. His slogan, "Make America Think Harder," shortened to "MATH," is stamped on merchandise and was chanted repeatedly before he walked onstage here.
In an interview in his New York City campaign office, Mr. Yang said there were "a lot of similarities" between him and Mr. Sanders, whom he supported during the 2016 election.

* Andrew Yang Raises $10 Million (Oct. 2)
"We draw in and energize people that haven't been attracted to politics historically," said Mr. Yang. "Bernie and I see some of the same problems and had many of the same goals. But I think, you know, I just have a different set of solutions that speak more to and empower the individual."
Mr. Sanders is in third place nationally, and the Vermont senator appears to have outraised everyone in the field this quarter, with $25.3 million.
Still, both candidates draw the overwhelming share of their support from voters under age 50, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll from September. Interviews found they both appeal to independents and others who don't typically vote in Democratic primaries. Mr. Yang's continued presence in the race could pose a hurdle for Mr. Sanders to catch up to former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the two front-runners who are distancing themselves from the pack.
Some of Mr. Yang's supporters told The Wall Street Journal that they once backed Mr. Sanders, an independent, but believe his growing influence within the Democratic Party has cost him his outsider status. They also worry that Mr. Sanders's promises to give free health care and college to everyone won't do enough to counter job losses, as companies invest in automation.
"I'm a Berner for Yang," said Valessa Mantona, 30, a retail worker from Henderson. Ms. Mantona said she supported Mr. Sanders during the 2016 primary but feels the relevant issues have changed since the last election.
Bennett Lovaas, a 25-year-old administrative assistant from Henderson, donated to Mr. Sanders's campaign in 2016, but he's mostly settled on supporting Mr. Yang this time. "I think Yang's positions on certain things differ from Bernie's and tend to focus more on fixing the issues instead of almost putting a Band-Aid," Mr. Lovaas said.
Mr. Yang, 44, has described himself to supporters as a version of Mr. Sanders who is "a little bit younger and more Asian and into technology." He showed up to his interview with The Wall Street Journal via bicycle, which includes a small child seat on the back. His campaign manager said the seat, typically used for one of Mr. Yang's two children, doubles as a luggage rack.
"Bernie's solutions tend to be more trying to address the imbalances within institutions without actually just putting the resources in our hands," Mr. Yang said. "Spiritually, our goals are quite aligned."
The Sanders campaign declined to comment.
Mr. Yang has said he doesn't support the "wealth tax" Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have proposed, calling it "somewhere between problematic and a disaster in practice." Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, has said he supports a federal jobs guarantee instead of a universal basic income such as Mr. Yang's proposed freedom dividend.
Unlike Mr. Sanders, Mr. Yang is raising money in part through traditional fundraisers. Marc Michel, a New York City-based venture capitalist who is co-hosting a fundraiser for him this month, said he is supporting the entrepreneur, whom he's known for years, because he's making the idea of universal basic income more mainstream. "I'm not expecting it to get adopted in this election cycle, but this is a start of a conversation about it," he said. "Could it happen in two or three election cycles? It's very possible."
Mr. Michel also pointed to a key difference between Mr. Yang and Mr. Sanders.
"We don't hear Andrew bash a billionaire," he said, "or a free-market economy or an innovation economy."
Unlike some elected officials in the Democratic race, Yang has qualified for every Democratic debate and will appear at the CNN/New York Times forum in Ohio Tuesday. But Mr. Yang has substantial ground to make up: In addition to Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris are also outpacing him in fundraising and polling.
In interviews with nearly two dozen undecided Democrats in Iowa recently, only one brought up Mr. Yang as one of the candidates on their shortlist. "I work in IT, so I understand what he's talking about on automation," said Wayne Rohret, 49, an IT consultant who lives in Ames, Iowa.
Mr. Rohret was skeptical about Mr. Yang's chances of winning the nomination but added: "I expect him to hang in there for a fair bit."
Another undecided Democrat, Tony Montgomery, 45, of Urbandale, Iowa, didn't consider Mr. Yang among his top choices because of concerns about electability but said he was intrigued.
"He needs to marinate more," Mr. Montgomery said.
Mr. Yang embraces his current position in the polls, going from an unknown to the low-single digits.
"The path is mainly about exceeding expectations," he said.
In Las Vegas, Mr. Yang's speech was peppered with curse words and jokes, and he spoke very little about traditional Democratic priorities—health care, climate change, gun control—instead focusing on his "freedom dividend" pitch.
After the rally, his campaign manager tweeted a video of Mr. Yang skateboarding, weaving around the young supporters who were still hanging around the mostly empty venue.

Texto completo: To learn something that will stick with you for life, it's best to start when you're young.That philosophy drives Gwinnett County Public Schools' Dual Language Immersion Program.
For about a decade, the district has offered an opportunity for students to spend half their school day learning in another language. Six years ago, Trip Elementary began a French Dual Language Immersion Program. Enrollment is voluntary, starting with incoming kindergartners who are guaranteed a spot every year afterward. They are allowed to drop out if the program isn't a good fit, but "I haven't lost a single student," said Principal Rukina Walker.
The first group will move on to middle school at the end of this school year, having pioneered a path for those who come behind them.
The French curriculum must be translated from English, so students in the program are receiving the same lessons as students in traditional classes.
Binta Bin-Wahad, a native of the West African nation of Guinea who grew up speaking French, teaches it in the third-grade DLI class at Trip.
"It may seem like extra work to translate all the lessons, but it's second nature to me," she said.
Katie Basile, the English language teacher in the same class, said there was a little bit of adjustment.
"I trained in France and met with teachers and shared an experience that's so different," she said.
The students start with the new language in kindergarten on the first day.
"It takes them a little while to get used to it, but by the third or fourth week, they've mastered simple words and phrases and are beginning to feel comfortable with the language," said Bin-Wahad.
Her third-graders say they often think in French since math and social studies are the lessons they are taught in French.
"I sometimes have to stop and think about the English word for something in math," said Bella Glasco. Her classmates nodded in agreement. But they all concur that they wouldn't trade the experience for anything.
Maddox Cannon and his family traveled to France over the summer, and he was the only member of the family who spoke the language.
"It was pretty cool that I ordered food for everyone and got directions and stuff like that," he said, smiling. He said the program has gotten him interested in a career in architecture or engineering on an international level.
Similarly, Chinoo Nwosu has aspirations of becoming a translator.
"I already help my mom learn French, so I already have some experience," she said.
Madison Cain also has dreams of putting her French tutelage to work.
Earlier this month, the third-, fourth-and fifth-graders at Trip had a special visit from Rémi Courgeon, a French author and illustrator.Sponsored by the French Embassy, he read from his book "Feather" and talked to the students about French culture.
The experience solidified Madison's determination to be an author herself. "I want to write in English and French," she said.
And although Courgeon's book is also available in English, his presentation was all in French.
The book, a winner of New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Books award, tells the story of musical girl who is also tenacious, tough and a fighter. It teaches children about taking charge and realizing their dreams. As he quizzed the kids about how their lives were the same or different from the protagonist's, nods and choruses of "Oui" filled the air. After the story was done, he put them through their paces asking questions that required more detailed responses.
Principal Walker said she's been bowled over by the success of the program.
"The program started my first year as principal here," she said. "I don't speak French, but we've become a French school even for the children that aren't in the program."
There are French words of the day and French words and phrases affixed to walls, and part of the morning announcements are read in French.
"We don't want it to seem like the program is elite," she said. "We include everyone in the learning on some level."
The school has already been in communication with nearby Bay Creek Middle School about the next phase of the program.
"It won't be an immersion program from that point on," said Virin Vedder, DLI coordinator. "We had to write three new courses because these students are more advanced than entry-level French students."
In high school those same kids can take Advanced Placement French and hopefully add foreign language mastery to their diploma.
"We started this program out slow and steady, and we're seeing fantastic results," said Vedder.
Walker agreed.
"There's power in the people, and we've got awesome teachers and world-class support. The students have nowhere to go but up."

MORE DETAILS
According to the Statistical Atlas of the United States,
39,600people in Georgia are native French speakers.
This makes up about 0.4% of the state's population.
Of those, about 80%say they speak English "very well."

Texto completo: Underneath one of the many Shake Shack restaurants in New York City lives the breakaway restaurant chain's Innovation Kitchen. The full-time team isn't filling the orders of hungry guests, but rather is inventing what diners may enjoy for years into the future.
The underground lab focuses all its resources on inventing what's next rather than delivering on today's business needs.
Test kitchens are common among food giants and restaurant chains around the world. They consist of a dedicated team focused on the future. Rather than extracting every ounce of efficiency, they often invest heavily to try completely different concepts, knowing that most will fail. The space is equipped with all the latest gear, ingredients, and supplies in order to foster fresh thinking and drive creativity. It's a place where inventive thinking and imagination are cherished instead of extracted to maximize near-term profits.
While the investment is tiny in proportion to a food company's overall cost structure, these innovation labs play a gigantic role in the organization's ability to drive sustainable success.
Test kitchens provide a steady stream of innovation, allowing team members to dream up tomorrow's solutions without being encumbered by today's imperatives. Without a test kitchen, a food company may be able to deliver on expectations for a while but would suffer greatly over time as inventive competitors leave the laggards behind in their creative wake.
If test kitchens are so vital to sustainable success in the restaurant business, why don't we all embrace the same concept in our own industries?
Your test kitchen could be a small brainstorming room, equipped with art supplies and funky seating to enable your team's creativity. Or it could be a small workshop for tinkering and exploration. In fact, your innovation lab could focus on innovations far beyond products and services; what about a test kitchen for improved processes, driving customer engagement or boosting safety? Your test kitchen can be small, scrappy and resource-constrained while still delivering a big punch of fresh ideas for growth.
Hospitals around the world have installed their own test kitchen concept called Maker Nurse – a dedicated space where front-line health care professionals can safely tinker, explore and improve patient outcomes. Nike has a test kitchen in downtown Chicago called the Nike Lab Recreation Center that invites people from all walks of life to help the shoe company discover new ideas.
Even if you can't dedicate full-time space, at least invest some time and effort to pull the team away from today's deliverables in order to invent tomorrow's solutions. Your test kitchen – whether physical or metaphorical – can yield gigantic leaps forward in growth, efficiency, service and customer success.
Experiment. Tinker. Investigate. Test. Play. Give your team members a chance to let their hair down and explore the limits of their imagination, and you'll invent a delicious path forward.

Texto completo: The Georgia Department of Public Health has announced the state's second death from a vaping-linked illness.
No details on the latest death were provided early Wednesday, as the number of people hospitalized continues to climb. The first person who died in Georgia, announced two weeks ago, was an unidentified man over the age of 35.
The agency did not say where he lived, only that he did not live in metro Atlanta. He had a history of heavy nicotine vaping but no history of vaping THC, which has been linked to a majority of the mysterious vaping-related lung diseases afflicting e-cigarette users.
STATE
Georgia to host November Democratic presidential debate
Georgia will host the Democratic presidential debate on Nov. 20, another indication that the state is a top political battleground in next year's election.
Democratic Party of Georgia chairwoman Nikema Williams told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Tuesday she was not clear where the debate will be held, but that it would likely be in metro Atlanta. "All roads to the White House run through Georgia," she said.
State Democratic officials have aggressively lobbied the Democratic National Convention to hold the debate in Georgia, particularly given the double-header U.S. Senate races and competitive U.S. House contests.
ATLANTA
Rec authority, Bottoms adviser rebuke zoo for costly expansion
Simmering tensions between Zoo Atlanta and a government oversight board boiled over this week when a key adviser to Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms criticized the ballooning cost of a major zoo expansion and blasted no-bid contracts and a failure by the zoo to meet requirements to hire minority-owned vendors.
Officials with the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority also took aim at the pay of zoo President and CEO Raymond King, whose total compensation more than doubled from 2013 to 2017 to nearly $630,000, putting him among the highest-paid zoo leaders in the nation.
"It's a bigger picture than these loans, it's the overall governance over there and making sure the money, the public money, is being spent the way we're being told it's supposed to be spent," said Alvin Kendall, a consultant to the authority board and adviser to Bottoms.
GWINNETT
Long-struggling Gwinnett Place Mall will soon be up for sale
For a few years now, local business leaders have urged the owners of Gwinnett Place Mall to sell off, move out and give someone else the chance to redevelop the long-struggling shopping center.
It appears they'll soon get their wish. Moonbeam Capital Partners is poised to sell their portion of Gwinnett Place, which is now so empty that it recently attracted Netflix's "Stranger Things" to shoot there -- and, in a more macabre incident, allowed the decomposing body of a murder victim to go unnoticed for weeks.
ATLANTA
Atlanta's rainbow crosswalks are here to stay, mayor says
The federal government has not asked the city of Atlanta to remove the rainbow crosswalks at 10th Street and Piedmont Avenue, but even if it did, the city wouldn't comply, said a spokesman for Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.
In recent years, the Federal Highway Administration, citing safety concerns, has asked cities across the country to remove the rainbow crosswalks -- a prominent municipal symbol of gay pride. The latest, according to the New York Times, is Ames, Iowa.
The news, coupled with the preparations for the 49th Annual Pride Celebration in Piedmont Park this weekend, caused Bottoms's press office to be inundated with questions about whether the city's own rainbow crosswalks were in the federal government's crosshairs.

Melissa Murphy, Gwinnett Online Campus teacher, teaches her students Sept. 25 during Blended Learning Elementary class at Gwinnett Online Campus in Lawrenceville. In a blended classroom, both face-to-face and online instruction take place each day using full digital content developed by teachers.

Along with focusing on reading, writing and arithmetic, more educators in the past few decades have striven to get students to take an active role in their learning. Instead of passively taking in the information such as in lectures or by rote memorization, they want students to engage with the lessons and ultimately perform better. Many think this can only occur face-to-face but education research says online courses can also be effective.
In its 10th year, Gwinnett Online Campus has proved that. With 7,900 courses offered, the program works with schools across the district. It offers choices for students from fourth grade through high school as full-time online learners who work from home, or students who take up to five online classes as part of their regular school day through supplemental programs."The days of teaching just one way are over," said Principal Christopher Ray. "Our method allows teachers to see in real time what students need. If someone if falling behind, there's an opportunity to pull them out for extra instruction right away. Or if a student is excelling, they can work ahead without it affecting the flow of the class."

Texto completo: The current fad of large companies and universities cravenly apologizing for their participation in slavery, no matter how slight the involvement, has become pervasive. Slavery was terrible, and it has thankfully been gone for 154 years, but certain black leaders simply cannot pass up the opportunity to monetize for themselves this ancient history. Certainly, the effects of slavery lasted for many years after the Civil War, but as long as so many black Americans wallow in victimhood, they will not be able to take their rightful place in our economy. It is sad that to gain and maintain political power, most black leaders continue to use the victimhood race card. Black Americans deserve better leaders, but that, sadly, is who they routinely elect.

'Unprotected'series spotlights care issues
Regarding "Suffering Behind the Facade" (News, Sept. 29), as a geriatric social worker in the field for 35 years, I am neither surprised nor shocked at what you are uncovering. My experience in training care staff is that most choose to do the work they do not for the money, but because they hope to provide compassionate care. Yet they are placed in jobs that require them to be superhuman. How can any caring human being be expected to care for 10 to 15 residents when these elders have dementia, need help with most activities of daily living and often resist the care they need? Not only are elders not receiving the best possible care and being placed in harm's way, but care staff cannot provide the best possible care and are also often placed in harm's way. Perhaps your series will wake some people up!

Dem hopefuls should spotlight Trump's flaws
Democratic candidates should always refer to "draft-dodging Trump," acting like a 600-pound man sleeping in the basement of his mom's house, eating fried chicken and tweeting. They should point out that a real "stable genius" would read books, respect different opin-ions and know a free press is part of what makes our government system great and that Fox News is not "fair and balanced." They also should point out that a brilliant, New York-elite billionaire would love to release his taxes to show his ability to make money (maybe Trump is not a billionaire?). "Draft-dodging Trump," please act presidential and realize you are president of all the people, Democrats and Republicans. "Draft-dodging Trump," don't give silly names to those who criticize you, as that is kindergarten stuff.

AJC's anti-Trump bias shows on Opinion page
It is atrocious that the AJC is inserting anti-Trump bias into its opinion page. Balanced reporting is reporting points of view from both political ideologies. Your Opinion page of Sunday, Oct. 6, presented two columns -- one from Gail Collins of the New York Times representing the left, and one from Mona Charen of Creators Syndicate purporting to represent the right. The problem here is Ms. Charen is clearly an anti-Trumper. The AJC did not fairly represent opposing points of view and joins the ranks of unethical media in sneaking in anti-Trump ideology in the guise of an opinion "From the Right." Its Editorial Board should be ashamed of itself.

ON THE RECORD: Views on when it's right to impeach

Texto completo: From a guest column on AJC.com by Jack Bernard, a Republican and former chairman of the Jasper County Commission:
Impeachment is the role of the House of Representatives. Removal of an impeached President (after a trial and vote) is the role of the Senate.
The Constitution did not envision our two-party system where the impeachment/removal process would be primarily controlled by party loyalty, extreme partisanship and politics. Thus, putting nation over other factors like party (as the Constitution envisioned) has not always been the case. For example, Clinton lied about a sexual affair having nothing to do with the daily functions of government. Clinton was then impeached by the GOP-controlled House (led by an obviously partisan Newt Gingrich) for lying to Congress, but the Democratic Senate subsequently refused to remove him from office.
On the other hand, true statesmen did (at other times) put the interests of our country before political gain. Famously, Sen. Barry Goldwater, the father of the modern conservative movement, went to Richard Nixon and indicated to him that the GOP Senate would support his removal if he did not resign.
From a New York Times column by Bret Stephens:
I came of age as a conservative in an era when Republicans were keen on matters of private virtue and public probity. Then Bill Clinton became president, and his behavior exemplified neither. In 1998 he was impeached by a partisan GOP House. But he survived the drama -- and could have easily been reelected to a third term absent the 22nd Amendment -- for three reasons. His opponents overreached. The country was doing fine. And his supporters could be remarkably creative or brazen (when they weren't simply mute) in excusing behavior they would never have tolerated from a Republican.
It's hard not to think of that episode now that the shoe is on the other foot. As with liberals and Clinton, so with conservatives and Trump: Their ethics have turned out to be purely situational. As a matter of immediate partisan interest, this is also likely to help the president.
But it won't help the country, or the long-term interests of the party, much as the Democrats' defense of Clinton didn't help them.

12 Hours. 4 Syrian Hospitals Bombed.

Texto completo: The Russian Air Force has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Syria in order to crush the last pockets of resistance to President Bashar al-Assad, according to an investigation by The New York Times.
An analysis of previously unpublished Russian Air Force radio recordings, plane spotter logs and witness accounts allowed The Times to trace bombings of four hospitals in just 12 hours in May and tie Russian pilots to each one.
The 12-hour period beginning on May 5 represents a small slice of the air war in Syria, but it is a microcosm of Russia's four-year military intervention in Syria's civil war. A new front in the conflict opened this week, when Turkish forces crossed the border as part of a campaign against a Kurdish-led militia.
Russia has long been accused of carrying out systematic attacks against hospitals and clinics in rebel-held areas as part of a strategy to help Mr. Assad secure victory in the eight-year-old war.
Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group that tracks attacks on medical workers in Syria, has documented at least 583 such attacks since 2011, 266 of them since Russia intervened in September 2015. At least 916 medical workers have been killed since 2011.
The Times assembled a large body of evidence to analyze the hospital bombings on May 5 and 6.
Social media posts from Syria, interviews with witnesses, and records from charities that supported the four hospitals provided the approximate time of each strike. The Times obtained logs kept by flight spotters on the ground who warn civilians about incoming airstrikes and crosschecked the time of each strike to confirm that Russian warplanes were overhead. We then listened to and deciphered thousands of Russian Air Force radio transmissions, which recorded months' worth of pilot activities in the skies above northwestern Syria. The recordings were provided to The Times by a network of observers who insisted on anonymity for their safety.
The spotter logs from May 5 and 6 put Russian pilots above each hospital at the time they were struck, and the Air Force audio recordings from that day feature Russian pilots confirming each bombing. Videos obtained from witnesses and verified by The Times confirmed three of the strikes.
Recklessly or intentionally bombing hospitals is a war crime, but proving culpability amid a complex civil war is extremely difficult, and until now, Syrian medical workers and human rights groups lacked proof.
Russia's position as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council has shielded it from scrutiny and made United Nations agencies reluctant to accuse the Russian Air Force of responsibility.
"The attacks on health in Syria, as well as the indiscriminate bombing of civilian facilities, are definitely war crimes, and they should be prosecuted at the level of the International Criminal Court in The Hague," said Susannah Sirkin, director of policy at Physicians for Human Rights. But Russia and China "shamefully" vetoed a Security Council resolution that would have referred those and other crimes in Syria to the court, she said.
The Russian government did not directly respond to questions about the four hospital bombings. Instead, a Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed to past statements saying that the Russian Air Force carries out precision strikes only on "accurately researched targets."
The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, opened an investigation into the hospital bombings in August. The investigation, still going on, is meant in part to determine why hospitals that voluntarily added their locations to a United Nations-sponsored deconfliction list, which was provided to Russia and other combatants to prevent them from being attacked, nevertheless came under attack.
Syrian health care workers said they believed that the United Nations list actually became a target menu for the Russian and Syrian air forces.
Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for the secretary general, said in September that the investigation -- an internal board of inquiry -- would not produce a public report or identify "legal responsibility." Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian permanent representative to the United Nations, cast doubt on the process shortly after it was announced, saying he hoped the inquiry would not investigate perpetrators but rather what he said was the United Nations' use of false information in its deconfliction process.
From April 29 to mid-September, as Russian and Syrian government forces assaulted the last rebel pocket in the northwest, 54 hospitals and clinics in opposition territory were attacked, the United Nations human rights office said. At least seven had tried to protect themselves by adding their location to the deconfliction list, according to the World Health Organization.
On May 5 and 6, Russia attacked four. All were on the list.
The first was Nabad al Hayat Surgical Hospital, a major underground trauma center in southern Idlib Province serving about 200,000 people. The hospital performed on average around 500 operations and saw more than 5,000 patients a month, according to Syria Relief and Development, the United States-based charity that supported it.
Nabad al Hayat had been attacked three times since it opened in 2013 and had recently relocated to an underground complex on agricultural land, hoping to be protected from airstrikes.
At 2:32 p.m. on May 5, a Russian ground control officer can be heard in an Air Force transmission providing a pilot with a longitude and latitude that correspond to Nabad al Hayat's exact location.
At 2:38 p.m., the pilot reports that he can see the target and has the "correction," code for locking the target on a screen in his cockpit. Ground control responds with the green light for the strike, saying, "Three sevens."
At the same moment, a flight spotter on the ground logs a Russian jet circling in the area.
At 2:40 p.m., the same time the charity said that Nabad al Hayat was struck, the pilot confirms the release of his weapons, saying, "Worked it." Seconds later, local journalists filming the hospital in anticipation of an attack record three precision bombs penetrating the roof of the hospital and blowing it out from the inside in geysers of dirt and concrete.
The staff of Nabad al Hayat had evacuated three days earlier after receiving warnings and anticipating a bombing, but Kafr Nabl Surgical Hospital, three miles northwest, was not as lucky.
A doctor who worked there said that the hospital was struck four times, beginning at 5:30 p.m. The strikes landed about five minutes apart, without warning, he said, killing a man who was standing outside and forcing patients and members of the medical staff to use oxygen tanks to breathe through the choking dust.
A spotter logged a Russian jet circling above at the time of the strike, and in another Russian Air Force transmission, a pilot reports that he has "worked" his target at 5:30 p.m., the time of the strike. He then reports three more strikes, each about five minutes apart, matching the doctor's chronology.
Russian pilots bombed two other hospitals in the same 12-hour span: Kafr Zita Cave Hospital and Al Amal Orthopedic Hospital. In both cases, spotters recorded Russian Air Force jets in the skies at the time of the strike, and Russian pilots can be heard in radio transmissions "working" their targets at the times the strikes were reported.
Since May 5, at least two dozen hospitals and clinics in the rebel-held northwest have been hit by airstrikes. Syrian medical workers said they expected hospital bombings to continue, given the inability of the United Nations and other countries to find a way to hold Russia to account.
"The argument by the Russians or the regime is always that hospitals are run by terrorists," said Nabad al Hayat's head nurse, who asked to remain anonymous because he feared being targeted. "Is it really possible that all the people are terrorists?"
"The truth is that after hospitals are hit, and in areas like this where there is just one hospital, our houses have become hospitals."

INTRO TEXT, PAGE 2.
These voters -- representative of all Americans who are registered to vote -- were invited to spend a weekend in late September at a resort outside Dallas to show that there might be a better way to disagree. And, as furor in Washington was just beginning to build over the possible impeachment of the president, Donald Trump's name barely came up. The New York Times took a portrait of nearly every participant. Collectively, their faces are a reflection of all American voters.
---
--ARTICLE--
GRAPEVINE, Texas -- The voters arrived from all over the country: nine of them named John, 10 who'd come from mobile homes, four who lived in South Dakota. Twenty-seven considered themselves extremely conservative; 30 said they were extremely liberal. Twenty-one were out of work and looking for it. Two came with service dogs. At least one did not tell her parents she was coming here, because talking politics is so hard at home that she didn't want to admit she was flying to Texas to talk politics with people she didn't know.
There were 526 of them, testing a theory by the Stanford political scientists James Fishkin and Larry Diamond. Put a diverse group of voters in a room, the researchers say, and they're like to mute their harshest views and wrestle more deeply with rebuttals. They become more informed, even more empathetic. And in this setting, pollsters can get a picture of what people believe when they're not just relying on sound bites and tribal cues.
Each voter here was selected from a nationwide survey of thousands of households to resemble the country's demographic diversity and political differences. "America in One Room," the event was called. In the conversations that followed, it was often hard to tell which ideological camp to place voters in.
A nonpartisan group named Helena raised about $ 3 million to bring everyone here to a hotel and convention center with cowboy-themed carpets and an indoor river walk. The research institution NORC at the University of Chicago conducted surveys of the group and worked to find the right representation of voters, calling some of them two, three, four times to coax them onto planes or away from home.
Many of the voters were sure at first that the invitation was a scam -- an all-expenses-paid trip to a Texas resort to ... give their opinions?
Over four days, mostly in small groups, they debated policy proposals in a 55-page briefing booklet that made little mention of whom the proposals came from. Partisan trigger words -- Democrats, Republicans, progressives, conservatives -- were, by design, largely missing from the text. The language voters themselves used was often personal rather than political.
"You have to learn to listen to them," Mr. Fishkin said. "They don't talk the way policy wonks talk about an issue. They bring their life experience, their observations. But they're making arguments when they tell a story."
In one room, the debate among a dozen voters about the Affordable Care Act moved from one personal testimonial to another: One man's deductible rose to $ 3,000 from $ 500 after the law took effect. Another man's family premium had gone up to $ 2,600 a month. Across the table, one woman said her father had been found to have colon cancer right after the law forced him to acquire insurance for the first time in his life. "I can tell you from personal experience, it saved one life," she said.
In a different room, a middle-aged man sure that steep tariffs on China were necessary encountered a young woman who believed the tariffs were hurting her family's South Carolina farm. In another room, voters argued about whether Americans would willingly take the jobs that many immigrants do, as a hotel worker whose employee badge identified him as from Mumbai came in to retrieve the coffee cart.
In another immigration discussion, a 53-year-old mother from Chicago wanted to share a story she'd seen on Facebook of immigrants transported to the United States inside of mattresses. She recalled seeing a mattress cut open -- the living bodies inside, the tufts of cotton covering them.
"There has to be a better way," she said. "I can see myself being transported in a mattress."
Asked if these conversations had moved them, many voters said their preferred policies had not shifted, but their views of each other had.
"I may not have changed my position," said Bonnie Sumner, 74, from Woodland Park, Colo. "But I've changed my understanding of the woman in the group who said, 'You know what, I had great health care, it worked for me, and the Affordable Care Act changed things, and I'm worse off now."'
In the final survey data, however, it appears that some minds were changed. NORC surveyed the group before the conference, and again on the same questions at the end. Voters on both the left and the right appeared to edge toward the center. Democratic support receded for a $ 15 federal minimum wage and for "Medicare for all"; Republican support grew for rejoining the Paris climate agreement and for protecting from deportation immigrants brought to the United States as children.
These answers, Mr. Fishkin said, better approximate public opinion in a society where voters are informed. And from inside this carefully constructed model of democracy in Texas, the share of participants who said they thought American democracy worked well doubled, to 60 percent.
In principle, there is something hopeful in these findings. But an essential part of what happened here will be harder to replicate than the structured discussions. During meals and at the bar at night, there were unlikely pairings of people everywhere, just talking, with no moderators.
James Mowrey, a 33-year-old microbiologist from Nebraska, walked away from dinner on the last night to say that the people around him had, in the end, changed his thinking about something. He considered himself a free-market guy. But he now believed a public option could foster more competition in the health care market.
"They explained it to me in the way I think," he said. And he seemed pleased to have changed his mind.

The case for identifying the whistleblower

Texto completo: The identity of the person who filed the intelligence community whistleblower complaint that sparked the drive to impeach President Trump remains a secret. Democrats leading the impeachment campaign say his or her identity (for brevity, the whistleblower will hereafter be referred to as "he") must remain closely guarded. Advocates of whistleblower laws, such as Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, agree.
The New York Times came under heavy criticism when it reported that the whistleblower is a CIA officer. "Any decision to report any perceived identifying information of the whistleblower is deeply concerning and reckless, as it can place the individual in harm's way," Andrew Bakaj, the whistleblower's lawyer, told the Times. "The whistleblower has a right to anonymity."
Does he? And does that right outweigh the rights of the public to know salient facts in a proceeding designed to lead to the impeachment and removal of the president?
The answer to the first question is yes, the whistleblower does have a right to anonymity. But the answer to the second question is no, that right does not outweigh other rights in an impeachment battle. Here are three reasons the whistleblower should be publicly identified:
1. The public has a right to know. There is no higher public concern than a debate that could lead to the president's removal. Simply put, everything should be public, because the public should be aware of everything that figures into the process. The whistle has not been blown on a mid-level bureaucrat using a government credit card for personal expenses. The whistleblower has accused the president of serious wrongdoing, and in doing so, has set off a proceeding of the highest public concern on Capitol Hill.
What were the circumstances of that accusation? Who gave the whistleblower the information he included in his complaint? Was that information cherry-picked? Did the whistleblower have contacts with others in the effort to bring the complaint against the president? Those are all valid questions for the public to ask and to which they deserve answers. The president is their president, not simply of a small number of privileged people at the Capitol.
Did the whistleblower act out of bias? If he did, does that matter? Explaining his reason for publishing the fact that the whistleblower is a CIA officer, the Times' executive editor Dean Baquet implied the paper wanted to defend the whistleblower against criticism. The Times reported that the whistleblower "works for a nonpolitical agency and that his complaint is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of the White House," Baquet said, "because we wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible." Baquet was right; it is important for journalists to give readers and viewers information about the president's accuser.
Finally, the president says he should have the right to confront his accuser. There is no such right written into the Constitution concerning impeachment. But in commonsense terms, Trump is correct. In a matter of such grave importance, a president should not have to face anonymously sourced charges.
2. The whistleblower set the terms of the debate. In his Aug. 12 complaint, he laid out the accusation that Democrats would later wholly adopt in the effort to remove the president. "I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election," the whistleblower wrote. "Namely, he sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the President's 2020 reelection bid."
The whistleblower included other information in his complaint, much of it alleged Trump actions involving the 2016 election, but the fact is, the whistleblower defined the controversy that would ensue as House Democrats followed his lead. There has been no more important player in shaping the case against the president. And that person is supposed to remain anonymous as the battle rages? The argument more or less refutes itself.
3. He's not Deep Throat. The most famous anonymous source in all of journalism is Deep Throat, the man who gave Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein a number of leads in the paper's Watergate reporting. Woodward and Bernstein agreed not to reveal Deep Throat's identity, an arrangement that lasted for decades until 2005, when Mark Felt, who was a top FBI official during Watergate, revealed that he was the source.
The whistleblower is not a similar case. He has gone through official channels to accuse the president, working with a team of attorneys to produce a polished legal document outlining Trump's alleged wrongdoing. Journalists have not made any agreement to keep his identity a secret.
In addition, the whistleblower does not have absolute protection under the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, which Democrats have cited to say the whistleblower's identity should remain secret. "The whistleblower has the right in the statute to remain anonymous," House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment effort, said recently.
In fact, the law says: "The Inspector General shall not disclose the identity of the employee without the consent of the employee, unless the Inspector General determines that such disclosure is unavoidable during the course of the investigation ..." First, that part of the statute applies only to the inspector general; he is the only official specifically prohibited from identifying the whistleblower. And second, even that prohibition has a condition attached to it, that the inspector general can identify the whistleblower if it is unavoidable in the course of the investigation. Even if "course of the investigation" refers only to the inspector general's inquiry, the fact is, that investigation has now morphed into a House impeachment proceeding in which the chances of the whistleblower remaining forever anonymous are thin.
The Times made the case, correctly, that personal details about the whistleblower were a key part of judging the credibility of his complaint. We already know, if the Times is correct, that he is a career CIA officer with deep expertise in Ukraine and Central European affairs. But the public is entitled to know all the facts about the whistleblower and not just the facts as characterized by journalists, or certain facts judged relevant by journalists while others are kept hidden. Credibility goes both ways. Party affiliation, past political activities, job performance, and any connections to investigators are all things that merit proper public scrutiny.
Some will argue that the whistleblower cannot be identified because exposure would bring threats to his safety. It is true that people of great notoriety sometimes face threats. But it is also true that the whistleblower's name is already out there; if threats are coming, they are coming whether or not a news organization reports his identity. If much of Washington already knows who he is, which it does, then anonymity ceases to be about protecting the whistleblower and becomes instead a shield that protects him from scrutiny in an effort to topple the president.
In the big picture, it is the public's right to know that should prevail. It's time for the whistleblower to be identified.

Heirs of omission: Who’s in, and not in, a will

Texto completo: These past few weeks we’ve been discussing “omissions” (you can decide whether these are errors or sins). As an estate planning attorney, I instantly think of “omitted heirs.” And you may think, “huh?”
An omitted heir is a person who would have inherited by law but was not mentioned in a will or trust. A related concept is “pretermitted heir”– someone who was born to, adopted by, or married to the deceased after the date of the will. Both situations have legal consequences, which may or may not have been intended.
Occasionally, I meet with a client who intends to disinherit a child. We always state that clearly and upfront in the will with a statement such as “I have intentionally not provided for my child Badly Behaving Bob and for all purposes hereunder he is to be treated as having predeceased me,” and sometimes we add “leaving no issue” if the client also wishes to disinherit any of Bob’s children (and let’s face it, if the behavior was bad enough those grandchildren could be sprinkled across the globe). This can make clients uncomfortable. But there is a reason for it.
California law
California provides that in the case of an omitted or pretermitted heir the heir will inherit an intestate share (what they would have received had there been no will at all) except in some specific circumstances. In other words, the law assumes you mean to provide for your children, with only a few exceptions, which are:
The decedent’s failure to provide for the child was intentional and that intention appears from the testamentary instruments.The decedent had one or more children and devised or otherwise directed the disposition of substantially all the estate to the other parent of the omitted child.
The decedent provided for the child by transfer outside of the estate, and the intention that the transfer be in lieu of a provision in said instruments is shown by statements of the decedent or by other evidence.
California law also provides that if at the time the decedent executed the estate plan they failed to provide for a child solely because they were unaware of the child or believed the child was deceased, the child will be entitled to take a share of the decedent’s estate.
Thus, documenting your wishes and intentions becomes important in these situations. And disclosing to your attorney any children, stepchildren, adopted children, or possible children you may have is also extremely important.
Celebrity omissions
Remember when actor Heath Ledger died, leaving behind 2-year-old Matilda, his daughter with Michelle Williams? Ledger’s will pre-dated Matilda’s birth by several years and left everything to his sisters and parents.
His will was signed when his assets were estimated at just above $100,000. When he died, his net worth was said to be more than $16 million. Luckily for Matilda, Ledger’s family agreed to give it all to her and no court battle ensued. Ledger was an Australian citizen; in California, the pretermitted heir law would have given the estate to Matilda anyway, but with a greedier family, a long court battle would have likely ensued.
The family of Michael Crichton, creator of Jurassic Park and ER, was not so lucky. At the time of his death in 2008, he was 66 years old and left behind four ex-wives, a 20-year-old daughter, and a new wife who was six months pregnant.
Crichton executed a will and trust in 2007 and specifically stated, “I have intentionally made no provision in this will for any of my heirs or relatives who are not herein mentioned or designated, and I hereby generally and specifically disinherit every person claiming to be or who may be determined to be my heir-at-law, except as otherwise mentioned in this will.”
If Crichton had updated his estate plan when he learned his wife was expecting, a protracted battle between his daughter (who thought that provision should apply to disinherit her half-brother) and the mother of his son (who had a prenup but fought on behalf of her son) could have been avoided. The court eventually ruled that Crichton’s son was entitled to one-third of his estate as a pretermitted heir since his son was not conceived or known of at the time the will was executed.
Crichton’s $100 million art collection soon went to auction at Christie’s to begin making distributions (and paying legal fees, no doubt).
When is a child not a child?
It is equally important to name those who may not be considered “children” by law. It’s not uncommon for a child to take the last name of a stepfather so that mom, stepdad and child all had the same name and to the world at large they were a family. This is particularly true if biological dad is not part of the child’s life.
But if stepdad did not legally adopt the child, the child will not be a legal heir. The stepdad would need to specifically state that he intended to treat the child as his own.
You forgot you were married?
The laws are similar for omitted spouses. When a testamentary document is executed before a marriage and does not mention the spouse, the surviving spouse will be considered a pretermitted heir entitled to all the community property and a share of separate property.
No contest
If you do intend to disinherit a child or a spouse, you will need to carefully state as much in clear language in your will or trust.
In some circumstances, however, you may want to consider a gift to that person instead. I know that sounds nuts, but hear me out. Most folks are aware of the “no-contest” provisions in testamentary documents — that’s the clause that says “if anyone contests this document, they inherit nothing.”
If you’ve completely disinherited someone, they have nothing to lose by contesting your plan. Instead, if you’ve given them a gift at least they have the loss of that gift to consider.
Let me not omit the best advice of all — implement and regularly review your estate plan.

Texto completo: Hoy abrió al público una plataforma de observación de vidrio en el piso 102 del Empire State Building que ofrece vistas de 360 ​​grados de la ciudad, en un ambiente sin paredes.
La apertura marca el comienzo de lo que los diseñadores llaman la “Experiencia del Observatorio”, resultado de cuatro años y $165 millones de dólares en renovaciones destinadas a resolver las largas colas y la congestión para hacer más atractiva la visita al edificio más famoso de Nueva York y quizá EEUU.
Después de ingresar, ahora a través de la calle 34 en lugar de la 5ta Avenida, los visitantes pasan por la fascinante arquitectura art deco y un modelo de 24 pies del edificio antes de acceder a una exhibición de 10 mil pies cuadrados sobre la historia del edificio abierto en 1931.
La exhibición dinámica y digital impulsa a los visitantes hacia los ascensores que transportan, en 55 segundos, a la cubierta del piso 86.
Los visitantes pueden ir al piso 102 pagando $20 dólares adicionales. Una variedad de beneficios, como tours privados y pases sin colas también están disponibles en paquetes que cuestan hasta $460, describió el New York Times.
“Es, simplemente, una vista inigualable”, dijo el jueves Jean-Yves Ghazi, presidente de Empire State Realty Trust, la compañía propietaria del edificio.
“Somos el punto en el mapa que mantiene unida a esta ciudad”, agregó. “Hay mucho significado aquí. La altura no es el marcador; se trata del estatus icónico de este lugar”.
El mirador en el piso 102 ofrecerá a grupos de unas 55 personas la oportunidad de ver Nueva York desde el panorama más alto de 360 ​​grados en la ciudad , destacó Ghazi.
El observatorio es completamente transparente. Los que se atreven pueden mirar directamente a las calles de abajo.
“Nunca ha habido un mejor momento para darle una nueva mirada” a la ciudad, escribió James S. Russell, recomendando que hasta los neoyorquinos y turistas que han subido al mirador del Empire State deberían volver ahora a redescubrirlo.

* Nueva York tendrá la terraza panorámica más alta del hemisferio, con piso transparente en Hudson Yards

Texto completo: Headnote AN ETHIOPIAN CULTURAL TREASURE
AMSTERDAM - In 1998, Sirak Asfaw, a Dutch civil servant who was born in Ethiopia, noticed something shiny in the suitcase of a guest who was staying at his house. Curious, he opened the case to find a glittering gilded crown inside.
"I couldn't believe my eyes," Sirak, who moved to the Netherlands a political refugee in the 1970s, said in a recent interview in Amsterdam. "I felt betrayed. Using my house to smuggle cultural heritage from Ethiopia? I knew it had something to do with Ethiopian history, the Ethiopian kingdom. I knew this is not good."
Sirak said that he felt he couldn't return the crown to the Ethiopian authorities, because he suspected that the government might have been complicit in the theft, and he feared that it would be stolen again.
He also didn't want to hand it over to the Dutch authorities, because he worried that a museum would keep the crown forever rather than returning it when a new Ethiopian government was in place.
So Sirak locked the visitor out of his house, he said, and removed the crown from the suitcase. He did not identify the smuggler to The New York Times for fear of his safety, and said he didn't know how his guest had acquired it.
For 21 years, he hid it in his home. "When I saw it, I always felt very emotional," he said. "I knew it shouldn't be here, not in my house, not in the Netherlands."
Last year, after Ethiopia installed a new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, Sirak decided that it was time to try to return the crown, confident that the new government would handle the return properly, he said.
He contacted an independent Dutch art crimes investigator, Arthur Brand, who placed the crown in a high-security art facility in the Netherlands and alerted the Dutch police.
Toon van Wijk, a spokesman for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an email exchange with The Times that officials were investigating. "Authenticity must be determined in cooperation with the Ethiopian authorities," he said. "Once the investigation has been completed, we must look at the next steps."
The Ethiopian ambassador to the Netherlands, Abay Weldu Hagos, said in a telephone interview that discussions were underway with Ethiopia's Ministry of Tourism and Culture to return the work either to the church from which it was stolen or to a museum in Ethiopia.
"It's up to Ethiopian stakeholders to decide where it should go," he said.
Jacopo Gnisci, a research associate at Oxford University who specializes in Ethiopian artifacts, examined the crown in Amsterdam a few weeks ago and said he thought it was authentic.
He believes it was probably a liturgical crown used in Orthodox Christian ceremonies. Gnisci also tracked down a photograph in which a priest is wearing the crown in 1993, a few years before it disappeared.
The crown was probably stolen in the 1990s from a church in the village of Cheleqot, 75 miles from the border with Eritrea, Gnisci said.
The researcher said it was a rare object, one of only about 20 such liturgical crowns in existence.
"If I had to put a price tag on it, I'd say 40,000 to 50,000 euros" - about $44,000 to $55,000 - Gnisci said in a telephone interview. That figure, he said, "is at the highest possible end of the market for Ethiopian artifacts, just under the price you'd fetch for an illuminated manuscript."
The object has surfaced at a time of increased international debate about the return of African art and artifacts to their places of origin.
Sirak said he would like for the crown to be given to the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa.
"That's the safest place for it, but I trust that the Ethiopian government will take care of it," he said. "Now it is in safe hands, and I'm a bit relieved."

O’Rourke to stage Trump counter rally

Texto completo: Beto O’Rourke is seeking to turn President Donald Trump’s rally next week at the American Airlines Center in Dallas into a duel for the heart of Texas between himself and the president he hopes to unseat.
The former three-term Democratic congressman from El Paso, who is seeking his party’s nomination for president, will hold a “Rally Against Fear” Thursday evening in Grand Prairie, 13 miles west of Dallas. The Trump rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. Doors open for the O’Rourke rally at 6 p.m.
“We will not be defined by this president’s fear, his hate, or the differences between us that he tries to exploit, but instead by a renewed sense of hope and a unified vision for the future of our country,” O’Rourke said in a statement released by his campaign Wednesday evening, announcing the rally. “In this moment of smallness, paranoia and division, Texas is going to lead the way with our strength, our courage, our diversity and the big, bold, ambitious things we want to achieve together.”
In February, when Trump held a rally in El Paso, O’Rourke was featured at a counter rally. Trump held the rally in the border city to stress the importance of completing a wall along the border with Mexico, an ambition O’Rourke opposes as unnecessary and counter-productive.
The Theatre at Grand Prairie, where the O’Rourke event will take place, has a seating capacity of 6,350 and the American Airlines Center can hold 20,000 people.
The dueling rallies will come on the heels of the fourth Democratic presidential debate Tuesday night outside of Columbus, Ohio. O’Rourke will be one of a dozen candidates sharing the stage for the debate, co-hosted by CNN and The New York Times.
But O’Rourke’s claim to a place in the fifth debate, in Georgia in November, is tenuous. He is at 1.6% in the RealClearPolitics polling average nationally and 1.7% in Iowa, his best performance in the four early nominating states.
Under Democratic National Committee rules, to participate in the November debate a candidate needs to reach 3% in four authorized national or early state polls, or 5% in two early state polls. O’Rourke is among four candidates who will be part of Tuesday’s debate who have not yet met that threshold. The other three are former San Antonio Mayor and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.

Texto completo: Android software creator Andy Rubin has left Playground Global, the venture-capital firm he co-founded, a person familiar with the matter said.
Playground bought back Mr. Rubin's stake in May when he departed, and Mr. Rubin no longer has an active role at the firm, the person said. The news of Mr. Rubin's departure from Playground was earlier reported by BuzzFeed.
Mr. Rubin couldn't be reached for comment about leaving Playground.
Playground is an early-stage investment firm that has raised $800 million across two funds.
Mr. Rubin came under public scrutiny for the $90 million exit package he got from Google parent Alphabet Inc. It followed sexual harassment claims from a former subordinate. Mr. Rubin denied the misconduct through his attorney . He departed Alphabet in 2014, but the settlement wasn't revealed until it was reported by the New York Times last year. The payment was publicly disclosed in a shareholder lawsuit earlier this year.
Mr. Rubin leads Essential Products Inc., a smartphone company he started. The company unveiled its new phone design this week. Playground remains an investor in Essential, the person said.
Mr. Rubin launched Playground in 2015 after his departure from Google. Playground raised its most recent $500 million venture fund in 2017. It raised a $300 million fund in 2015.
Playground's portfolio companies have included Wi-Fi business Eero , diabetes-treatment provider Virta Health Corp. and drone business Skydio Inc.

Life &amp; Arts -- Architecture Review: A Tipping Point Both Elegant and Disorienting

Texto completo: [The Museum of Modern Art Reopens]
New York -- What do the airport, the municipal hospital, and the Museum of Modern Art have in common? Each is condemned to perpetual growth, to add wing upon wing and never achieve final resolution. We resign ourselves to our rambling airports and hospitals but naturally expect more from a building that was once one of the most innovative and influential museums of the 20th century.
In 1939 MoMA completed its first permanent museum, a diminutive but flawless essay in translucent glass (a material imported from Mussolini's Italy) and flowing space. Edward Durell Stone, one of its co-architects, claimed that it was the first building in New York in the International Style, which was only fair since MoMA itself had coined the term just a few years earlier. Since that modest beginning, the museum has sprawled to take up the lion's share of the block between Fifth and Sixth avenues, and 53rd and 54th streets.
Every subsequent addition deferred to the original building. In three campaigns (1950, 1953 and 1964), Philip Johnson extended it to the east and west, and added a sculpture garden. Cesar Pelli pushed it farther westward in 1984 with a residential tower that provided museum space in its base. Yoshio Taniguchi's mighty expansion of 2001-04 added 35,000 square feet of exhibition space (along with 217,000 square feet of additional space for administrative and other needs, a harbinger of changing priorities).
All of these architects replicated the aesthetic language of their International Style model: fluid spatial continuity within a taut rectilinear frame, grace notes limited to those provided by impeccably laconic detailing, and a categorical avoidance of any structural drama, any visible play of weight and support.
Yet the original MoMA could not be enlarged ad infinitum simply by adding more International Style compartments, any more than a song can be turned into a symphony just by adding more notes. Once a certain threshold is crossed, the original loses its integrity without producing something resolved and coherent in its place. And with the newest $450 million enlargement of MoMA, an approach to planning that was splendidly suited to a building of modest scale now stubbornly refuses to cohere.
Of architects working today, Diller Scofidio + Renfro perhaps comes closest to the visual aesthetics of the International Style. Its addition (in collaboration with Gensler, the international design firm), begun in 2016, gives MoMA more than 40,000 additional square feet of exhibition space. Just to the west of the Taniguchi addition, where Tod Williams and Billie Tsien's startlingly imaginative American Folk Art Museum once stood, they have added two generously scaled double-height performance spaces, visible from the street. Farther west, MoMA spills into the lower stories of an extravagant 1,050-foot-high residential tower by Jean Nouvel, whose dynamic diagonal struts finally give some visual excitement to a block that, lined with MoMA's pageant of charcoal and gray facades, offers a kind of rhapsody in smoke.
Gallery by gallery, DS+R's new spaces are quite successful. Somewhat larger than those in the Taniguchi wing, they are pleasingly proportioned and superbly detailed. The maple floors are attractive, and subtly detailed to distinguish themselves from those in the Taniguchi wing. It was also a clever idea to move the bookstore below ground level, so that pedestrians can look down into it (although its managers have evidently had to scramble to make their wares attractive from above, what they call "aerial marketing").
One new space is uncommonly handsome. Just to the west of the Taniguchi wing, visible from outside, a continuous stair wraps around a suspended blade that looks sharp enough to shave with. Its wood-paneled walls, to dampen the inevitable clatter of heels, are speckled with micro-perforations -- one of the most elegant acoustic measures I have ever seen.
There is no question that DS+R can make elegant contemporary spaces, but to array those spaces in comprehensible fashion is a problem of a different order. It is a rule in architecture, from Stonehenge to the Seagram Building, that strong programs make for strong buildings. The clearer and more specific the client's requirements, the easier it is for the architect to resolve them in a unified, coherent design. But an indecisive program makes for an indecisive building, and the architectural program of the new MoMA, along with the innovative installation that marks its reopening, is riddled with ambivalence and insecurity.
Critics have already praised the reconfigured MoMA for dispensing with its traditional narrative of the heroic rise of modernism -- for abandoning, in the words of one New York Times writer, its "Whiggish movement-by-movement logic" -- even as they have complained about its confusing layout. But these are two sides of the same coin. The great museums of the past, a category that sadly now includes the original MoMA, were planned so that the visitor's linear movement was in physical and metaphysical harmony with the story they told. The architectural order reinforced the intellectual order. Controlled vistas were employed so that crucial works could be seen from a distance, and brought into meaningful and often complex relationships with other objects.
It is extraordinary how studiously the new MoMA avoids the axis; gallery doors are purposefully not aligned so there is no sense of enfilade, the axial progression from room to room that culminates in a climax. But a climax presupposes that most unfashionable of things, a hierarchy, without which the visitor is left to wander through an installation that has no point around which one can orient oneself, no sense of rising action and falling action, either in its sequence of objects or sequences of spaces. The result is a museum that is maddeningly disorienting. The intense effort that has been put into signage is itself a warning sign; a well-ordered building should be self-explanatory.
At one time the Museum of Modern Art prided itself on presenting one of the great events in history, a presentation rooted in rigorous value judgments, confidently made. It treated this story with pride, reverence and curiosity. Now it looks at it in vague embarrassment, an embarrassment that permeates its glistening but distressingly insecure shell. It proudly refuses to make value judgments, an attitude nowhere more perfectly expressed architecturally than in its wish "to encourage a multitude of possible routes through the museum." But that in itself is the greatest value judgment of all.

Texto completo: The 10 Cobb County Superior Court judges and the Cobb District Attorney will receive a 4% raise retroactive to Oct. 6.
By a split vote of 3-2, the Cobb Board of Commissioners authorized Oct. 8 this increase to begin Oct. 6 when a 4% merit increase also became effective for all Cobb County employees.
Opposed were Commissioners Bob Ott and Keli Gambrill with Commission Chairman Mike Boyce and Commissioners JoAnn Birrell and Lisa Cupid in favor.
Since the Superior Court judges and the DA are state employees, Ott said, "The state needs to take responsibility for the Superior Court judges. At some point in time, we've got to tell the state enough."
Boyce said he would bring this matter to the Cobb delegation of state lawmakers when they meet in December.
However, Boyce said, "We have the best judges in the state. I don't believe we should hold their salary back. It's the first merit raise in four or five years."
Cobb Superior Court Administrator Tom Charron noted that the DA and the Superior Court judges have received one salary raise from the state in 16 years and no raise this year from the state -- other than a supplement from Cobb County.
The Cobb commissioners have the authority to enact the 4% for all Superior Court Judges without seeking legislative action as provided under 2014 Georgia Laws Act 450 (House Bill 1126), Charron added.

Texto completo: The two winners of the Nobel Prize for literature, announced Thursday, are both European literary stylists known for their imaginative prose and also for at times becoming lightning rods for controversy.
But that's where the similarity ends between Austrian avant-garde novelist, poet, playwright, screenwriter and essayist Peter Handke, who received the 2019 Nobel, and Polish author and political activist Olga Tokarczuk, who belatedly received the 2018 prize. The latter award had been postponed a year after a sexual abuse scandal rocked the Swedish Academy, which chooses the winner.
The judges hailed Handke for producing an influential body of work "that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience." The prize announcement compared him to another influential 20th-century writer in the German language, Franz Kafka.

Winning the Nobel is "a sensation of freedom I've never felt before," Handke, 76, said in an interview released on YouTube by the Nobel website. It was a turnabout from his 2014 interview with the Austrian newspaper Die Presse, in which Handke called for the Nobel Prize for literature to be abolished and derided the award for what he called its "false canonization" of literature.
Nobel judges lauded Tokarczuk for writing with "a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life." The English version of her novel "Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead," translated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones , made the longlist for this year's Booker Prize. The unconventional crime novel tells the story of an elderly astrologist who lives in a remote Polish village; her revulsion at hunting initially leads her to believe that dead bodies found in her village are acts of retaliation by animals.
National Public Radio reviewer Kamil Ahsan praised the Polish novelist as "fundamentally a portraitist, a writer with a keen sense for sniffing out the incongruities that make a person."
In an interview Thursday, Tokarczuk, 57, noted that Central Europe is struggling with political turmoil and said she hoped "such a prize will, in a way, give us a kind of optimism." Her books are increasingly being republished in other languages. "That's why translators are so important," she said in the interview published on the Nobel website. "They are like fragile links between languages, reminding us that literature is one."
Last year's Nobel Prize for literature award was scrapped on the heels of the furor surrounding Jean-Claude Arnault, a convicted rapist married to poet and former Swedish Academy member Katarina Frostenson. The Nobel Foundation announced in March that it planned to double up on the literary awards after last year's controversy, which cut the number of Swedish Academy voters from 18 to 11.
Arnault was accused of leaking the names of Nobel Prize winners as well as assaulting or harassing 18 women -- including Crown Princess Victoria, heir to the Swedish throne -- causing several members to resign. Frostenson and Arnault also faced conflict-of-interest allegations involving Forum, a Swedish cultural center funded in part by the Swedish Academy.
On Thursday the organization took an unusual move to award literature prizes to not one but two authors.
The 2019 winner, Handke was born in the village of Griffen in southern Austria in 1942, the son of a German soldier -- whom he wouldn't meet until his own adulthood -- and a mother who was an ethnic Slovenian. After studying to be a lawyer, he dropped out after publishing "Die Hornissen" ("The Hornets"), an experimental novel-within-a-novel, in 1966.
That same year, he gained notoriety with a provocative play, "Publikumsbeschimpfung" ("Offending the Audience"), in which a quartet of actors debated the nature of drama in between insulting theatergoers. One of his subsequent plays, 1968's "Kaspar," reinterpreted the story of Kaspar Hauser, the 19th-century German boy who claimed to have been held in isolation for years, and portrayed him as a victim of society's attempts to impose its values upon an innocent.
Handke went on to become such a prolific writer that the announcement of his Nobel win cited nearly 100 works. Of those, one of Handke's best-known books is 1970's "Die Angst des Tormanns beim Elfmeter" ("The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick"), a Kafkaesque crime novel about a former soccer player who becomes a murderer. It was made into a film by German director Wim Wenders, with whom Handke collaborated on the screenplay. Handke also helped write the screenplay for Wenders' most famous film, 1988's "Wings of Desire."
Handke's 1975 book "A Sorrow Beyond Dreams," an account of his mother's life and death, was praised by a Times reviewer as "an exacting picture of the shock and grief that await those who have inherited the ruins of a suicide."
Handke also has received criticism for his political views. After he published "A Journey to the Rivers," a 1995 book that presented a sympathetic view of the Serbian side during the war in Bosnia, reviewer David Rieff called Handke's book "contemptible." In 2006, after Handke attended the funeral of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic -- who died while being tried for war crimes -- German politicians threatened to revoke a literary prize Handke had been awarded, leading him to turn it down, according to the German newspaper Deutsche Welle. "I am a writer and not a judge," Handke said of Milosevic in a 2006 New York Times interview.
The 2018 winner Tokarczuk was born in 1962 in Sulechow in Poland, the offspring of two teachers. She studied psychology at the University of Warsaw before publishing her 1993 debut novel, "Podroz ludzi Księgi" ("The Journey of the Book-People"), which was set in 17th-century France and Spain. She rose to literary stardom with 1996's "Prawiek i inne czasy" ("Primeval and Other Times"), which retold the history of the Polish nation in the 20th century, starting on the eve of World War I.
Other books by Tokarczuk include the historical novel "Księgi Jakubowe" ("The Books of Jacob"), based upon the life of charismatic 18th-century sect leader Jacob Frank. In 2018, Tokarczuk became the first Polish writer ever to win the Booker Prize for her book "Flights," a novel that contemplates both modern travel and the human anatomy.
But Tokarczuk also has become a lightning rod because of her opposition to Poland's conservative ruling Law and Justice Party and her support for gay rights, according to the Associated Press.
A 2018 profile of Tokarczuk in the British newspaper the Guardian depicted her as a controversial figure in her native Poland, where some denounced her after she gave a television interview in which she questioned Poland's self-image as a survivor of oppression, saying that the country had committed "horrendous acts" of colonization during its history. Her publisher had to hire bodyguards to protect her as a result, the Guardian reported. Conversely, she's become a hero to youthful leftists in her country, as the New Yorker reported in a recent profile.
Tokarczuk told the New Yorker she sees herself as a "psychotherapist of the past," who compels her readers to contemplate portions of their own lives and Polish history that they otherwise wouldn't think about.

Texto completo: A memory card found on the ground in Alaska led to a man being arrested for a gruesome murder committed days before the lost storage device was discovered.
Police said a woman in Anchorage discovered the SD card lying on the ground somewhere in Anchorage and turned it over to authorities. When the contents of the card were pulled up on a computer, police found it contained 39 images and 12 videos of 48-year-old Brian Steven Smith brutally strangling and killing a woman, according to the New York Times.
Smith, who is South African, was identified because police said they recognized him from an unspecified prior investigation. The charging document said that the man in the video “had some sort of an English-sounding accent when he spoke.”
The videos allegedly show Smith strangling the woman with his hands and stomping on her neck, at one point he began laughing. While strangling her, police say he can be heard saying, “Just … die.”
On Oct. 2, two days after the memory card was recovered, the body of the woman in the videos was found along a highway. Police said the location of the remains was about 18 miles from the hotel where they think the murder took place.
Smith had checked out a room at the hotel from Sept. 2 to Sept. 4. Police said the carpet in the video matches the carpet seen in the hotel room where the woman was murdered. Furthermore, authorities said that on around 1 a.m. on Sept. 6, Smith’s phone pinged near to where the body was dumped.
Smith made a brief court appearance Wednesday where he pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. He is being held on $500,000 bail.
Police spokesman MJ Thim credited discovery of the memory card as key to nabbing Smith.
“We believe that we have our suspect in custody,” Thim said, “and we are moving forward with determining the rest of the answers to this investigation.”

Trump's Reckless Rush to Withdraw; The Syria pullout boosts the impression that he's all impulse, blithely operating out of his depth.

Texto completo: One thing I think I've correctly observed about the U.S. military in the 21st century is that its leaders tend to be the last to want to go to war and the last to want to leave it. Political figures operate under public pressures and shifting geopolitical needs and goals; they're surrounded by people who see the world a certain way; they get revved up, and say, "Go, invade." Top military staff have reservations. They've studied the area, know the realities, the history—they have doctorates in it—and don't want to get into anything America can't win cleanly, decisively, relatively quickly. They're skeptics.
In the end the commander in chief makes the decision and they do their constitutional duty. Troops are deployed and perform. They dig in and fight, they're professionals—they commit.
The political figures then decide after a few years—or decades—that it's time to come home. Military leaders are skeptical again. They've been in this thing a while, they're committed to the battle space, they've lost men, they know and care about their allies in the fight, they have a sharp sense of the repercussions of withdrawal. They want more time.
I suspect the current habit of skepticism springs in part from the military's generations-long reckoning with Vietnam. You can see it in Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster's influential 1997 book, "Dereliction of Duty." "The war in Vietnam was not lost in the field, nor was it lost on the front pages of the New York Times," Donald Trump's second national security adviser writes. "It was lost in Washington, D.C." Responsibility for the failure rested not only with President Lyndon B. Johnson and his civilian advisers but also his military advisers, particularly the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Between the lines Gen. McMaster was telling the current military: Don't claim to see lights at the ends of tunnels when you don't really see them, play it straight. Be forthcoming with political leaders—and the public—about "likely costs and consequences."
Anyway, history is human. Military leaders have their ways and biases. But public military opposition to the president's withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria, after a Sunday telephone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, seems to me completely correct. Gen. John Allen, a retired Marine, said, "If we were going to draw a circle around a group of American troops who are more important right now to the stabilization of any place on the planet, it's that thousand troops." He said of Turkey's incursion into Syria, "This is just chaos." Retired Adm. James Stavridis said it will lead to the comeback of ISIS and embolden other U.S. adversaries. He noted that it's some kind of policy that can unite, in opposition, Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bernie Sanders.
It is.
More compelling is what Jennifer Griffin, the respected national-security correspondent for Fox News, reported Wednesday night. She spoke to a "distraught" U.S. Special Forces soldier on the ground alongside the Kurdish forces that were about to be abandoned. "It was one of the hardest phone calls I have ever taken," she tweeted. The soldier told her "I am ashamed for the first time in my career." He said, "There was no threat to the Turks—none—from this side of the border." The Kurds, who are guarding thousands of ISIS prisoners, had just prevented a prison break and were pleading for U.S. support. Without it, the soldier said, those detainees would likely soon be free. Of the president: "He doesn't understand the problem. He doesn't understand the repercussions to this." "It's a shame," he added. "The Kurds are standing by us. No other partner I have ever dealt with would stand by us."
I believe every word of this.
Why this decision? Why now?
To redeem a campaign pledge with another campaign looming? On impulse? What was behind the impulse? The president doesn't seem to know much about the Kurds—that they've backed the U.S. since 2003 and fought ISIS since 2011. They have their reasons: They want their own state. But they are a gallant people, brave and sympathetic to the West.
The president, defending this decision, asked what we owe them. "They didn't help us in the Second World War, at Normandy for example."
Yes, I forgot. Reagan made that point in his Pointe du Hoc speech. He said, "Don't forget to stick it to the Kurds for not showing up." Oh wait, he didn't say that, because he was quite the reader of history.
Mr. Trump, in defending his position, says he is against the "endless wars" that have marked the first two decades of this century. Fair and good, the right approach, he ran for president opposing them and Americans left and right agreed.
But there is too much craziness to the decision, both its substance and how it was made. The area has been functioning, the number of U.S. troops small and limited. Adm. Stavridis called it "a small investment with a big spring to it."
The decision was done on the word of Mr. Erdogan, a particular kind of player—thuggish, duplicitous. He considers the Kurds on his border a security threat. He threatens to send Syrian refugees to Europe if European countries call his incursion an occupation. If they insult him like that, "We will open the gates and send 3.6 million refugees your way."
Mr. Trump himself says if the ISIS terrorists the Kurds are holding in prison are freed or escape, no worry. "They're going to be escaping to Europe," he said. "They want to go back to their homes."
That's a viciously careless way to treat your allies. Who, by the way, were at Normandy.
Most unsettling was the president's mad tweet assuring critics that his decision was right: "If Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!)." This isn't funny, it's self-inflated nut stuff.
The president is misreading his base, which will have qualms. Their sons and daughters fought in the wars; they know who the Kurds are.
Why would he do such a dramatic, piercing thing at what is for him a dramatic, piercing moment, with impeachment looming and support for it rising in the polls? Why offend Republicans senators, whom the president needs to survive impeachment? Why give them an excuse to start peeling off?
Why give those of his supporters who are cable-news hacks an excuse to show some pride? I'm not a lackey, this is about principle, the president has made a misjudgment! Watch it, they could get in the habit of self-respect.
The Syria decision contributes to the hardened impression that in foreign policy he's all impulse, blithely operating out of his depth. It adds to the hardening suspicion that in negotiations he's not actually tough; he'll say yes to a lot of things, and some very bad things, to get the deal, the photo-op, the triumphant handshake.
Foreign-policy decisions in this administration look like the ball in a pinball machine in some garish arcade with flashing lights and some frantic guy pushing the levers ping ping ping and thinking he's winning.

Texto completo: In its postwar heyday, Evelyn Wood's Reading Dynamics course was more than just the object of fun it would later become. (Woody Allen on what he gleaned from speed-reading "War and Peace": "It's about Russia.") It was an educational franchise that attracted politicians, corporate executives and generations of college students eager to get through their coursework in time for a kegger. In "Scan Artist," Marcia Biederman argues that the course was a fraud that bilked millions through false claims, pushy sales tactics and rigged assessments of post-instruction speeds. As if condensing her point for rapid reading, she declares: "Evelyn Wood was perhaps the greatest scammer of the twentieth century."
A Utah school teacher and a member of the Church of Latter-Day Saints, Evelyn Wood is an unlikely figure to have outdone such legendary swindlers as Charles Ponzi and George C. Parker (whose signature scam was selling the Brooklyn Bridge). But appearances can deceive: Maybe Wood was like the Brewster sisters in "Arsenic and Old Lace," those sweet little old ladies who outdid the most sinister of criminals.
Wood didn't set out to teach speed reading. Pursuing a master's degree at the University of Utah's speech department after World War II, she visited her adviser upon completing her work. "I turned in my thesis to Dr. Lowell Lees," Wood would recount, "and watched in amazement as he read my eighty-page paper as fast as he could turn the pages; he read, graded, and returned the thesis within a matter of minutes." She believed he actually read it all, and she was thrilled.

Inspired by this feat, Wood dived into the business of teaching people to read rapidly. The core instruction involved using one's finger as a "pacer" that would lead the eyes to view not lines of text but blocks or even whole pages. "The average person reads 150-200 words per minute," lamented an early Reading Dynamics advertisement. Wood promised "1,000 words per minute with greater comprehension." Teenagers on her payroll were presented with books they had supposedly never seen before. After a few minutes of finger zig-zagging, they could answer questions from the crowd about what they had "read." While Ms. Biederman, a New York-based journalist, isn't able to prove that the demonstrations were faked, she persuasively suggests that they were.
Corporations were the first to be enthusiastic about the speed-reading idea, keen to see their managers zip through piles of paperwork. By the 1960s and 1970s, the target market was colleges. A New York Times story from the early 1970s reported that there were Evelyn Wood institutes in "more than 150 cities" in 47 states and seven foreign countries.
From the beginning of the craze it was obvious to more than a few observers that what was gained in speed was lost in comprehension. William Perry Jr. and Charles Whitlock taught social and educational psychology at Harvard and were early critics of the idea of "lightning-like reading rates." A pupil taught speed reading hadn't become a better reader, they scoffed; he had merely been trained "how to get nothing out of such reading in one-tenth the time it previously took him to get nothing out of it."
Eventually Reading Dynamics became a punchline, and not only with Woody Allen. "Saturday Night Live" ran a spoof ad for the Evelyn Woodski Slow Reading Course: "I used to be a heavy speed reader," Jane Curtin says, "and I never laughed when I read Mark Twain. But now that I take my time, I find him very funny. Did you know that reading all the words in a story can help you understand the humor?"
If Evelyn Wood perpetrated a scam, she was not as adept at harvesting its rewards. She grew her business and her brand but sold out early, in the mid-1960s, to an investment group, staying on as a consultant (for $1,000 a month) and retaining the Utah-Idaho franchise. When she died, according to a grandson, the last of the Reading Dynamics money "was spent on the funeral brunch."
Ms. Biederman makes a good case that Wood's claims were preposterous, but she takes such a prosecutorial stance that one begins to feel some sympathy for her subject. She chides the company for an advertisement that showed a picture of the White House with the caption "Reading Dynamics Held Here Under Two Presidents." Not so, objects Ms. Biederman: "In fact, the class for Nixon staffers met at a site now named the Eisenhower Executive Office Building." What a silly gotcha. The mansard-roofed edifice known then as the Old Executive Office Building is on the White House grounds, next to the West Wing, and is where most White House staff work. It is hardly an alternate "site."
More seriously, Ms. Biederman argues that Evelyn Wood and her husband, Douglas, were Nazi sympathizers. Active in his church, Doug was named to run a Mormon mission in Frankfurt, Germany, in the late 1930s, where Evelyn joined him. Ms. Biederman accuses them not just of complicity in the church's policy of accommodating the Third Reich but of actively admiring Hitler. Doug wrote home to his parents that "the people practically worship Hitler"—Ms. Biederman plays down his furtive criticism of the regime, points to his making anti-Semitic remarks and concludes he "was practically a fellow worshiper." As for Evelyn, she "likely" rewrote church lessons to delete "words like 'Israel' and 'Zion.' "
When it comes to her more substantial indictment of Wood's reading boasts, Ms. Biederman might have cited the great scholarly work on the grift, "The Big Con" (1940), by David Maurer. In a classic con job, he explained, the mark is easily fleeced because he thinks he is in on the scam. Thus the maxim: "You can't cheat an honest man." Yes, Wood's enterprise played on the enduring American desire for self-improvement. But it succeeded because it promised learning on the cheap, and customers raced to be duped with unseemly speed.

Texto completo: Auto emissions have risen nationwide in the last three decades, and particularly so in Fairfield County and the greater New Haven.
Auto emissions have gone up 25 percent overall in Fairfield County since 1990. When adjusted for population, that increase drops to 9 percent, according to Boston University’s Database of Road Transportation Emissions.
In New Haven, the increase is more stark. Overall, emissions have risen 41 percent since 1990 — a 32 percent per-person increase.
That pattern holds true across the country, according to a New York Times analysis of the Boston University data. Suburban driving is the primary culprit, and though there are more cars in denser, urban areas, there also tends to be more public transportation.
Auto emissions are, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the largest producers of carbon-monoxide and other greenhouse gasses. Passenger cars and SUVs make up 60 percent of all emissions, with another 23 percent coming from freight trucks, as The New York Times reported.
Americans have been driving a lot more in recent years, according to federal officials, bolstered by a relatively solid economy and low gas prices.
In 2018, Americans drove 3.225 trillion miles, an increase of 12.2 billion miles over 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
“Record-setting vehicle-miles traveled reflects a robust economy, lower gas prices and is another reason to ensure that America’s roads and bridges are well-maintained and modernized to improve safety,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao said.

Texto completo: Former NBC anchor Matt Lauer denied that he had a nonconsensual sexual encounter with a network staffer, following reports that a book by journalist Ronan Farrow contains that allegation.
"In a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault," Mr. Lauer said Wednesday. "It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense."
In Mr. Farrow's book, "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators," which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, a former NBC News employee, Brooke Nevils, alleged that Mr. Lauer anally raped her in his hotel room during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. The book is due to be released next week.
Mr. Lauer, a longtime co-anchor of NBC's "Today" show, was fired in November 2017 for inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace. NBC said at the time that it had received a detailed complaint from an employee about misconduct by Mr. Lauer that represented "a clear violation of our company's standards." The book reveals that employee to be Ms. Nevils.
In a statement Wednesday, NBC said: "Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That's why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint."
Ms. Nevils tweeted Wednesday evening, "I want to thank the many survivors who shared their stories with me today and offered their support. It takes courage, and I am truly grateful."
Mr. Farrow was working for NBC when he started investigating allegations of sexual harassment by movie producer Harvey Weinstein. In his book, Mr. Farrow alleges that executives at NBC News slow-walked his investigation.
Mr. Farrow ultimately took the story to the New Yorker where it was published in the fall of 2017. It was awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, which Mr. Farrow shared with New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey.
Mr. Weinstein is due to go to trial in January on criminal charges including rape. He has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. A spokesman for Mr. Weinstein didn't respond to a request for comment.
In his book, Mr. Farrow alleges that Mr. Weinstein tried to pressure NBC News to kill his story. Mr. Farrow wrote that at one point Mr. Weinstein threatened the network, alleging that he was "aware of Mr. Lauer's behavior and capable of revealing it." He also wrote that employees at National Enquirer parent American Media LLC were looking into Mr. Lauer's workplace behavior and calling employees at NBC News about it.
"The story presented by Mr. Farrow, while dramatic, is inaccurate," an American Media spokesman said. NBC said that NBC News "was never contacted by [American Media], or made aware in any way of any threats from them, or from anyone else, for that matter."

And Now We're in a Constitutional Crisis

Texto completo: With a full-on confrontation between the House and the president, no simple resolution is available.
For the first time since President Richard Nixon refused to turn over the White House tapes, the United States is facing a genuine constitutional crisis.
To be sure, Donald Trump had already created a crisis in the presidency by abusing the power of his office to pressure foreign governments to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. But that act on its own didn't count as a constitutional crisis, because the Constitution prescribes an answer to presidential abuse of office: impeachment.
Now that President Trump has announced -- via a letter signed by Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel -- that he will not cooperate in any way with the impeachment inquiry begun in the House of Representatives, we no longer have just a crisis of the presidency. We also have a breakdown in the fundamental structure of government under the Constitution. That counts as a constitutional crisis.
A constitutional crisis exists when two conditions hold. First, we face a situation where the Constitution does not provide a clear, definitive answer to a basic problem of governance. Second, the political actors whose conflict is creating the problem appear ready to press their competing courses of action to the limit.
With Watergate, those two conditions were met. When President Nixon refused to comply with a valid subpoena issued by a federal court, there was no clear answer in the Constitution as to which branch of government would prevail. Mr. Nixon wouldn't budge, and neither the special prosecutor nor the court was willing to back down. The crisis was resolved only after the Supreme Court ordered the tapes to be turned over and Mr. Nixon resigned.
President Trump's stonewalling of the House impeachment inquiry also satisfies the two conditions for a constitutional crisis. First, the Constitution doesn't indicate what is supposed to happen if the House tries to exercise its constitutional power of oversight to investigate the president and the president flatly rejects the House's constitutional authority. Congress can demand that the president comply, but it can't very well send its sergeant-at-arms to the White House to enforce its subpoenas.
You might say that under the Constitution, the House could justifiably impeach the president for refusing to participate in the impeachment inquiry. Indeed, the third article of impeachment adopted by the House Judiciary Committee against Mr. Nixon charged him with contempt of Congress for ignoring subpoenas issued by Congress.
Yet as Mr. Trump appears to be calculating, it's not so simple or satisfying for the House to proceed to impeachment without a factual inquiry. Impeaching a president for refusing to participate in an impeachment inquiry is a kind of meta-impeachment. It would allow Mr. Trump to argue that the meta-impeachment is illegitimate because it isn't based on an investigation.
That brings us to the second condition, namely that neither of the key actors seems prepared to back down. About the only thing the House could do now would be to pass a resolution formally authorizing the impeachment inquiry -- something it has not yet done and which the White House counsel cited in his letter as a reason to consider the current inquiry "unprecedented." Passing such a resolution might be a good idea for the House. But it would not qualify as backing down. To the contrary, passing a resolution to investigate impeachment would raise the stakes in the constitutional confrontation.
Mr. Trump, for his part, could in theory back down once the House passes such a resolution and start cooperating in the inquiry. That would avert the crisis. It's just barely conceivable that the motivation for the White House counsel's letter was to force House Democrats to go on the record individually as supporting an impeachment inquiry.
The White House counsel's letter, however, strongly signals that Mr. Trump won't start cooperating even if the House passes a resolution to authorize the inquiry. The letter makes a number of independent arguments for why the current impeachment inquiry is unconstitutional and illegitimate, and those would presumably still apply even if the House passed a resolution authorizing the inquiry.
Assuming that Mr. Trump isn't backing down, we're witnessing a full-on confrontation between the House and the president, with no simple resolution available.
When two branches of government are locked in a standoff, it's always possible that the third branch of government might come in to resolve it. In this instance, that's the judiciary, and the Supreme Court is the obvious candidate for the role. Faced with presidential refusal to comply with subpoenas, the House could seek judicial enforcement of its subpoenas.
As a matter of ordinary constitutional law, there's little doubt that the House's arguments before the courts would be much stronger than any offered in Mr. Cipollone's letter. It's well-settled constitutional doctrine that Congress may issue subpoenas for any valid legislative purpose. The Constitution gives the House the power to impeach. An impeachment inquiry is therefore a valid legislative purpose under the Constitution -- and impeachment-related subpoenas should be enforced by the courts.
The president could always assert executive privilege with respect to particular confidential documents. Such claims of privilege could be analyzed by the courts under existing constitutional precedents. There is no precedent in constitutional doctrine, however, supporting a president's blanket refusal to comply with any subpoenas regardless of privilege.
More to the point, Mr. Cipollone's letter presents the president as the judge of whether a congressional inquiry into impeachment is constitutional. That obviously can't be right. Not only would that violate the principle of separation of powers; it also would effectively put the president in ultimate control of the impeachment process.
Given the extreme weakness of Mr. Trump's arguments, it's probable that the lower federal courts would side with the House. Going to the Supreme Court, however, is always a bit of a gamble. The court's four more-liberal justices would undoubtedly side with the House. The court's four most conservative justices, two of them appointed by Mr. Trump, would find themselves in a quandary. Given the weakness of Mr. Trump's arguments, it's possible to imagine that they would take the position that the judicial branch should abstain from a conflict between the other two branches -- a way of dodging the issue that would effectively allow them to give Mr. Trump a victory.
That would leave the balance of power with Chief Justice John Roberts, who is a judicial conservative but above all wants to protect the court from appearing partisan. The trouble is, there would be almost no way for the Supreme Court to resolve the current crisis without seeming as though it was taking a side in a political fight.
What would happen? A good guess is that Chief Justice Roberts, with his back to the wall, would stand up for the clear constitutional precedent that says the courts will enforce valid congressional subpoenas. The Supreme Court chose the rule of law over President Nixon, a precedent that will not be lost on Justice Roberts.
But a guess is not constitutional reassurance. And in a constitutional crisis, that kind of reassurance is what the Republic needs.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The White House has signed off on special licenses for some U.S. companies to do some business with Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co., according to a person familiar with the process.
The approval is likely to be interpreted as an act of goodwill as senior U.S. and Chinese officials gather for trade talks on Thursday . Business groups hope negotiators can agree on an interim or partial deal to prevent higher tariffs and additional duties on imports from China.
The partial reprieve for Huawei follows up on a plan President Trump outlined after meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit of the Group of 20 leading economies in June. The administration had blacklisted Huawei earlier this year , contributing to an economic standoff between the U.S. and China dominated by tariffs and other sanctions.
Mr. Trump had said U.S. companies could do business with Huawei if the cooperation didn't harm U.S. national security, allowing the Commerce Department to grant licenses in those cases. No licenses have yet been granted , although the U.S. government has granted a temporary reprieve allowing companies to cooperate with Huawei.
Further details on which companies might be licensed and how national-security concerns would be addressed couldn't immediately be learned. The New York Times earlier reported the White House action.
The White House referred questions to the Commerce Department, which said the temporary reprieve remains in effect and that it had no additional announcements at this time.
Senior U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to meet Thursday to discuss possible ways out of the trade war before an increase in U.S. tariff levels on Chinese products scheduled for Oct. 15 and the addition of major new consumer imports to the tariff list, set for Dec. 15.
The Huawei licenses or other concessions, including purchases of American agricultural goods by China, could be included as a part of such a deal, the person said.
Still, Mr. Trump this week said he doesn't favor a partial deal, and senior GOP lawmakers have expressed their preference for a broad deal to end the trade war and roll back tariffs. Democrats and China hawks are likely to attack any perceived shortcomings of an interim deal.

China is winning the battle for corporate America's soul

Texto completo: It turns out Twitter may be good for something after all.
On Friday, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for the pro-Democracy protesters in Hong Kong, who have been demonstrating against their communist overlords for months. “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,” the image he posted read.
With his bland tweet of solidarity, Morey exposed the cravenness of corporate America and revealed the self-proclaimed “wokest professional sports league” in America as a total sham.
Within hours of his tweet, the proverbial roof had caved in on Morey. China’s consulate in Houston expressed its “strong dissatisfaction.” The Houston Rockets offered a swift apology, distancing itself from its own general manager. The NBA did the same, calling the tweet “deeply offensive” and “regrettable.” Morey also retreated, deleting the original tweet and then tweeting a groveling apology.
Of course, the NBA didn’t see reason to apologize when Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai took to Facebook to disagree with Morey. Tsai, a co-founder of Alibaba, the Chinese equivalent of Amazon, called the Hong Kong protesters a “separatist movement” and their cause a “third-rail issue.”
The irony is that the NBA is seen as the most permissive professional sports league in America in terms of the amount of room it gives players to exercise free speech. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said he’s proud the NBA is known as “the wokest professional sports league” out there.
“Political speech is their absolute right within the league,” Silver told the New York Times last year. Try telling that to Morey.
Silver eventually reassured basketball fans that the NBA still believes in free speech. “The NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues,” he said. “We simply could not operate that way.”
Well, the Chinese communist government does operate that way and it announced that it will not televise the NBA's preseason games in China.
This is just the latest example of a U.S. corporation bowing to communist China.
American, Delta, and United Airlines gave in to China last year by deleting references to Taiwan as its own country. The Gap apologized for selling t-shirts with a map of China that didn’t include Taiwan or Tibet. Marriott International issued a cowed statement when China’s government shut down its website after the hotel company listed Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Tibet as separate countries.
“We don’t support separatist groups that subvert the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China,” Marriott said in a statement that could have been written by the Chinese Ministry of State Security Propaganda.
This is all about money, at least for the money-grubbing American corporations. China has a consumer base worth billions of dollars. Hundreds of millions of people there have entered the middle class over the last couple of decades, and they want to spend money on things like NBA merchandise and game tickets.
Chinese tech company Tencent Holdings reports that nearly 500 million people in China watched the NBA last year. That’s an audience roughly 50% larger than the entire U.S. population. The NBA recently announced a five-year contract with Tencent to stream games in China worth a reported $1.5 billion.
The communist Chinese government already has a vice grip on its 1.3 billion subjects. Through the sheer force of its market power, now it is telling Americans what they can and cannot say.
As I’ve written here before, ever since Congress extended permanent normal trade relations to China nearly 20 years ago, pro-China pundits have argued that increased trade and engagement with Beijing would cause the communist regime to open up and embrace democratic values.
But China’s behavior hasn’t changed at all. To the contrary, Beijing has become more authoritarian and more adversarial. Doing business with China has changed us more than it’s changed them.
This episode shows once again that when push comes to shove, the NBA and many other American corporations will prioritize profits over principle, and billions of dollars over millions of lives.
What the NBA and other companies will eventually come to realize is that if and when tanks roll into Hong Kong, China will not be satisfied unless the NBA and American companies applaud while the slaughter is taking place.
At the end of the day, this is not about Chinese communists. It's about us. The world has always had bad actors. The difference is how we respond. We want their money and they want our souls. Sadly, there are plenty of people willing to make that bargain.

Former NBC colleague of Matt Lauer accuses him of rape in new Ronan Farrow book

Texto completo: The NBC News employee whose sexual harassment complaint led to the firing of Matt Lauer in November 2017 says she was raped by the former anchor, according to a new book by investigative journalist Ronan Farrow.
According to a report in Variety, which obtained a copy of the book, “Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators,” Lauer allegedly forced the woman, Brooke Nevils, to have anal sex in a hotel room in Sochi, Russia, while the “Today” team was covering the 2014 Winter Olympics.
Nevils, who was interviewed by Farrow and agreed to reveal her identity, worked as an assistant to Meredith Vieira, Lauer’s co-anchor at the time.
Nevils told Farrow she was drinking heavily the night of the incident. She had gone to Lauer’s room twice — once to retrieve an Olympics press credential that he had taken as a joke and a second time at his invitation.
Farrow wrote that “she had no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience.”
Nevils alleged that once she was in Lauer’s hotel room, he pushed her against a door and kissed her before pushing her onto the bed and asking her if she liked anal sex. She declined several times, but he “just did it,” according to the book. She said she wept into a pillow during the incident.
“It was non-consensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,” Nevils said in the book. “It was non-consensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn’t want to have anal sex.”
Nevils told Farrow she had more sexual encounters with Lauer after the incident. She said she was fearful that he had control over her career. Farrow wrote that sources close to Lauer said Nevils sometimes initiated their meetings.
Nevils told Vieira about the Sochi incident in 2017. Vieira told her to report it to NBC’s human resources department with a lawyer. Lauer was terminated the day after Nevils and her attorney met with NBC.
In a report Wednesday on “Today,” the network said in a statement: “Matt Lauer’s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible as we said at the time. That’s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break for our colleague.”
Lauer’s attorney provided an open letter from his client to Variety, calling allegations that the encounter was an assault “categorically false.” Lauer again said it was consensual.
“It’s outrageous,” Lauer said in the letter. “So after not speaking out to protect my children, it is now with their full support that I say ‘enough.’ ”
Lauer has previously denied that any of the sexual relationships he had with women who worked with him were non-consensual.
Nevils’ allegations in the book stunned Lauer’s former “Today” colleagues, who reported on them on Wednesday’s program.
“This is shocking and appalling, and I honestly don’t even know what to say about it,” co-anchor Savannah Guthrie said. “I think I speak for all of us when I say we’re disturbed to our core.”
Co-anchor Hoda Kotb, who was close friends with Lauer, also expressed dismay. “You feel like you’ve known someone inside and all of a sudden a door opens up and it’s a part of them you didn’t know,” she said.
The book, which was given in advance to the Hollywood Reporter for a cover story out Wednesday, also details what Farrow says were Harvey Weinstein’s efforts to use information the movie mogul had about Lauer’s behavior as leverage, in an effort to suppress Farrow’s reporting on Weinstein’s alleged sexual misconduct.
An NBC News representative was not available for comment. But executives have denied the allegation, which has circulated as a rumor since Lauer was fired.
Farrow shared a Pulitzer Prize with New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey for his reporting on alleged sexual harassment, assault, rape and abuse of power by Weinstein during his long career. Farrow started his investigation at NBC News but left in frustration as executives believed he did not have enough corroboration to get the story on the air. Farrow eventually had the story published in the New Yorker on Oct 10, 2017.
NBC News executives have maintained that they supported Farrow’s reporting on the Weinstein scandal but would not budge from their position that he needed a victim or witness to the mogul’s alleged behavior to be identified on camera for the story to air.
NBC News executives have said Farrow’s reporting done at the network never reached the necessary standard for putting it on the air. They said none of the seven victims whom Farrow named in his meticulously reported New Yorker piece — Asia Argento, Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette, Lucia Evans, Emma de Caunes, Jessica Barth and Sophie Dix — were willing to speak on the record or be identified on camera to discuss the allegations.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Presidential candidate and Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday that it's "nonsense" to think his campaign was trying to hide the fact he had a heart attack last week.
During his first sit-down interview since leaving a Nevada hospital Friday, Sanders swatted back claims that his campaign was concealing the medical issue.
"That's nonsense," he told NBC News. "I don't know what people think campaigns are, you know we're dealing with all kinds of doctors and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on really. "
Sanders said he believes his campaign "acted absolutely appropriately. "
"The first thing that we're trying to do is understand what's going on and not run to the New York Times and have to report every 15 minutes," he said. "You know, this is not a baseball game. So I think we acted absolutely appropriately. "
Sanders' campaign last Wednesday announced that doctors found the Vermont Senator had blockage in one artery and two stents were inserted after he felt chest discomfort during a campaign event in Las Vegas.
More: Bernie Sanders will not participate in LGBTQ town hall after heart attack
It wasn't until Friday that Sanders' campaign officially noted he'd had a heart attack. Arturo E. Marchand Jr. and Arun Guraraj, Sanders' treating physicians, said in a statement that the senator was “diagnosed with a myocardial infarction” at another facility before being transferred to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. A myocardial infarction is the medical term for a heart attack.
Sanders at 78 years old is the oldest person running for president in 2020. Former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and President Donald Trump is 73. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is 71.
More: 4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates. Here's what that looks like.
More: Sanders says heart attack won't hurt campaign
According to NBC News, Sanders also said he "misspoke" when he said Tuesday that he would "change the nature" of his campaign post-heart attack.
"I misspoke the other day, I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it," Sanders said. "We're going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings. ”

'It's Always Sunny' has dodged cancel culture

Texto completo: Fans of the deeply irreverent "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" probably never expected to hear the show mentioned in the same breath as the 1950s values-ridden family sitcom "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" -- unless it was to contrast the two. Charlie Day, one of the co-creators of "It's Always Sunny," certainly didn't.
But the two now share a unique distinction.
With the recent premiere of the FX show's 14th season, they share the record for being the longest running live-action sitcom, a fact Day dubbed a "dinner conversation statistic of pride" during an interview with the Washington Post.
The show's origin story has become something of Hollywood lore. Frustrated with their struggles to break into the acting world, a group of out-of-work actors decided to shoot their own material. Rob McElhenney, one of the stars and co-creators, started with a darkly comic scenario that he originally envisioned as a short film about a guy who "came over to another friend's house to get sugar, and the friend tells him he has cancer, and all the guy can think about is getting his sugar and getting out of there," he told The New York Times in 2007.
With no budget to speak of, they used their own equipment and shot in their own apartments until -- next thing you know -- FX picked up the show, about a cranky group of friends running an Irish bar in south Philly, and added Kaitlin Olson to the cast along with McElhenney, Day and their co-creator Glenn Howerton.
Critics and a certain cult following loved the first season, but it wasn't picking up the steam it required. FX execs suggested that adding a bigger star to the cast of unknowns might gin up some more attention for the show -- and made it clear this wasn't a choice, the co-creators have said. It turned out Danny DeVito, a 30-year veteran of the big screen and an Emmy winner for "Taxi," had become a fan of the show. He joined the second season and has been with the show since.
From the jump, the show was built around these narcissistic crew of sociopaths -- calling them friends doesn't feel right, since friends generally don't try to constantly con one another -- and it's never really lightened its tone.
But while its quips about serial killing, child molestation, abortion and you-name-it might explain why it's never been nominated for a major Emmy, it did earn a steady audience.
"We don't have a lot of hardware accolades to brag about," Day said. "So I guess we can brag about statistics.
"I honestly don't have a clue why it's lasted this long," he added. "We've always been a bit of a counterculture show. We started out as the anti-sitcom. There's going to be nothing warm and fuzzy about this show, and we're gonna go right for the jugular. ... I think there's always going to be an audience for that kind of a show."
The business of actually making the show hasn't changed much in that time. The writing process, for example, remains "pretty much the same at the end of the day. It's usually Rob and I in a room, or (writers) David Hornsby and Megan Ganz in a room, and we just keep banging our heads against a wall until we have something that works."
Perhaps the show's most impressive feat is how it hasn't fallen prey to #cancelculture.
"I think the reason we came out unscathed is we're sort of grandfathered into some bad behavior," Day said. "If we, all of a sudden, launched the show this season and we're saying and doing the things we do, people might be a little more skittish about it."

Texto completo: The federal government has not asked the city of Atlanta to remove the rainbow crosswalks at 10th Street and Piedmont Avenue, but even if it did, the city wouldn'tcomply, saidaspokesman for Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.
In recent years, the Federal Highway Administration, citing safety concerns, has asked cities across the country to remove the rainbow crosswalks--a prominent municipal symbol of gay pride.
The latest, according to the New York Times, is Ames, Iowa.
The news, coupled with the preparations for the 49th Annual Pride Celebration in Piedmont Park this weekend, caused Bottoms's press office to be inundated with questions about whether the city's own rainbow crosswalks were in the federal government's crosshairs.
"While we have received no such request, Atlanta's rainbow crosswalk is located on city-owned streets," said Bottoms Spokesman Michael Smith. "Much like glitter, the crosswalk is here to stay indefinitely. The Bottoms Administration wishes Atlanta a safe and fabulous Pride."
The city of Ames has thus far
rebuffedthe government's request and in the process, made national headlinesabouthowthesmall Midwestern town is taking on the administration of U. S. President Donald Trump. The city is home to roughly 66,000 people, about half of whom are students.
In the Federal Highway Administration's Sept. 5 letter to Ames city leaders, the government cites no safety statistics or studies indicating that colorful crosswalks pose a greater threat to pedestrians than the typical plain white stripes.
"The purpose of aesthetic treatments and crosswalk art is to 'draw the eye' of pedestrians and drivers, in direct conflict with commanding the attention of drivers and motorists to minimize the risk of collision," the letter said.
The government's failure to identify any reports showing the rainbow crosswalks received more injuries bothered Jamie Ensely, president of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans, an organization that works within the Republican Party to advocate for gay and lesbian rights and has already endorsed Trump in the 2020 election.
"I would like to see statistics or a study from the federal highway administration, that states people are being injured and that car accidents have been caused from rainbow crosswalks," Ensely said.
In Atlanta, the crosswalk at 10th and Piedmont at the southwest corner of Piedmont Park still resonates emotionally with many in Atlanta's LGBT community, according to Jeff Graham, executive director of Georgia Equality. Temporarily painted in 2015 for Atlanta Pride week and then permanently instated in 2017, Atlanta was among the earliest cities to install a rainbow crosswalk.
The intersection was once home to Outwrite Bookstore &Coffee House, an important gathering spot for the city's LGBT community. Graham said the community often went there in anticipation of important court decisions or to protest.
"I'm certainly pleased with the mayor's response," Graham said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Trump campaign threatened to sue a Minneapolis arena for passing along a half-million-dollar security bill from the city to cover costs of the president's political rally there on Thursday.
Minneapolis officials told the Target Center it would be responsible for the $530,000 the city says it will need to beef up security. The arena then passed the bill along to the Trump campaign and said the campaign would have to pay it, or it could not use the arena.
The ensuing battle has infuriated the Trump team, which is accusing Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey of trying to block Trump's visit.
Trump slammed Frey in a tweet Tuesday, calling him a "lightweight." Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, accused Frey of "abusing his power."
The campaign's legal team sent the Target Center's parent, AEG Management, a letter Monday declaring that refusing to allow Trump to hold his event there would be a breach of contract. The letter said the campaign "will aggressively pursue all remedies available."
In a statement, Parscale accused Frey of extortion by "conjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security in an effort to block a scheduled Keep America Great rally."
"The radical Mayor of Minneapolis, @Jacob_Frey,is abusing his power in an attempt to block the President's supporters from seeing him speak on Thursday," Parscale tweeted Tuesday. "We refuse to be bullied by a left-winger resister & won't let him stifle the speech of @realDonaldTrump or his supporters!"
Trump retweeted his campaign manager and wrote: "The lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!"
Frey, an outspoken critic of Trump, responded to the president's tweet: "Yawn . . . to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors," Frey tweeted back.
After Trump announced his visit, Frey said while there was "no legal mechanism to prevent the president from visiting, his message of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis."

Televangelist: Trump risks losing 'mandate of heaven'
WASHINGTON — Televangelist Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, is the latest of President Trump's supporters to decry the decision to abandon the Kurdish allies in Syria as Turkish forces approach.
"I believe . . . the president of the United States is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen," Robertson said Monday on his CBN show, "The 700 Club."
In his unusually fiery criticism, Robertson said he was "appalled" by the president's decision, implying it was a betrayal to Kurdish allies. He went on to invoke the Armenian genocide, in which the Turkish government killed thousands of Armenian Christians amid World War I, and the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, ­assassinated last year in a ­Saudi consulate in Turkey.
"The president, who allowed Khashoggi to be cut into pieces, without any repercussions whatsoever, is now allowing the Christians and the Kurds to be massacred by the Turks," Robertson said. He also criticized Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan — with whom Trump has friendly rapport — as a "thug" and a "dictator."
"Now our government is saying you have a free hand to go into Syria, take out the democratic forces and take out the Kurds," Robertson said.

After heart attack, Sanders will slow pace of campaign
BURLINGTON, Vt. — Senator Bernie Sanders, a week after suffering a heart attack in Las Vegas, said Tuesday that he planned to slow his pace on the campaign trail and acknowledged that voters are likely to consider his health when deciding whether to vote for him.
Speaking to reporters outside his home following a visit to a cardiologist, Sanders gave no indication he was planning to drop out of the race and said he'd continue to campaign actively.
“We were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people," Sanders said. “I don't think I'm going to do that."
“I think we're going to change the nature of the campaign a bit," he added. “Make sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do."
Asked to clarify, he replied: “Probably not doing four rallies a day."
“Everything that happens everyday weighs on how people feel about you," he said. “And my own view is that — and I think it's the voters' view — you look at the totality of who a candidate is."

Is the President Betraying the Kurds?

Texto completo: Readers worry that America is putting the Kurds, who have helped us fight ISIS, at the mercy of Turkey, and that bloodshed will follow.
To the Editor:
Re "Backtracking on Syria, President Mixes Signals, Inciting a G.O.P. Furor" (front page, Oct. 8):
President Trump's statement on Sunday that he was willing to let Turkey enter the Kurdish parts of northern Syria by withdrawing American troops is deeply concerning. The United States has de facto betrayed the Kurds, who took upon themselves a large part of the fight against ISIS.
What Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has in store is not a peaceful resettlement of Syrians. Instead, under the pretext of Syrian refugees' resettlement, his forces will move in to destroy Kurdish fighters and civilians.
Mr. Trump later warned that he would obliterate Turkey's economy if the Kurds are attacked, but Mr. Erdogan simply needs American troops out of his way. He will pay little attention to Mr. Trump's words.
The United States is sending allies in the region -- and anywhere really -- the wrong message: We will use you until we are done with you, and then we will throw you to the wolves.
Besides that, it is likely that 10,000 captured ISIS fighters -- held by the Kurds -- will escape as the Kurdish forces turn to repel Turkey. Congratulations, Mr. Trump.
I am afraid that this is the beginning of a Turkish genocide against the Kurds. And Mr. Trump will be to blame. This is not how you conduct foreign policy.

To the Editor:
So now the Kurds will learn what many others have learned during the Trump presidency: Loyalty and cooperation will bring you a knife in the back. As has happened to many officials, cabinet officers and allies, this president will cast you aside on a whim. And he will do it with a sneer and a smear. His implication that the Kurds were fighting only for money is patently untrue.
While there are valid arguments to be made for lessening American involvement in the Middle East, this kind of precipitous action is the worst possible course, and will only increase bitterness against the United States. That bitterness will linger long after this gang has left the White House. But this president has always left his messes for others to clean up. This one may involve a lot of spilled blood.
Howard Schmitt
Green Tree, Pa.
To the Editor:
You report that President Trump may allow Turkey to invade Syrian Kurdistan, an autonomous democracy with more rights for women than any state in the Middle East save Israel. Beyond Israel, the Kurds have been our only true regional ally for decades, and now we are abandoning them -- for the third time.
The United States betrayed the Kurds after the first gulf war when we kowtowed to Saddam Hussein and permitted him to crush a Kurdish uprising, leading to the slaughter of thousands of civilians. And Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger betrayed them after pledging autonomy in exchange for supporting Israel and Iran against Soviet-backed Iraqis -- only to sell them out in 1975 after the shah cut a deal with Iraq.
Yet to this day the Kurds have fought with us for American interests. After this day, they may never fight with us again. Given bipartisan criticism since the decision, Mr. Trump appears to be backtracking. This is a positive development.
The Kurds are a secular, democratic force in a region where both are scarce qualities. They were with us in the invasion of Iraq. They have been with us against ISIS. Why aren't we with them?

To the Editor:
Re "Turkey's Plan to Move Refugees to Syria Is Dangerous," by Ryan Gingeras and Nick Danforth (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Oct. 7):
What is so unashamedly ignored in the reaction to Turkey's plans is the complete lack of assistance by the West to resettle the Syrian refugees. This is the root of the problem. President Trump's anti-immigrant and anti-refugee policies have closed the door to the United States, and Europe's fears of a Muslim invasion reaching back to the days of the Ottoman Empire remain, even if glossed over with more politically correct rationalizations.
Most people in the region believe, perhaps rightly, that if this were a problem of white, Christian refugees, the response would be very different. The longer we ignore the problem of resettlement and leave Turkey to carry the weight of millions of refugees alone, the more Turkey will act out and pockets of radicalization in the region will grow.
Resistance to Turkey's plans without offering alternatives is not a solution.
Kerime Akoglu

To the Editor:
In light of President Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria, which followed a phone call from Turkey's president, the path forward for now imperiled Kurdish forces in Syria is clear: Call Mr. Trump. He always does what the last guy on the phone wanted.

'Starters' set for new podcast at the Athletic

Texto completo: "The Starters" have found a new home in time for the NBA season. The popular quartet has joined the Athletic and will launch a new daily podcast next week. Tas Melas, Leigh Ellis, Trey Kerby and Phil Elder (professionally known as J.E. Skeets) were free agents after Turner did not renew their contract earlier this year following six years of hosting an irreverent show on NBA TV.
The podcast, titled "No Dunks," will be available outside the Athletic's paywall and feature the daily musings of the four hosts in their trademark quirky style. Before their run on TV, "The Starters" were among the first personalities to create a podcast and eventually joined Grantland's network before creating the TV show.
"It's definitely going to be what people know when it comes to our NBA coverage," Elder said in an interview. "We're getting back to our roots in podcasting and we're going to be talking every day about games, big stories and really the hilarity of the NBA."
The show will feature a healthy dose of the irreverence "The Starters" are known for - during NBA Summer League two years ago, the four hosts dressed as Las Vegas showgirls - as well as give the Athletic, a subscription sports website specializing in local team-by-team coverage, another platform to showcase the work of its stable of writers.
In addition to quirky humor, the hosts have plans to interview Athletic writers about their biggest NBA stories. "The idea is to draw from our newsroom and highlight the news from the Athletic that's driven by people on the front lines with these teams," said Nick Adler, the Athletic's general manager of audio.
"The Starters" have plans for additional podcast series to be available behind the Athletic's paywall that could feature trivia games, mail bags and long-form interviews with local writers.
Adler said the company now has more than 100 distinct podcasts with the hopes of reaching 120 by the end of the year. Last month, the Athletic launched another free daily podcast, "The Lead," a general interest show that focuses on a single story each episode, similar to "The Daily" from the New York Times. The format for many of its team-specific audio offerings is one free episode per week and another behind the paywall. (Episodes of "No Dunks" will include advertisements.)
"It's about reaching a broader audience," Adler said. "I think we see putting things outside the paywall as a way for more people to find out about the Athletic."
Terms of the deal allow "The Starters" to pursue a separate deal for video content, meaning they could partner with another outlet on a rebooted TV show or simply simulcast tapings of the podcast.

Memo Shows White House Official's Alarm at Trump-Zelensky Call; The presidents' conversation is at the heart of a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump abused his office

Texto completo: President Trump's July 25 phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart had so alarmed a White House official that he called a colleague at the CIA the next day to share his concerns, according to a memorandum.
The memorandum, now in the possession of congressional investigating committees, was written by the Central Intelligence Agency official who eventually would file a formal complaint under federal whistleblower laws about Mr. Trump's interactions with Ukraine. The memo was shared with Congress last week by the Intelligence Community's inspector general, Michael Atkinson, a congressional official said.
Mr. Trump's conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is at the heart of a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into whether the U.S. president abused his office by urging Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
The two-page memorandum appears to provide further evidence that the call prompted early and deep concerns among some White House aides as well as officials at U.S. intelligence agencies.
The memorandum's existence was first reported by Fox News.

The whistleblower's identity hasn't been made public, and the name of the White House official who contacted him on July 26 hasn't been released.
Mr. Trump has defended his conduct with Ukraine, and his administration has broadly rebuffed congressional demands for testimony and documents in the impeachment inquiry.
An attorney for the whistleblower didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. At least one additional whistleblower, who has firsthand knowledge of the circumstances around the call, has come forward, according to lawyers representing both that individual and the CIA officer.
In his formal complaint filed on August 12, the initial whistleblower—who acknowledged he didn't have firsthand knowledge—wrote that "multiple White House officials with direct knowledge" of the phone call said Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.
"The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call," he wrote.

Texto completo: President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Kurt Volker was aware of the effort to get Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
That contradicts the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine's testimony to Congress, when Volker said, "At no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden."
Giuliani told the Washington Examiner he disputed that Volker would’ve been unaware of this effort related to Ukraine and the Bidens — and the texts and testimony Volker provided indicate Volker was likely aware of what Giuliani was up to.

In his testimony, Volker distanced himself from the controversial July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump asked for a "favor" from Ukraine, urged Zelensky to look into any Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election, and suggested the Ukrainians investigate allegations of corruption related to the Bidens.
But Giuliani had publicly advocated for Ukraine to investigate allegations of corruption related to the Bidens for months, both on Twitter and in numerous television appearances and news articles, and Giuliani and Volker spoke multiple times.
A person familiar with Volker's entire congressional testimony told the Washington Examiner that Volker was not aware of every conversation that Giuliani was having to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, that Volker didn't take the Trump attorney's public commentary seriously, and Volker didn't see Giuliani's activities as part of an official U.S. effort.
“New President of Ukraine still silent on investigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 election and alleged Biden bribery of President Poroshenko,” Giuliani tweeted in June. “Time for leadership and investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused by Hillary and Obama people.”
Volker considered that tweet and similar comments from Giuliani venting as bluster, not actual pressure being put on Ukraine, said the person familiar with Volker's discussion with lawmakers.
“Volker’s answers sound contradictory,” Giuliani told the Washington Examiner in a text message. “First he says he didn’t know, then he says I told him? Don’t understand?”
Volker also testified that “Vice President Biden was never a topic of discussion” in his texts with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and U.S. chargé d’affaires to Ukraine William Taylor. A person who knew what Volker told Congress said that Biden may have been discussed by Volker, Sondland, and Taylor in meetings or by phone, but only in the context of all of them agreeing that the Ukrainian investigations shouldn't be about Biden specifically or about 2020.
The messages sent and received by Volker mention “investigations” four times — with an investigation into Burisma mentioned twice. Giuliani told the Washington Examiner “it was certainly understood,” including by Volker, that Giuliani wanted Burisma to be investigated in connection with Hunter Biden’s $50,000 per month position and because of Joe Biden’s actions in Ukraine threatening to withhold $1 billion in loans while pushing for then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin.
The Biden camp and many others have countered that Shokin was widely seen by the United States and Europe — and inside Ukraine — as ineffective, corrupt, and a hindrance to Ukraine’s progress. Ukraine’s Parliament removed Shokin in 2016.
Volker and Giuliani never talked directly about Biden after the July meeting, but Volker and Giuliani did continue to talk about Burisma, a person familiar with what Volker told the House Intelligence Committee said, and Volker believed the Biden issue and the Burisma issue were not synonymous.
Volker testified he didn’t listen in on the July 25 phone call, and he was unaware of Biden being mentioned until the transcript was released.
Volker testified he learned in May that Giuliani “planned to travel to Ukraine to look into” these issues. Giuliani’s proposed trip became national news at the time, with the New York Times reporting Giuliani wanted Ukraine to investigate 2016 and the Bidens and Burisma. Giuliani said that “we’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation.” Dozens of articles and television segments made it clear Giuliani was part of an effort to push Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.

“Explain to me why Biden shouldn’t be investigated if his son got millions from a Russian loving crooked Ukrainian oligarch while he was VP and point man for Ukraine,” Giuliani tweeted in May in response to a Democratic senator. “Ukrainians are investigating and your fellow Dems are interfering. Election is 17 months away. Let’s answer it now.”

Giuliani's calls for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens continued through the summer and the fall.
In the wake of Volker's testimony, Republicans pointed to his claim there was no quid pro quo related to withholding military aid to Ukraine, while Democrats pointed to Volker’s assertion that Biden’s actions in Ukraine weren’t improperly influenced by his son’s business dealings.

New Problems with Elizabeth Warren's Inequality Math; Just because the New York Times believes a tax claim doesn't mean readers should.

Texto completo: Faced with the collapse of their argument that income inequality has risen dramatically in recent decades, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's favorite economists have come back with an even more audacious claim. And some members of the press corps seem eager to buy it.
"The Rich Really Do Pay Lower Taxes Than You," asserts a New York Times headline above a column from David Leonhardt. The column contains a related assertion that is perhaps even more striking:
For the first time on record, the 400 wealthiest Americans last year paid a lower total tax rate — spanning federal, state and local taxes — than any other income group, according to newly released data.
Since the IRS hasn't yet published complete official statistics for 2018, there would seem to be grounds for skepticism. But Mr. Leonhardt does his best to credentialize the two controversial academics making the claim:
The data here come from the most important book on government policy that I've read in a long time — called "The Triumph of Injustice," to be released next week. The authors are Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, both professors at the University of California, Berkeley, who have done pathbreaking work on taxes. Saez has won the award that goes to the top academic economist under age 40, and Zucman was recently profiled on the cover of Bloomberg BusinessWeek magazine as "the wealth detective."
Sen. Warren frequently cites the work of Messrs. Saez and Zucman and relies on their estimates to claim that her new wealth tax will raise close to $3 trillion over a decade. As for the Times detective, he suspects a particular response to the latest claim from the two economists. Writes Mr. Leonhardt:
I already know what some critics will say about these arguments — that the rich will always figure out a way to avoid taxes.
Sure, but what many critics across the philosophical spectrum are also saying is that Messrs. Saez and Zucman are simply wrong in their income and tax calculations.
David Splinter of Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation writes in a new paper that , just as you would expect, the rich in America do pay higher tax rates than the poor, according to a range of sources:
U.S. federal taxes are progressive, as shown by Congressional Budget Office and Tax Policy Center estimates, with average tax rates increasing with income. In fact, the OECD estimated that the U.S. has the most progressive household taxes among developed countries. Moreover, the 2017 tax reform is expected to have little effect on overall tax progressivity (Tax Policy Center, 2017; Joint Committee on Taxation, 2019). But Saez and Zucman (2019) argue that average tax rates are nearly equal over the income distribution. To examine this claim, this paper compares other estimates of average tax rates by income group, all of which suggest a high degree of progressivity. Three issues are found to bias the average tax rates presented in Saez and Zucman (2019). After correcting for these issues, their estimates align more closely with other estimates that show U.S. taxes are progressive.
Mr. Splinter documents the Saez-Zucman errors at length, and he's not the only one finding flaws in the work of Sen. Warren's favorite economists. Former Obama Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman took to Twitter this week to point out that U.S. high-income earners pay at a higher rate than low-income earners, both before and after accounting for state and local taxation.
Economic historian Phil Magness finds an implicit rebuttal of the new Warren-friendly math in data from the Congressional Budget Office:
The CBO's figures diverge sharply from the findings in the New York Times report. Whereas Saez and Zucman place the top 1 percent's total tax burden (federal, state, and local) at around 30 percent of its income in 2016 (the latest year available for comparison in both series), the CBO's estimate for federal taxes alone is actually higher at 33.3 percent.
A similar inconsistency may be seen at the bottom of the distribution. According to the CBO, the bottom quintile (20 percent) of earners paid just 1.7 percent of their income on federal taxes. Saez and Zucman's numbers also include state and local taxation, but their estimates for the poorest segment's overall tax burden leap to nearly 25 percent. While state and local tax burdens do skew somewhat in a regressive direction, other data suggest this spike is entirely implausible.
Mr. Magness also cites work from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy that undermines the new claim from the Warrenistas. He also details some of the flaws, beginning with the calculation of income and taxes among those in the lowest income bracket:
First, as Zucman recently admitted on Twitter, their series removes the refundable portion of the earned income tax credit (EITC) from the bottom quintile's federal tax burden. He claims this was done to separate the alleged "muddle" of transfer payments from the mix when looking at tax data, yet this produces highly misleading results.
Maybe one of Sen. Warren's opponents at next week's Democratic debate will challenge her on the inequality muddle at the heart of her economic policy.

Texto completo: A judge ordered President Trump to turn over eight years of tax returns, but the case raises constitutional issues that could end up in the Supreme Court.
On Monday, a federal judge issued a ruling that effectively ordered President Trump's accountants to turn over eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney.
Mr. Trump's lawyers immediately appealed the decision, and an appeals court temporarily blocked the ruling. So for now, the president can keep his financial information secret.
But the case raises sweeping constitutional issues that could reach the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Trump argued that sitting presidents are immune from criminal investigations, a position that has not been tested in a court.
In a 75-page decision, Judge Victor Marrero of Manhattan federal court called that argument an "extraordinary claim" that was "repugnant to the nation's governmental structure and constitutional values."
Here are five takeaways:
Presidents are not immune from criminal inquiries, the judge says
The legal showdown started in late August, when the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., subpoenaed Mr. Trump's accounting firm for his personal and corporate tax returns dating to 2011.
Mr. Vance has been investigating whether any New York State laws were broken when Mr. Trump and his company reimbursed the president's former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, for payments he made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who had said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president denies the affair.
In their lawsuit seeking to block the subpoena, Mr. Trump's lawyers argued that the investigation itself is unconstitutional. They asserted that presidents cannot be subject to the burden of investigations, especially from local prosecutors who may use the criminal process for political gain.
Judge Marrero rejected that argument wholesale. "Neither the Constitution nor the history surrounding the founding support as broad an interpretation of presidential immunity as the one now espoused by the President," the judge wrote.
Presidents might not even be immune from criminal charges
Federal prosecutors are barred from charging a sitting president with a crime because the Justice Department has decided that presidents have temporary immunity while they are in office. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was following that direction when he said in May that presidents could not be charged.
That position is outlined in two Justice Department memos written during the Nixon and Clinton administrations, citing the burden that a barrage of investigations would put on the president. But Judge Marrero called it into question. He said the memos rely on "suppositions, practicalities and public policy" as well as dire pictures of hypothetical scenarios -- and not on an actual case.
Either way, those memos -- themselves interpretations of the Constitution -- do not bind the hands of a local prosecutor such as Mr. Vance. Still, the question of whether a president can face state criminal charges also has never been tested, the judge noted.
The question could reach the United States Supreme Court
Mr. Trump's lawyers quickly appealed Judge Marrero's decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. Depending on what happens there, the losing side ultimately could try to take the case up to the Supreme Court.
The Department of Justice said on Monday that it planned to weigh in on the case as well.
That does not mean the high court would agree to take the case. But if it does, it could set a sweeping new constitutional precedent about presidential immunity. Did the framers intend for impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate to be the only vehicle for handling any wrongdoing by the president? Should prosecutors with possible political bias have the unfettered ability to disrupt a presidency? Is no American above the law?
Even if the district attorney wins, the president's tax returns would not be made public
The president has fought multiple attempts to obtain copies of his tax returns, which he said during the 2016 campaign that he would make public but has since refused to disclose.
Mr. Trump's lawyers have sued to block attempts by congressional Democrats to access his tax returns and financial records, and by New York lawmakers to release state tax returns to congressional committees. They also successfully challenged a California law requiring presidential primary candidates to release their tax returns.
But even if Mr. Vance prevails and obtains Mr. Trump's tax returns, they would not automatically become public. The documents would be protected by the rules governing grand jury secrecy unless they became part of a criminal case.
Time is running out for Mr. Vance
Aside from the constitutional question, the practicalities of the investigation are at stake. Mr. Vance has accused the president of trying to delay the subpoena until the statute of limitations on any possible crimes run out. The president's lawyers have denied this.
Mr. Vance's office has been investigating whether the Trump Organization falsely accounted for the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen as a legal expense. It was unclear why the office has attempted to obtain Mr. Trump's personal financial records as part of that inquiry.

Perry focused on energy, aide says

Texto completo: Energy Secretary Rick Perry encouraged President Trump to speak to Ukraine's president — but on energy and economic issues, Perry's spokeswoman said Sunday, addressing Perry's role in a telephone call that is at the center of a congressional impeachment probe for Trump.
"Secretary Perry absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development," Perry's Energy Department spokeswoman, Shaylyn Hynes, said in an e-mail.
Hynes's remark comes as Perry becomes the latest administration official drawn into inquiries in a House impeachment probe of Trump. Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in the July 25 call to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, sparking a whistle-blower complaint and now the impeachment inquiry.
Trump on Friday evening told House Republicans that it was Perry who had set up the July call with Ukraine, according to a person familiar with Trump's new comments who was granted anonymity to discuss the private conference call.
But Trump did not suggest that Perry had anything to do with the pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, or a US holdup in military aid to the country, the person said. Trump's remarks on the late Friday call were first reported by Axios.
Perry, the former governor of Texas and up to now a lower-profile but active member of Trump's Cabinet, has made repeated trips to Ukraine and met often with Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky. Perry and his agency say his involvement with Ukraine was part of US policy, predating the Trump administration, to increase US natural gas, coal, and other supplies to Eastern Europe to lessen Russia's control of the region's energy market.

Anti-Muslim group plans to host gala at Mar-a-Lago
An anti-Muslim organization plans to host its annual gala at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's private club in Palm Beach, Fla., in November.
ACT for America claims to be the nation's largest grass-roots national security organization, and is considered the largest anti-Muslim group in the United States, according to the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks such groups.
Michelle Malkin, a conservative columnist, author, and television commentator, will be the keynote speaker, according to an invitation posted on the organization's website. Standard tickets are $1,500 per person and premium tickets, which put attendees at the head tables, are $2,500. Premium tickets are sold out, according to the website.
“I don't think it should occur," said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization. “It's really a violation of the US Constitution to funnel funds from a hate group directly to the president and his business," he said, referring to the emoluments clauses of the Constitution.
In an e-mail Sunday, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said, without elaboration, “This event will absolutely not be taking place at Mar-a-Lago." She did not respond to additional questions.

Trump to hold election eve rally against La. governor
President Trump is heading to Louisiana ahead of Saturday's election, for a last-minute rally aimed at peeling support from Governor John Bel Edwards and keeping the Democratic incumbent from a primary win.
Trump tweeted Sunday about the get-out-the-vote event, saying he's working to elect "a great new Republican Governor!" He hasn't endorsed one of the GOP candidates, Ralph Abraham and Eddie Rispone.
The president's event will be held Friday night in Lake Charles, in southwest Louisiana.
In Louisiana, all candidates run against each other, regardless of party, on the same primary ballot. Polls show Edwards well in the lead, ahead of his two main Republican challengers, within striking distance of topping 50 percent and reaching a primary win.
Trump's visit follows a GOP voter rally in Kenner featuring Vice President Mike Pence.

Former president Jimmy Carter 'feels fine' after fall
Former president Jimmy Carter fell Sunday at his home in Georgia and needed some stitches above his brow, but "feels fine," his spokeswoman said.
Deanna Congileo said in an e-mail that the 39th president fell Sunday in Plains and received stitches. Carter turned 95 on Tuesday, becoming the first US president to reach that milestone.
Congileo said Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, who is 92, were eager to be at a Habitat for Humanity build in Nashville. The opening ceremony for the project was scheduled for Sunday evening and it runs through Friday.

Texto completo: We're all familiar by now with the reasons advanced for why elected Republicans shrivel like dry houseplants whenever they are asked to distance themselves from the president. They fear primary challengers. They dread his Twitter wrath. They like the judges. All true as far as it goes. And we might add that partisanship has reached radioactive levels — what with the siloing of information sources, the “big sort” in geographical choices, and so forth.
But pause for a moment over the people who work directly for Trump. Why do so few of them quit?
The turnover rate in this administration has set records, but with the exception of James Mattis and John Bolton, remarkably few have walked out. (For what it's worth, Trump contends that he fired both Mattis and Bolton.)
After Bolton's departure, Trump crowed that “we have 15 candidates” for national security adviser. “Everyone wants it badly, as you can imagine.” And why would that be? Because it's key to keeping America safe? Because it carries great responsibility and opportunities to make the world more stable and secure? No, “It's great because it's a lot of fun to work with Donald Trump.”
Thus does the job of national security adviser to the president of the United States get transformed into a game show slot.
The truth is that Trump is among the worst bosses in the world. He has tantrums, hurls insults and maintains a level of chaos that makes a Tilt-A-Whirl seem calm. But none of that seems to faze Trump's appointees, who have frequently accepted humiliation at his hands.
A recent New York Times account of Trump's behind-the-scenes fulminations about immigration illustrate the pattern. Dressing down his Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, Trump demanded that she shoot down drones without legal authority. When she pushed back, he sneered: “Kirstjen, you didn't hear me the first time, honey. Shoot 'em down. Sweetheart, just shoot 'em out of the sky, OK?”
Bob Woodward's book “Fear” offers similar examples. He called his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, “mentally retarded. He's this dumb Southerner.” After Rudy Giuliani turned in a TV appearance that Trump judged insufficiently sycophantic, he jibed: “Rudy, you're a baby. I've never seen a worse defense of me in my life. They took your diaper off right there. You're like a little baby that needed to be changed. When are you going to be a man?”
He told Wilbur Ross that he didn't trust him to negotiate because “you're past your prime.” He called Reince Priebus “weak” and gave him the nickname “Reincy.”
If they won't even stand up straight and assert their own dignity, it's not surprising that they shrink from vindicating the honor of the United States and the rule of law. If more of Trump's people had resigned rather than silently assented to a presidency that displayed contempt for law, Trump might not be facing impeachment now.
Again and again, those surrounding Trump have taken to subterfuge (Gary Cohn snatching papers off the Resolute desk), or anonymous New York Times op-eds to proclaim their patriotic role in restraining the wilder impulses of the commander in chief.
But they do not protest that this administration is lawless. They don't resign. They don't go public. They wait to be fired and then insulted, and thereby reinforce the president's perception that there are no guardrails.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump says that "like every American," he deserves to meet his accuser ("the so-called 'Whistleblower' ") from the intelligence community. Compared with his earlier statement calling the anonymous whistleblower “almost a spy” and making a thinly veiled reference to execution, the president’s most recent request seems tame — almost reasonable.
In fact, it is anything but. As an attorney who represents courageous individuals who come forward to report fraud in a range of industries, I know just how essential confidentiality is to guarding the safety of whistleblowers and the integrity of the reporting process, and just how dangerous a precedent revealing the whistleblower’s identity could set.
The president is not entitled to “meet my accuser” any more than the general public is entitled to rule on the whistleblower’s credibility.
Retaliation and intimidation risks
As more information emerges on Trump's attempts to get Ukraine to do political favors for him, that notion seems to be up for debate even outside Trump's Twitter account. The New York Times, ignoring the chilling effect on future whistleblowers, revealed details about this whistleblower's employment history.
When faced with a backlash, Executive Editor Dean Baquet responded that “the president himself has called the whistleblower’s account a ‘political hack job,’ ” so the Times “wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible. ” Others have echoed the idea that revealing details about the whistleblower would somehow add to the credibility of his accusations.
It’s time to put this idea to rest. Revealing details about the national security whistleblower’s employment history will not further inform the public or help the government determine whether his allegations are credible. The identity of the whistleblower has nothing to do with the credibility of his information.
Consider the various programs that reward and protect whistleblowers who come forward with evidence of fraud in matters involving government agencies. These programs explicitly account for the vulnerability of the person reporting the fraud. Whistleblowers risk retaliation and intimidation, both from within their company and from other potential employers who might blacklist them — especially when they report misconduct at high levels of an organization.
Nobody gets to 'face' their accuser
Maintaining confidentiality is crucial to protecting whistleblowers from threats to their safety and from being ostracized. It is also a way to ensure that potential whistleblowers are not discouraged by these risks and to incentivize them to come forward.
For this reason, the majority of federal whistleblower programs allow people to file reports of fraud under seal. The whistleblower’s confidentiality is preserved even as the government investigates the claim.
How Democrats should impeach Trump: A searing constitutional duty, a plan from two realists
At no time during the government’s investigation into a company or individuals accused of wrongdoing is the target of the investigation entitled or allowed to “face” the accuser. Nor is the whistleblower allowed to discuss the matter with anyone other than his or her attorney.
As part of its investigation, the government may confidentially interview the whistleblower, interview other witnesses or try to corroborate the report with other evidence. The emphasis throughout the investigation is on the credibility of the whistleblower’s allegations, rather than the identity of the person reporting wrongdoing.
Focus on identity is meant to distract
Intelligence community whistleblowers are in an especially precarious position. They have far fewer retaliation and safety protections than private sector whistleblowers. And the heightened media attention often makes them more vulnerable to threats from members of the public.
Case in point: Two Trump supporters offered a $50,000 reward to anyone who could provide further details of the whistleblower’s identity. As a result, the whistleblower’s lawyer reported that his client feared for his safety.
Keep the priorities straight: Pay attention to what Ukraine whistleblower reported, not motivations for speaking out
I know from experience that obsession with the identity of the whistleblower rather than the evidence supporting the allegations is a common tactic used by those accused of fraud. De-emphasizing the national security whistleblower’s identity and focusing on the evidence that results from his information should be our collective priority.
The House Ways and Means Committee is now investigating a federal whistleblower's report of improper influence at the Treasury Department in connection with a mandatory audit of Trump's taxes, and other intelligence officials are coming forward on the Ukraine allegations. We need to show these and future whistleblowers that we can get this right.
Debating the merits of revealing the national security whistleblower’s identity distracts from the investigation and the evidence it develops. That plays right into the hands of those seeking to detract from the gravity of the accusations against the president.
We should not fall into this trap.

Leonard Pitts: My, my, how the times have changed

Texto completo: You may, if you are old enough, recall a TV actor named Foster Brooks.
<img class="size-full wp-image-2657490" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Leonard-Pitts-Color.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="193" />
He was a guest star on such classics of boomer kitsch as “The Monkees,” “The Munsters” and “The Mod Squad.” But if you do remember him, it’s likely for one thing only: his imitation of inebriation. Brooks made his slurring, stammering “funny drunk act” a TV staple, back when drunks were still considered, well … funny.
To recall his career is to marvel at what a difference a generation or two makes.
That era produced another TV trope that, in hindsight, seems equally bizarre: the funny sexual harasser. A hundred times, you saw it: the lecherous boss chasing the nubile secretary around the desk. A hundred times, it didn’t register as anything but a joke.
And again, the memory makes you marvel at how the times, they have changed.
In their new book, “She Said,” Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, The New York Times reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment story, remind us that early October contains three anniversaries, each a milestone of the progress we have — and have not — made in learning to take sexual assault seriously.
October 7, 2016: The Washington Post releases the now-infamous “Access Hollywood” video where presidential candidate Donald Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. “And when you’re a star, they let you do it,” he says. “Grab them by the p—y. You can do anything.”
October 5, 2018: The Senate advances the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court despite a credible allegation that, as a drunken teenager, he attempted to rape a then-classmate, research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford.
Between those two dates — October 5, 2017 — The Times published its report on the film producer Weinstein and his alleged assaults on women in his professional circle, including the actor Ashley Judd. Later, Gwyneth Paltrow and Annabella Sciorra would also number themselves among the accusers.
The story opened a floodgate. By the time the wave of accusations crested, it had splashed dozens of famous men: Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Mario Batali, Louis C.K., George H.W. Bush and Al Franken among them. Once-silent women found their voices under a hashtag — #MeToo.
“She Said” recounts the journalistic detective work that led to the breakthrough. It’s a compelling story that leaves one pleased to see the good guys — the good “gals,” really — get a win. But let us be clear on the limitations of that win. Indeed, the convergence of those anniversaries speaks eloquently to America’s ongoing irresolution on matters of sexual harassment and assault. Sure, Weinstein is facing charges, but Kavanaugh went to the Supreme Court, and Trump, to the White House.
Still, the story Twohey and Kantor broke changed gender politics. Predictably, there came a backlash, increasing numbers of male managers reportedly refusing to mentor female subordinates. That would seem to open them to civil sanctions. It will be fun to watch one of them try to defend his sexism in court, perhaps before a judge with lady parts.
Elsewhere, folks just want to know, where is the line? Is it allowed to tell a co-worker you find her attractive? Can you share — or laugh at — a bawdy joke? “So much was suddenly open to question,” write Kantor and Twohey.
And it is. And that is surely frustrating and difficult.
On the other hand, some of us remember when the boss chased the secretary while the laugh track howled. We thought nothing of it. Now people are wondering what’s acceptable?
Maybe that’s not the worst thing in the world.

I worked in the White House during an impeachment. Trump's team isn't ready for it.

Texto completo: The period in early December 1998 just before the House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton has been on my mind lately. I've been thinking about those few weeks, the most harrowing of my career, ever since House Democrats announced they would launch a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. While I may not be rooting for Trump, I have a keen sense of what his staff is going through right now.
An impeachment inquiry exacerbates all the stresses and anxieties that already exist in any White House. The media magnifies the slightest development; dire predictions of imminent demise are commonplace. As press secretary -- a perilous job during normal times -- I personally felt the pressure to not make a mistake from the podium, with every word I spoke analyzed for both real and hidden meanings.
Throughout, members of the press breathed down our necks, sniffing for any material that could help them characterize "the mood in the White House." John Podesta, the chief of staff, had made clear, using quite colorful language, that he didn't want people talking about impeachment. Not in meetings, not at the proverbial water cooler and especially not out in public, even with family and friends. It was difficult to go through this period always being watched, and always pretending it wasn't happening.
Despite Podesta's admonition, the few staffers working on impeachment -- mostly lawyers and communications staff like me -- were constantly being asked what was going on. Everyone lived off rumors and secondhand information, studying the body language of the president and senior staffers. Several times a day, colleagues dropped by my office to "see how I was doing." No one got much sleep. Once, I remember working until about 4 a.m., getting about an hour's rest, and then my wife suddenly waking me up in the shower. I had been standing under the water, fast asleep.
We all developed a certain gallows humor. Bad jokes flew around: "If you see the vice president, tell him it looks like he's lost weight. He'll remember you when he starts filling out his staff." One memorable flight back from the Middle East was punctuated by phone calls in the Air Force One conference room, about Republicans we were losing on the impeachment vote. One staffer yelled out, "We've lost Jack Quinn," to groans. "Ben Gilman is now a yes on impeachment!" another added. I shouted, "We just lost Dick Gephardt!" -- the Democratic leader in the House. That got a big laugh.
Perhaps the defining aspect of this period was its sheer unpredictability. The best way to describe the experience is by recalling the day the president was impeached: Dec. 19, 1998. It was as normal a Saturday as you could expect, knowing that the vote was coming. We knew the outcome, and we had a strategy.
We would say this was all partisan, and the president would stay focused on the people's business. Simple. People in the administration believed it, and that was our message for that day.
Then, just before noon, Bob Livingston, R-La., the new speaker, went to the House floor and said he'd had an affair, and that the only honorable thing he could do was resign. Which he did, right there in the middle of the debate.
Our simple message was suddenly trumped by an even simpler one: Do something wrong, get caught, resign.
I estimated that we had about 15 minutes before everyone caught their breath and the television pundits started the drumbeat for the president, too, to resign.
I sprinted to the Oval Office to get President Clinton's reaction. While waiting for other staffers to arrive, I asked him not what we should say, but what he thought, and scribbled it down. Ten minutes after the meeting, I went to White House driveway and read it aloud, word for word.
That clear statement -- that it was wrong for Livingston to resign and that the politics of personal destruction had to stop -- seemed to break the fever before it fully spiked. Because the media largely focused on the president's plea for Livingston to reconsider, we avoided a full-scale outcry for him to resign.
After that, I dashed to a State of the Union planning meeting.
I remember sitting there, discussing issues like health care, education and gun safety, and thinking, we are going to get through this. Then, 10 minutes in, I was pulled away to meet with the national security staff. During the lead-up to the impeachment vote, we were about 10 days into a military action against Iraq. The military action was complete, and the national security team needed the president to announce it that evening. "You've got to be kidding me," I said. "Just last week, we launched this strike and said it had nothing to do with impeachment. Now you want to announce we won the war on impeachment day?" I politely inquired if we couldn't find more targets to hit. The national security team didn't think that was especially funny.
We had no choice but to handle what some might call a communications problem: delivering opposing messages from the president back to back. First, we had 150 members of Congress stand with the president on the South Lawn of the White House for a partisan pep rally. The impeachment was all about politics, Democrats are good, Republicans are not -- that was the gist.
Then, in the time it took to carry the presidential podium no more than 100 yards away, we moved inside to deliver a slightly different message. Flanked by America's military leaders, the president declared that we were not a country of Republicans and Democrats, but of Americans, bound together by patriotism.
He proclaimed the military action successfully completed, and he departed, leaving me to explain how these two messages -- us against them, and we are all in this together -- could fit.
At the end of this long day, I went back to the office. Waiting for me was a close colleague with two cold beers. We sat down, and I'll always remember what he said next: "You know, except for getting impeached, we had a pretty good day."
We survived the process because we were disciplined about keeping the president out of the impeachment debate. We had an aggressive and experienced legal, communications and political team. Most importantly, we never turned on one another. While being in the foxhole was never comfortable, it was comforting to know who was in there with me.
My sense is this White House has none of these things. Their lawyers have yet to develop a legal theory to extricate the president from his predicament and instead seem to be devoting all their energies to stonewalling Congress. No "war room" has been set up to plan the response -- any such operation "would be (an) overreaction on our part," Kellyanne Conway blithely told The New York Times. The political and communications infrastructure is nonexistent, with internal factions vying for control. In the meantime, the official response to developments seems to be whatever the first thing the president thinks to say. Everything seems to run from Trump's Twitter account.
Even if they had everything prepared, I still don't think they know what is about to hit them. With no signs of a strategy, and with a loose-cannon president, I can only wish this White House the best of luck. It will need it.

Texto completo: When truth dissolves anything is possible.
The message of much of Kremlin propaganda is not to showcase Russia as a beacon of progress, but to prove that Western politics is just as rotten as President Vladimir Putin's. We may have corruption, the argument goes, but so does the West; our democracy is rigged, but so is theirs.
The latest scandal surrounding President Trump and his dealings with Ukraine is, for this reason, a godsend for the Kremlin: The son of an American presidential candidate is suspected of using his father's reputation to get himself a $ 50,000-a-month job at a Ukrainian gas company; the president of the United States is accused of acting like a geopolitical gangster, extorting kompromat about a political rival. American politics have become enmeshed in Russian and Ukrainian corruption, and much about the Trump administration seems pulled from the playbook of a post-Soviet kleptocracy. The Kremlin couldn't have put together a better script.
As I follow the news coming from America at my home in Britain, the political culture and language in the thing once known as "the West" reminds me of my years in Moscow, where I lived in the first decade of the 21st century. Perhaps in nothing more so than in its relationship to the truth.
The media manipulation of the early Putin years didn't try to convince you of a fabricated version of "truth." Instead, it worked by seeding doubt and confusion, evoking a world so full of endlessly intricate conspiracies that you, the little guy, had no chance to work out or change. Instead of conspiracy theories being used to merely buttress an ideology as under Communist rule, a conspiratorial worldview replaced ideology as a way to explain the world, encouraging the public to trust nothing and yearn for a strong leader to guide it through the murk -- a tactic that's as common in Washington these days as in Moscow.
Seeing all rules and norms as mere facades for a vast conspiracy also legitimizes getting around them to exercise unlimited corruption. The cynicism implicit in conspiratorial thinking frees you up to indulge in anything you want. Mr. Trump was, like many American businessmen, attracted to Russia in the 1990s and early 2000s, a time when rules -- both logical and financial -- were suspended. Throwing off the constraints of factuality goes together with throwing off political and legal norms, which for Mr. Trump means, among other things, turning his private lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, into a private diplomat.
There's a dark joy in being released from the constraints of legality and factuality, something Mr. Putin grasps well. When the Russian president went on international TV during the annexation of Crimea to smirk and say that there were no Russian soldiers on the peninsula, and that the soldiers the world could see were just locals who had bought Russian military uniforms, he wasn't so much lying as demonstrating that he doesn't care at all about facts and, by extension, the rules governing his behavior.
Mr. Trump, too, has doubled down since it was revealed he was exerting his own pressure on Ukraine. Despite all the protestations of State Department officials and Ukrainian journalists who painstakingly show that the accusations that Joe Biden helped fire a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son are specious, Mr. Trump and his allies have responded by repeating them. The president even suggested that Mr. Biden should be investigated for alleged corruption in China, too.
Mr. Giuliani has gone on cable news to spin an ever-greater web of insinuation, dropping in dark questions about whether Hillary Clinton's email server might be in Ukraine or why Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign manager Paul Manafort was jailed because of evidence of his financial impropriety there. Watching clips of Mr. Giuliani, I am reminded of the catchphrase of Russia's most prominent current affairs TV host as he twirls from one conspiracy to another: "A coincidence? I don't think so."
This attitude is what makes Kremlin propaganda today different from its Soviet predecessor. The Soviets tried to make their lies sound factual. Even their disinformation in the West was meant to feel foolproof: For example, the 1980s campaign to show that the C.I.A. had invented AIDS was carefully curated through Soviet-controlled medical conferences. When President Ronald Reagan called out the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr. Gorbachev feigned horror at the idea that the Soviet Union would stoop to lies. Today, when the Kremlin pushes conspiracies claiming Americans invented Ebola or Zika, these stories are thrown online with no serious attempt to make them sound believable. Their aim as much to confuse as to convince. And there's no shame in being caught lying.
In my search for how and why the future arrived first in Russia, I've interviewed political strategists in Moscow and found their approaches anticipated what we have come to term "populism" in the West today. One spin doctor, Gleb Pavlovsky, who was a senior strategist in Mr. Putin's 2000 election victory, described how he was faced with a landscape where the ideologies of both communism and democratic capitalism had collapsed; the old social roles and political categories meant nothing. In order to win, he had to collect different interest groups, many of which resented one another, but which all felt they had lost out in the 1990s, and unite them around a vague feeling that they constituted a "majority" and "a people." Decades later, the Trump campaign likewise united different interest groups, which felt they had been "left behind," around vague feelings of grievance against "the establishment."
Mr. Putin skillfully managed to get rid of the old oligarchs by claiming he was cleaning up elite corruption -- only to replace it with his own corrupt elite. Mr. Trump and his supporters claim the president is draining the swamp, just as he replaces it with his cronies: Mr. Giuliani, his family, whatever allies and backers are willing to work with him in Washington or Kiev or wherever else.
Mr. Pavlovsky told me last year that the West is reaching a stage of post-ideological development similar to the one Russia reached decades earlier: "The Cold War split global civilization into two alternative forms, both of which promised people a better future," he said. "The Soviet Union undoubtedly lost. But then there appeared a strange Western utopia with no alternative, ruled over by economic technocrats who could do no wrong. Then that collapsed."
In Eastern Europe, communism once presented an ideology that claimed to be evidence-based and rational, guiding humanity toward a better future. In the West, the alternative was a vision of capitalism that would inevitably improve the world. Both have now collapsed.
But without an ideology that looks toward the future, there are no goals of progress. Instead of offering a coherent vision for the future, you peddle in nostalgia; you explain the world not through ideas but conspiracies. Instead of being a beacon of hope, you accuse everyone else of being just as corrupt as you are. We are all post-Soviet now.

Texto completo: Un segundo oficial de inteligencia está considerando presentar una queja y testificar ante el Congreso sobre sus preocupaciones sobre los tratos del presidente Trump con Ucrania, informó el New York Times el viernes, citando a dos personas informadas sobre el asunto.
The Times informó que el oficial tiene más información directa sobre la situación que involucra a Trump que el primer denunciante, cuya queja presentada en agosto ayudó a provocar la investigación de juicio político contra Trump que la Cámara demócrata lanzó la semana pasada, reporta The Hill.
Según los informes, el Inspector General de la Comunidad de Inteligencia Michael Atkinson entrevistó a la persona para corroborar las afirmaciones originales del denunciante.
Trump ha criticado repetidamente al primer denunciante no identificado, cuestionando sus motivos y acusando que son “partidistas”.
Mientras tanto, el Director interino de Inteligencia Nacional, Joseph Maguire, dijo al Congreso a fines de septiembre que creía que el denunciante hizo lo “correcto” al presentar su queja.
El denunciante presentó su queja por preocupaciones sobre la llamada telefónica de Trump al presidente de Ucrania a fines de julio en la que Trump presionó al líder extranjero para que iniciara una investigación sobre el exvicepresidente Joe Biden , un destacado candidato presidencial demócrata.
Una transcripción aproximada de la llamada emitida por la Casa Blanca dada a conocer la semana pasada, corroboró varios puntos clave en la queja del denunciante relacionada con la conversación de Trump con el líder ucraniano.
El denunciante original no tenía conocimiento directo de la conversación, pero escribió que obtuvo información de “múltiples funcionarios de la Casa Blanca con conocimiento directo”.
El presidente Trump y otros republicanos han atacado la credibilidad de la persona.
Mientras tanto, los demócratas dijeron que el testimonio de Atkinson el viernes ante la Cámara confirmó detalles importantes del llamado de Trump con el presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelensky .
“Exploramos con el Inspector General (IG) a través de documentos y testimonios las razones por las cuales encontró que la denuncia de denunciantes era urgente y creíble”, dijo el presidente del Comité de Inteligencia, Adam Schiff en un comunicado. “Ahora que todos hemos visto el registro de llamadas, podemos ver que la determinación del IG fue correcta en ambos aspectos “.
El Times informó el viernes que no estaba claro si Atkinson informó a los legisladores que el segundo funcionario estaba pensando en presentar una queja.
The Hill se comunicó con la oficina del inspector general de la comunidad de inteligencia para obtener comentarios y aún no ha recibido respuesta.

Texto completo: A clinical and focused approach is called for in the face of Trump's theatrics and distraction.
President Trump and House Republicans are trying to cast the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Adam Schiff of California, as the lead villain in a partisan impeachment reality show. The president has road-tested some nicknames, called for Mr. Schiff's resignation and accused him of treason, and is now trying to spin out a new conspiracy theory, suggesting that Mr. Schiff "probably helped write" the whistle-blower complaint. House Republicans have indicated that they intend to force a vote to condemn Mr. Schiff when they return from recess.
But in all the ways that matter for this particular moment, Mr. Schiff seems to be coming off as the opposite of a slick political operator bent on betraying the country.
For starters, he was thrust into this role largely by happenstance. Jerry Nadler, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, has been pursuing an impeachment investigation for some time. But his efforts have largely fallen flat with both the public and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.
News of a whistle-blower complaint about Mr. Trump's July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine changed all of that. The drama that ensued put Mr. Schiff in the driver's seat -- not because the call specifically addressed intelligence matters, but because the whistle-blower just happened to work in the intelligence community. A whistle-blower from the State Department with access to similar witnesses and facts could just as easily have submitted the complaint to a different committee.
Mr. Schiff is a stickler for process. When the whistle-blower approached him and his staff, they did precisely the right thing: They directed the whistle-blower to obtain legal counsel and file the complaint through the appropriate channels laid out in the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act.
Mr. Schiff went public only after receiving a letter from the intelligence community inspector general indicating the acting director of national intelligence had not followed process requirements outlined in the law. The president can concoct all the conspiracy theories he wants, and Lindsey Graham and others may pick up the tune, but Mr. Schiff played it by the book.
Speaker Pelosi tagged Mr. Schiff as the lead on gathering facts on the Ukraine issue in anticipation of an impeachment vote. For now, Mr. Nadler has stepped into the background -- eventually, any articles of impeachment would go through his committee first. But Mr. Schiff is quarterbacking speedy efforts of his own staff and also two other committees, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform, that Ms. Pelosi has directed to assist in the effort.
Mr. Schiff is setting the tone and strategy of the inquiry, quickly setting up depositions of key witnesses and warning the administration that obstruction and delay could form the basis for a distinct article of impeachment similar to one approved by the Judiciary Committee against Richard Nixon in 1974.
In short, Mr. Schiff is the man of the moment -- and, without knowing it, he has been preparing for it for the past two years. As chairman, he followed Devin Nunes of California, whose handling of the committee's Russia investigation was specious and included cloak-and-dagger visits to the White House.
Mr. Schiff was vocal about his desire to tell the American people, in an open and public way, exactly what happened in the 2016 election. He also signaled he would seek to address wider issues, like the intersection of the president's foreign policies and the Trump family's global financial interests. Mr. Schiff has become the Democrats' go-to articulator of the importance of core American values like the rule of law, election integrity, respect for human rights and anti-corruption -- as well as broader foreign policy challenges like the rise of authoritarianism around the world.
But understand this: The role of the head of the House Intelligence Committee is not normally so high-profile. Traditionally, the chairman focuses on more mundane agency oversight topics -- and does so not in front of TV cameras but in closed-door settings.
There is also an element of personality and style. Before the 2016 election, Mr. Schiff was a well-respected but relatively obscure member of Congress. In a 2018 California Sunday Magazine profile, he was described this way: "Dressed in a crisp blue suit and sensible dress shoes, he cultivates a cheerfully beleaguered demeanor. He speaks without notes and tells jokes the way a dad would if that dad had access to highly classified intelligence."
He has been called solid, reasonable and mild-mannered. Sometimes too much so. Even awkward at times. Even now, his Democratic colleagues in the House view him as the prosecutor he once was -- not a political operator clawing his way to ever-greater heights of power. But for purposes of the investigation, clinical and focused is what is called for in the face of Mr. Trump's theatrics and distraction.
But Mr. Schiff has also shown that his patience has its limits and that he can be a very effective communicator. His characterization of President Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky as a "classic organized crime shakedown" is easy for people to understand. His lengthier, more impassioned remarks -- like his defense of his view that the Mueller report did not absolve the president of wrongdoing, after Mr. Trump and committee Republicans called for his resignation -- showed a backbone that left Republicans quieted.
Mr. Schiff's status as a credible, effective communicator who can speak to Americans in ways that ring true may be the most important contribution he can make over the next few weeks and months.
It is becoming clearer every hour that the impeachment inquiry is not over whether Mr. Trump pressed a foreign power to investigate a political rival. He admitted to that conduct, released the call memo and even doubled down on camera on Thursday, saying of the Ukrainians, "If they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation into the Bidens" and "China should start an investigation into the Bidens."
This is not a disagreement about facts or process. It is about whether what Mr. Trump is doing is improper and impeachable. The ultimate outcome of this process could depend on Democrats' ability to draw a straight line between the president's actions and the most profound concerns of the authors of the Constitution about the abuse of executive power.
This type of fight has always been Mr. Schiff's strong suit.

'More serious each day': Bob Woodward says impeachment 'almost certainly going to happen' to Trump

Texto completo: Veteran journalist Bob Woodward said he expects the House to impeach President Trump.
The famed Watergate sleuth made the prediction during a discussion Thursday with students from Whitworth University in Washington state hours after Woodward was booed by a D.C. crowd while interviewing two New York Times journalists who wrote a book about reporting on the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal.
He said Trump's behavior has not escalated to the level of President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal that led him to resign in the face of almost certain impeachment, according to the Spokesman-Review.
But, Woodward said, “It gets more serious each day," referring to Trump calling on Ukraine and China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival in the 2020 election, and his son Hunter.
“Impeachment, which of course is the charge from the House of Representatives, is almost certainly going to happen to Trump,” Woodward said. “But then there’s a trial in the Senate.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she supported a formal impeachment inquiry last week after Trump acknowledged he discussed Biden during a July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president that became the focus of an intelligence official's whistleblower complaint. Meanwhile Trump, who insists he said nothing wrong, is poised to send a letter to the California Democrat stating the White House doesn’t plan to comply with demands for documents related to an impeachment investigation because there was no official vote held on the House floor.
Woodward also said he is making progress on his follow-up to his 2018 book Fear about the Trump presidency.
“I’m working on a second book now, and I’m going through interviews with Trump, looking for one word that can be the title for the second book,” Woodward said after noting this is the same method for how he determined the title for his last book. “I think I’ve found it, but I’m not going to say.”

Grassley right: Whistleblowers trump politics

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley's long and leading advocacy for protection of whistleblowers - insiders who confidentially report fraud, waste, mismanagement or misconduct - might well have been put to the test the last week or two.
After all, the senior senator from Iowa is a Republican, and the man in the eye of the nation's biggest whistleblower storm, President Trump, is the GOP standard-bearer.
In response to a whistleblower's report that Trump abused his presidential power by pressuring the leader of a foreign government (Ukraine) to investigate a possible election rival (Joe Biden), the president has pulled out all the stops in attacking the unidentified whistleblower, depicting himself as a political martyr and warning of a civil war. All of it could well undermine the foundation of whistleblowing programs everywhere.
Trump's personal attacks (against an unidentified target), the unsubstantiated allegations (such as the whistleblower is a traitor who had only "second-hand" information) and the claim that he is "entitled" to know and even interview the whistleblower (whom he calls his "accuser") clearly demonstrate either ignorance or disrespect for the process.
A whistleblower is not an investigator. A whistleblower is not a prosecutor. A whistleblower reports, and then it's up to investigators and prosecutors to dig deeper for the facts. Think of a whistleblower as a hunting dog, pointing at what might not otherwise be visible; what happens next is up to the hunter.
Chuck Grassley gets all that. For decades, he has promoted and defended whistleblowers through legislation and his public statements. But until now, the issue did not involve the president of the United States - and the leader of his own political party.
It might have taken a tick or two longer than if the subject of the report had a D behind his or her name, but Grassley has spoken out in defense of the whistleblower process, even as it involves Trump.
"This person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected. We should always work to respect whistleblowers," Grassley said on Tuesday. "Complaints based on second-hand information should not be rejected out of hand, but they do require additional leg work to get at the facts and evaluate the claim's credibility."
His position reflects a clear break with many if not most of his Republican colleagues and the president's surrogates, some of whom are defending Trump even to the point of making stuff up. But this is not the first time Grassley has broken with the party line, and it's likely not the last.
The political news website Politico further quoted Grassley regarding questions asked at confirmation hearings. "They all say they're going to respect whistleblowers but they end up not doing it. Every Cabinet person that comes in is well intended about protecting whistleblowers and then they're treated like a skunk at a picnic."
The news media are not getting a free pass from the senator. He criticized outlets that reported that the whistleblower is a CIA officer. Such disclosures by the media "don't serve the public interest," he said, "even if the conflict sells more papers or attracts clicks." (The New York Times and Washington Post were the first to carry that limited identification. That information was subsequently included in articles by The Associated Press, whose reports have appeared in the TH.)
No one can predict for sure what will come out of the investigation of the whistleblower's complaints, the impeachment inquiry and the international and domestic fallout. But it is heartening to see the Iowan Grassley put partisan pressure aside and remain an outspoken if lonely defender of whistleblowers.

Where we stand
It's heartening that Sen. Chuck Grassley has put partisanship aside to defend the whistleblower at the heart of the Trump-Ukraine issue.

Texto completo: Speaking to reporters Thursday , President Trump said that China, along with Ukraine, should investigate the business dealings of former Vice President and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, R. Hunter Biden.
Here is what we know about the Biden family's dealings in China:
What are Hunter Biden's business interests in China?
Hunter Biden, a 49-year-old lawyer and the second son of the former vice president, owns 10% of a private-equity firm called Bohai Harvest RST (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Co.
Over the past roughly six years, it has channeled $2.5 billion or more on behalf of its financial backers into automotive, energy, mining and technology deals, according to interviews with people familiar with the private-equity firm and a review by The Wall Street Journal of financial filings and other official business records.
Hunter Biden is one of nine directors of the firm, known as BHR Partners, which is controlled and funded primarily by large Chinese government-owned shareholders.
​What has President Trump said?
President Trump has alleged that Hunter Biden benefited from Chinese government largess and "walked out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund." Mr. Trump has also drawn attention to the fact that BHR Partners was officially registered 12 days after Hunter Biden in December 2013 flew to Beijing aboard Air Force Two, while his father made an official visit as vice president.
Mr. Trump hasn't provided evidence to support the $1.5 billion financial claim, which appears to be based on a fundraising target once announced by BHR Partners. The firm mainly invests by raising money deal to deal from other companies, according to a former employee, and its total paid-in capital is less than $5 million, according to its business registration.
​What does Hunter Biden say?
The board seat at BHR Partners isn't a paid position, and Mr. Biden hasn't recouped his original investment in the company, said his spokesman, George Mesires. The firm's business registration shows Mr. Biden's paid-in capital was about $425,000. Formation of the firm was negotiated for many months beforehand, and its shareholders applied to register the business in the month before the Air Force Two flight, according to the spokesman and the former employee, who described its official registration soon after the vice president's trip as a coincidence.
BHR Partners filings show that Mr. Biden has served as a director of the firm since it was founded but that he didn't become a shareholder until October 2017, after his father's term as vice president ended.
​What is BHR Partners?
BHR Partners calls itself a private-equity firm, and it acts on behalf of large financial backers to find companies to invest in, most of them in China.
Filings show BHR Partners winning a piece of several desirable transactions: a stake worth more than $900 million in a corporate spinoff of non-oil industry assets from China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.; a $10 million holding in China General Nuclear Power Corp., just before an initial public offering; and participation with a dozen other investment groups in a $4.4 billion privatization of a property business controlled by entertainment giant Dalian Wanda Group. For a time, BHR Partners held a stake in Didi Chuxing Technology Co., China's dominant ride-hailing service, and has invested in a leading facial-recognition business, Megvii Technology Inc. BHR Partners has also launched a number of investment funds.
Investors in some of these transactions stood to score quick profits, while the firm hasn't yet made a profitable exit from others, the filings suggest.
In the U.S., BHR Partners participated in a $600 million buyout of Michigan automotive-suspension-systems maker Henniges Automotive in 2015, acquiring a 49% stake, but a banker involved in the deal said negotiations were handled primarily by Aviation Industry Corporation of China Ltd., a state-owned aircraft company that bought a 51% stake.
​Who are the primary investors in BHR Partners?
BHR Partners is 80%-controlled by Chinese entities, its business registration shows.
A consortium including the Chinese government's postal savings bank, its main development bank, a pension fund and the Bank of China controls 30%, while another 30% is held by a major mutual-fund group called Harvest Fund Management Co. Three other entities each own 10%, according to business filings.
Hunter Biden holds his 10% stake through a company he owns, Skaneateles LLC, named for his mother's hometown in upstate New York.
BHR Partners' chief executive is a Beijing investment banker named Jonathan Li, who explained his philosophy for a firm that could do deals in China and overseas on its website : "I wanted diversified ownership, including both Chinese and foreign partners, to make the firm more international," he said.
Executives at BHR Partners didn't respond to questions from the Journal.
What is Hunter Biden's role in the firm?​
It isn't clear what role Mr. Biden has played in the deal-making at BHR Partners. Details about how its transactions are structured aren't public.
Mr. Biden has had other ties in China, including with top executives of a now-collapsed Shanghai oil company, CEFC China Energy Co., as they were trying to break into the U.S. energy market, according to articles in the New Yorker and the New York Times. J. Michael Cole, a Taiwan-based analyst who has written critically about CEFC and wrangled with it legally, says its lawyers repeatedly described the Biden family as friends of the oil company.
What is the origin of the figure cited by Mr. Trump?​
The origin of the $1.5 billion figure cited by Mr. Trump about Hunter Biden's business in China is unclear, but the Journal in July 2014 quoted BHR Partners executives as saying the firm was trying to raise that much money to invest outside China. The plan, they said, aimed to take advantage of a new free-trade zone in Shanghai that Chinese authorities were promoting as a streamlined route to make acquisitions abroad for companies registered there, such as BHR Partners.
The Journal article was cited as the only source for the $1.5 billion figure when it appeared in a book published last year that is critical of Mr. Biden's business activities, and which has been praised by Mr. Trump. "Secret Empires," by Peter Schweizer, says that after Hunter Biden's flight to Beijing aboard Air Force Two, "Hunter's firm would seal a highly unusual $1.5 billion deal with funding from the Chinese government."
BHR Partners hasn't said if it met its fundraising target, but a former employee said it was never more than a long-term goal.
​Are Hunter Biden's business ties in China unusual?
When Mr. Biden acquired his foothold in the Chinese investment firm, U.S.-China relations were riding high, and money was flowing more easily than ever between the countries. China was just then embarking on a global buying spree, a trend that enthralled the financial industry, including the Americans who teamed up with BHR Partners, the former employee said.
China is also flush with private-equity firms that have adopted a famous-sounding name or tapped a politician's relative to hold a stake or join a board, which executives say reflects an effort to stand out in a crowded industry. The official name for BHR Partners in Chinese translates as "Bohai Sino-American."
"Perceptions count," says a Chinese private-equity investor who knows the principals at BHR Partners.

Chef's tastes: Simple, fine dining

Texto completo: Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten is one of the most revered chefs in the world.
The Michelin-starred chef has fed Oprah, George Clooney and the Dalai Lama. His eponymous fine-dining restaurant in New York received four stars from The New York Times.
Born and trained in France, Vongerichten owns and operates 39 restaurants worldwide and has shared his work on programs like the "Good Morning America" and "Top Chef."
We caught up with the acclaimed chef as he prepped his latest restaurant Jean-Georges Philadelphia, which opens at Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia in August. Vongerichten dished on food trends and let us know what's fresh and what's past their expiration date.
Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.
Question: What's your favorite trend happening in food today?
Jean-Georges Vongerichten: When I came to New York in 1986, people were eating Chinese food on Sunday nights. I feel today, people eat Asian food two or three times a week because they're looking for new sensation, new flavors. ... palates have changed nowadays. They have more tolerance for spice, for acidity, for more flavor on the food.
Q: Are there any food trends you don't like?
Vongerichten: Molecular gastronomy. What I love is the last couple years, we went back to more basics, like simple food. I'm not too crazy about sous vide as well, because I feel like, if you live in a city like Philadelphia or New York, you don't need to put things in a bag or cook it in a bag. I like fire. I like live cooking. I think we're going back to that, to a more simple, more direct way of cooking. I feel we are going back in touch to more simple life and more simple things. Nobody needs chemicals in their food. I feel the molecular gastronomy was a little out of whack.
Q: What food will never go out of style?
Vongerichten: People are always going to eat Italian food. They're always going to have sushi. Is it creative sushi? Is it traditional sushi? I mean, it's still sushi. Same thing with Italian. But you know what's never going to go out of style? Good food. Delicious food. Some type of people are looking for weird combination, but, in the end, we're all going back to delicious.
Q: Your career in food and dining has taken you all over the world. Are there any food trends from other countries you wish were more popular in America?
Vongerichten: When I go to a new city I've never been to ... I drop my luggage in the hotel. I go straight to the market, and I see how people eat. I feel like all the markets in Asia are run by people cooking at the market. If you look at the food trucks and everything else, the only street food we had in New York for many years was hot dogs. Now we have all kinds ... I'm a big fan of street food.
Q: What's an older trend that isn't in style anymore but you think should be brought back?
Vongerichten: I feel like in the old days, everything was on a platter. Everything was cooked in a pot, and put the pot in the middle of a table, and people served themselves. I feel we're going back to that a little bit. I don't know if it's the "Game of Thrones" cooking, where you put the leg of lamb in the middle of the table and people slice their own. People want to see the real food. I feel like we're going back to bigger pieces, less plating, less touching the food.
Q: How important would you say presentation is to the overall dining experience?
Vongerichten: Oh, it's very important. I mean, everything has to be Instagramable. Is it a whole chicken on fire or is it something beautifully presented with edible flowers? I think today, visual is very important, as you know. Is it simple? Is it complicated? But the visual I think today where everyone is posting food, everybody is taking pictures of views of design, I think it's a way of communication today. Sometimes if I go to a restaurant, I go to Instagram to see what the food looks like before I actually make a reservation.
Q: How do you think people will be eating in the future?
Vongerichten:I believe that the future of food is really plant-based. I was saying that to all my chefs. We're still gonna eat steaks and fish and a lot of things, but I think, as a daily diet, we're probably gonna eat more plants and grains.
Q: Who are some celebrities or famous people you've served in your restaurants?
Vongerichten: Oh my God, I have a huge list, but I don't remember all the names. You know, George Clooney to Oprah. We cooked for the Dalai Lama once. Every day, we have people coming to our restaurants as well, but I feel like everybody is somebody. When you come to us, we treat you the same way.
Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten has 39 restaurants around the world, including two in Las Vegas.

Schiff's Shifty Timeline

Texto completo: If the latest impeachment push continues to backfire, Democrats can thank their duplicitous House Intelligence chairman, Adam Schiff.
The New York Times reported this week that the "whistleblower" who set off the latest inquisition provided an "early warning" to Mr. Schiff's committee that he or she was filing a complaint over Donald Trump's July 25 call to Ukraine's president. The media is now at pains to stress that whistleblowers do sometimes reach out to Congress, that all "procedures" were followed, and that what really matters is the accusation that Mr. Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.
Actually, it matters a great deal that Mr. Schiff knew about this early and withheld it deliberately from both the public and his House colleagues. He used his advance information to lay the groundwork steadily for later exploitation of the issue. He went so far as to charge the White House with a coverup -- of a complaint he already knew about. The timeline of this orchestrated campaign is another knock to the legitimacy of the so-called impeachment inquiry. If the public can't trust Mr. Schiff to be honest about the origins of his information, why should they trust his claim that the information itself is serious?
Mr. Schiff on Sept. 13, a Friday night, issued the explosive news that he had been alerted a few days earlier by the intelligence community's inspector general of an "urgent" yet unspecified whistleblower complaint. But the complaint is dated Aug. 12, and news reports now say the whistleblower interacted with Mr. Schiff's staff prior to then. So Mr. Schiff knew about the topic of the complaint for more than a month -- while the public did not. It is now clear why the intelligence chairman in that month suddenly developed an interest in all things Ukrainian, and began aggressively previewing his impeachment mantra.
On Aug. 23, for instance, Mr. Schiff tweeted that Mr. Trump tried to "get dirt on a political opponent" via personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's interaction with the office of the Ukrainian president. On Aug. 28, the chairman tweeted his newfound concern that Mr. Trump was "withholding vital military aid to Ukraine." And on Sept. 9, Mr. Schiff suddenly announced his committee would launch a full-fledged investigation into whether Mr. Trump was trying to "pressure Ukraine to help the President's re-election campaign." All this was priming the public and the media for what was to come -- the better to take full advantage of the whistleblower "news."
Yet even after news broke of the complaint, Mr. Schiff played dumb. On Sept. 17, he flatly (and falsely) stated on MSNBC: "We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower." Two days later, he thanked the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, without whom "we might not have even known there was a whistleblower complaint." Really? Mr. Schiff wanted to make it sound as if the Trump administration was muzzling the complainant, when in fact the process was working and Mr. Schiff knew all about it.
The chairman also actively kept his information secret from Republicans on his committee. GOP members confirm that Mr. Schiff had multiple opportunities to acknowledge his awareness of the coming complaint, but kept mum about his side's early involvement. That included even during the committee's closed-door Sept. 19 briefing with Mr. Atkinson.
The whistleblower's early communication with the committee also bears on the complaint's credibility. The Times story explains that the whistleblowing Central Intelligence Agency officer initially alerted the CIA's top lawyer to concerns. Yet before even waiting for this procedure to play out, the officer went to Mr. Schiff's staff. This act has to be measured in light of Mr. Atkinson's acknowledgment that the source demonstrated an "arguable political bias . . . in favor of a rival candidate." It has become urgent that Republicans demand more information about the whistleblower's history and motivations -- questions that are central to any whistleblower complaint, but particularly one being used as a basis for impeachment.
If all this has a somewhat familiar feel of subterfuge and ambush, it should. The episode is redolent of the sneak attack on Brett Kavanaugh. An unknown person levels nasty allegations; a Democratic lawmaker (in that case, Sen. Dianne Feinstein) conceals the claim before springing it at an opportune moment; the media jumps on board to distort and inflame the story. Lost in the carnage are little things like fairness, standards and due process.
Mr. Schiff's staff is suggesting its interaction with the whistleblower was limited. Maybe, but given Mr. Schiff's recent deceptions, it's reasonable to ask more questions about how involved his committee was with the creation of this complaint. The Democratic claim that Mr. Trump's Ukraine call rose to the level of impeachment was always absurd. But Americans have even more reason to doubt the legitimacy of this push in light of Mr. Schiff's scheming exploitation of the whistleblower charge.

Previews & Openings
'AMERICAN UTOPIA' at the Hudson Theater (previews start on Oct. 4; opens on Oct. 20). Heaven, David Byrne once sang, is a place where nothing happens. But Broadway is not. And it is hosting the latest theatrical experiment from Byrne ("Here Lies Love," "Joan of Arc: Into the Fire"). Byrne and 11 barefoot collaborators sing and discuss music and justice. Annie-B Parson does the choreography.

'FOR COLORED GIRLS WHO HAVE CONSIDERED SUICIDE/WHEN THE RAINBOW IS ENUF' at the Public Theater (previews start on Oct. 8; opens on Oct. 22). Ntozake Shange's epoch-defining choreopoem, which premiered at the Public Theater in 1976, reappears this month. Okwui Okpokwasili and Adrienne C. Moore are among the actresses unpacking their lives and hearts. Leah C. Gardiner directs, with choreography by Camille A. Brown.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'GEORGIA MERTCHING IS DEAD' at the Ensemble Studio Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 10). A road trip garnished with ambivalence and pie, Catya McMullen's new play follows three young women (Layla Khoshnoudi, Diana Oh and Claire Siebers), one of them heavily pregnant, driving toward their shared past. Giovanna Sardelli directs this dark comedy about sex, road food and mourning.

'HEROES OF THE FOURTH TURNING' at Playwrights Horizons (in previews; opens on Oct. 7). Will Arbery's play, about Christian conservatives, takes its title from a sociological theory that tracks how America moves through crisis, recovery, awakening, unraveling and back to crisis. In a Wyoming backyard, four young adults and a college president have some crises of their own. Danya Taymor directs.
212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org
'LINDA VISTA' at the Hayes Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 10). A midlife crisis comes to Broadway, courtesy of Steppenwolf and Second Stage. Ian Barford stars in Tracy Letts's play about a recently divorced man with a talent for disappointing the women in his life and himself, too. Dexter Bullard directs a cast that includes Caroline Neff, Chantal Thuy and Cora Vander Broek.
2st.com
'MACBETH' at Classic Stage Company (previews start on Oct. 10; opens on Oct. 27).

'NOTES ON MY MOTHER'S DECLINE' at Next Door at NYTW (previews start on Oct. 6; opens on Oct. 13). A new dad cares for his old mom in Andy Bragen's semi-autobiographical piece, directed by Knud Adams. (Since Bragen's "This Is My Office" explored his relationship with his father, a companion piece seems only fair.) Bragen has written that it is the most personal play he has ever written and the most difficult.
212-460-5475, nytw.org
'POWER STRIP' at the Claire Tow Theater (previews start on Oct. 5; opens on Oct. 21). A play that doesn't protect from surges, this drama by Sylvia Khoury, set in the recent past, centers on Yasmin (Dina Shihabi), a young woman, originally from Syria, in a Greek refugee camp fighting for autonomy and amperes. Tyne Rafaeli directs for LCT3, with Peter Ganim, Darius Homayoun and Ali Lopez-Sohaili.
212-239-6200, lct3.org
'SLAVE PLAY' at the Golden Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 6). Jeremy O. Harris's play about race, sex and the deep wounds of inherited drama, which was a sensation at New York Theater Workshop last winter, hurtles onto Broadway. When this production, directed by Robert O'Hara, opened Off Broadway in December, Jesse Green called it a "willfully provocative, gaudily transgressive and altogether staggering new play."
212-947-8844, slaveplaybroadway.com

212-727-7722, mcctheater.org
'VICTOR' at Axis Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 6). Edgar Oliver, the eerie raconteur and one-man Gothic novel, returns to Axis with a new work of solo storytelling. This piece, which is directed by Randy Sharp and includes original music by Paul Carbonara, charts Oliver's two-decade friendship with a homeless man, Victor Greco.
866-811-4111, axiscompany.org
Last Chance
'NOVENAS FOR A LOST HOSPITAL' at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater (closes on Oct. 13). Rattlestick's site-specific autopsy of St. Vincent's Hospital, shuttered in 2010, reaches its conclusion. The show, directed by Daniella Topol and starring a luminous Kathleen Chalfant, traverses 16 decades and several locations, which is perhaps too much. According to Jesse Green, "'Novenas' often feels like it's trying to find the quickest way to connect its points, instead of the richest way."
866-811-4111, rattlestick.org
'WIVES' at Playwrights Horizons (closes on Oct. 6). Jaclyn Backhaus's comedy, about the subjugation of women in a patriarchal culture, ends its Off Broadway run. Though Ben Brantley noted that the time-jumping play, directed by Margot Bordelon, "ultimately careens off the rails in its revisionist enthusiasm," it is, he wrote, "a gleeful work of historical subversion."

Texto completo: And the winner is ... Vladimir Putin.
For some Europeans, the most embarrassing revelation of the now very public phone conversation between Donald Trump and Ukraine's president on July 25 was not the attempt by Mr. Trump to interfere in the judiciary system of a foreign country for his own political benefit. Nothing the American president does could surprise any longer.
What they found particularly disappointing, instead, was the servility with which his young counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, sought to ingratiate himself with Mr. Trump, pretending that he had won the Ukrainian presidency by imitating him, claiming to have appointed a new prosecutor general who would be "100 percent my person," and happily joining in the Euro-bashing that has become one of Mr. Trump's trademarks.
Masks were falling off. So this popular maverick comedian turned real-life politician after playing one in a TV series, this promising reformer that President Emmanuel Macron of France had hosted at the Élysée even before he was elected, was in fact another spineless, unprepared leader jumping into President Trump's every trap.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Macron have been wise enough not to comment on this pathetic turn of events. Privately, French diplomats insist that Paris still actively supports Mr. Zelensky -- even more so in light of the American meltdown. What is at stake in Ukraine for the European Union is far too important, and the risk of seeing Mr. Trump's dirty work derail laborious efforts to reform that post-Soviet country far too real.
The issue is bigger than Mr. Zelensky. After a popular uprising in 2014 forced a corrupt predecessor of Mr. Zelensky to flee to Russia, Ukraine and its 44 million citizens became the new frontier of democratic Europe. To prevent that from succeeding, President Vladimir Putin's Russia annexed Crimea and intervened in the Donbas region, across its border.
Contrary to Mr. Trump's claims, the European Union has been very active in Ukraine -- and far more generous than the United States -- in supporting reforms in its governance, economy and civil society. Since 2014, European institutions have mobilized more than 15 billion euros in grants and loans, on top of bilateral assistance from member states.
Brussels has signed an association agreement with Kiev that includes the most wide-ranging free trade agreement ever concluded by the union: If Ukraine manages to bring its legal norms and regulations in line, it could end up fully integrating its economy into the European single market. Thanks to a new visa-free system, set up in 2017, millions of Ukrainians have been able to travel and work in Europe, mostly in neighboring Poland, and send remittances back home. The European Union Advisory Mission maintains 300 people in Ukraine to help transform the Ukrainian civilian security sector.
But in the field of military aid, the United States is Ukraine's main partner. That is why withholding $ 391 million of such aid, as the Trump administration did this summer, can so effectively put pressure on Kiev. In the five-year-old war with Russia over Donbas, which has claimed 13,000 lives, American support has been crucial. Defense experts point out that when the Pentagon sent Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine two years ago, Russian tanks pulled back.
So when a new, untested 41-year-old president of Ukraine gets ready to take on Mr. Putin, the ruler for two decades of the big power next door, the last thing he needs is his main military aid provider withdrawing its backing.
Indeed, the Trump mess could not come at a worse time for President Zelensky. Four months into his term, a big question mark still hangs over the direction this fast-learning political novice will choose for his country. "He is from another planet," reckoned a European diplomat who has watched him closely.
Mr. Zelensky campaigned on a promise to bring peace, unify the country and fight corruption, and won by a landslide. Voters were desperate for change, which he embodied, but his political program was so vague that analysts were left guessing. The kind of president Mr. Zelensky would be, they concluded, would be determined by who in his entourage ended up having the upper hand.
The young, earnest reformers who have joined his government, supported by new members of Parliament? His childhood friends and former associates of his TV production company? Or the immovable oligarchs, and one billionaire in particular -- Ihor Kolomoisky, whose PrivatBank was nationalized three years ago after financial regulators found that $ 5.5 billion was missing from its accounts?
Who wins this competition is of interest not just to Ukrainian voters. Ukraine's European partners and the International Monetary Fund, which has set up a major credit line to help the country rebuild its economy, are also watching closely. An I.M.F. delegation visited Kiev in September but left without an agreement on a new cooperation program; its members seemed both impressed by the reformers' ambition and wary of Mr. Kolomoisky's ostentatious presence.
The oligarch returned from self-imposed exile as soon as Mr. Zelensky, his protégé, took office in May. He is now talking to the government about $ 2 billion in "compensation" for the loss of PrivatBank. For foreign experts, whether the government gives in will be a test of President Zelensky's political strength.
In France, President Macron, having bet on Mr. Zelensky as a potential game-changer and eager to reopen a wider dialogue with Moscow, has been encouraging Ukraine to try to give new impetus to stalled peace talks with Russia on Donbas. President Zelensky and President Putin have talked on the phone, which led to a much-awaited exchange of prisoners in early September and, lately, into some positive steps in the negotiation over the future status of Donbas.
Enter Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, a whistle-blower and Nancy Pelosi. Very much an American story -- except that Ukraine is unwillingly dragged into the mud. While Washington wallows in the impeachment procedure, the consequences could be devastating for its relationship with Kiev. The resignation of Kurt Volker, the State Department special envoy for Ukraine, whom Ukrainians considered their most solid defender in negotiations with Russia, is seen as a big loss, especially coming after Washington's recall of Marie Yovanovitch as the American ambassador in May.
President Zelensky, his image now tarnished, is left to mend fences with his European allies. President Macron will have to adjust to this new situation. Last but not least, as the anti-corruption activist Daria Kaleniuk recently lamented on the Ukrainian television channel Hromadske, "The U.S. push for good governance in Ukraine is seriously undermined. What America was selling to the world used to be the rule of law."
And the winner is ... Vladimir Putin. President Jimmy Carter's former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski in his 1997 book, "The Grand Chessboard," described newly independent Ukraine as "a geopolitical pivot, because its very existence as an independent country helps to transform Russia." He added: "Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire. However, if Moscow regains control over Ukraine, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state."
The stakes are still that high. Whether President Trump is aware of it is anybody's guess.

Bipartisan report says Trump’s abuse has pushed federal science to a ‘crisis’

Texto completo: Washington • In a single month in 2017, the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency blocked scientists from speaking at a climate change conference, its Interior Department forwarded a policy letter to U.S. Customs and Border Protection only after deleting concerns from biologists about a border wall’s effects on wildlife, and the FBI issued a crime report that omitted dozens of tables of data on homicides and arrests.
That October was fairly typical for the Trump administration, according to a new report out of New York University, led by Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney, and Christine Todd Whitman, who led the EPA for George W. Bush.
Every president over the past two decades has, to some degree, undermined research and injected politics into science, the report said. But, it concluded, “Now, we are at a crisis point, with almost weekly violations of previously respected safeguards.” The report calls for stringent new standards to enshrine scientific independence.
The study, to be formally released Thursday, follows reports that President Donald Trump’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, pressured the commerce secretary to rebuke weather forecasters who appeared to contradict the president after he erroneously claimed a recent hurricane could affect Alabama. This summer a State Department intelligence analyst resigned in protest after the White House tried to edit scientific testimony about climate change and then blocked it from being entered into the permanent Congressional Record. For months the White House debated a plan to publicly question the established scientific conclusions about the severity of climate change.
“While the threat to the independence of scientific data did not start with this administration, it has certainly accelerated of late,” said Whitman, a Republican who also served as New Jersey’s governor, in an emailed statement.
A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the report’s findings.
The report is the second in a series of studies issued by a democracy task force that was launched last year at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law. Both Bharara and Whitman have been critical of Trump, but they emphasized that stronger laws against financial conflicts, political interference with law enforcement and the suppression of science were needed to curtail the impulses of any president from either party.
Under President George H.W. Bush, the report noted, the White House altered the scientific testimony of James E. Hansen, a NASA scientist, to make his conclusions about climate change appear less certain. The EPA under President Barack Obama made last-minute changes to a report to downplay the risks of an oil and gas extraction technique known as fracking on the nation’s water supply. In another instance the Obama administration issued a memo discouraging members of EPA’s scientific advisory boards from speaking publicly without agency approval.
But the report reserved special condemnation for the actions of the Trump administration, which has disbanded independent scientific review boards, altered reports that contradict the administration’s political views and relocated researchers whose conclusions were politically uncomfortable. For instance, the Agriculture Department decided in May to move some of its economists out of Washington after they presented research indicating that the agricultural benefits of Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax cut would flow largely to the nation’s richest farmers.
On Oct. 13, 2017, the Interior Department sent a supportive letter to border patrol officials considering Trump’s proposed wall along the southwestern frontier, but deleted concerns by scientists about the harm that a physical structure could cause the habitats of rare cats and other wildlife in the area, according to the report. A few days later the EPA barred three agency scientists from speaking at a conference in Rhode Island about the effects of climate change on Narragansett Bay. A week after that the FBI issued its annual report of crime data with 70% fewer data tables. The changes, according to a report at the time, did not go through the normal review process.
“Policies governing the health and welfare of the public and of our shared environment have to be based in credible, independent science,” Whitman said in emailed remarks. “For the public to lose faith in that process will call into question everything that has been done to make our drugs and food safe and our environment healthier.”
The authors maintain that, without action from Congress, future administrations of either party could further erode the independence of federal scientific data. Among the changes it recommended was legislation to require that all federal agencies that perform scientific research articulate clear standards for, and report on, how political officials interact with career scientists.
While that seems like a long shot in the current Congress, where even the definition of scientific integrity is in dispute, the authors said they are optimistic that rules governing scientific advisory bodies could earn bipartisan support. Legislation by Rep. Paul Tonko, D-N.Y., to develop scientific integrity standards has 217 co-sponsors, but none are Republican.
“There’s truth and there’s science, and that shouldn’t be swayed by whether someone is a liberal or a conservative, a Democrat or a Republican,” Bharara said in an interview.

Cal Thomas: Whistleblower’s complaint feels a bit slimy

Texto completo: Back when reruns were a staple of summer programming, television networks aired repeats of their programs, giving viewers another opportunity to see what they had already seen. Democratic politicians are now conducting their own version of reruns.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656862" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Cal-Thomas-Color-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" />
The same bunch who brought us the failed Russian “collusion” story, the sliming of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and charges that President Trump is a racist (which also failed, given the spectacular increase in minority employment), are now rerunning the same show with different characters.
According to a still anonymous “whistleblower,” who wrote a multi-page “complaint” about a phone call between President Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that he or she heard about secondhand from another unnamed person, President Trump held back military aide to Ukraine until “dirt” on Joe Biden and his son Hunter could be provided. Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, which paid him $3.1 million over a 16-month period. This when his father was vice president of the United States and, according to Bloomberg, pursing “…an anti-corruption policy in Ukraine … that included a call for the resignation of the country’s top prosecutor who had previously investigated Burisma.”
Ukraine’s prosecutor general has since come out and said that there is no evidence of wrongdoing by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden or his son, but something doesn’t pass the smell test.
The New York Times reports the whistleblower is a CIA agent who was on loan to the White House. I have known several CIA agents and two directors of the CIA — George H.W. Bush and Porter Goss — and none were known for the kind of prose contained in the complaint. The document appears to have been written by a team of lawyers with a political objective, namely impeachment of the president.
This is a view shared by Fred Fleitz, president of the Center for Security Policy, a conservative, Washington, D.C.-based think tank. Fleitz is also a former deputy assistant to President Trump and to the chief of staff of the National Security Council (NSC).

Writing in The New York Post, Fleitz says: “I am very familiar with transcripts of presidential phone calls since I edited and processed dozens of them when I worked for the NSC. I also know a lot about intelligence whistleblowers from my time with the CIA.
“My suspicions grew … when I saw the declassified whistleblower complaint. It appears to be written by a law professor and includes legal references and detailed footnotes. It also has an unusual legalistic reference on how this complaint should be classified. From my experience, such an extremely polished whistleblowing complaint is unheard of. This document looks as if this leaker had outside help, possibly from congressional members or staff.”
When it comes to an impeachable offense, there is no there, there.
Like other attempts to undo the results of the 2016 election, this one should also fail if Republicans stick together, as Democrats did during the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) revealed his party’s true motives when he said that if Trump isn’t impeached he will be re-elected.
There are deeper issues for 2020. They include capitalism vs. socialism; higher unemployment vs. lower; judges who revere and obey the Constitution vs. judges who wish they had written it and know what the Founders intended better than the Founders; government health care vs. reforms in the current system to make it better; greater dependence on government vs. an expansion of individual liberty; rewarding initiative and success vs. penalizing the successful with higher taxes and more regulations.
Don’t expect President Trump to start quoting this line from the Ukraine national anthem, but it could prove prophetic if Democrats fail in their latest cynical attempt to impeach him: “Like the dew before the sun, enemies will fade. We will further rule and prosper in our promised land.”

Texto completo: Dear reader:
“The country is not as divided as the media make it seem.”
That’s a quote from a participant in a recent election survey experiment called “America in One Room.” As the name indicates, the project brought together a representative sample of voters from around the country, reflecting the nation’s deep divides on partisanship, ideology, and identity. Over the course of a long weekend in Dallas, they held small-group discussions on five hot-button topics: immigration, healthcare, the environment, the economy, and foreign policy.
Many participants experienced significant shifts in thought. “Republicans became more welcoming of immigration and less punitive in their attitudes,” the researchers write in The New York Times. Support for making undocumented immigrants return to their home countries, for example, fell from 45 to 25 percent. Democrats shifted notably on economic issues – support for a federal minimum wage dropped by 23 percentage points.
The conversations also had a marked effect on people’s confidence in our democratic institutions: The percentage who said America’s system of democracy was “working well” rose from 30 percent to 60 percent.
Many groups have undertaken similar efforts in recent years, anecdotally confirming what “America in One Room” was able to measure: When you bring people of opposing views together for thoughtful discussions, the nation’s partisan divide shrinks.
The challenge, of course, lies in the “bringing together” part. Partisanship is now correlated with geography – Democrats are clustered in cities (and, increasingly, suburbs); Republicans dominate in exurban and rural areas. The lack of regular contact between Democrats and Republicans has led to a decrease in understanding. But overcoming a geographic divide is easier said than done.
And while physical distance isn’t an issue in virtual communities, those spaces are increasingly segregated as well. The participants in Dallas were given a 55-page handbook with arguments for and against each policy proposal. Most voters today get their information in a piecemeal fashion from media sources or peers that simply reinforce previously held views.
Still, the “America in One Room” researchers highlight their project’s value as a measure of public opinion – revealing Americans’ “considered judgments” following discussion and deliberation, rather than the “surface impressions” most polling reflects.
“It was interesting how many times people agreed at the heart of an issue, but just had slight differences in how to go about making needed changes,” participant Joan Young told CNN. "I was very hopeful after seeing the way our small group behaved.”

Schiff's Shifty Timeline; What did the House Intel Committee chairman know and when did he know it?

Texto completo: If the latest impeachment push continues to backfire, Democrats can thank their duplicitous House Intelligence chairman, Adam Schiff.
The New York Times reported this week that the "whistleblower" who set off the latest inquisition provided an "early warning" to Mr. Schiff's committee that he or she was filing a complaint over Donald Trump's July 25 call to Ukraine's president. The media is now at pains to stress that whistleblowers do sometimes reach out to Congress, that all "procedures" were followed, and that what really matters is the accusation that Mr. Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.
Actually, it matters a great deal that Mr. Schiff knew about this early and withheld it deliberately from both the public and his House colleagues. He used his advance information to lay the groundwork steadily for later exploitation of the issue. He went so far as to charge the White House with a coverup—of a complaint he already knew about. The timeline of this orchestrated campaign is another knock to the legitimacy of the so-called impeachment inquiry. If the public can't trust Mr. Schiff to be honest about the origins of his information, why should they trust his claim that the information itself is serious?
Mr. Schiff on Sept. 13, a Friday night, issued the explosive news that he had been alerted a few days earlier by the intelligence community's inspector general of an "urgent" yet unspecified whistleblower complaint. But the complaint is dated Aug. 12, and news reports now say the whistleblower interacted with Mr. Schiff's staff prior to then. So Mr. Schiff knew about the topic of the complaint for more than a month—while the public did not. It is now clear why the intelligence chairman in that month suddenly developed an interest in all things Ukrainian, and began aggressively previewing his impeachment mantra.
On Aug. 23, for instance, Mr. Schiff tweeted that Mr. Trump tried to "get dirt on a political opponent" via personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani's interaction with the office of the Ukrainian president. On Aug. 28, the chairman tweeted his newfound concern that Mr. Trump was "withholding vital military aid to Ukraine." And on Sept. 9, Mr. Schiff suddenly announced his committee would launch a full-fledged investigation into whether Mr. Trump was trying to "pressure Ukraine to help the President's re-election campaign." All this was priming the public and the media for what was to come—the better to take full advantage of the whistleblower "news."
Yet even after news broke of the complaint, Mr. Schiff played dumb. On Sept. 17, he flatly (and falsely) stated on MSNBC: "We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower." Two days later, he thanked the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, without whom "we might not have even known there was a whistleblower complaint." Really? Mr. Schiff wanted to make it sound as if the Trump administration was muzzling the complainant, when in fact the process was working and Mr. Schiff knew all about it.
The chairman also actively kept his information secret from Republicans on his committee. GOP members confirm that Mr. Schiff had multiple opportunities to acknowledge his awareness of the coming complaint, but kept mum about his side's early involvement. That included even during the committee's closed-door Sept. 19 briefing with Mr. Atkinson.
The whistleblower's early communication with the committee also bears on the complaint's credibility. The Times story explains that the whistleblowing Central Intelligence Agency officer initially alerted the CIA's top lawyer to concerns. Yet before even waiting for this procedure to play out, the officer went to Mr. Schiff's staff. This act has to be measured in light of Mr. Atkinson's acknowledgment that the source demonstrated an "arguable political bias . . . in favor of a rival candidate." It has become urgent that Republicans demand more information about the whistleblower's history and motivations—questions that are central to any whistleblower complaint, but particularly one being used as a basis for impeachment.
If all this has a somewhat familiar feel of subterfuge and ambush, it should. The episode is redolent of the sneak attack on Brett Kavanaugh. An unknown person levels nasty allegations; a Democratic lawmaker (in that case, Sen. Dianne Feinstein) conceals the claim before springing it at an opportune moment; the media jumps on board to distort and inflame the story. Lost in the carnage are little things like fairness, standards and due process.
Mr. Schiff's staff is suggesting its interaction with the whistleblower was limited. Maybe, but given Mr. Schiff's recent deceptions, it's reasonable to ask more questions about how involved his committee was with the creation of this complaint. The Democratic claim that Mr. Trump's Ukraine call rose to the level of impeachment was always absurd. But Americans have even more reason to doubt the legitimacy of this push in light of Mr. Schiff's scheming exploitation of the whistleblower charge.

Movie-goers shouldn't wear costumes with 'Joker' in theaters

Texto completo: FOND DU LAC – As the origin story of a Batman villain hits the silver screen in the movie "Joker" Thursday, The Odyssey Fond du Lac Theatre 8 has told patrons to leave the costumes and face paint at home.
Owned by the Minneapolis-based Odyssey Entertainment Inc., the theater said in a statement on its Facebook page that while it does not comment on security protocols or operating procedures, neither employees or patrons will be allowed to dress up at theaters screening the film, as many costumes, particularly the Joker, involve face paint, which could not be taken off at the theater's request for "identification purposes," according to the statement.
"We believe in strongly having events which often involve great times with costumed characters, but we also have to balance that with the safety of our patrons and employees as well. We greatly appreciate your understanding," the post reads.
The company, which owns nine theaters under the names Odyssey and CineMagic throughout Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio and South Dakota, posted the statement on the Facebook pages of other locations as well.
"Joker" stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man who plays a clown by day and seeks to be a comedian, while feeling disconnected and mistreated by those around him in Gotham City. In response, "he slowly descends into madness" to become the Joker, according to the movie description.
The film has received much critical acclaim, garnering the top award at the Venice Film Festival and Oscar buzz for Phoenix. Currently, it has a certified-fresh rating of 76% on Rotten Tomatoes, which complies critics' reviews to give movies a score of "fresh" or "rotten."
Controversy surrounding the film stems from its human depiction of the Joker character, who retaliates against society with violence. Critics of the film say it calls to mind violent episodes in the United States history, such as the 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado during a screening of the Batman film "The Dark Knight Rises," according to The New York Times. Families of that shooting wrote a letter to Warner Bros., stating their concerns over the film, according to Entertainment Weekly.
In response, the company issued a statement saying that the function of storytelling is "to provoke conversations around complex issues," and the film is not intended to encourage violence, according to CNBC.
"Make no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero," the statement reads.
In September, military officials issued a notice from Oklahoma's Fort Sills Army base of a potential threat to a movie theater somewhere in the United States based online chatter, however, Army officials say they have received no credible information, according to USA TODAY.
The post on Odyssey's Facebook page generated positive feedback, with comments saying it is a "good call" and lamenting "sad that it needs to come to this, but solid thing to do ... just in case."
The theater chain is not the only issuing such a policy for the film.
The Los Angeles-based Landmark Theaters, which has 56 theaters in its chain, will not be allowing employees or customers to wear masks, costumes or face-paint to the showings, according to Entertainment Weekly.
Since the Aurora, Colorado shooting during a screening of the Batman film, "The Dark Knight Rises," AMC Theaters out of Kansas has not allowed masks, face paint or weapons at any movies at its more than 650 theaters, according to CNBC.
On Monday, Marcus Theatres, which has 21 locations throughout the state including Ripon and Oshkosh, posted on social media that it will change its bag and package policy so bags no bigger than 12 inches by 12 inches by 6 inches will be allowed in. The movie was not cited in the post, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Other movie theater chains in Milwaukee, including the Neighborhood Theatre Group, also changed their policy.
Other theaters are also stepping up security, such as Texas' Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, which has 40 theaters, according to Entertainment Weekly. In New York City and Los Angeles, uniformed police officers will be at theaters playing the film on opening weekend, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
The film with not be shown at the Aurora theater where 12 people were killed and 70 injured in 2012, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
In an interview with the Associated Press, Co-writer and Director Todd Phillips said the film is meant to look at "comic book world of movies" and ask why they are celebrated and "what are the real-world implications of violence." He also hopes that it inspires conversation on violence and mental illness, according to the interview.
Screenings for the film begin at 4 p.m. Thursday at the Fond du Lac Theatre, and will continue into the weekend. The film is rated "R."

Nosrat mulls going part-time vegan

Texto completo: Samin Nosrat's laugh is delightful and infectious. It's the kind of warm uninhibited chorus that makes you feel not only like you've known the New York Times best-selling author for years, but also that she couldn't be more happy to talk with you today.
This charming, approachable persona is an undeniable part of the reason why Nostrat's Netflix series "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" — inspired by her James Beard Award-winning book of the same name — has been hailed for changing the food show landscape forever.
In the four-part series, viewers see Nosrat lose herself in the pleasure of a piece of aged Parmesan cheese, giggle as her eyes water while chopping onions and do an adorable happy dance with a friend as they devour a dish while standing around the kitchen counter.
What to expect at Samin Nosrat's Mesa show It's a show that's as much about food, where it comes from and how to make it, as it is about watching someone simply enjoy it.
The show premiered on the streaming platform almost a year ago, and Nosrat's been busy in the intervening months. She's already begun work on a second series and thinking about her next book, called "What to Cook."
She's also hitting the road, crisscrossing the country for evening events during which she chats with local hosts about food, cooking and anything else that might come up when she fields questions from the audience.
On Saturday, Oct. 5, she'll join chef Mark Tarbell at Mesa Arts Center. Ahead of her Phoenix tour stop, we chatted with the author, TV star and chef about what fans can expect.
Question: So, what can people expect from this tour?
Answer: We basically laugh a lot (laughs) and then, I mean, each conversation is different, which is something I really love about it.
One thing I'm really excited about that is that I edited this year's edition of "Best American Food Writing." I was pretty riled up when I was doing the editing and writing the forward but what I'm excited about is I think it will rile people up when they read it. I did my best to highlight all sorts of different issues beyond what we just consider to be food and I'm really excited to get to talk about the wonderful diversity of the writing.
The other thing I'm thinking so much about, which I'm sure people in Arizona must think about all the time, is climate change and how food affects and is affected by it.
I have been reading a lot about climate change and agriculture and food and I feel like — and I'm so hesitant to say this, but I gotta start saying it somewhere — I feel like the only responsible thing for me to do is become a daytime vegan. And I really don't want to. Like I really don't want to but I feel like it's something I have to do and I feel like it's what I need to, not necessarily bully other people into doing, but at least model for people. Changing out diets is the single most powerful thing we as individuals can do.
It's both depressing and exciting. (laughs)
Why getting a show was a 'whiplash moment' Q: It sounds like you maybe have been thinking about using your platform to be an activist? Or raise awareness, maybe?
A: I wouldn't use the word "activist." I still do have a relationship with the New York Times so I have not fully jumped into activism. But I do think education and awareness is really important and it's my job.
I found out that Netflix was interested in the show two days after the 2016 election and it was a really hard time for me. I really felt that that election said to me, personally, that people who look like you are not wanted here. So I was sort of sitting with the grief of that and then found out this thing two days later.
It was a really whiplash moment for me and I took it really seriously and thought really carefully about whether I wanted to put myself in the public eye when the public had made it clear that people who look like me or are from the part of the world that my family is from are not necessarily considered American or welcome here.
I did in the end decide that I did want to do it and I was like, OK if I am going to do this then I'm going to use it to promote the kind of message that's really important to me, which is one of unity and sharing with people my ultimate belief that we are more similar than different across the world.
So I don't know that I would use the word "activist" necessarily, but I do think that there are so many things in our daily lives that feel really overwhelming. Changing a habit is really hard. I get how hard it is. I have my own really conflicted decisions about changing the way I eat and yet my brain understands that it's what we all have to do. Or it's what I have to do at least.
What being 'daytime vegan' means Q: But vegan? I don't know if I could give up cheese...
A: Well, the thing is it's daytime vegan (laughs)
Q: So, only when the sun is up?
A: Totally. Basically, statistically, if you give up animal products for two of your meals, you end up using less carbon than if you're a full-time vegetarian. I think if I fully had to give up cheese and dairy and butter it would just be like, I couldn't. I would die.
One of the books I've been reading is by my friend Jonathan Safran Foer. He has a new climate change book coming out, and he proposes this and his whole book is about his own personal difficulty with it and also the understanding that if you don't do it, you're just a person who didn't do something when the moment required it.
Q: I know you're working on another book. Can you share anything about what people can expect in "What to Cook"?
A: Yeah! I mean to be completely honest I have not actually started working on it because I am going to make another TV series first. I'm in the sort of development part, which is like the brainstorm part of the show, so that's been taking up most of my mental energy.
How her new book will be different from 'Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat' But as far as the book, one of things I've seen is that people feel kind of stuck about deciding what to make.
Even really good home cooks create a menu for a dinner or a party page for page, word for word out of a magazine spread of recipes. Or because they saw such-and-such-thing on TV or Instagram. I started to think about how there's so much I can share with those people about how to make their lives easier by understanding what decisions to make about what they should be cooking.
I did my best with "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" to teach people how to translate how professional cooks think about how to cook. What I've realized is I haven't really that similar translation about how professional cooks decide what to cook.
I think people have a really romantic notion that chefs show up at work and are like 'today I feel like making this grand and wonderful creation' or something. And maybe some people do that. But the constraints of a real kitchen are what chiefly make a professional cook decide what to make. If I can teach that to home cooks I think it would make people's day-to-day cooking a lot easier.
So that's what I'm going to do with the book that I have not started writing yet. (laughs)

Texto completo: "Are you talking to me?" President Trump asked, his brow creased in disgust.
He was staring at Jeff Mason, a Reuters reporter whom Mr. Trump had called on moments earlier during an East Room news conference with the president of Finland.
Such events, with the American president joined by a fellow head of state, are usually formal affairs. But Mr. Trump seemed to be in a stormy mood on Wednesday, lashing out on Twitter and in person at his enemies, real and perceived, as House Democrats pursue a formal impeachment inquiry against him.
One regular Trump boogeyman -- the American news media -- has come in for particular ire of late. Mr. Trump has tweaked his usual "fake news" sobriquet, now preferring the term "corrupt news." Earlier on Wednesday, in the Oval Office, he attacked the credibility of The Washington Post over an article that outlined his interest in constructing an alligator- and snake-filled moat along the southern border. Mr. Trump appeared unaware that the article had been published by The New York Times.
Then came the exchange with Mr. Mason, which was emblematic of the president's escalating attacks on the press.
Mr. Mason, a veteran White House correspondent, had posed a straightforward question: What did the president hope to achieve when he asked the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, about the Biden family's dealings in his country?
Mr. Trump's discursive reply ranged from his gripes about financial support for Europe to a shout-out to Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and included a comparison of Ukraine to "a wall between Russia and Europe -- a big, wide, beautiful wall." The substance of Mr. Mason's question went unanswered, so the Reuters reporter tried again.
"The question, sir," Mr. Mason said, "was what did you want President Zelensky to do about Vice President Biden and his son Hunter?"
Polite but persistent follow-ups are a White House correspondent's stock in trade. But Mr. Trump expressed deep offense, interrupting Mr. Mason and instructing him to ask the Finnish president a question instead.
"Did you hear me? Did you hear me?" Mr. Trump said from his lectern. "Ask him a question. I've given you a long answer. Ask this gentleman a question. Don't be rude."
"I don't want to be rude," Mr. Mason replied. "I just wanted you to have a chance to answer the question that I asked you."
Again, Mr. Trump deflected -- this time with a verbal fusillade against journalists. "I've answered everything," the president said. (He hadn't.) "It's a whole hoax, and you know who's playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country -- and, I say in many cases, the corrupt media, because you're corrupt. Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it's corrupt."
Mr. Mason seems to have a knack for standing out at Finland-related events: Last year, he drew attention for a series of tough questions to Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during their summit in Helsinki.
His calm on Wednesday won praise from fellow journalists. "Jeff Mason is a total pro," a Washington Post reporter, Michael Scherer, wrote on Twitter. "That was textbook. Play the tape in journalism schools."
Even after he moved on from Mr. Mason, Mr. Trump returned to his acid commentary on the press. "If the press were straight and honest and forthright and tough, we would be a far greater nation," he said in closing.
Mr. Trump's slashing criticism of the media has been denounced by news outlets and press advocates, in particular for the ways that autocrats around the world have invoked his remarks to justify cracking down on independent journalists. Almost uniformly before Mr. Trump, American presidents publicly promoted the role of journalism in a democracy, even if they groused over tough coverage.
In his recent fury, Mr. Trump has also pressed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable discourse in journalism. On Wednesday, the president fired off a tweet that included a profane word for manure, rendered in all capital letters. Soon after, Richard Davis, CNN's head of standards, circulated a memo at the network noting that its journalists should feel free to use the word "in graphics, banners and headlines."
"It is newsworthy that he wrote it and tweeted it out, and we should show and say it because the president sent it out just that way," Mr. Davis wrote, according to a copy of the memo reviewed by The Times.

Boeing Rejected Safety System For 737 Max Jet, Engineer Says

Texto completo: A senior Boeing engineer filed an internal ethics complaint this year saying that during the development of the 737 Max jet the company had rejected a safety system to minimize costs, equipment that he felt could have reduced risks that contributed to two fatal crashes.
Boeing has provided the complaint, which was reviewed by The New York Times, to the Department of Justice as part of a criminal investigation into the design of the Max, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry, who requested anonymity given the active legal matter. Federal investigators have questioned at least one former Boeing employee about the allegations, said another person with knowledge of the discussions, who similarly requested anonymity.
It is unclear what, if any, assessment investigators have made of the complaint.
The complaint, filed after the two crashes, builds on concerns about Boeing's corporate culture, as the company tries to repair its reputation and get the planes flying again.
Many current and former Boeing employees have privately discussed problems with the design and decision-making process on the 737 Max, outlining episodes when managers dismissed engineers' recommendations or put a priority on profits. The engineer who filed the ethics concerns this year, Curtis Ewbank, went a step further, lodging a formal complaint and calling out the chief executive for publicly misrepresenting the safety of the plane.
During the development of the 737 Max, Mr. Ewbank worked on the cockpit systems that pilots use to monitor and control the airplane. In his complaint to Boeing, he said managers had been urged to study a backup system for calculating the plane's airspeed. The system, known as synthetic airspeed, draws on several data sources to measure how fast a plane is moving.
Such equipment, Mr. Ewbank said, could detect when the angle-of-attack sensors, which measure the plane's position in the sky, were malfunctioning and prevent other systems from relying on that faulty information. A version of the system is used on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, a new plane model.
Mr. Ewbank did not respond to requests for comment.
In both crashes of the Max, an angle-of-attack sensor is believed to have failed, sending bad data to automated software designed to help prevent stalls. That software, known as MCAS, then activated erroneously, sending the planes into irrecoverable nose dives.
Mr. Ewbank noted in the complaint, "It is not possible to say for certain that any actual implementation of synthetic airspeed on the 737 Max would have prevented the accidents" in Ethiopia and Indonesia. But he said Boeing's actions on the issue pointed to a culture that emphasized profit, in some cases, at the expense of safety.
Throughout the development of the Max, Boeing tried to avoid adding components that could force airlines to train pilots in flight simulators, costing tens of millions of dollars over the life of an aircraft. Significant changes to the Max could also have required the more onerous approval process for a new plane, rather than the streamlined certification for a derivative model.
According to Mr. Ewbank's complaint, Ray Craig, a chief test pilot of the 737, and other engineers wanted to study the possibility of adding the synthetic airspeed system to the Max. But a Boeing executive decided not to look into the matter because of its potential cost and effect on training requirements for pilots.
"I was willing to stand up for safety and quality, but was unable to actually have an effect in those areas," Mr. Ewbank said in the complaint. "Boeing management was more concerned with cost and schedule than safety or quality."
His account, and the description of the system's benefits on the 787 Dreamliner, were backed up by a former senior Boeing employee involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing Justice Department investigation. The former Boeing employee, who worked on the Max, confirmed that executives had discussed the system. The employee said they had determined that trying to install such new technology on the 737 Max, a plane based on a 1960s design, would be too complicated and risky for the project, which was on a tight schedule.
But the former Boeing employee said Mr. Ewbank's complaint overstated the importance of such a system and understated the complexity of adding it to the 737 Max. This employee said Boeing had installed the system only on the 787 Dreamliners, noting that it was unclear how or whether the Max could similarly calculate synthetic airspeed, because it has fewer sensors. The employee also did not recall Boeing executives citing the potential impact on pilot training when deciding not to study adding the system.
A company spokesman, Gordon Johndroe, said in a statement, "Boeing offers its employees a number of channels for raising concerns and complaints and has rigorous processes in place, both to ensure that such complaints receive thorough consideration and to protect the confidentiality of employees who make them."
Boeing's chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, said in a speech on Wednesday that "it is critical we take a step back to humbly look at our culture."
"We're taking action as a result of the accidents to reinforce our values of safety, quality and integrity because we know we can always do better," Mr. Muilenburg said at the Economic Club of New York.
Shares of Boeing fell 2 percent in trading on Wednesday.
Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, declined to comment on the complaint.
Mr. Ewbank worked as an engineer at Boeing from 2010 to 2015, and was generally well regarded by his colleagues, according to two people with knowledge of his work, who requested anonymity to discuss a sensitive internal inquiry. Mr. Ewbank's complaint said he had left the company in part because he had become concerned that it was not making safety its priority. He returned to Boeing in 2018, and is working on the development of a new 777.
Mr. Ewbank said he hadn't filed a complaint during the development of the Max because, in part, the "fear of retaliation is high."
He stepped forward this year, he explained in the complaint, because of the "ethical imperative of an engineer -- to protect the safety of the public."
"Boeing is not in a business where safety can be treated as a secondary concern," Mr. Ewbank wrote in the complaint. "But the current culture of expediency of design-to-market and cost cutting does not permit any other treatment by the work force tasked with making executive management's fever dreams a reality."

Giuliani seeks jailed Manafort's help in flipping 2016 election narrative

Texto completo: In his quest to rewrite the history of the 2016 election, President Trump's personal attorney has turned to an unusual source of information: Trump's imprisoned former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
Rudolph W. Giuliani in recent months has consulted several times with Manafort through the federal prisoner's lawyer in pursuit of information about a disputed ledger that would bolster his theory that the real story of 2016 is not Russian interference to elect Trump, but Ukrainian efforts to support Hillary Clinton.
The alliance, which Giuliani acknowledged in an interview this week with The Washington Post, stems from a shared interest in a narrative that undermines the rationale for the special counsel investigation. That inquiry led to Manafort's imprisonment on tax and financial fraud allegations related to his work in Kiev for the political party of former president Viktor Yanukovych.
Giuliani's effort is gaining traction on Capitol Hill. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, have announced their renewal of an inquiry into any coordination between Ukraine and Democratic Party officials.
Manafort, who is serving a 7 1/2 -year term in a federal prison in Pennsylvania, has continued to express support for Trump, and Trump has never ruled out giving him a pardon.
Trump's push on a July 25 call to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the matter, and also probe former vice president Joe Biden, triggered an impeachment inquiry in the House. Many of the accusations Giuliani has been making about Ukraine recycle those that Manafort's team first promulgated.
Giuliani joined Trump's legal team in April 2018 to help defend the president against special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe, and the former mayor said he launched his own investigation into Ukraine late last year, which led him to consult with Manafort. He said he has not spoken directly to Manafort in two years.
"It was that I believed there was a lot of evidence that the [Democratic National Committee] and the Clinton campaign had a close connection to Ukrainian officials," Giuliani said, noting that he was never advocating for a pardon of Manafort. "It was all about Trump. I don't think I could exonerate Manafort."
Manafort's lawyer, Kevin Downing, did not respond to a request for comment.
Giuliani said his consultation with Manafort centered on trying to ascertain the veracity of a secret black ledger obtained by Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which the New York Times revealed in an August 2016 story. The Times said the ledger recorded $12.7 million in cash payments from Yanukovych's political party to Manafort. The revelation led Manafort to resign from the campaign.
Giuliani's narrative recasts Ukrainian accusations in 2016 against Manafort and efforts by Democratic operatives to gather research on Manafort after he took a leading role in Trump's campaign as a conspiracy involving both Ukrainian and American officials to swing the election for Clinton.
As part of that, Giuliani has focused on a theory that Manafort's team was promoting as early as 2017: that the Ukrainian government separately interfered in the 2016 campaign on behalf of Clinton through the activities of a Ukrainian American contract worker for the DNC, Alexandra Chalupa.
Chalupa confirmed she worked part-time as an outreach worker for the DNC to Ukrainian Americans and others, and met with Ukrainian officials from the embassy in Washington during that time. She said she "sounded the alarm" on Manafort outside her duties for the DNC, and sought to circulate that information, because she said she was concerned about Manafort's ties to Yanukovych, who was backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. She said the Ukrainian Embassy stayed clear of U.S. election matters, even with regard to Manafort.
"The White House has been pushing this narrative to distract from Donald Trump's gross abuse of power in pressuring a foreign country to interfere in our elections," DNC press secretary Adrienne Watson said in a statement.
There were Ukrainian Americans and people in the Ukrainian anti-corruption movement who were motivated to "shine a light" on Manafort's activities in Ukraine during 2016, and some Ukrainian Americans were active on behalf of Clinton, said Jeffrey Mankoff, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, but he said those activities aren't equivalent to Russia's state-sponsored intervention, which included the release of stolen emails and an extensive online disinformation campaign.
"One theory has been documented with extensive detail in the Mueller Report," Mankoff said. "The other is something that Rudy Giuliani and people in his orbit have conjured up as a way to cast aspersions and confuse the story."
Giuliani said he needed to consult with Manafort through the latter's lawyer this spring to ask whether a black ledger ever existed.
"I said, 'Was there really a black book? If there wasn't, I really need to know. Please tell him I've got to know,'" Giuliani recalled asking Manafort's lawyer. "He came back and said there wasn't a black book."
Giuliani said he was interested in the matter to prove his theory that the ledger's release, which he has claimed was done in conjunction with U.S. officials, was part of a falsified pretext for U.S. authorities to reopen a case against Manafort.
The FBI, however, already had a case open against Manafort before the 2016 campaign, having interviewed him twice about his work in Ukraine in 2013 and 2014.
The special counsel's office did not introduce the "black ledger" at Manafort's trial in Virginia in August 2018, nor did Manafort's defense team mention the document during his trial on tax and financial fraud charges, or try to show that it had been forged.
After a jury convicted Manafort of eight felonies, the former Trump campaign chairman pleaded guilty in Washington to avoid a second trial. As part of his plea, Manafort acknowledged that he made more than $60 million in Ukraine, laundering more than $30 million of it through foreign companies and bank accounts to hide it from the IRS and cheating the government out of $15 million in taxes. He also agreed that he had lobbied in the United States on behalf of Ukrainian officials without registering and that he conspired to tamper with witnesses in his case.
Serhiy Leshchenko, a Ukrainian journalist, anti-corruption campaigner and former member of parliament, said the ledger "was obtained by an anonymous source in the burned-out ruins of the headquarters of Yanukovych's party." His involvement in the release of part of its contents at a news conference, he said, was motivated by a desire that Manafort be brought to justice for his activities in Ukraine.
"Giuliani's entire approach is built on disinformation and the manipulation of facts," Leshchenko said in an op-ed in The Post. "Giuliani has developed a conspiracy theory in which he depicts my revelations about Manafort as an intervention in the 2016 U.S. election in favor of the Democratic Party."
In a text conversation with Manafort from August 2017 released by prosecutors, Fox News host Sean Hannity mentions "Ukraine interference" as one of the issues he was highlighting to attack Mueller. On his show that year, Hannity repeatedly claimed Ukraine had intervened in the 2016 election by sharing information on Manafort with a DNC contractor. Manafort did not respond directly to those claims but frequently encouraged and praised Hannity throughout the summer.
The White House also promoted the allegation.
"If you're looking for an example of a campaign coordinating with a foreign country or a foreign source, look no further than the DNC, who actually coordinated opposition research with the Ukrainian Embassy," White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in July 2017.
Grassley and Johnson, writing this week in a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr, again mentioned the allegations as a matter they intend to investigate.
"Ukrainian efforts, abetted by a U.S. political party, to interfere in the 2016 election should not be ignored," the senators wrote. "Such allegations of corruption deserve due scrutiny, and the American people have a right to know when foreign forces attempt to undermine our democratic processes," the senators wrote in the letter.

Texto completo: As the Trump impeachment narrative descends into the familiar bog of incomprehensibility, some guidance: Do not confuse Ukraine with Ukrainia.
Ukraine is a real country. Ukrainia is an imaginary place created by the national Democratic Party and the Washington press corps.
It was probably inevitable that after 2½ years of the Trump presidency, the Democrats and the press would end up in Ukrainia. For years, they have accused Mr. Trump, with some justification, of creating his own reality. Last week, they decided to create their own.
This story began two weeks ago, on a Thursday, with reports of a whistleblower filing a complaint to the intelligence community's inspector general about Mr. Trump's July 25 phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, the real president of the real Ukraine. For about 48 hours, the issue was simple: Had Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter?
That Sunday, Mr. Trump said he did bring up Mr. Biden during a conversation about corruption. On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she had approved a formal inquiry into Mr. Trump's impeachment. Then, in what became the working headline for everything else last week, "the dam broke."
If you live in Peoria, most likely you can't fully understand the meaning of "the dam broke." It's not that people in Peoria don't know what's going on. But like virtually everyone today, they get most of their news from screens—on cellphones, PCs or television. That isn't how Washington gets the news.
Besides the inevitable screens, people working in Washington still get their news as they did during the Watergate scandal—from the front pages of the print editions of national newspapers.
Those front pages were once the political world's official dam, releasing information into the world at a rate appropriate to the news of the day. Last week, that dam collapsed in an indiscriminate torrent.
The day after the White House released the text of Mr. Trump's conversation with Mr. Zelensky, the New York Times, under a banner headline—"Trump Asked for 'Favor' in Call, Memo Shows"—spread a reproduction of the transcript across the top half of the page, with six sections highlighted portentously in yellow marker. That day's Washington Post filled its first section with an astounding 19 separate "impeachment inquiry" stories, each more or less pegged to this single transcript.
On Friday, the Times returned with another banner headline: "Complaint Asserts a White House Cover-Up." Below that, again filling the top half of the page, is text from the unnamed whistleblower's semi-hearsay complaint and the inspector general's letter.
This is Ukrainia, the impeachment world inhabited by Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler and the rest of Washington—a world of newspaper melodrama, nonstop talking heads and hysterical social-media posts.
It's hard to recall the paint-by-numbers story line that presumably caused Nancy Pelosi to pull the trigger on impeachment—the notion that Mr. Trump's raising the investigation of a political opponent in a national-security conversation with a foreign leader was an abuse of presidential power and an impeachable offense.
At long last, the Democrats believed, they had a violative Trump act the public could understand, as opposed to what the New York Times described—with an utter absence of irony—as "months of murky messaging around a confusing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign."
It is barely a fortnight since this "understandable" impeachment charge emerged and already the story line is descending, again, into deep insider minutiae and ultimately something incomprehensible to the general public.
Adam Schiff—who admitted Wednesday that the sainted whistleblower touched base with the House Intelligence Committee days before unloading the complaint against Mr. Trump—is as always carpet-bombing the administration with subpoenas. He wants Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to testify. He wants to depose a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, and various others in the U.S. diplomatic corps no one's ever heard of. George Papadopoulos must be in there somewhere.
Meanwhile, the real Ukrainians look like they don't want to pursue the matter further, and that includes Mr. Trump's predictable exhortation to investigate Joe Biden.
The Democrats will fall back on the media to keep the impeachment game going, which it will. For much of the media, its primary activity has become feeding a voracious internet, which means the most minimally relevant anti-Trump stories are reported in microscopic detail whose purpose is to hold on to eyeballs with a permanent and presumably addictive sense of dread.
Politicians like Nancy Pelosi used to be better at assessing the political importance of events, but their judgment is now being overwhelmed by the ideological frenzies of modern media, culminating in the past two wild weeks.
For more than two years, the Democrats have asked the American people to buy into a succession of Trump takedowns—Russian collusion, Mueller obstruction, tax abuse and Stormy Daniels. Now they expect voters to spend the next year living with them in Ukrainia. There has to be a limit, and this may be it.

Texto completo: One question predominates among Democratic voters assessing which candidate to nominate as their standard-bearer for 2020: "Can they beat Donald Trump?"
One person who thus far has not been deemed up to the task by prospective voters is New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who has been languishing deep in the second tier of candidates in national polls. So dire was the situation that his campaign put out a memo a little over a week ago warning that if it didn't raise $1.7 million by the end of September, Booker would be forced to drop out of the race. His supporters rallied, and on Monday his campaign announced he had reached its target.
Booker has been dogged by concerns that his message of love and togetherness might not be right for the times. The New York Times summed it up in a headline: "Is Cory Booker too nice? (And is that bad?)"
But Booker believes strongly that his approach is the winning way.
In a recent interview, Booker told me that "grace and decency is the way to beat Trump. You can't beat him using his tactics, fighting him on his turf." Put another way: Never wrestle with a pig. The pig likes it, and you get dirty.
What we need is to have "a revival of civic grace, to have a more courageous empathy, to get back to understanding that we share a common cause and common purpose, and most certainly share a common destiny," Booker said. He lamented that Americans are "falling into tribalism in this country where we hate each other so much."
On some level, we all know this is true. Yet to many Americans, this kind of talk sounds weak. This is because we have a real misunderstanding about what strength is in politics.
There is "this sort of toxic masculinity that is this idea that to be strong, you have to be an ass," the senator noted. "The antidote to this moment and time is not more Trumpiness. That's why I constantly remind people that love is not weak. Do not confuse strength with meanness. Do not confuse being tough with being cruel. In fact, they are opposites."
Of Trump and Biden
Still, grace for your political enemies feels unnatural, even wrong. It's a posture that takes a lot of work to achieve.
Booker himself admitted on "Late Night with Seth Meyers" in July that he sometimes feels like punching Trump. Many of us know that feeling, so Booker is in no way suggesting that anyone stop hating what Trump is doing to the country. He's not suggesting we have to be perfect and never utter a bad word about Trump or his allies. He's just outlining an approach to beating Trump that sounds counterintuitive in the era of clapbacks and cancel culture.
It also doesn't mean that Booker can never criticize his Democratic opponents. When Booker pointed out after the last debate that some people were concerned former Vice President Joe Biden might fumble the ball if he became the nominee, many commentators said he was off brand. But that's because our culture is confused about what grace looks like. Grace does not ask you to be a doormat or have no opinions or never criticize. Loving people does not require you to stay silent when you see something that merits being called out. Certainly, Booker's concerns about Biden deserved to be heard and considered.
When I presented Booker with the disturbing math I've heard from too many Democrats behind the scenes that it will take a white man to beat Trump, he replied, "This idea that we need a safe candidate that we may not all be excited about, but he's the safe choice, is so contrary to our self-interest." He added, "And by the way, you make a big mistake if during the campaign the person says something that's racially offensive. That steps in it. And that's why, as a lot of people have written after the last debate, please, Joe Biden, clarify what you were saying about black parents. Please give the guy a chance to clarify because what he said was offensive to black people."
Hear him out
This pointed criticism of Biden's response to a question of how to repair the legacy of slavery is certainly within bounds. A lack of grace involves much more than critiquing an opponent. It looks a lot more like the ad hominem attacks the president launches nearly daily against all who aren't actively worshiping him. It looks like Trump's relentless attempts to pit Americans against one another. Trump does this because he cannot survive in an ordered universe free of hatred and chaos, so he works overtime to create disorder. His best hope is that Democrats will sink into the mud with him so that voters will ultimately tune out in disgust, leaving only the most hardened partisans showing up to vote.
Cory Booker gets this. Whether he will break through with his message and vision remains to be seen. But he deserves a real hearing.

All Roads Lead to Mueller

Texto completo: Watergate comparisons are in the air but a big difference is overlooked. Only a few days elapsed between news breaking of anonymous whistleblower allegations against Donald Trump (the actual report hadn't even been seen yet) and Nancy Pelosi's opening of an impeachment inquiry.
No Ben Bradlee. No weeks and months as the story developed to ponder and reflect on what it might mean. Luckily, media ranks today are overflowing with people who don't need to labor their minds over the matters that come before them. They instantly know the answer because Twitter tells them.
And yet, once again, their rush to judgment is getting ready to blow up in their faces.
Numerous press accounts claimed falsely, even with the evidence in hand, that Mr. Trump had asked for a "favor" from Ukraine's president in the form of "dirt" on Joe Biden. Yet the plain words of the available transcript show the "favor" he sought was cooperation with the Justice Department's perfectly proper investigation of the 2016 election.
Now come reports in the Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post that at the behest of Attorney General William Barr, the administration has reached out in similar fashion to other governments, including Italy's, Britain's and Australia's.
House Democrats, of course, are free to impeach over any charge that can win a majority, including a claim Mr. Trump sought foreign interference in the 2020 election. But they didn't bargain on the Russia-collusion fiasco forcing its way into the drama they are trying to create. Even a daily email blast from the Trump-unfriendly Columbia Journalism Review acknowledges that the "Trump-Ukraine story, it's safe to say, is now about much more than Trump and Ukraine."
Democrats were going to face powerful counterarguments anyway: The U.S. media itself had raised questions about Mr. Biden; Mr. Trump had merely asked Ukraine to take up the allegations with the U.S. attorney general, which is a pretty good shield against Mr. Trump himself lapsing toward any illegalities.
But more important is the new outpouring of reporting that sets these questions in the broader context of a legitimate inquiry into the actions of U.S. intelligence agencies in the last presidential election. The implications are not small. Democrats may have to reconsider their selection of Adam Schiff as impeachment frontman because of his role in promoting the Russia-collusion canard. Questions will have to be asked about the motives of the whistleblower -- a CIA official who dropped his highly polished bomb on the eve of a Justice Department inspector general's report that will begin opening the lid on FBI and CIA actions during the 2016 campaign.
At least by the public, questions should also be asked about the mainstream media's conspicuous reluctance to look into Democratic and Obama administration behavior in the Russia-collusion matter. Why, it's almost like the press doesn't want the subject investigated, for fear of what might be learned about the press.
Three years ago, I had an epiphany watching the George Stephanopoulos show on ABC. Mr. Trump behaved badly (typically) when the family of a slain soldier appeared at the Democratic convention, but he never equated the dead soldier with a radical Islamic terrorist, as one of the ABC show's panelists said.
An unspoken decision seems to have been made that Mr. Trump has no reputation to injure; he is an illegitimate president, so the media is free to put words in his mouth. It happened with his Charlottesville comments. It happened with his infamous tweet that tried to say something a lot more complicated than just that four congresswomen of color should "go back" to their countries of ethnic origin.
And it continues. The magical ellipses have been rolled out again to make Mr. Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president sound a lot less ambiguous and a lot more incriminating than it was.
The media's hopscotching from one impeachment cause to another, until they landed on one Mrs. Pelosi would endorse, is not likely at this late date to convince a broad spectrum of Americans. How fitting, though, that they hopscotched to one that serves Mr. Trump's own obsession with 2016. All roads lead back to Mueller, and the fact that Mr. Trump, surely one of the most controversial and sinning of presidents, may also be the most sinned against.
He is the paradox that keeps on giving. Illicit actions by FBI chief James Comey may have helped elect him. Joe Biden, said to be the opponent he fears most, is being taken out by friendly fire. Questions about 2016 that could have been aired years ago, if the mainstream media had played it straight, may soon crowd out the Democratic hopes of a 2020 campaign focused on his manifest deficiencies.
If liberals are looking for someone to blame, they might start with their own favorite news outlets, which owed it to them to keep their critique of Mr. Trump grounded in realities and even mention the occasional unwelcome truth once in a while.

Escalation From Beijing on Its National Day

Texto completo: Hong Kong -- President Xi Jinping wanted Tuesday -- Beijing's National Day -- to be a celebration of the 70th anniversary of communist China. Instead, it marked an escalation in violence against Hong Kong. For the first time, police fired a live round at a protester, an 18-year-old student, who suffered a chest wound.
National Day had loomed for months as a potential milestone for the protest movement that has roiled Hong Kong since June. Authorities wanted to quell the unrest before Oct. 1, while protesters strove to keep it alive until then -- and they prevailed. Tuesday's shooting will invigorate the protests, and Beijing has no obvious solution to this political crisis.
In a video address Tuesday night, a police spokeswoman claimed that protesters had attacked officers, one of whom fired "to save his own life and his colleagues' lives." She added: "The police do not wish to see anyone injured in the incident. It is really heart-breaking."
Hong Kongers don't buy it. They believe only international pressure has prevented a massacre. They were especially heartened when President Trump told reporters in August that "it would be very hard to deal" with Beijing "if it's another Tiananmen Square" in Hong Kong. Wong Chun Wing, 20, told me he first regarded Mr. Trump as crazy but has come to respect him because he stands up for human rights and challenges China. Mr. Wong doesn't believe Hillary Clinton would have taken such a hard line. Protesters now carry American flags as "a way to say thank you," he said.
Emboldened by international support, Hong Kongers say they will quit the streets only if the government meets their "five demands, not one less," as the rallying cry goes. Beijing is afraid of conceding too much, lest mainland Chinese learn that demonstrations and disorder yield results.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam acquiesced to one demand last month, agreeing to withdraw the extradition bill that triggered the large-scale protests in June. "That invited a lot of criticism in China," said Fu King Wa, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong who has been tracking online discussion in the mainland. "They take withdrawal of the bill as a major concession" and question why the government would "back down" in response "to a rioter who created violence."
It would be even harder for Beijing to accede to the protesters' remaining four demands -- for free elections, an independent inquiry into police violence, official acknowledgment that the protests aren't riots, and amnesty for those who've been arrested. Instead authorities are working to discredit the protesters. While the vast majority have been peaceful, a minority have brawled with cops, thrown Molotov cocktails or bricks, started fires, and damaged property. Ms. Lam argues that giving them amnesty would "run counter to rule of law."
Following the lead of their mainland counterparts, Hong Kong authorities are also attempting to buy legitimacy with material blandishments. In August Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced a US$2.4 billion spending package, which includes numerous handouts. In a New York Times op-ed last week, Ms. Lam promised "bold initiatives to tackle deep-seated problems, such as access to affordable housing," along with "numerous major projects and initiatives . . . that will provide thousands of jobs and opportunities for young people to explore for years to come."
In another effort at appeasement, Ms. Lam launched a series of "community dialogue sessions," where the public can vent concerns. Some in Hong Kong have speculated that without directly addressing protesters' demands, she may also establish commissions to explore how Hong Kong can reform its police department or gradually work toward a more representative government. But no one braves water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas for listening sessions or the dithering of bureaucrats. And dialogue, like a commission or special report, sets the expectation that the government will eventually address Hong Kongers' concerns. A disappointing outcome would only exacerbate the public discontent.
Beijing and its pawns in the Hong Kong government have tried to intimidate protesters with nonlethal force and wait until their energy runs out. That strategy has failed, and Tuesday's violence will add to the protesters' momentum. Against all odds, Hong Kongers succeeded in defeating the extradition bill that presented an immediate threat to their autonomy, calling global attention to Beijing's abuses of power, and leaving Beijing with no good way to end an embarrassing spectacle.
The greatest threat to their success may be the prospect of a U.S.-China trade deal. If Mr. Trump succeeds in striking one, he may be less eager to take Beijing to task over Hong Kong. The risk for protesters is that the world will lose interest in the confrontation, emboldening Beijing.

The majority of nutrition studies are observational--in the case of red meat, they asked if meat-eaters were less healthy, and if those who ate more were also less healthy than those who ate less.
But it's extremely difficult to know what someone is eating;many study participants struggle to remember and accurately report their diets.And meat-eaters
may differ from those who don't eat meat, or eat less, in a variety of ways that also influence health.
Researchers try to correct for those variations, but the statistical analyses are difficult and, many experts say, not particularly reliable in a system as complex as human nutrition.
Even in the best of circumstances, observational studies do not prove cause and effect; they only suggest correlations.But policymakers often rely on this data when devising guidelines.
2 Studies do turn up small health benefits from eating less meat Here are some of the outcomes cited by the authors of the new research: If people were to reduce meat consumption by three servings a week, there might be one to six fewer heart attacks per 1,000 people.But there would be no effect on deaths resulting from heart disease or any cause overall. For cancer, the group reports that decreasing meat consumption by three servings a week might result in seven fewer cancer deaths per 1,000 people. But there would be no effect on the risk of getting breast, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic or prostate cancer.
3 But what does that mean for you personally?
Frank Hu, professor and chair of the nutrition department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, wrote in an email:
"These risk reductions are not small from a public health point of view and could save hundreds and thousands of lives in the U.S.,because of the high prevalence of people consuming diets high in red and processed meats.Few dietary or lifestyle changes or even a drug could have multiple health benefits on major causes of deaths."
But Dr.Dennis Bier of Baylor said the studies of meat consumption are so flawed that it is naïve to assume these risk reductions are caused by eating less meat.
"The rules of scientific proof are the same for physics as for nutrition," he said in a telephone interview.But unlike experiments in physics, where investigators can control variables and determine causality, in nutrition "you can't conduct the experiment."
4 Major medical organizations are sticking to their dietary recommendations
The American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association, among others, immediately released statements reiterating their advice to eat less red meat for better health.
5 We're all going to have to live with some uncertainty "The guidelines are based on papers that presumably say there is evidence for what they say.And there isn't.That's the history of nutrition,"said Bier.
Dr.David Allison, dean of the Indiana University School of Public Health-- Bloomington, said there is a difference "between evidence for drawing a scientific conclusion, and making or recommending an action."
"The standards of evidence for the former are scientific matters and should not depend on extra scientific considerations"he added. "The standards of evidence for the latter are matters of personal judgment or in some cases legislation."
His advice: "People should be aware of the uncertainty and make their decisions based on that awareness."

To the Editor:
Re "Why a Trump Impeachment Should Terrify You," by Frank Bruni (column, nytimes.com, Sept. 25):
I'm not afraid of what happens if we impeach President Trump. I'm afraid of what happens if we don't.
Right now, the standard for impeachment is quite low, as it should be. Three presidents have faced impeachment in the past, all for what I would consider relatively small crimes measured against what we are seeing today.
Andrew Johnson violated a federal act by removing an official. Richard Nixon tried to stifle the investigation of a burglary. Bill Clinton lied to a grand jury. As Representative Barbara Jordan brilliantly argued in her Watergate speech, the only question we need to ask of impeachment is if the president violated the public trust.
Mr. Trump far exceeds this standard. He lies constantly and may have broken numerous laws regarding corruption, extortion, campaign finance, bribery, collusion, conspiracy and obstruction.
If Mr. Trump is not impeached, the bar for impeachment will be raised to such heights that it will cease to be a functional part of the Constitution. Congress will lose its co-equal status and serve at the behest of a vastly more powerful executive branch. Our republic is on a knife's edge. Indeed, as Nancy Pelosi said, quoting Thomas Paine, "The times have found us."

To the Editor:
Re "What's Different Now" (news analysis, front page, Sept. 25):
Carl Hulse writes that "Republicans paid a steep political price in the midterm elections for moving to impeach Bill Clinton in 1998." Although this thought is often heard, it is badly misleading.
In the midterm elections of 1998, following the impeachment of President Clinton by the House, Republicans did lose five House seats to the Democrats, but they retained control of the House. In the Senate the Republicans maintained their majority. Most important, the Republicans went on to win the White House in the next two elections.
One must conclude that it cost Republicans very little to attempt to remove from office even a president as widely popular as Bill Clinton. Today, since Mr. Trump's approval rating is around 43 percent, the Democrats stand to lose more from not impeaching him than from letting him slide. Perhaps they have now realized this.

Trump's Desire to Meet His Accuser
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Seeks Whistle-Blower's Identity" (nytimes.com, Sept. 30):
So President Trump says he wants to "meet my accuser." That's a first.
Does he realize how foolish he sounds now, having spent his life avoiding all the women who have accused him of crimes, and all the Trump University victims who have wanted to confront him and all the small contractors who were stiffed by him?
"Meet my accuser"? Just step outside any of your rallies, Mr. Trump!

When Men Are Sexually Abused in the Military
To the Editor:
Re "Men Tell Their Stories of Rape in the Service" (news article, Sept. 12):
As trauma psychologists, we thank you for shining a spotlight on the high prevalence of sexual assault of men in the military and the incredible pain associated with it.
For too long, this experience has been denied or minimized. The sexual violation of boys and men is a much bigger public health problem than previously realized. Indeed, at least one in six men is sexually abused before his 18th birthday, and this number rises to one in four across a man's life span.
The negative mental health consequences from such terrifying violations include post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, depression, anxiety and suicidal behavior. The effects don't stop there.
Many men live with related impairments in their relationships, finding it hard to trust or feel safe in communion with others. They largely live in silence, fearing that if they tell someone, all the negative things they think about themselves will be confirmed.
Our group at Yale is conducting a national study trying to help male sexual abuse survivors get the help they need. Healing from sexual trauma is possible, and even probable, with evidence-informed interventions.

Texto completo: Weeks after the city's Board of Supervisors declared the National Rifle Association a terrorist organization, the mayor clarifies that the resolution will not change city policy.
The city of San Francisco is pulling back from its face-off with the National Rifle Association, weeks after its Board of Supervisors declared the group a domestic terrorist organization. But the N.R.A. said it is not yet prepared to drop a lawsuit it filed against the city in response.
A resolution the board approved on Sept. 3 called for the city's agencies to limit their relationships with companies that do business with the N.R.A. But Mayor London Breed said in a memo on Sept. 23 that the resolution was not binding, and that it would not change the practices of city agencies. The existence of the memo was previously reported by The San Francisco Examiner.
The mayor's move came two weeks after the N.R.A. filed suit against San Francisco, alleging that the city had violated the organization's First Amendment right to free speech and was effectively moving to "blacklist anyone linked to the N.R.A."
In the memo, the mayor and the city attorney, Dennis Herrera, wrote, "The city's contracting process and policies have not changed and will not change as a result of the resolution." The notice was circulated to the heads of all city departments.
"There is an epidemic of gun violence plaguing our country, and we need to hold organizations like the N.R.A. accountable for their obstruction to real reforms to make our communities safer," Ms. Breed said in a statement on Tuesday. "While this nonbinding resolution has no force of law behind it, this doesn't take away from the fact that the N.R.A. continues to shamefully stand in the way of every single piece of gun control legislation."
John Coté, a spokesman for Mr. Herrera, said the Sept. 23 memo was "not a concession," adding: "It just explains what has always been true -- the resolution does not change the law. If the N.R.A. thinks this is a win, it's only because their lawsuit completely distorts what the resolution actually does."
William A. Brewer III, a lawyer for the N.R.A., said that city officials "wisely have attempted to pull back from what we alleged, the association alleged, was a clear violation of the association's First Amendment rights."
But the group is not ready to drop its litigation.
"What we hope is that the Board of Supervisors will further mitigate the damage they've done," he said, adding that the organization would like to see the board rescind or repeal the resolution, "or walk away from it in some binding way."
The group considered San Francisco's original declaration part of a series of actions against it by Democratic leaders in the wake of several mass shootings. The Board of Supervisors passed the resolution two days after three people were killed and 13 injured in a shooting at a garlic festival in Gilroy, Calif.
"I knew all along that this was a nonbinding resolution," Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who introduced the measure, said in a statement on Tuesday. "We made our point: The N.R.A. is a terrorist organization. I will keep fighting them using every tool at my disposal."
For now, the group is declaring victory.
"Through these actions and our public advocacy, we hope the message is now clear," Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.'s chief executive, said on its website on Tuesday. "The N.R.A. will always fight to protect our members and the constitutional freedoms in which they believe."

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris should take a note from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s 2020 playbook and put her primary campaign out of its misery.
It is over for the California lawmaker. This is not her moment. Voters are not interested. It is only a matter of time before reality forces Harris to end her candidacy, so she may as well do it while she can still bow out with some dignity.
The senator’s 2020 campaign, which has imploded in the polls, is making major changes to its senior staff, according to reports. That alone is a bad sign for the senator. What is worse is that the changes have also reportedly taken her senior aides by surprise, creating an additional layer of anxiety within an already struggling campaign.
In other words, it is a mess for Harris.
Her 2020 campaign is adding her Senate Chief of Staff Rohini Kosoglu and senior adviser Laphonza Butler to the mix. The two Senate staffers will assist in Harris’ 2020 bid on a permanent basis. The senator’s current campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez, will stay right where he is, focusing on budgeting and long-term strategies while Kosoglu and Butler will take over whatever campaign duties remain.
The staff changes come amid Harris’ pitiful attempts to ingratiate herself to the Democratic base. In recent weeks, she has embraced ludicrous gimmicks, including calling on Twitter to suspend President Trump's account and calling also for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh based on a heavily amended and deeply flawed New York Times op-ed.
“We need to get to the truth about Kavanaugh. And I believe the best path to truth and accountability is through a formal impeachment process,” she said in an op-ed published last week by Elle. “That’s why I called on the House Judiciary Committee to open an impeachment inquiry and take a serious look at whether Kavanaugh lied under oath during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.”
Calling for an impeachment inquiry over a since-corrected and widely criticized op-ed is definitely a thing a serious candidate does. Yep. Yessir.
On a more serious note: Sudden staff changes and absurd fantasy fulfillment are not the things of winning primary campaigns. In fact, this is all extremely reminiscent of the Gillibrand 2020 candidacy, and you know how that ended. But you try telling that to Harris’ team.
For his own part, campaign manager Rodriguez assured reporters that the changes in campaign staff had been in the works for some time. Harris, for her part, downplayed concerns that her candidacy is running on fumes.
"I'm very proud of our team," the senator said this week in an interview with CNN. "We have accomplished a great amount of work thus far, which makes me a top-tier candidate, and by many accounts within the top four, maybe five, in a field of over 20 people. So something's been going right and we're going to continue moving ahead."
Harris’ polling average has plummeted from its high of 15.2% in early July, according to a RealClearPolitics, to 4.6%, just behind the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
Good luck in Iowa, senator.

Escalation From Beijing on Its National Day; As a live round wounds a Hong Kong protester, there's no obvious solution to the political crisis.

Texto completo: Hong Kong
President Xi Jinping wanted Tuesday—Beijing's National Day—to be a celebration of the 70th anniversary of communist China. Instead, it marked an escalation in violence against Hong Kong. For the first time, police fired a live round at a protester, an 18-year-old student, who suffered a chest wound.
National Day had loomed for months as a potential milestone for the protest movement that has roiled Hong Kong since June. Authorities wanted to quell the unrest before Oct. 1, while protesters strove to keep it alive until then—and they prevailed. Tuesday's shooting will invigorate the protests, and Beijing has no obvious solution to this political crisis.
In a video address Tuesday night, a police spokeswoman claimed that protesters had attacked officers, one of whom fired "to save his own life and his colleagues' lives." She added: "The police do not wish to see anyone injured in the incident. It is really heart-breaking."
Hong Kongers don't buy it. They believe only international pressure has prevented a massacre. They were especially heartened when President Trump told reporters in August that "it would be very hard to deal" with Beijing "if it's another Tiananmen Square" in Hong Kong. Wong Chun Wing, 20, told me he first regarded Mr. Trump as crazy but has come to respect him because he stands up for human rights and challenges China. Mr. Wong doesn't believe Hillary Clinton would have taken such a hard line. Protesters now carry American flags as "a way to say thank you," he said.
Emboldened by international support, Hong Kongers say they will quit the streets only if the government meets their "five demands, not one less," as the rallying cry goes. Beijing is afraid of conceding too much, lest mainland Chinese learn that demonstrations and disorder yield results.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam acquiesced to one demand last month, agreeing to withdraw the extradition bill that triggered the large-scale protests in June. "That invited a lot of criticism in China," said Fu King Wa, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong who has been tracking online discussion in the mainland. "They take withdrawal of the bill as a major concession" and question why the government would "back down" in response "to a rioter who created violence."
It would be even harder for Beijing to accede to the protesters' remaining four demands—for free elections, an independent inquiry into police violence, official acknowledgment that the protests aren't riots, and amnesty for those who've been arrested. Instead authorities are working to discredit the protesters. While the vast majority have been peaceful, a minority have brawled with cops, thrown Molotov cocktails or bricks, started fires, and damaged property. Mrs. Lam argues that giving them amnesty would "run counter to rule of law."
Following the lead of their mainland counterparts, Hong Kong authorities are also attempting to buy legitimacy with material blandishments. In August Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced a US$2.4 billion spending package, which includes numerous handouts. In a New York Times op-ed last week, Mrs. Lam promised "bold initiatives to tackle deep-seated problems, such as access to affordable housing," along with "numerous major projects and initiatives . . . that will provide thousands of jobs and opportunities for young people to explore for years to come."
In another effort at appeasement, Mrs. Lam launched a series of "community dialogue sessions," where the public can vent concerns. Some in Hong Kong have speculated that without directly addressing protesters' demands, she may also establish commissions to explore how Hong Kong can reform its police department or gradually work toward a more representative government. But no one braves water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas for listening sessions or the dithering of bureaucrats. And dialogue, like a commission or special report, sets the expectation that the government will eventually address Hong Kongers' concerns. A disappointing outcome would only exacerbate the public discontent.
Beijing and its pawns in the Hong Kong government have tried to intimidate protesters with nonlethal force and wait until their energy runs out. That strategy has failed, and Tuesday's violence will add to the protesters' momentum. Against all odds, Hong Kongers succeeded in defeating the extradition bill that presented an immediate threat to their autonomy, calling global attention to Beijing's abuses of power, and leaving Beijing with no good way to end an embarrassing spectacle.
The greatest threat to their success may be the prospect of a U.S.-China trade deal. If Mr. Trump succeeds in striking one, he may be less eager to take Beijing to task over Hong Kong. The risk for protesters is that the world will lose interest in the confrontation, emboldening Beijing.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is rarely criticized for being too nice on Twitter. But who can support his oddly cheerful conduct of foreign social-media relations on Tuesday morning? Mr. Trump wished a happy birthday to China's communist government, currently celebrating seven decades of suppressing liberty. Americans must hope this is merely the start of the deal on trade and not a policy statement on freedom in Asia.
"Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China!," tweeted America's duly elected president to the regime that has never held a free election.
Ken Meyer at Mediaite writes :
While Trump may think that his tweet will lead to some positive effect on the trade war between the U.S. and China, the fact remains that the president just bid his compliments to a communist regime that committed numerous atrocities and human rights abuses against its own people for decades. Trump's tweet also comes just hours after the news broke that a Hong Kong police officer shot a protester for the first time since demonstrations began against China's tightening of control over the territory.
Someone named Benjamin Fearnow writes in Newsweek:
Liberal journalist David Corn joined dozens of members of the media who immediately pounced on the president's words of encouragement to the Chinese Communist Party he frequently ridicules during trade war talks. "Go gangster communism!!!" he responded.
As if communism needs a modifier to emphasize its criminality. By some estimates Chinese communism has killed an average of nearly a million people each year the regime has been in power. Fortunately the pace has dramatically slowed and economic freedom has massively increased since the government's Great Leap Forward of the late 1950s and early 1960s killed some 45 million people . Soon after, the Cultural Revolution killed perhaps a million more. A move toward economic freedom beginning in the 1970s has pulled hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.
But freedom has declined since Mr. Xi came to power in 2012. Ominously, he has venerated the regime's founder and author of its murderous early decades, Mao Zedong. This has been a surprise to some who hoped Mr. Xi might be something of a reformer, given that his own father had been purged from a leadership role in the Mao era and spent years in the wilderness. As Mr. Xi was ascending to the top of the Chinese dictatorship in 2012, Andrew Higgins wrote in the Washington Post about the father:
...Xi senior is particularly popular with many liberals, who remember him as unusually open-minded and tolerant — and hope that his son, under a carapace of political rectitude, is perhaps similar.
Not everyone had high hopes, as Mr. Higgins reported at the time:
Frank Dikotter, a Dutch scholar who is working on a book on the party's early years in power, urged caution in viewing Xi's father as a "great moderate." Archive material records him demanding an "active attack" against Christian churches. He never questioned one-party rule. But, said Dikotter, he does seem to have been broader-minded than the norm and "doesn't come across as a big mister nasty" who saw violence as a solution.
Given the carnage of China's revolutionary era, one had to be extremely nasty to stand out from the other commies. As for the current Mr. Xi, he hasn't been a sweetheart when it comes to human rights. Stuart Lau reports in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post on one resident of the People's Republic who is currently serving a life sentence:
Jailed Uygur academic Ilham Tohti has been awarded one of Europe's top human rights prizes, as Beijing comes under pressure over its treatment of the predominantly Muslim population in its far western Xinjiang region.
...More than a million ethnic Uygurs and members of other largely Muslim ethnic groups are believed to have been detained in extrajudicial internment camps in Xinjiang in a crackdown that began in early 2017. The camps have prompted an international outcry, but the government says they are vocational training centres and part of an effort to combat terrorism.
There have been reports of torture and forced labour at the camps, and some members of the Uygur diaspora in Turkey have also complained of forced family separation in Xinjiang, with children ordered to go to boarding schools.
Meanwhile Chris Buckley reports in the New York Times that on a recent visit to Xinyang, China, Mr. Xi honored a memorial to communist fighters from the Mao era. But official accounts made no mention of the vastly larger number of peasants in the area who were starved to death by the regime. Notes Mr. Buckley:
In his seven years in power, Mr. Xi has acted on the belief that to control China he must control its history. His administration has molded textbooks, television shows, movies and museums to match his narrative of national unity and rejuvenation under iron party rule...
Exposing the party's historical setbacks has become increasingly unwelcome under Mr. Xi... He warned officials in 2013 to take heed of the unraveling of the Soviet Union, when liberal historians dismantled its revolutionary heritage.
"Why did the Soviet Union disintegrate? Why did the Soviet Communist Party collapse?" Mr. Xi said. One important reason, he said, was that its leaders had allowed Stalin, Lenin and Soviet history to be denigrated.
"There's a lesson in that for us," Mr. Xi said.
For Mr. Trump, it's a lesson not to expect too much in the way of reform from China's dictator.

A Simple Regimen Can Prevent TB. So Why Aren’t More People On It?

Texto completo: Tuberculosis struck 10 million people worldwide in 2017, killing 1.6 million of them - a toll greater than that of HIV, malaria, measles and Ebola combined. TB is the leading infectious killer around the globe; nearly 1.8 billion people are carrying the bacterium that causes the disease.
The world is sorely in need of new ways to prevent TB, not just treat it. Drugs to stave off the infection do exist, but the monthslong regimens are difficult and people often do not finish the prescribed courses.
That may soon change: A new drug course, lasting just one month, is just as effective as longer regimens at preventing TB, scientists reported earlier this year. The results have left experts hoping for new progress against a disease that has been an intractable enemy for centuries.
“I think it’s a moment of really extraordinary promise,” said Mike Frick, co-lead for TB at Treatment Action Group, an advocacy organization.
Among the plagues sweeping developing countries, TB has often taken a back seat to competing and urgent priorities, especially HIV. (The two are linked: HIV patients account for 1 in 5 TB deaths worldwide.)
In August, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug to treat the deadliest strain of TB - but it was the first approval for a TB drug in more than 40 years. Diagnostic tests for the infection are not sensitive and mostly rely on sputum, which many sick people struggle to produce.
And prevention? “It’s really downplayed and it’s ignored, and it’s ignored to a degree that is scandalous,” said Dr. Richard Chaisson, professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
One challenge is identifying those who should receive preventive drugs. The drugs are the clear choice for the most vulnerable groups: people with HIV; people whose immune systems are compromised because they take biologic drugs for Crohn’s disease, arthritis or other diseases; and young children and others who share a home with someone infected.
Protection for these groups should last at least five years, studies suggest.
But 1 in 3 people worldwide harbor the TB bacteria, and just 1 in 10 will go on to develop the disease. Who among them should be treated?
“The biggest issue has been to identify those 10%,” said Dr. Eliud Wandwalo, senior coordinator for TB at the nonprofit Global Fund. “We don’t have any good indicator to show you which of these people who are infected might progress and become sick.”
For many people who are healthy, or who simply feel healthy, the drugs have been a tough sell.
For decades, the standard course has been an antibiotic called isoniazid that kills the bacteria causing TB only when they are replicating. The drug must be taken daily for nine months, in the hope of catching the bacteria as they multiply, and it can cause numbness, nausea and fever. Isoniazid also can cause liver toxicity, so people taking it are advised not to drink alcohol for the entire nine months.
“Traditionally, completion rates have been very poor,” said Alison Grant, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
Doctors sometimes decline to prescribe the antibiotic because of worries about exposing otherwise healthy people to the side effects, or contributing to a rise in drug-resistant bacteria if patients don’t complete the full course.
Both those concerns are unfounded, said Grant. Doctors “just stay away from it, despite the evidence showing otherwise.”
In the past decade, scientists have come up with two shorter courses: a drug called rifampin taken every day for four months; or a combination of isoniazid and rifapentine, taken once weekly for three months.
Still, for some people, remembering to take the pills - and all 11 pills together - once a week can be more challenging than taking them every day, Grant said.
An alternative emerged in March, when Chaisson and his colleagues published a study in The New England Journal of Medicine showing that a regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine, taken daily for one month, is as effective at preventing TB, safer and more likely to be completed than the traditional nine-month course of isoniazid.
The World Health Organization met to review this new regimen in July and is expected to endorse it later this year. The study was conducted only in people infected with HIV, however, and it is likely that the WHO will approve the regimen only for those patients.
Chaisson thinks preventive drugs should be given to a far larger population.
“If we had an intervention for HIV that reduces mortality by 37%, the WHO would have an emergency meeting and it would be recommended for uptake in the entire world,” he said. “But when it’s for TB, people just sort of shrug.”
“It’s just a stolid world of never-changing practices - slow to adopt, slow to change, slow to evolve,” Chaisson added.
Cost is another hurdle. The one- and three-month courses both rely on rifapentine, made by Sanofi. In 2013, after a yearlong advocacy campaign to lower the costs, Sanofi dropped the price of rifapentine in the three-month course from $71 to $32.
The new one-month course requires more rifapentine overall than the three-month regimen, and so is more expensive. Advocates and global health organizations are in intense negotiations with Sanofi to lower the cost to just $15 for the entire one-month treatment course.
At least two companies are said to be developing generic versions, which also may bring down the cost. Without a lower price, donors like the federal government’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief are unlikely to support the new course.
Still, experts said they are more optimistic about TB prevention than ever before.
Just a year ago, funding organizations still presented countries with a false choice between prioritizing antiretroviral therapy for HIV and preventive therapy for TB, said Chaisson.
But PEPFAR has begun to prioritize TB prevention. National governments will have to follow in order to turn back TB.
South Africa has shown what political will can accomplish, said Dr. Gavin Churchyard, a TB specialist based in Johannesburg. The country once had an abysmal TB preventive therapy program, with just a few thousand people taking the pills.
But in 2008, after Pakishe Aaron Motsoaledi, then the country’s health minister, made TB prevention a national priority, the numbers began to rise dramatically. By 2011, 350,000 people were enrolled in preventive therapy. Today, South Africa still has the world’s largest TB preventive therapy program, Churchyard said.
Chaisson did a “back-of-the-envelope” calculation, published in 2017 in the Lancet Global Health, suggesting that if such preventive therapy had been rolled out worldwide, several million deaths could have been averted.

Texto completo: BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The prime minister of Lebanon gave more than $ 16 million to a South African bikini model who said they had a romantic relationship after they met at a luxury resort in the Seychelles, according to South African court documents obtained by The New York Times.
The prime minister, Saad Hariri, was not in office when he sent the money starting in 2013, and the transfer does not appear to have violated any Lebanese or South African laws.
But the revelation in a South African court case this year of the extravagant gifts to a younger model comes during a difficult period for Mr. Hariri, the top Sunni Muslim politician in Lebanon and an American ally.
His business and political empires have fallen on hard times, depriving many employees of their pay. His family's construction conglomerate, Saudi Oger, ceased operations in 2017, and his media outlets have struggled to pay salaries.
A looming financial crisis in Lebanon has set off antigovernment protests. This month, Mr. Hariri said the Lebanese government would declare an "economic state of emergency" and push through austerity measures.
Mr. Hariri did not respond to questions sent to his media team about his relationship with the model, Candice van der Merwe, or any gifts to her.
The gifts have no clear tie to Lebanon's current economic woes and Mr. Hariri, a married father of three, was sufficiently wealthy to have made the payments himself. Forbes magazine estimated his net worth in 2013 at $ 1.9 billion, thanks largely to business interests he inherited after his father, Rafik Hariri, who also served as prime minister, was assassinated in Beirut in 2005.
Since then, the younger Hariri has remained one of Lebanon's best known political figures. He makes frequent state visits to Paris, Washington and Riyadh and favors pro-Western policies, but heads a power-sharing government that includes Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party backed by Iran.
His bank transfers to Ms. van der Merwe were made between his two terms as prime minister, but while he was the head of his political party, the Future Movement. He was 43 at the time of the first transfer, in 2013. He was then running family businesses in construction and other domains and living in France and Saudi Arabia.
Ms. van der Merwe was 20 years old. She had appeared in energy drink promotions and swimwear calendars, but her reported annual income had never exceeded $ 5,400.
In a promotional interview in a skimpy bikini conducted in conjunction with the publication of a swimsuit calendar in 2011, she said her interests included listening to Jack Johnson and Celine Dion, riding Jet Skis and flying helicopters with her father.
Then in May 2013, her assets suddenly soared, thanks to a transfer of $ 15,299,965 from a Lebanese bank.
"Lady luck, it would seem, suddenly smiled on the applicant," a South African judge wrote in 2015.
The transfer would likely have remained secret had the large sum not raised suspicions among the South African financial and tax authorities, who investigated and deemed it taxable income.
Ms. van der Merwe insisted the money was a gift, and not taxable according to South African law. In subsequent court cases, she argued the money had been given to her without conditions and identified her benefactor as Mr. Hariri.
"Love you my Saad :)," Ms. van der Merwe wrote in an email to Mr. Hariri in which she provided her bank account details so he could transfer the money, telling him it was so she could buy property.
The money landed in her account shortly afterward.
The New York Times was unable to reach Ms. van der Merwe, but two of her previous lawyers, her current lawyer, and her father, who has represented her in tax court, declined to comment and to make her available for an interview.
In an affidavit cited in the court documents, Ms. van der Merwe said she had been recruited at age 19 to travel to an exclusive resort in the Seychelles Islands called The Plantation Club that was "frequented by some of the richest private individuals in the world," including billionaires "for whom money is no object."
At this "playground of the super wealthy," she said, "it is the norm for lavish parties and events to be held" and models were flown in "to lend a sense of glamour and exclusivity." The models' passports were taken when they arrived and they were forbidden from taking photos.
Ms. van der Merwe spent four days at the resort in 2012, she said, and connected with people she met because of her "healthy lifestyle" and other qualities.
"I have also been told that I have a very engaging personality," she said.
Other trips followed. On her first two, she flew economy class. Later, she was upgraded to first or business class.
During a trip in March 2013, she said, she told friends that her "dream car" was the Audi R8. After she returned home, she had an accident that totaled her car and cracked her cellphone screen.
A car dealer soon called her to pick up a new Audi R8 Spyder, which had been paid for and registered in her name. She also received two new cellphones, including one with international roaming, and a Land Rover Evoque.
The two vehicles were worth more than $ 250,000, a sum that was added to her tax bill. Her lawyers wrote in 2015 that they were gifts from the same "extremely well-to-do Middle Eastern gentleman" who sent her the money.
When government investigators asked about the $ 15 million transfer, a bank official said that "the sender and beneficiary are boyfriend/girlfriend and are currently together in the Seychelles."
Ms. van der Merwe bought properties worth more than $ 10 million, including a house in Cape Town's upscale Fresnaye neighborhood with an outdoor swimming pool and commanding ocean views. She also lent $ 2.7 million to a real estate company her father was involved with and made other transactions, leaving $ 537,000 in her account, she said.
The tax authorities considered her claim that the money was a gift implausible and suspected the funds had been for her father, Gary van der Merwe, a businessman who had fought repeated court battles with the tax authorities over his own business dealings. The authorities levied income tax on the sum, froze Ms. van der Merwe's assets and appointed a curator to oversee them until the matter was settled.
So Mr. Hariri stepped in again, sending Ms. van der Merwe an additional $ 1 million to help cover her legal and living expenses, according to court documents.
In correspondence with the tax authorities, Ms. van der Merwe's lawyers acknowledged it was hard to believe that "such largess was bestowed on a young girl" by someone with whom she had "a casual relationship." But Ms. van der Merwe insisted the money and cars were gifts for her personal use with no conditions.
She reached a settlement with the tax authorities in 2016, which she appealed last year. A judge dismissed that case this month.
In January, she sued government officials for $ 65 million in damages she attributed to the tax authorities' pursuit of her. These documents made Mr. Hariri's role in the case public this year.
In the suit, she argues that she had to sell the house because the asset freeze prevented her from paying for its upkeep. She also says the court cases and related publicity had caused irreparable damage to her career and severed her link to Mr. Hariri.
"The plaintiff's relationship with Mr. Hariri was terminated, which resulted in the loss of financial benefits that would have accrued to her from the relationship if it had been allowed to persist without outside interference," the suit says.
