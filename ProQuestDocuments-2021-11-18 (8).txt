Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Just weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the Trump administration can add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, new evidence emerged Thursday suggesting that the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to white Republicans.
The evidence was found in the files of the prominent Republican redistricting strategist Thomas Hofeller, who died in August.
It reveals that Hofeller "played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 Decennial Census in order to create a structural electoral advantage for, in his own words, 'Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,' " and that Trump administration officials purposely obscured Hofeller's role in court proceedings, lawyers for plaintiffs challenging the question wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman.
Furman was one of three federal judges who ruled against the question this year.
The letter drew on information discovered on Hofeller's hard drives, which were found by Hofeller's estranged daughter. Stephanie Hofeller Lizon then shared them with the organization Common Cause for a gerrymandering lawsuit it is pursuing in North Carolina.
The files show that Hofeller concluded in a 2015 study that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census "would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats" and benefit white Republicans in redistricting. Hofeller then pushed the idea with the Trump administration in 2017, according to the lawyers' letter to Furman.
The evidence, first reported by The New York Times, contradicts testimony by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' expert adviser Mark Neuman and senior Justice Department official John Gore, as well as other testimony by defendants, the letter said.
The Commerce and Justice departments did not respond to questions about the new information.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion in district court Thursday for "sanctions and any other relief the court deems appropriate, because of apparently untruthful testimony" by Trump administration officials in the earlier trials, said Dale Ho, who argued the case at the Supreme Court on behalf of the ACLU.
It is unclear how the information might affect deliberations at the Supreme Court. The ACLU on Thursday afternoon filed a letter with the court to "respectfully inform" it of the motion filed in New York District Court and that a hearing was scheduled for next week.
The letter repeated the charge contained in the earlier letter to Furman that Hofeller played a significant role in adding the citizenship question to the 2020 census to give white Republicans an advantage in redistricting "and that Petitioners (the government) obscured his role through affirmative misrepresentations."
The letter from Ho did not ask the court to take action, but it drew its attention to the new motion. The hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.
"Witnesses misrepresented the origin and purpose of their effort to add a citizenship question to the census," Ho said in a statement accompanying release of the letter. "Their goal was not to protect voting rights, but to dilute the voting power of minority communities. We look forward to Wednesday's hearing and will keep the Supreme Court aware of any further developments."
The Supreme Court heard the case April 23.
Evidence in the case concluded with oral arguments that day, and it appeared the conservative majority seemed inclined to agree with the government that the decision to add the question was within the authority of the commerce secretary.
The court, if it followed normal procedure, voted that week on the outcome of the case, and the justices are now writing the opinion.
The ACLU also asked the district court to allow previously redacted testimony from Neuman to be made public.
On Thursday, Furman ordered that the government must provide a response by 10 a.m. Friday; he called a hearing on the matter for Wednesday.
The new information indicates that blueprints for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census predated the Trump administration, but Donald Trump's election allowed them to become a reality, Ho said.
"It just shows that there was a long-standing plan to weaponize the census to dilute minority voting power to try to forestall the electoral effects of the demographic changes that this country is undergoing," he said.

Texto completo: “What you choose to tell first affects everything else," Richard Todd once said of how writers open stories.
So it was with each book he edited, and so it is now with the stories told by those who worked with him, knew him, loved him.
“He taught me to write," said Tracy Kidder, whom Mr. Todd guided from struggling, fledgling freelance efforts to a Pulitzer Prize and bestsellers.
Their uncommonly close writer-editor relationship — “I think of it more as a collaboration, really," Kidder said — lasted from 1973 until April 21, the day Mr. Todd died in Northampton's Cooley Dickinson Hospital, where he was being treated for complications from a fall, and for cancer. Mr. Todd was 78 and had lived in Ashfield since 1981.
As an editor at Houghton Mifflin, The Atlantic Monthly, and New England Monthly, he played a key role in shaping some of the best writing that defined literary journalism from the 1970s onward.
Though best known as Kidder's editor, Mr. Todd worked with authors who published enduring works of nonfiction and fiction: Adrian Nicole LeBlanc and Suzannah Lessard, James Fallows and Darcy Frey, Ann Patchett and Mark Kramer.
Mr. Todd's contributions to his writers, and to the genre itself, reached beyond his editing notes on manuscript pages. When Kidder was looking for a writing topic in the 1970s, Mr. Todd remembered that his former college roommate Tom West was at Data General in Westborough. “He said, 'Why don't you look into computers?' I laughed. I couldn't think of anything drearier," Kidder recalled.
The book turned into “The Soul of a New Machine," which earned Kidder a Pulitzer for general nonfiction in 1982.
The two worked closely on all of Kidder's work. “He was by my side, shoulder-to-shoulder, looking over everything," Kidder said. When each book reached a final edit, their last ritual was to trade off reading it “aloud to each other, usually one page apiece," Kidder said.
Mr. Todd was an author, too, most recently of 2013's “Good Prose: The Art of Nonfiction," co-written with Kidder. The book offers guidance and includes the kind of sharp, short tips that can fit on a sticky note perched on the edge of a laptop's screen: “If you can't imagine yourself saying something aloud, then you probably shouldn't write it."
In 2008, Mr. Todd wrote “The Thing Itself: On the Search for Authenticity," which “manages to be a memoir without being an autobiography," Cullen Murphy, editor at large for The Atlantic, wrote in a tribute on the magazine's website after Mr. Todd died.
In essays for The Atlantic and New England Monthly, both of which he led as the top editor, Mr. Todd examined subjects as disparate as visiting Las Vegas or swimming in Maine, where even summer waters refrigerate the soul. He willingly surrendered to that numbing pleasure.
“After 10 minutes or so," he wrote, “people watching you swim in this water grow affectingly anxious, unable to comprehend that for you, suffering is only a memory."
Admirers welcomed reading Mr. Todd's unfiltered voice, rather than guessing which of his memorable observations had slipped into the prose of writers he edited.
“Dick's own writing generally took a back seat to the writerly assistance he gave to others, whether as an editor or as a teacher," Murphy wrote. “He was a keen social observer, and his manner and voice fit naturally with the demands of the personal essay."
In his Back Bay office at The Atlantic, with its marble fireplace and framed Emily Dickinson poem in the poet's own handwriting, Mr. Todd could seem like a character from a book — at least in Murphy's telling. Visitors might chance upon pages from an article in progress, all planted on the floor. Amid them, Mr. Todd stood staring down at sentences and paragraphs, like a farmer contemplating seedlings.
Near the end of “The Thing Itself," Mr. Todd wrote: “I think within these sheltering walls I may sometimes understand another meaning of what it can be to 'live in the moment.' Not that striving, self-forging, abyss-staring quest — not that at all, but instead something more like acceptance."
An only child, Samuel Richard Todd Jr. was born in 1940 in Newburgh, N.Y., the son of Samuel Todd, who worked in sales for DuPont, and Miriam Walsh, who had been a dentist's office manager.
While his father served in the military during World War II, Mr. Todd and his mother lived on his paternal grandfather's Newburgh farm — an experience that shaped his love of rural living.
The family subsequently moved to Park Ridge, Ill., and to Darien, Conn., where Mr. Todd was a middle-class teen among affluent peers.
He graduated from Amherst College in 1962, majoring in English and writing a senior thesis about Dickinson. While there, he met Susan Bagg, who would graduate from Smith College, after a poetry reading that featured her brother.
Mr. Todd worked in New York City in advertising after graduating, and then did graduate work at Stanford University in the creative writing program Wallace Stegner founded.
In Palo Alto, Calif., Mr. Todd and Susan eloped, marrying in 1964 in the city's courthouse and living in a converted water tower. A couple of years later they headed east, where Mr. Todd began freelancing and the couple settled in Cambridge.
He wrote for The Atlantic, eventually becoming its executive editor, and published elsewhere, too. In a 1971 New York Times profile, Mr. Todd wrote that author Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s “face is a sculptor's clay model of itself; he often passes his hand over it as if to get it right."
For a time, Mr. Todd, his wife, and their three daughters lived on a farm in Westminster, growing vegetables that they sold at a roadside stand and raising chickens, pigs, and sheep. They returned to Boston for a few years before settling in Ashfield.
“My father helped me connect so deeply to our home, our land, and our town.," his daughter Nell of Washington, D.C., said in a eulogy at his memorial service Friday.
He was his daughters' editor, too. “He taught me how to write by listening," Maisie Todd Wallick of Redding, Conn., said in her eulogy. One night at home she was stymied by her writing. “Just tell me what you want to say," he told her, and “I did, surprising myself with a sudden clarity. . . . Listen to how your words sound, he said. Trust your ear."
Mr. Todd “was gentle and encouraging as a father, too, but also a seeker of ambition on our behalf," his daughter Emily of Northampton said in her eulogy. “He believed in who we were becoming and kept pushing (gently), helping us to reach toward there."
In addition to his wife, Susan, a retired elementary school teacher and principal, and his three daughters, Mr. Todd leaves six grandchildren.
“There was no one wiser," Maisie said in her eulogy. “No one who listened as closely. No one who made us laugh more or knew us better. He loved us so well."
For Mr. Todd, the acceptance he sought as a husband, as a father, as an editor “happens perhaps at a table at night with the closest people and you feel not unpleasantly that you are no more or less real than the candlelight," he wrote in “The Thing Itself."
At such moments, he was sure “that they have your substance, your very self, in their hands. That it is their gaze and their laughter, their unspoken and inexplicable affection that give you substance, that you are held there like a fallen leaf on an invisible updraft of air."

Jenet Erickson: No, religious women are not brainwashed

Texto completo: When findings from the World Family Map exploring links between religion and family well-being were published in The New York Times last week, a strong reaction ensued. The study found that the happiest married women in America are those who attend church regularly with their husbands and hold more traditional views about the roles of men and women. Fully 73 percent of religiously active, married women who agreed that “it is usually better for everyone involved if the father takes the lead in working outside the home and the mother takes the lead in caring for the home and family” reported high levels of satisfaction, commitment, closeness and stability in their marriages.
Critics reacted to the findings arguing that religious, conservative wives could only have been “brainwashed” to say they were happy. Consistent with the statement of New York Times’ executive director, Dean Baquet, their comments indicated, “We don’t get religion. We don’t get the role of religion in people’s lives.” This, in spite of the fact that decades of research exploring the connection between religion and individual wel-being confirm what Harvard professor Tyler VanderWeele summarized, “Participation in religious services is associated with numerous aspects of human flourishing, including happiness and life satisfaction, mental and physical health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, and close social relationships.”
In fact, findings from the World Family Map were not new. Previous research similarly found that for women, the happiest marriages were those in which both spouses shared more traditional views about marriage and attended church together. Religious activity seems to impact men’s behavior, in particular, in ways that “result in higher-quality marriages for women.” Compared to other fathers, those who attend church weekly were found to be the most active and emotionally engaged with their children, and their wives felt more appreciated and more satisfied with the affection, love and understanding they felt from their husbands.
But this isn’t the first time that women’s perspectives about marriage and family have been dismissed as simply the result of being “brainwashed.” Another “stubborn fact” frequently overlooked in public conversations about women is the finding that the vast majority of married mothers prefer not to work full-time. Pew Survey results over multiple years consistently find that less than 25 percent of married mothers with children under age 18 prefer full-time employment. In the nationally based Motherhood Study, only 15 percent of the 41 percent of mothers who were employed full-time considered that to be ideal.
Surely these women cannot all just be “brainwashed.” The evidence is clear that both women and men hold strongly “to the ideal of equal opportunity for women professionally and publicly.” But when children and family are brought into the discussion, a different focus emerges. Pew survey results indicate that only 21 percent of adults say “the trend toward more mothers of young children working outside the home has been a good thing for society.” And only 12 percent of mothers say “having a mother who works full-time is the ideal situation for a child.” These findings coincide with a persistent increase (since 1994) in the percentage of high school seniors and young adults who espouse the traditional ideal of fathers as breadwinners and mothers as primary caregivers.
As Ashley McGuire insightfully notes, in a world where women feel more free to “choose what works best for our families and ourselves,” millennial mothers are actually “trending” more traditional. With “technology’s evolution,” many are finding ways to “join tradition with innovation” in contributing economically to their families while prioritizing care of their children.
To them, their husbands’ commitment matters deeply, and it shows up in more meaningful ways than how equally they do the same tasks. It shows up in how emotionally attentive, invested and committed he is to his wife and children, including how he appreciates what she uniquely offers in the care of her family. As other recent research found, for husbands especially, “religion was associated with more positive relationship interactions including less conflict, greater commitment, and more frequently doing kind ‘little things’ for their wives.” That is the kind of relationship that makes women happiest.

Texto completo: Summer always brings back a sense of nostalgia as we remember what the world and summers were like as children. I remember playing kickball in the neighborhood, riding bikes, and jumping through lawn sprinklers. Those were the good old days.
It's amazing how much neighborhoods change over time and what used to be so familiar can look so different years later. Well for all of you feeling nostalgic like me, Shreve Memorial Library has a new research tool available that will let you explore neighborhoods of old and see just how much has changed over the years.
Shreve Memorial Library's research databases now include Fire Insurance Maps Online (FIMO). FIMO is a premium historical property map research tool.
The online research portal allows you to find and view high-definition, color fire insurance maps, real estate atlases, plat books, and other historical maps showing building structures, building construction details, property ownership, property uses and other useful information. Access to FIMO is now available at the Broadmoor, Hamilton/South Caddo, and Main Branches.
Using FIMO, you can explore how neighborhoods have changed over time by viewing historical fire insurance maps and atlases of entire communities, including businesses, homes, public places, apartment buildings and government offices. Through FIMO, you can see building additions, new buildings on formerly vacant lots, and the growth and redevelopment of entire neighborhoods. You can also get information on building materials to see how many floors or windows a particular building had and whether that building was a single family home, a multi-family dwelling, a church or a business. Combine the use of FIMO with Shreve Memorial Library's extensive genealogy collection, and you can really start to imagine what life was like once upon a time.
It's only befitting that we include stories of our own neighborhoods and childhoods as we get ready to enter the Universe of Stories summer reading program. Be sure to sign up at your favorite Shreve Memorial Library branch and share your stories with us this summer.
What's New at the Library
"The Farm" by Joanne Ramos (fiction)
Nestled in New York's Hudson Valley is a luxury retreat boasting every amenity: organic meals, personal fitness trainers, daily massages – and all of it for free. In fact, you're paid big money to stay here – more than you've ever dreamed of. The catch? For nine months, you cannot leave the grounds, your movements are monitored, and you are cut off from your former life while you dedicate yourself to the task of producing the perfect baby. For someone else. Jane, an immigrant from the Philippines, is in desperate search of a better future when she commits to being a "Host" at Golden Oaks – or the Farm, as residents call it. But now pregnant, fragile, consumed with worry for her family, Jane is determined to reconnect with her life outside. Yet she cannot leave the Farm or she will lose the life-changing fee she'll receive on the delivery of her child. Gripping, provocative, heartbreaking, The Farm pushes to the extremes our thinking on motherhood, money, and merit and raises crucial questions about the trade-offs women will make to fortify their futures and the futures of those they love.
"Radicalized" by Cory Doctorow (fiction)
From New York Times bestselling author Cory Doctorow, "Radicalized" is four urgent Science Fiction novellas of America's present and future within one book. Told through one of the most on-pulse genre voices of our generation, Radicalized is a timely collection consisting of four Science Fiction novellas connected by social, technological, and economic visions of today and what America could be in the near, near future. Unauthorized Bread is a tale of immigration, the toxicity of economic and technological stratification, and the young and downtrodden fighting against all odds to survive and prosper. In Model Minority, a Superman-like figure attempts to rectify the corruption of the police forces he long erroneously thought protected the defenseless... only to find his efforts adversely affecting their victims. Radicalized is a story of a darkweb-enforced violent uprising against insurance companies told from the perspective of a man desperate to secure funding for an experimental drug that could cure his wife's terminal cancer. The fourth story, Masque of the Red Death, hearkens back to Doctorow's Walkaway, taking on issues of survivalism versus community.
"The Book of Flora" by Meg Elison (fiction)
In this Philip K. Dick Award-winning series, one woman's unknowable destiny depends on a bold step in human evolution. In the wake of the apocalypse, Flora has come of age in a highly gendered post-plague society where females have become a precious, coveted, hunted, and endangered commodity. But Flora does not participate in the economy that trades in bodies. An anathema in a world that prizes procreation above all else, she is an outsider everywhere she goes, including the thriving all-female city of Shy. Now navigating a blighted landscape, Flora, her friends, and a sullen young slave she adopts as her own child leave their oppressive pasts behind to find their place in the world. They seek refuge aboard a ship where gender is fluid, where the dynamic is uneasy, and where rumors flow of a bold new reproductive strategy. When the promise of a miraculous hope for humanity's future tears Flora's makeshift family asunder, she must choose: protect the safe haven she's built or risk everything to defy oppression, whatever its provenance.

Texto completo: LONDON -- On a cold, damp day in December 2017, angels and demons were abroad in a sprawling South London park. The Archangel Gabriel jogged in a light gray tracksuit and two lesser mystical beings argued in a Victorian bandstand.
"Great pustulant mangled bollocks to the Great blasted Plan," yelled a demon called Crowley. An angel called Aziraphale looked suitably shocked.
The schoolboys playing soccer nearby didn't notice this earthly host and the passing dog-walkers ignored them. But in the video village a few yards away, a fleece-jacketed film crew saw what they had made, and, behold, it was good.
To be precise, it was "Good Omens."
Unlike Creation, however, this television adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's novel, debuting Friday on Amazon Prime Video, wasn't finished in six days.
It took nearly 30 years of misfires, false starts and tragedy, including Pratchett's death in 2015, for "Good Omens" to reach the screen.
The upside is that this fantastical six-part adaptation, which stars Michael Sheen ("Masters of Sex") as Aziraphale and David Tennant ("Doctor Who," "Gracepoint") as Crowley, with Jon Hamm guest-starring as Gabriel, is arriving at a time in which television's ambition has caught up with that of the story. Either God moves in mysterious ways, or the gods that govern television do.
"What we've got is a great big sprawling six-part movie with 300 different characters, and every scene is in a different place," Tennant said in his trailer, after filming Crowley's outburst. "Even if it's just Michael and I talking on a park bench, we're on a park bench surrounded by Victorian dinosaurs."
The novel, which debuted in 1990, is in the vein of Douglas Adams's "The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy," except that instead of riffing on science-fiction tropes, it pokes geeky fun at "The Omen" and the Book of Revelation.
"Good Omens" establishes that Aziraphale and Crowley have been on Earth for millenniums, luring its inhabitants toward salvation and damnation, respectively. Now, though, their time is almost up. A war between Heaven and Hell is brewing; Judgment Day is just a week away. But like a pair of John le Carré undercover agents who have grown too comfortable in their assumed identities, the angel and the demon realize that they quite enjoy living with the human race, so they team up to find the Antichrist and postpone the end of days.
The author pairing was equally auspicious. Gaiman has written beloved fantasy stories in just about every medium there is, including comics ("Sandman"), novels ("American Gods," "Coraline"), children's books ("The Wolves in The Wall") and screenplays ("Beowulf"). Pratchett wrote the best-selling "Discworld" series of Tolkienesque comic novels.
Sure enough, "Good Omens" earned rave reviews across the board -- almost. More than 27 years later in Battersea Park, Gaiman can still quote from memory Joe Queenan's review in The New York Times, which argued that "Good Omens" was more than unfunny -- it was proof that the British are intrinsically humorless. Readers disagreed.
"When we wrote the book, all the trouble was happening with 'The Satanic Verses,"' Gaiman remembered, referring to the Salman Rushdie novel that prompted Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini to call for the author's murder, sending him into hiding. "Terry did wonder whether we would have to find out if Salman Rushdie had a back bedroom."
"But in fact," he added, "what we got was an enormous amount of love."
A film was the obvious next step. Or so it seemed. Gaiman and Pratchett quickly drafted a screenplay, but neither was happy with it. A decade later, Terry Gilliam, the director of "Brazil" and "12 Monkeys," had a crack at it. He cast Johnny Depp as Crowley and Robin Williams as Aziraphale, and flew to Hollywood to find a distributor in early 2002.
"But it was post-9/11," Gaiman said. "No one was interested in an apocalyptic comedy."
Another decade later, Terry Jones announced that he would shepherd "Good Omens" onto television, thus making it the only novel to have had two members of Monty Python (and three people named Terry) play key parts in developing its screen adaptation. But when Jones's iteration fell through, it was left to the original Terry -- Pratchett -- to ensure that a TV series would go ahead.
But in 2007, he was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. By 2014, the condition he called "the Embuggerance" was so severe that he sent Gaiman a letter.
"We'd been friends for 35 years," Gaiman said, his voice thickening. "He said: 'I've never asked you anything before, and we've always agreed that with anything related to "Good Omens" we either do it together or we don't do it. But you have to do this. No one else can do it. I know how busy you are, but I want to see this before I can't see anything."'
"So I had to do it," he said.
Pratchett died in 2015, a week before Gaiman planned to begin writing. "So I started in a not-funny frame of mind," he said.
Nonetheless, he completed the scripts for a six-part series. They included a nuclear power plant, the Garden of Eden and the lost city of Atlantis. The plot spanned the globe and encompassed the whole of human history. The cast of characters included Shakespeare, Satan and the Four Horsemen (or rather, Motorcyclists) of the Apocalypse.
In other words, there was no way that Britain's state broadcaster, the BBC, could afford to produce it. But, lo, a miracle occurred. In 2016, a new law allowed the BBC to collaborate with commercial competitors for the first time, enabling Amazon to cover 70 percent of the "Good Omens" budget. Gaiman saw this partnership as being almost as unlikely as Crowley and Aziraphale's.
"On the one hand, you have a Kafka-esque organization" like the BBC, he said, "and on the other you have the Wild West" of Amazon, he said. "And they have to learn to play well together."
Whatever your views on divine providence, it could be for the best that the adaptation comes at a time when television series can be as expensively spectacular as Hollywood blockbusters, while also being several hours longer.
"I think in deciding to adapt this book, there had to be the opportunity to give it the scale and the scope that it has," Tennant said. "There would have been no point in telling this story without that opportunity."
Such scale and attention to detail will no doubt delight fans of the sprawling, fanciful novel, especially after 30 years of waiting for it to reach the screen. "People who love the book love it with a passion," Tennant said. "It's our responsibility not to mess it up."
This responsibility goes beyond just doing right by the novel's fans, he added. "There is a real sense that Neil is keen to honor Terry's memory."
Outside in chilly Battersea Park, Gaiman concurred. The uproarious tale of the friendship between an angel and a demon is being televised at last, he stressed, because of the friendship between two writers.
"Terry Pratchett asked me to do it," he said. "And I did."

Re "On Names, Japan's Foreign Minister Says, Western News Outlets Get It Backward" (news article, May 23):
Americans, and those in all Western societies, have long transliterated Chinese and Korean names into European languages in the order used by the people of those societies; family name first, individual name second. But in the case of Japanese names, we have always reversed the order, using the practice preferred in our own societies.
As an American who was raised in both Japanese and Western cultures, I have long been struck by the fact that this is not merely inconsistent, but also unfair.
The exception made for Japanese names has a historical basis: In the 1850s, a weak Japan acquiesced in adopting many of the practices of powerful Western countries. But that explanation cannot serve as justification any longer. How would Americans feel if, for 150 years, another powerful country expected us to happily flip the order of our personal names every time we interacted with that society?
When the foreign minister of Japan now asks the rest of the world to follow the Japanese practice, as we already do with Korean and Chinese names, it's long past time for us to acquiesce. It's also time for The New York Times to apply its own policy -- "to render people's names the way they prefer" -- to Japanese names as well, and to add its considerable influence to the critical mass that this change will require outside of Japan.

Texto completo: BY JOSEF FEDERMAN
The Associated Press
JERUSALEM - President Donald Trump's top Mideast advisers face skeptical audiences as they visit several locations in the region and in Europe starting Tuesday to rally support for what they have billed as a workshop on the economic foundations of peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
The White House is promoting the June 25-26 meeting in the Gulf state of Bahrain as the first phase of its long-awaited Mideast peace plan, which envisions large-scale investment and infrastructure work, much of it funded by wealthy Arab countries, in the Palestinian territories.
But American officials say the Bahrain conference will not include the core political issues of the conflict: borders of a Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian refugees or Israeli security demands.
A White House official said the trip, with stops in Morocco, Jordan, Israel and Europe "is part of our ongoing efforts to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians" but offered no specifics. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Palestinians will not attend the Bahrain meeting, rejecting the parameters of the conference, while key American allies Egypt and Jordan have not announced their plans for participation.
For now, the Americans are pinning their hopes on wealthy Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, hoping their regional influence and deep pockets can make the conference a success.
The Saudis, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, along with host Bahrain, have accepted invitations to attend. This has fueled Palestinian jitters that they will come under heavy pressure to accept large sums of money in exchange for freezing or abandoning aspirations for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip.
"The deal of the century or the deal of shame will go to hell, with God's will, and the economic project they are working on next month will go to hell too," Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said this week. "Whoever wants to solve the Palestinian issue must start with the political issue, not by selling the illusions of billions (of dollars."
Jared Kushner, Trump's senior adviser and son in law, announced the plans for the Bahrain conference last week, saying it would focus on economic issues and investment in the Palestinian territories.
The absence of a political horizon has put American allies in the region in a bind. Heavily reliant on the U.S. for political and military support, it is difficult for countries like Jordan to say no to the invitation. But the Palestinian issue resonates deeply with the Arab public and it is difficult for leaders to embrace a plan that does not promise the Palestinians a state.
In accepting the invitation to the Bahrain conference, Gulf countries have been careful to express solidarity with the Palestinians but have also signaled flexibility.
These countries have forged quiet relationships in recent years with Israel, driven primarily by a shared animosity to Iran. Those concerns, and readiness to engage with Israel, appear to outweigh any sympathies they may feel with the Palestinians.
"Dialogue with Israel is a positive thing," Anwar Gargash, the UAE's minister of state for foreign affairs, recently told journalists. "I think this is something that we need to do, but at the same time the dialogue with Israel doesn't mean that we don't disagree with them politically."
Palestinian officials have called on Arab countries not to attend the Bahrain workshop. Abbas is expected to step up those calls at a pair of conferences later this week in Saudi Arabia. But changing their minds may be difficult.
In a recent editorial, the editor in chief of a Saudi newspaper with close ties to the palace urged the Palestinians to give the Trump plan a chance.
"The Palestinians should negotiate hard, and then take what they can to secure a nation state for future generations," Faisal Abbas wrote in the Arab News. "There is nothing to be gained from a refusal to come to the negotiating table."
In another important diplomatic breakthrough, Qatar, which has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with Saudi Arabia, has agreed to attend, a possible precursor of a broader reconciliation among Gulf rivals.
Beyond the Gulf, the plan appears to face skepticism.
Jordan is in an especially sensitive situation. A majority of the population has Palestinian roots, and the kingdom borders the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the heartland of any future Palestinian state. Any perception that Jordan is selling out the interests of the Palestinians would be deeply unpopular and possibly even destabilizing.
Ahead of Kushner's arrival, Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, indicated he is uncomfortable with the economy-first approach.
The official Petra news agency said that in a phone call with his Irish counterpart, Safadi stressed that "any economic plan to handle the consequences of the conflict can't be an alternative to a comprehensive political plan that aims at fulfilling the two-state solution."
"Safadi stressed that all efforts for solving the conflict need to begin from the fact that ending occupation is the path for peace," the agency said.
Egypt, a key U.S. and Israeli ally that borders Gaza, also has not said whether it will attend. An Egyptian official said businessmen who do business with Israelis might take part in the conference as "individuals." The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the media.
President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has repeatedly called for the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
Kushner's visit to the region started Tuesday in Morocco, a moderate Arab state that has low-level ties with Israel. From there he was to head to Jordan, then Israel and on to Europe.
The European Union has not said whether it will attend the conference, while Russia, another key player in the region, late Tuesday called the meeting an attempt by Washington to enforce its views on the Middle East.
A statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry criticized what it called the United States' "stubborn desire to replace the task of achieving a comprehensive political settlement with a package of economic bonuses that dilutes the principle of two states for two peoples."
After more than two years of work, Kushner's team still has not unveiled its political vision. But his few public statements have indicated they will focus heavily on so-called economic peace while sidelining or ignoring the longstanding Palestinian goal of independence. The two-state solution continues to enjoy the broad support of the international community.
Abbas and his autonomy government in the West Bank cut off ties with the White House after Trump recognized contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017.
Israel captured east Jerusalem in 1967 and annexed it to its capital. Though Trump said his declaration did not determine the city's final borders, the Palestinians saw the move as unfairly favoring Israel. U.S. cuts in aid, and the closure of the Palestinian diplomatic office in Washington, further deepened their suspicions.
Saeb Erekat, a top Palestinian official, noted this week that the Palestinians were not even consulted about the Bahrain conference. "Let us be clear," he wrote in the New York Times. "There will be no economic prosperity in Palestine without the end of the occupation."

Texto completo: The world watched in December as a 72-year-old funeral director pushed the coffin of President George Bush into a polished Cadillac hearse in Houston. He had done the same before at services for Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, first ladies Betty Ford and Nancy Reagan, and many other well-known figures.
He is Robert M. Boetticher Sr., chief executive of a boutique death services firm that contracts with the federal government for state funerals.
For almost two decades, Boetticher has been privy to perhaps the most intimate, and delicate, conversations around a commander in chief's death. The planning begins almost as soon as a president is elected.
"It doesn't matter if it's the first family or if it's the barber down the street, they all react the same," Boetticher said earlier this year. "They just lost somebody that they loved. You are the person that they trust, that they look up to, to help them through it."
Since 2011, Boetticher has been at the helm of LHT Consulting Group, which primarily provides top-shelf services for wealthy individuals, and is a subsidiary of Service Corp. International.
A $3 billion entity known for its Dignity Memorial brand, SCI owns about 2,000 cemeteries and funeral homes in North America, including the home in California where Boetticher had one of his first jobs, and a parlor in Washington used during high-profile services.
Boetticher has also assisted at services for Sens. John McCain and Edward Kennedy, as well as the Rev. Billy Graham and actress Farrah Fawcett. This week, his consulting group was assisting at services in Indiana for former Sen. Richard G. Lugar, who died in late April.
State funerals are reserved for presidents, presidents-elect and people designated by the president, and unlike civilian services, they stretch for days, mixing military, religious and familial traditions, usually for a live television audience.
Since President Herbert Hoover's funeral in 1964, ceremonies have been scripted down to the drumbeat and the sun's position in the sky, and, in recent years, rehearsed with coffins weighted by sandbags. (Ronald Reagan's was about 700 pounds.)
When a president dies, the military conducts about 4,000 service members, from piccolo players to pallbearers. But Boetticher works with the family on the more prosaic aspects, like embalming (a recommended service because of the travel involved), headstone and coffin selection, private events and the burial. His firm mobilizes a Ceremonial Funeral Team, a flying squadron of licensed funeral directors, to assist at local funeral homes.
There are a lot of moving parts, Boetticher said, and "you've got one shot to do it right."
As a child in Southern California, Boetticher had ambitions to become a movie director like his uncle. But he often sneaked out of Saturday matinees at a theater in Santa Monica to check out the antique cars parked in the driveway of a nearby funeral parlor.
In high school, a career aptitude test forecast his path as a funeral director. At 18, he handled his first dead body while working at an ambulance and mortuary accommodation company that leased equipment and removed bodies when regular funeral homes were tied up.
"I made myself sick," Boetticher said about the encounter. But he responded to "the next death call" to prove to his parents he was committed to the job.
After studying at the California College of Mortuary Science and a tour embalming military personnel in the Army, he purchased his first funeral home in Wyoming with his wife, Jarka Boetticher.
There, he served as a coroner in Teton County, investigating mountain climbing deaths and drowning incidents in Yellowstone National Park.
In 1983, Boetticher started working for SCI and eventually moved to the company's headquarters in Houston, where, among other jobs, he managed the development of a new embalming fluid and became president of SCI's museum of funeral history.
He also indulged his passion for filmmaking, by advising set designers on a pilot for "Six Feet Under," the HBO series about a family-run funeral parlor, and playing an undertaker in a miniseries starring Sally Field.
But it was a call from a representative for Nancy Reagan in 2002 that thrust Boetticher into a rarefied circle of military and Secret Service personnel, government employees and family members of the president.
Joanne M. Drake, a chief of staff to the Reagans, recalled pulling all-nighters with Boetticher in the weeks before Ronald Reagan's interment in 2004. He was a "calming" partner during the planning process, she said, and "sensitive to the odd things that have to happen, and the obvious."
Boetticher helped the family select the solid mahogany Marsellus Masterpiece coffin. He pressed the American flag that was draped over it, too.
At a funeral parlor in California, Boetticher worked with a team to embalm Ronald Reagan's body. They also made sure the bouquets of flowers and the mementos left by mourners at a fountain outside faced the news cameras.
When Reagan's body was returned to California for burial after lying in state in Washington, Boetticher led a motorcade with the chief of Reagan's security detail to the presidential library in Simi Valley in time for a 6 p.m. sunset.
It was "very humbling" to escort the president's body, Boetticher said.
The plan for Gerald Ford's funeral was developed by Gregory D. Willard, a White House staff assistant in 1975 who later served as the Fords' personal lawyer in California. Willard spent three years on the 597-page plan for the nine-day funeral event, he said. It required late-night rehearsals on airport runways.
"A large part of the secrecy in the planning is not that we're dealing with classified information," Willard said. "But it's inevitable if people were to observe us, it would immediately be in the headlines: 'Ford on the Brink of Death.'"
About eight minutes after Ford died Dec. 26, 2006, in Rancho Mirage, California, Willard called Boetticher. He was in the parking lot of the hospital where the body was taken, having flown in from Houston.
For the Bush services in December, Boetticher led a half-dozen licensed funeral directors at a funeral home in Houston owned by SCI. Descending like a SWAT team in black suits, red-and-black-striped ties and "Ceremonial Funeral Team" pins, they communicated with motorcade drivers through earpieces and radios.
During services in Houston, Bush's coffin rested on a padded bier, provided by LHT, that has only been used during services for the Fords, Nancy Reagan, and first ladies Barbara Bush and Lady Bird Johnson.
Michael D. Wagner, chief of national events planning for the Army's Military District of Washington, a command that oversees official military ceremonies, has worked closely with Boetticher and his company during several state funerals.
"They provide a unique capability in terms of the level of expertise and also availability of equipment across the country," Wagner said.
The Department of Defense contracts with LHT to supply ceremonial sedans, SUVs and limousines (as well as drivers, including Boetticher) for multiple motorcades and convoys and for rehearsals, Wagner said. The department also rents specialty equipment, like a wheeled bier to transport the coffin, and the modified Cadillac hearse used in Houston, as well as a backup just in case.
Boetticher declined to disclose the fees for his funeral squad, which are paid by the families, or the fees paid by the federal government.
"Our prices are client-based," he said. "Any of that is highly confidential."
"If we ever broke that trust, we would never get it back," he said.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Defense said that "services are provided at market rates."
Joshua Slocum, executive director of the Funeral Consumers Alliance, a watchdog group that promotes affordability in the industry, is a vocal critic of LHT's parent company, calling it "an adversary in our line of work."
SCI has settled multimillion-dollar class-action suits after families accused funeral homes owned by the company in California and Florida of mixing up remains, losing them or secretly digging up plots and reselling them, but did not admit wrongdoing.
In the late 1990s, the company's chief executive, Robert Waltrip, was accused of calling on Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to halt an investigation by the state Funeral Service Commission into the company's practices, which the company denied.
An SCI spokeswoman declined to comment on past allegations.
Boetticher, who speaks with an adopted Houston drawl, said he "very rarely" talks to the media.
"I've been a funeral director for 53 years," he said. "And I was just very, very lucky and honored to be asked to fill the position that I'm in now."

Texto completo: Las encuestas revelan que la popularidad del presidente Donald Trump está a la baja entre la población en general, pero su base electoral sigue fuerte, lo que mantiene sus fuertes posibilidades de lograr su reelección en 2020.
Sin embargo, lo que motiva a los electores, indican expertos, es que –como se ha señalado en otras ocasiones– la economía es el factor clave al momento de decidir su voto.
El asesor del secretario del Tesoro de la administración de Barack Obama , Steve Rattner , reconoció en un artículo del New York Times que es casi imposible que el mandatario pierda, basado en tres informes sobre modelos de predicción de economistas acreditados que encontraron que el presidente Trump probablemente retendrá su presidencia.
Mark Zand i, economista de Moody’s y crítico del presidente Trump, ha analizado 12 modelos de predicción para 2020 que evalúan las tendencias económicas a nivel estatal y agregan factores políticos como el índice de aprobación de un presidente, reportó el Daily Mail. En todos los modelos ganó el actual mandatario.
“Si las elecciones se llevaran a cabo hoy, Trump ganaría según los modelos y con amplio margen” , dijo Zandi a Politico. “Tiene bajos precios del gas, bajo desempleo y muchas otras variables políticas a su favor. La única excepción es su popularidad, que importa mucho. Si eso cae por un precipicio, sería una gran diferencia”.
Un análisis hecho por el profesor de economía de Yale, Ray Fair , encontró que el presidente Trump podría lograr 56.1 por ciento de los votos, dadas las condiciones económicas, aunque su mayor enemigo es él mismo.
Estos mismos modelos previeron la histórica victoria de Obama en la Casa Blanca en 2008, su reelección en 2012 y la inesperada victoria del republicano 2016.
En las más recientes encuestas sobre tendencias electorales, una de las preguntas a los votantes es sobre los temas que más les preocupan, destacando la situación laboral y económica, así como los servicios de salud.

Who's Afraid of Robert Smith's Philanthropy? The billionaire promises to pay off a graduating class's student loans—and finds himself under attack.

Texto completo: Robert Smith was raised in a working-class Denver neighborhood in the 1970s. A high-school science class in his junior year sparked his interest in transistors, the building blocks of computers, cellphones and other electronic devices. Transistors were invented in the 1940s by AT&T's Bell Labs, which had a facility not far from the teenager's home. He applied for a summer internship there but was told it was available only to juniors and seniors in college. Unbowed and impatient, he spent months pestering people in the human-resources department to give him a shot. Eventually, they did.
Mr. Smith went on to earn an engineering degree at Cornell and a business degree from Columbia. He worked as a chemical engineer and then as an investment banker. In 2000, he started a private-equity firm that focuses on investing in computer software companies. His net worth today is $5 billion, which makes him, according to Forbes magazine, the richest black person in America.
Mr. Smith urges others to be generous with their wealth, and he leads by example. He has financed college scholarships for minorities and women and set up a foundation that exposes inner-city kids to nature and the arts. He funds nonprofit groups that support underprivileged children interested in studying math and science. He gave $50 million to his alma mater Cornell and another $20 million to the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. He has pledged to commit more than half of his wealth to philanthropy.
Mr. Smith has kept a relatively low profile over the years, but earlier this month he made a splash with his commencement address at Morehouse College, a historically black institution in Atlanta. Toward the end of his remarks, Mr. Smith announced that he would pay off the student loans of the nearly 400 graduates. The students and administrators were thrilled, of course, but others just saw another opportunity to score political points.
A New York Times story about Mr. Smith's magnanimous act noted the "growing calls across the country to do something about the mounting burden of student loan debt," then informed us that "presidential candidates like Elizabeth Warren have made debt cancellation a key plank in their campaign platforms." The paper even found an expert critic of private charity who said he feared that "a gift like this can make people believe that billionaires are taking care of our problems, and distract us from the ways in which others in finance are working to cause problems like student debt, or the subprime crisis."
No sane person believes that billionaire philanthropists are "taking care of our problems," but a Times editorial on Mr. Smith's gift insisted the wealthy could do just that if only the government would raise their taxes high enough. The paper's editors likened Mr. Smith to Andrew Carnegie and other villainous plutocrats of yesteryear, and said that a new generation of the superrich had "amassed great fortunes, in part because the federal government has minimized the burden of taxation." They asserted that Mr. Smith opposed increasing taxes on carried interest—profits from private-equity investments—and that this lost revenue could be used by the federal government to offset the cost of tuition.
The reality is that tuitions have risen mainly because the government is subsidizing them and schools know that most students won't have to pay for the full ride. More federal funding of higher education will exacerbate this problem, not solve it. And if higher tax receipts from "the rich" is the objective, then history argues that top marginal rates ought to be lowered, not increased. After those rates fell under Presidents Coolidge, Kennedy, Reagan and George W. Bush, both the amount and share of taxes paid by top earners rose.
But the comparison between Mr. Smith and his Gilded Age counterparts is apt in at least one respect. Famous philanthropists like Carnegie, Julius Rosenwald, John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan played key roles in educating black Americans after Reconstruction. Rosenwald, who made his fortune running Sears, Roebuck & Co. when it was the largest retailer in the country, teamed up with the educator and former slave Booker T. Washington to start thousands of quality elementary and secondary schools for blacks in the South. In 1903, Andrew Carnegie gave $600,000 in U.S. Steel bonds to Washington's Tuskegee Institute, now known as Tuskegee University, a historically black college in Alabama. Morehouse sits on land donated by Rockefeller, who was also a major donor to Spelman College, yet another historically black college in Atlanta, which is named in honor of Rockefeller's wife, Laura Spelman.
There is a lengthy tradition in this country of our wealthiest residents financing educational opportunities for the less fortunate. Let's hope Mr. Smith ignores the critics. He's in very good company.

Byron York: As Barr mulls declassification, a familiar tune from critics

Texto completo: In February 2018, the House Intelligence Committee released the so-called Nunes memo. In four pages, the document, from the committee's then-chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, revealed much of what the public knows today about the FBI's reliance on the Steele dossier in pursuing since-discredited allegations that the Trump campaign and Russia conspired to fix the 2016 election. Specifically, it revealed that the FBI included unverified material from the dossier in applications to a secret spy court to win a warrant to wiretap Trump foreign policy volunteer adviser Carter Page.
All that was classified. To release it, the committee appealed to President Trump, who made a declassification order. That is the only way Americans know about the Page warrant. From that knowledge came later revelations about the FBI's use of confidential informants and undercover agents to get information on Trump campaign figures.
It is good that the public knows such things, just as it is good that the public knows what is in the Mueller report. But in the days before the Nunes memo was declassified, many of the nation's top current and former intelligence officials, members of Congress, and analysts in the press warned that declassification would do grave damage to American national security.
It didn't happen.
Now, some of the same people are issuing somber warnings of the damage that will be done if Attorney General William Barr declassifies documents showing what else the nation's law enforcement and intelligence agencies did in the 2016 Trump investigation.
In 2018, former CIA director John Brennan said of the Nunes memo, "I never witnessed the type of reckless partisan behavior I am now seeing." Recently, Brennan called the Barr declassification project "a reckless, reckless initiative."
In 2018, Rep. Adam Schiff, of the Intelligence Committee, said the Nunes memo "crosses a dangerous line." Recently, he said the Barr initiative marks "a new and dangerous phase."
In 2018, former Attorney General Eric Holder called the Nunes memo "unheard of" and "dangerous" and "irresponsible." Recently, he called the Barr initiative "the height of irresponsibility" and "a dangerous precedent."
Many others echoed Brennan's and Schiff's and Holder's sentiments. The problem is, they were wrong then, and they are likely wrong again now.
The revelation that the FBI used the Steele dossier -- the collection of unconfirmed anti-Trump dirt compiled for the Hillary Clinton campaign by the former British spy Christopher Steele -- set off a tremendous argument about the dossier's reliability. But there was no doubt that the Nunes memo was correct, that the FBI had indeed cited the dossier as evidence in its argument that Carter Page should be wiretapped. It's hard to avoid the conclusion that some of the loudest voices denouncing Nunes were angry about the exposure of the FBI's questionable actions, and not the fact that the FBI's actions were indeed questionable.
Indeed, after the release of the Nunes memo, there was little discussion of any specific damage it had done to U.S. national security.
Now, there is another fight about declassification. Nunes himself has heard this all before. "Every time we have tried to get information on the Russia hoax, the Left as well as the media and their leakers claimed it would devastate national security," Nunes said in a text exchange. "Now we hear the same argument from the same reporters, leakers, and leftists, even though all their previous doomsday warnings proved false. These people simply use national security as a false justification to hide information that would reveal their abuses."
Nunes summed up with one more line: "Democracy dies in darkness."
The resistance to Barr's work is likely to be ferocious. Almost immediately after President Trump ordered intelligence agencies to cooperate with Barr and gave the attorney general "full and complete authority" to declassify information from the Trump-Russia investigation, the intelligence world struck back when the New York Times reported that Barr's project could endanger one of the CIA's most prized sources.
Attributing its story to "former officials," the Times said the source was someone "close to [Vladimir] Putin" who gave the CIA "information about [Putin's] involvement" in U.S. election interference, and specifically turned over evidence to support the conclusion that "Putin himself was behind the Russia hack." The source had been "long nurtured" by the CIA and was highly valued by Brennan when he was director. All of that work might be at risk from Barr's work, the Times suggested.
Now, if anything might endanger such a source, it would be exposure in the New York Times. But the story showed that the intelligence world will push back hard against this new effort to investigate its record. The fight could be messy. But Barr, like Devin Nunes, has heard such threats before. It's time to find out what the CIA, FBI, and other agencies did in those difficult days of the 2016 campaign.

Texto completo: Women have a new weapon they can use to make their case against the chilly office conditions many experience each summer, as their sleeveless summer work clothes do battle with cranked-up air-conditioning systems. A new study shows women tend to perform better on certain skills when the temperature is a little warmer, making them more productive, while men tend to perform better when the temperature is a bit cooler.
In a paper released Wednesday by the journal PLOS One, researchers at the University of Southern California and the WZB Berlin Social Science Center reported that in experiments, tests scores on verbal and math skills improved for women as the temperatures rose, and were better for men when they declined (though to a lesser effect), opening a new front in the office thermostat wars.
The paper's release set off yet another round of attention and headlines to what's been called the "thermostat patriarchy, or the gender divide on where to set the thermostat in the office. A few years ago, a scientific paper in the journal Nature Climate Change turned up the dial of the debate when it offered physiological data for why women and men are comfortable at different indoor temperatures and spelled out how office temperatures may be based on the needs of a 40-year-old, 154-pound man.
Then last summer, it flared up again when Cynthia Nixon, Andrew Cuomo's Democratic primary opponent for New York governor, asked a TV station to set the debate hall thermostat to a warm 76 degrees, calling workplaces "notoriously sexist when it comes to room temperature, the New York Times reported.
When the PLOS One article prompted its own furious round of headlines and social media attention - "tweeting this while wrapped up in the blanket I keep at my desk, wrote one woman on Twitter as she shared a headline on the paper - researcher Tom Chang, an associate professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California's business school, wasn't surprised.
Not only did the Nixon-Cuomo flap break out when they were wrapping up the paper last year, "but for the past 10-plus years, I've been arguing with my wife about the thermostat at the house, Chang said. And at USC's business school, he said, "the female faculty have illicit space heaters under their desks; they wear sweaters; they have blankets, he said. "This is relevant for anyone who works in an office space.
What Chang was surprised by was the magnitude of his study's results. Chang and his co-author, Agne Kajackaite, tested verbal and math skills in tests of college students in Berlin. They found that for every one degree increase in Celsius, the number of math questions answered correctly by women went up by 1.76 percent. Put another way: Even within normal indoor temperature variations - increasing the temperature from the 60s to the 70s in the room - female performance on the math tests increased by 15 percent.
"This was a really large effect, Chang said. Performance by males, meanwhile, dropped by about 3 percent, on average, when the temperature rose over the same variance.
Chang said the explanation for the difference isn't entirely clear, but some research suggests the effect may be biological, or based on size - average surface area to body volume comparisons for men vs. women. "I haven't seen anything definitive, he said.
What's not likely to be the explanation, at least in this case, was clothing. Because the test was run in college students, he said, there weren't the same kind of sartorial differences between male and female participants. Rather than button-down shirts and pants or sleeveless blouses or dresses, both male and female students dressed in relatively similar ways, he said: "They were all coming in in shorts and a T-shirt.
Chang acknowledges that it's also unclear whether the same productivity effects would be seen in a workplace environment as the student participants, but suggests the results are still a reminder employers should be more mindful that indoor temperatures aren't just about making employees comfortable, but making them more productive.
What can employers do in response? The ubiquity of open office plans makes it more challenging, but Chang doesn't rule out the idea of having different temperature settings in different spaces. Most important, he said, is to recognize that something should be done if people are complaining or actively making their own accommodations to cold temperatures.
"Everybody is latching on to the battle of the sexes, but I don't think that's the right lesson to take away from our work, Chang said. "I think the two lessons are first, that these environmental factors matter more than people think they do when it comes to productivity. The other is one size doesn't fit all. ... If half of the people in your office are sneaking space heaters under their desk or talking about how it's hot all the time, you should take that more seriously.

Texto completo: Not long ago I found myself inside the hushed and high-vaulted interior of a nursing home for geriatric books, in the forgotten city of St.-Omer, France. Running my white-gloved hands over the pages of a thousand-year-old manuscript, I was amazed at the still-bright colors applied long ago in a chilly medieval scriptorium. Would anything written today still be around to touch in another millennium?
In the digital age, the printed book has experienced more than its share of obituaries. Among the most dismissive was from Steve Jobs, who said in 2008, "It doesn't matter how good or bad the product is, the fact is that people don't read anymore."
True, nearly one in four adults in this country have not read a book in the last year. But the book - with a spine, a unique scent, crisp pages and a typeface that may date to Shakespeare's day - is back. Defying all death notices, sales of printed books continue to rise to new highs, as do the number of independent stores stocked with these voices between covers, even as sales of electronic versions are declining.
Nearly three times as many Americans read a book of history in 2017 as watched the first episode of the final season of "Game of Thrones." The share of young adults who read poetry in that year more than doubled from five years earlier. A typical rage tweet by President Donald Trump, misspelled and grammatically sad, may get him 100,000 "likes." Compare that with the 28 million Americans who read a book of verse in the first year of Trump's presidency, the highest share of the population in 15 years.
"We don't read and write poetry because it's cute," wrote Walt Whitman. "We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race."
So, even with a president who is ahistoric, borderline literate and would fail a sixth-grade reading comprehension test, something wonderful and unexpected is happening in the language arts. When the dominant culture goes low, the saviors of our senses go high.
Which brings us to Michelle Obama. You can make a case that we owe a big part of the renaissance of the written word in recent months to her memoir, "Becoming." In the first 15 days after publication last year, it sold enough copies to become the best-selling book in the United States for all of 2018. By the end of March of this year, it had sold 10 million copies and was on pace to become the best-selling memoir ever written in this country.
I was late to her book, having my doubts about platitudinous, focus-group-neutered memoirs by political personalities. As it turned out, she's a luminous, observant, self-aware writer, even if she had some help from a team of ghostwriters. Consider these passages describing her early dance of romance with Barack Obama, when she worked within "the plush stillness" of her Chicago law firm.
"Barack was an ambler. He moved with a loose-jointed Hawaiian casualness, never given to hurry, even and especially when instructed to hurry."
And here is the effect he had on her: "Until now, I'd constructed my existence carefully, tucking and folding every loose and disorderly bit of it, as if building some tight and airless piece of origami." But then, "Barack intrigued me. He was not like anyone I'd dated before, mainly because he seemed so secure. He was openly affectionate. He told me I was beautiful. He made me feel good."
This is old-fashioned storytelling, taking us from an upstairs apartment on the South Side of Chicago to the White House. As someone who makes his living in the business of storytelling, I couldn't be happier to see her book smash records and help the printed word amble confidently, like young Barack, through another century.
Storytelling, Steve Jobs may have forgotten, will never die. And the best format for grand and sweeping narratives remains one of the oldest and most durable.

As abortion bans multiply, increasingly diverse voices are calling to protect women's rights

Texto completo: This unholy war on women's health has gone on too long and too far.
One woman held up a sign representing Medical Students for Choice. It said, "Get your own uterus, then tell it what to do."
A man carried one that said, "If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament."
"More access, more providers, fewer politicians," declared an ACLU poster.
The 200-plus people rallying inside Iowa's State Capitol Tuesday found creative and colorful ways to express their outrage over politicians' increasingly successful efforts to control women's bodies. Theirs was one of five #StoptheBan rallies across Iowa and more than 450 across America.
Already this year, legislators in different states have passed 16 curbs on abortion, said Erin Davison-Rippey, state executive director of Planned Parenthood of Iowa. Alabama's new law bans all abortions except when a woman's health is at serious risk. Under it, performing an abortion is a felony punishable by life or up to 99 years.
Under a bill passed in Missouri and awaiting the governor's signature, doctors who perform abortions could be sentenced to prison for anywhere between five and 15 years. They could lose their licenses for not performing a fetal heartbeat test. Davison-Rippey said one in three — 25 million — women of reproductive age now lives in a state where abortion could be outlawed if Roe v. Wade were overturned.
Those laws are in direct defiance of the wishes of 73% of Americans, Davison-Rippey said. Iowa's courts saved Iowans from the fetal heartbeat abortion ban that was passed and signed into law last year by Gov. Kim Reynolds. But Republican lawmakers are itching for court fights that go all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, now with a conservative majority, so they can challenge Roe v. Wade.
"Politicians have stopped pretending these restrictions are about making abortions safer," observed Mark Stringer, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa.
But there were heartening signs that activists are readying to fight back in a more comprehensive way than in the past by building bridges and connecting the dots. Stressing that their fates and issues are intertwined, a diverse group of speakers — African-American, Native American, white; male, female, transgender; millennial and Baby Boomer – hammered on the common threats to everyone's sovereignty and right to self-determination.
Olivia Samples, an African-American doula, called the control of women's fertility an issue of white supremacy and patriarchy, and talked of how slaves were forcibly bred following an 1808 ban on importing slaves. Meanwhile black mothers today (including in Alabama) are three to four times as likely to die in childbirth than white women, she said.
Talking about "ownership and control of marginalized bodies," Max Mowitz, who is transgender, talked of restrictive state bills pertaining to bathroom use and Iowa's recent ban on Medicaid coverage for sex-change surgery. Trisha Etringer of Indigenous Iowa, wearing a T-shirt that said, "No one is illegal on stolen ground," suggested anyone truly pro-life would be concerned about immigrant children dying in Homeland Security custody or other children dying from firearm access.
"As an indigenous woman, I believe I inherently have sovereignty over my body," she said, calling anti-abortion laws a form of colonization. She predicted that with penalties against pregnant women who hurt their fetuses, low-income women and those of color would disproportionately be deemed criminals.
And Christine Nobiss of Seeding Sovereignty, one of the rally's sponsors, said the legacy of colonization had contributed to indigenous women facing the highest rape rates in the country, along with teenage pregnancies, poverty, discrimination and violence. Yet no reservation can provide abortion services because of the federal Hyde Amendment, which restricts abortion coverage for federally funded health-care recipients.
Against this backdrop, instead of getting more diverse, Nobiss said the Republican Party "became more white and more male than ever. " Her research found congressional Republicans are 95% white, 99% Christian and 90% male, and that 91% "openly support anti-abortion laws in different capacities."
"It's beyond obvious that there is a segment of this country's population that has no intention of separating church and state," Nobiss said. "Have you ever heard of a pro-lifer that does not have any sort of religious affiliation?... As an indigenous person, I take infiltration of Christianity into legislation very seriously, as it is the perpetuation of the doctrine of discovery, manifest destiny, the white man's burden..."
The New York Times called last week "the most momentous" in years for the anti-abortion movement. With eight states having passed greater restrictions, the anti-abortion movement is closer than in the 46 years since Roe v. Wade to dismantling it. It cites sustained anti-abortion activism supported by conservative churches. The shift is welcomed by Republican politicians who have ridden those wedge issues to control over state legislatures and congressional seats, and then rewritten state laws curbing abortion access.
Legal or not, women will continue to have abortions when having and raising children isn't feasible. One-quarter of women in America has an abortion in her lifetime, Davison-Rippey said. This unholy war on women's health and choices has gone on too long and gone too far, and the only thing that can stop it is enough people joining together, linking stories and issuing a resounding NO to anyone else trying to control our bodies.

$13 Million (in Sand) Washes Ashore

Texto completo: A pleasant British tourist, who declined to give his name, said that he had heard about Rockaway Beach from a friend's mum, so there he was, in the extravagant sunshine of last Sunday afternoon, with two friends, one of whom went in the water. Cold, was the report.
Since the beaches of Rockaway Beach are constantly drifting away, requiring fresh sands to take their place, it makes sense that new life-forms find their way there, including pleasant British tourists -- softish shoulders, neatish beard -- steered by their friends' mums. Human crop rotation, maybe.
This one did not know how much toil and federal and city loot went into the sand under his feet.
You see all these pipes and heavy machinery here ?
Just weeks ago they were working 24/7 to rebuild this stretch of Rockaway Beach between Beach 92nd Street and Beach 105th Street, which last year had become so narrow that the city suddenly closed most of it for the season just days before Memorial Day, a move that made beachside business owners feel insufficiently blessed.
That was last year.
Tides roll in, tides roll out, and what do you know, this year $ 13.4 million washed up on the shore, in the currency of sand -- 348,000 cubic yards of it, pumped onto the beach from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' dredging mission in East Rockaway Inlet.
The strip of beach reopens for swimming this weekend.
"We're beyond stoked," said Michael Perzy Powers, a co-owner of the Low Tide Bar and High 97 concessions at Beach 97th Street, eyeing a genial midafternoon crowd. Summer frenzy had not yet arrived. But at least this year, Mr. Powers felt confident that it will.
"Last year was a struggle," he said.
A commander from the Corps of Engineers said that if you piled that much sand onto a football field the heap would be 20 stories high. That's in addition to nearly 3 million cubic yards of sand that was already added to a two-mile stretch of the beach in 2014, a project that cost $ 28 million in federal emergency relief funds available after Hurricane Sandy.
Ever since Rockaway Taco opened nearby in 2007, drawing other foodie-friendly vendors to the area, this stretch of the barrier island has been a magnet for off-islanders, including busloads from Williamsburg in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side of Manhattan. (The taco shack closed in 2015, replaced by Tacoway Beach.)
Mr. Powers had a thought about that. In the past, he said, the beach stayed open with even more erosion than last year. But that was before the fashionable crowds came. "Now it gets more attention," he said, and left it at that. No point in spoiling a beautiful day.
But in fact, Rockaway Beach has always gotten a lot of attention -- almost $ 270 million in restoration efforts since 1930 (in today's dollars), as of the latest tabulation by the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University. That's more than any other beach in the country. The federal government has replenished the sand at least 37 times.
Andy Coburn, associate director of the program, said that what we call beach erosion might more accurately be called shoreline migration, the island's natural response to changing currents and "human interactions." The Rockaways want to move westward, but we won't let them. Thus the unceasing need for more sand.
As a character says in Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's novel "The Leopard," "For everything to stay the same, everything must change."
Or, as Hector Mosley, a spokesman for the Corps, put it, "In the past, Rockaway was a much shorter place."
He called the island "a sacrificial barrier to large storm waves." With tacos and a decent surf scene.
Valerie Costa, who was relaxing on the boardwalk with her boyfriend and his young daughter, called the new sand a "Band-Aid on a broken leg," but she said she was glad to see the beach open, however long this fix lasts. A lifelong Rockaway Beach resident, she was still smarting from a 2010 New York Times article about Rockaway Beach that called her father "amusing, almost."
Tides roll in. Condescension now tends to target the outsiders rather than the natives. The arc of the moral universe bends slowly, etc.
But no matter. When the beach was closed last year, Ms. Costa said, these same outsiders wandered confused into her neighborhood farther west, around Beach 107th Street. "We felt the ripple effect from everyone coming up," she said. "If putting in sand opens the beaches and restores balance, I'm happy with that."
The Corps' next plan, starting in 2020, is to build jetties and groins to slow the erosion.
On a sand bank below the boardwalk, Wanda Osorio pulled a towel over herself to protect her from the cool wind. She has lived in the Rockaways for 47 of her 65 years -- maybe enough, she said. But where would she find a beach like this?
Still, rising sea levels might take some of the fun out of life on a sacrificial barrier, she said.
"That's predicted," she said. "The water's gonna take over New York. I think that's the last days."
Perhaps. In the meantime, surf's up!
But step lively, friends. Hurricane season begins June 1.

Texto completo: When he was a National Guardsman serving in Afghanistan, Derrick Miller loomed over a civilian who was being interrogated and fired a bullet into the man's head. Then Miller turned to another soldier and said, "He was a liar."
Miller was sent to prison eight years ago for that premeditated murder after a prosecutor urged a military court to make "a statement about how soldiers should behave."
President Donald Trump will also make a statement about how soldiers should behave – one utterly misguided and corrosive to military discipline – should he follow through on plans reported by The New York Times to pardon, on or around Memorial Day, troops accused or convicted of war crimes.
"Bad message. Bad precedent. Abdication of moral responsibility," a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, declared on Twitter.
Miller, since released on parole, hopes to be among those pardoned. Others include:
Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused by platoon members of wanton acts of violence, including stabbing to death a teenage boy, and gunning down a girl and an old man. Gallagher is said to have boasted about his kills and labeled his accusers as traitors.
Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, a Green Beret charged with executing a man suspected of being a Taliban bomb-maker who had been ordered released. Golsteyn admitted the crime only after undergoing a polygraph.
Former Blackwater contractor Nicholas Slatten, convicted of instigating the slaughter of 14 Iraqi civilians with a cadre of Blackwater gunmen at a Baghdad intersection.
Misconstrued Holding these men accountable for wartime barbarity has somehow been misconstrued by part of Trump's base as justice gone awry.
Trump, who traffics in a culture of pseudo toughness that endorses torture or the killing of terrorist families, has caught their drift.
Pardoning a convicted war criminal is not out of character for Trump. Earlier this month, he pardoned a former Army first lieutenant serving time for "unpremeditated murder in a combat zone." He had been convicted of ordering an Iraqi prisoner to strip naked before shooting the man to death.

Texto completo: For too many Shabbats in recent weeks, I've had conversations about anti-Semitism. At my synagogue, most of them have turned to the two shootings at synagogues in Poway and Pittsburgh, and how we can keep our community safe without closing our holy spaces off from the world; how we explain to our children that there are people who hate us.
I’m sure that similar conversations took place at thousands of synagogues across the country in the past months. It’s the new normal for being an American Jew in these times.
Imagine a world where this sober topic would drive a national conversation where leaders across the political spectrum examine the increase in anti-Semitic incidents; where we investigate why violence targeting Jewish people, Muslim people, people of color, and immigrants is spreading in this country; where we collectively resolve to confront hate-fueled terror and all who enable it.
Instead, this month we saw a different conversation unfold in the media and among elected leaders — one with which we are now all too familiar — with Twitter-fueled accusations of anti-Semitism targeting yet another progressive leader disliked by conservatives. This time the target was Rep. Rashida Tlaib and the absurd misrepresentation of comments she made in an interview.
Read more commentary:
White supremacist terror is rising, and Trump's policies kneecap our ability to fight back
You can critique Israel without sounding anti-Semitic. Rep. Ilhan Omar should learn how.
The right's revealing hypocrisy over Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments is painful to watch
The pattern is by now quite clear. A Muslim member of Congress makes remarks about Israel. A conservative media outlet cherry picks a phrase, a couple of words, spinning opinion into news. Republican members of Congress — like Liz Cheney, Lee Zeldin, and Steve Scalise — launch disingenuous attacks on Twitter or in press releases. Conservative media —like Breitbart and The Federalist — pile on with front-page articles amplifying their blatantly false claims of anti-Semitism.
Then mainstream media outlets get in on the act, with more traditional platforms reporting on on the false accusations, lending them undue legitimacy. Even seemingly neutral headlines further the idea that the member of Congress has sparked a controversy, or is suddenly embattled, while allowing conservative voices to speak on behalf of the Jewish community. All that is before President Donald Trump jumps in with a tweet, continuing his offensive effort to push Jewish Americans to abandon the Democratic Party with fear-mongering and divisive rhetoric.
Faux outrage machine is new normal
In a few days, the conservative faux outrage machine will move on. There will be someone else who is smeared and misrepresented, and chances are good they will be a progressive leader of color. Headlines will be generated, reputations and careers tarnished. Our country’s ability to take the threat of anti-Semitism and the rise of violent white nationalism seriously will be further impaired, even as the threat of violence remains.
This strategy of misrepresentation, lies and attacks has become routine. The same playbook has been employed repeatedly against other Muslim members of Congress for years. The ‘outrage’ begins with statements from members of Congress decrying their Muslim counterparts’ remarks, followed by the comments being elevated by the conservative media echo chamber until they bleed into the mainstream.
Here’s how the distraction works: when the waters are muddied, we can no longer see clearly. When threats are everywhere, they are nowhere, and fear can be sown about anyone. Fingers will often point to Muslim or Black leaders, people who have long been scapegoated as a source of danger in our society, and who are thus easy targets for people’s fear. In this way our attention can be shifted from the people responsible for unleashing a wave of white supremacist violence targeting our communities. That’s why within 24 hours of the shooting at Chabad of Poway there were members of Congress and conservative pundits who obscured the shooter’s white nationalist manifesto by directing blame on a Muslim member of Congress and a cartoon in the New York Times International Edition.
Don't be fooled by fake anti-Semitism
The public shouldn’t be so easily fooled. Anti-Semitism is not a joke or a game, and we deserve elected officials who understand that. Politicians who weaponize anti-Semitism for political gain must be denounced for their destructive actions and driven from office. Media outlets who, even unintentionally, allow such smear campaigns to spread must hold themselves to a higher standard.
Ultimately, all the faux outrage and manufactured smears have real life consequences: they reduce the time, attention, and resources devoted to tackling the real sources of anti-Semitism that are actively putting my community and others at greater and greater risk.
The best way to respond is to keep the focus where it belongs, on the radical ideology of white nationalism and its normalization in our politics, and to reject efforts to divide our communities from each other. That means re-dedicating ourselves to strengthening solidarity within our Jewish community and with our allies by organizing against the policies and politicians that threaten our lives. Only through a united movement can we ensure a future where we are all safe in our synagogues, temples, mosques, and churches; where our democracy protects the rights of every single one of us to live without fear.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT Stream on Netflix. Spike Lee's 1986 debut about a Brooklyn artist juggling lovers got an update in this Netflix series, which debuted in 2017. Directed by Lee and counting the playwright Eisa Davis among its writers, the first season introduced a new Nola Darling (DeWanda Wise) and a feminist lens. "More expansive than interior, more defiant than dreamy, it's a vibrant if uneven work in heated conversation with itself," James Poniewozik wrote in his review of the first season for The New York Times. The second season, which debuts Friday, also makes time for episodes in Puerto Rico and on Martha's Vineyard, in addition to its native Brooklyn. Anthony Ramos ("Hamilton") returns as Mars Blackmon, the lover of Nola's who was played by Lee in 1986. "At the end of Season 1, we knew who everybody was," Lee said recently in an interview with the website Blackfilm. "Season 2 is 'now what?"'
THEY SHALL NOT GROW OLD (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. For this World War I documentary, the director Peter Jackson was given a challenge: make a movie for the centennial of the Armistice using original footage, in an original way. Jackson, in keeping with his reputation for visual splendor, went a painstaking route. He and his team worked to restore the footage and colorize it. The resulting movie, made up of film shot on the Western Front from 1914 to 1918 paired with archival voice-overs from veterans, is a unique encapsulation of the lives of British soldiers who fought in the trenches. "This footage has been around for 100 years and these men had been buried behind a fog of damage, a mask of grain and jerkiness and sped-up film," Jackson said in an interview with The Times last year. "Once restored, it's the human aspect that you gain the most."
WHAT / IF Stream on Netflix. Renée Zellweger plays a notorious San Francisco venture capitalist in this new anthology series from Mike Kelley, the creator of the early 2010s ABC thriller "Revenge." The melodramatic plot involves Zellweger's character, Anne Montgomery, disrupting the relationship of two newlyweds.
What's on TV
STAR WARS: EPISODE I -- THE PHANTOM MENACE (1999) 8 p.m. on TNT. Some things are best not to revisit. Whether this first installment in George Lucas's "Star Wars" prequel movies is one of them is a matter of opinion -- it was famously derided by critics when it was released. But in a recent article for The Times, Scott Tobias wrote that "Lucas's obsession with world-building in 'The Phantom Menace' proved a more lasting contribution to film and television in the 21st century than it might have seemed at the time." The movie turned 20 this week.

CITY &amp; STATE; 3 parents in college scam plead guilty; They are among 16 who have admitted to roles in the college admissions scandal.

Texto completo: As Marcia and Gregory Abbott's daughter prepared to take her SAT subject tests last August, she asked if the tall blond man who was "so sweet" when proctoring an earlier exam in West Hollywood would be there again.
"She said, 'Can't I take my SAT subjects with him?' " Marcia Abbott told William "Rick" Singer, a Newport Beach college admissions consultant who, like the proctor, is now a felon after admitting to rigging dozens of entrance exams for wealthy families like the Abbotts.
The proctor, Mark Riddell, didn't just monitor the girl's exams: He corrected her answers once she was finished, Marcia and Gregory Abbott admitted Wednesday in federal court in Boston, where they pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy.

Another parent, Peter Jan Sartorio of Menlo Park, pleaded guilty to the same charge and admitted to conspiring with Singer to inflate his daughter's ACT score.
As of Wednesday, 10 parents -- among 16 people total -- have pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering crimes committed as part of Singer's scheme.
Riddell, a 36-year-old Harvard graduate and director of exam preparation at IMG Academy in Florida, was paid thousands of dollars to tamper with both girls' exams. Singer also bribed administrators at two schools, in West Hollywood and Houston, to turn a blind eye to the fraud, prosecutors say.
With Riddell's help, the Abbotts' daughter notched a 35 out of 36 on the ACT, a score in the 99th percentile. Sartorio's daughter secured a 27 out of 36 on the ACT, good for the 86th percentile nationally. She had scored in the 51st percentile on an earlier entrance exam.
For the test-rigging services, Sartorio paid Singer $15,000 in cash. The Abbotts wired $50,000 from a family foundation to Singer's charity, which had no real charitable purpose and was used to launder bribes.
Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and obstruction of justice. Riddell has pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. Both are awaiting sentencing.
Sartorio, 53, runs a frozen foods enterprise that includes selling frozen burritos under the PJ's Organics line. Prosecutors recommend Sartorio be fined $9,500 and sentenced at the low end of guidelines that call for six months in prison to no time at all, according to his plea agreement and federal sentencing guidelines.
Prosecutors recommend Gregory and Marcia Abbott each spend a year in prison and pay a $55,000 fine.
Gregory Abbott, 68, is the founder and chairman of a packaging company for the food and beverage industry.
In conversations intercepted by the FBI and transcribed in court documents, the Abbotts told Singer their hopes for their daughter -- to see her matriculate at Duke, her mother's alma mater -- and what they were willing to do to make it happen.
After their daughter's test was fixed in April 2018, netting her a 35 out of 36 on the ACT, Singer told the couple it was "a good thing that she did this."
Had they not hired him, Singer said, she would have scored a 23.
Two months later, Marcia Abbott asked Singer if he could rig SAT subject tests, which are often submitted as supplements to an application and are scored out of 800 points.
Duke "told us they didn't want anything below a 750," Marcia Abbott said, according to the transcript. Marcia Abbott had graduated cum laude from Duke, according to the wedding notice in the New York Times.
In September 2018, Singer confirmed that Riddell would fix math and literature tests for the Abbotts' daughter, and that "we'll get 750 and above."
"Fabulous," Marcia Abbott said.
The Abbotts wired Singer another $75,000 from their family foundation. With Riddell's help, their daughter scored 800 and 710 on the math and literature tests, respectively. There is no indication in court documents she knew her parents had conspired with Singer to tamper with the exams.
"Do you know how she did on her own?" Gregory Abbott asked Singer afterward.
"Do I know how she did on her own? Yeah, I do," Singer said. "She scored in the mid-600s."
By then, Singer was cooperating with investigators. On their instructions, he called Sartorio in October 2018 and told him his foundation was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, which could come calling with questions about Sartorio's five-figure cash "donation" a year earlier.
"Anything that was done verbally, that was verbal and there's no record," Sartorio said, expressing relief at having paid cash. "There's nothing. There's nothing."

Amend the Espionage Act

Texto completo: It has been almost 102 years since the Espionage Act was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Initially conceived as a means by which to punish acts of interference with the foreign relations, the Act has since become a tool of suppression, used to punish whistleblowers who expose governmental wrongdoing and criminality. It is time that the law be amended to accommodate those who share information vital to the public interest.

Daniel Everette Hale, a 31-year-old former intelligence analyst, become the latest target of the weaponized Espionage Act with his arrest last week. Mr. Hale is accused of leaking classified documents between 2013 and 2015 regarding the Obama administration's drone program.

The leaked information revealed details about the secret legal system used by the Obama administration to create lists of people to kill, including American citizens who had not been formally charged with crimes.

The information also revealed that the drone program is dangerously inaccurate, killing the wrong target as often as 90 percent of the time.

This information is clearly of substantive value to the public. The American people have a right to know who is being killed by its government and how the government makes such decisions.

Transparency ensures due process and ethical decision-making.

But Mr. Hale has been charged under the Espionage Act and, as a result, will be denied the right to make a public interest defense.

Sadly, Mr. Hale's situation is not unique. He is the fourth individual to be charged by the Trump Administration under the Espionage Act for leaking classified information to journalists.

Terry Albury of the FBI and Reality Winner of the National Security Agency are already serving prison sentences for their actions, while Joshua Schulte of the CIA has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. Only the Obama administration prosecuted more whistleblowers under the Espionage Act - eight people.

While many people are, justly or unjustly, angered by the hostile rhetoric that has been directed toward the press in recent years, the prosecutions of whistleblowers under the Espionage Act are a much more nefarious and dangerous abridgment of First Amendment freedoms in this country.

Five years ago, Daniel Ellsberg, who was charged - but not convicted - under the Espionage Act in 1973 for leaking the Pentagon Papers, argued that the current state of whistleblowing prosecutions under the Espionage Act makes a truly fair trial wholly unavailable to an American who has exposed classified wrongdoing.

Since that time, the situation has grown more dire as the government becomes more emboldened to punish those who leak information to the press.

Obama administration's decision to use the Espionage Act to vigorously prosecute whistleblowers has created a dangerous precedent.

It must be stopped now.

The press must take up the cause of the brave men and women who leak vital information to them. Whistleblowers like Mr. Hale, Ms. Winner, Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and more must be defended, just as those who publish that information - a list that includes everyone from the New York Times to Julian Assange - must be defended.

The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has never addressed the constitutionality of using the Espionage Act to punish those who leak information to the American press. Some legal scholars have argued that this application violates the First Amendment.

The U.S. Supreme Court should settle the question.

And Congress could put all this to rest by amending the Espionage Act to allow public interest defenses, a revision that would immediately improve government transparency and positively benefit the American people.

But whatever happens, this issue can no longer be on the sidelines. The consequences of this debate will have a tremendous impact upon free expression, the freedom to publish vital information, and the right to know what our government is doing in our name, good or bad.

We cannot afford to remain silent on this issue.

Silence is complicity, and America's whistleblowers deserve better.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Harriet Tubman — former slave, abolitionist, “conductor" on the Underground Railroad — will not become the face of the $20 bill until after President Trump leaves office, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday.
Plans to unveil the Tubman bill in 2020, an Obama administration initiative, will be postponed until at least 2026, Mnuchin said, and the bill itself will not likely be in circulation until 2028. Until then, bills with former president Andrew Jackson's face will continue to pour out of ATMs and fill Americans' wallets.
Mnuchin, worried that the president might create an uproar by canceling the new bill altogether, was eager to delay its redesign until Trump was out of office, some senior Treasury Department officials have said.
As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump criticized the Obama administration's plans for the bill.
That April, Trump criticized the proposed change as “pure political correctness" and suggested that Tubman, whom he praised, could be added to a far less common denomination, like the $2 bill. “Andrew Jackson had a great history, and I think it's very rough when you take somebody off the bill," Trump said at the time.
Trump has frequently described Jackson, whose portrait hangs in the Oval Office, as a populist hero who reminds him of himself.
The delay comes three years after Mnuchin's predecessor, Jacob Lew, announced plans for a sweeping and symbolic redrawing of the currency.
Treasury Department officials did not say whether Trump had a hand in the decision, and Mnuchin would not say whether he himself believes that Tubman should be on the bill's face.
“I've made no decision as it relates to that," Mnuchin said Wednesday at a congressional hearing in response to a question from Representative Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts.

Democratic candidates tout small-dollar donations
Joe Biden got 97 percent of the contributions to his presidential campaign in amounts of less than $200, his campaign announced, leaving out a key detail: how much that added up to.
The former vice president, like many of the other 22 active candidates running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, is touting his success with small donors as an indicator of grass-roots support from voters. It's become almost as important as poll numbers as evidence of a candidate's appeal.
Much of the information campaigns have voluntarily released on fund-raising doesn't provide as full a picture as the reports candidates are required to submit to the Federal Election Commission each quarter, and omit details about all the ways they are raising money.
With the spotlight on grassroots donors as Democrats emphasize their ability to raise money from sources other than big donors and corporate political action committees, candidates can camouflage large checks from wealthy contributors by citing the larger number of small-dollar donors, but not the actual dollar amounts.
In announcing her first-quarter totals, the campaign of California Senator Kamala Harris said that 98 percent of her contributions came in amounts of less than $100. While small donors accounted for most of the transactions, bigger donors gave most of the money.
Of the $12 million she raised, 63 percent came from donors who gave more than $200. Donors giving $1,000 or more contributed $5.8 million, FEC records show.
Small-dollar donors have been the critical component driving Democratic presidential fund-raising so far. The 14 Democratic 2020 candidates active in the first quarter reported raising $71.5 million, of which $40.1 million came from donors giving $200 or less. Bernie Sanders raised $15.3 million from such donors, more than any other candidate, followed by Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg.

Senator questions Trump plans for July 4th festivities
WASHINGTON — President Trump's planned July Fourth extravaganza on the National Mall sounds like it could become a giant Trump rally on the taxpayers' dime, a Democratic senator cautioned Wednesday.
But Interior Secretary David Bernhardt defended Trump's still-vague Independence Day plans for Washington, D.C., in response to questioning by Senator Tom Udall, a New Mexico Democrat, at a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing.
Udall expressed concern that Trump tweets heralding his planned appearance at an amped-up version of this year's fireworks and festivities signaled the president planned to take a "nonpartisan celebration and turn it into a de facto political rally."
Citing the specific statute prohibiting use of federal agencies for "publicity or propaganda activities," Udall asked Bernhardt to guarantee that no taxpayer money "will be spent on activities that are partisan or serve purely to aggrandize this president."
The president has made rallies with ardent, conservative Trump fans a staple of his presidency.

Pelosi is no 'profile in courage'

Texto completo: I wonder sometimes whether officials at the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, which presents the annual Profile in Courage Award, have ever read “Profiles in Courage." In his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1956 book, then-Senator John Kennedy described eight US senators who upheld an unpopular political position with fortitude, even though it meant defying their party or allies and jeopardizing their careers.
Recipients of the Profile in Courage Award are supposed to epitomize the kind of political fearlessness that JFK extolled. But while some have indeed been exemplars of conscience who put the public good ahead of their own political safety, others definitely have not. At times the award has served as a kind of consolation prize for haughty liberals whose disdainful manner alienated their constituents. At other times it has amounted to little more than a lifetime achievement prize for famous Democrats, such as Barack Obama and Ted Kennedy.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the newest Profile in Courage honoree. She received the award, according to the JFK Library, for shepherding passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and for “leading the [Democratic] effort to retake the majority" in the House of Representatives in 2018. Those accomplishments, impressive as they were, had nothing to do with political bravery. They attest to Pelosi's legislative and electoral acumen, not her moral grit.
Yet when Pelosi found herself in a situation where political courage was required, she showed none. Just a few months ago, the House was roiled by the anti-Semitism of freshman Representative Ilhan Omar. In public comments, the Minnesota Democrat perpetuated the ugly stereotypes that Jewish money dominates American policy-making and that pro-Israel Jews in Congress are motivated by “allegiance to a foreign country." That outraged respected party veterans, who introduced a resolution condemning such anti-Jewish bigotry. But the measure triggered an uproar from far-left Democrats and the Congressional Black Caucus, who rallied around Omar and demanded that the resolution be watered down into a bland condemnation of all forms of hatred.
That was when the speaker of the House could have shown real mettle and insisted that Democrats repudiate the anti-Semitism in their ranks. Instead, she caved to the extremists. The strong resolution was spiked, and Pelosi lamely excused Omar on the grounds that she hadn't understood the “full weight" of her slurs.
But if Pelosi doesn't fit the description of a profile in courage, there are others who do. When Senator Susan Collins of Maine decided last October to support Brett Kavanaugh's elevation to the Supreme Court, she knew well that “her vote will haunt her politically for the remainder of her career," as The New York Times put it. The pressure on Collins to oppose Kavanaugh was noisy, public, and abusive. A crowdfunding campaign raised millions of dollars for a future campaign to unseat Collins if she didn't vote no. Her office was inundated with profane and threatening messages. Undeterred, Collins cast the crucial vote for Kavanaugh, carefully explaining her reasons in a speech on the Senate floor. Now that's what JFK would have called a profile in courage.
Perhaps he would have said the same about Massachusetts Democrat Seth Moulton, the congressional backbencher who launched an intraparty campaign to stop the powerful Pelosi from being restored as speaker after Democrats recaptured the House majority in November. Or about Representative Justin Amash, the Michigan Republican who is bucking virtually the entire GOP with his call for President Trump's impeachment. Or about Mark Janus, the Illinois state worker who challenged one of the most powerful public-sector unions in the country, fighting all the way to the Supreme Court for the right not to have to support a labor union as a condition of working in public service.
Almost by definition, genuine profiles in courage are uncommon. But they aren't impossible to find. In his classic book, JFK made a point of focusing on exemplars of backbone and integrity, not on the political tribe they belonged to. Kennedy was a loyal Democrat, but that wasn't the point of “Profiles in Courage." It shouldn't be the point of the Profile in Courage Award, either.

Texto completo: Defying stereotypes, many people who frequently use cannabis also seem to be people who frequently exercise, according to the first large study of legal marijuana and exercise habits.
The study finds that many people who report using cannabis in the hours before or after a workout believe that it makes their exercise more enjoyable and may help motivate them to get out and be active. Fewer of those who exercise and use pot maintain that it actually improves their physical performance while exercising.
When we think of marijuana users, many people harbor preconceptions about their lives and lifestyles. The image that comes up for many of us, often cobbled together from watching The Dude in the movie “The Big Lebowski” or the misadventures of Harold and Kumar, is of the laid-back stoner who dreamily takes yet another hit on the bong.
“The usual stereotype is of someone lying on his couch for hours, blissed out and eating Doritos,” said Angela Bryan, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Colorado Boulder, who oversaw the new study.
Recently, the possibility that this cliche might be accurate had begun to worry her and her colleagues. Her lab studies health behavior and the actions and decisions that tend to promote or reduce people’s health.
She and her colleagues realized that legalization of recreational cannabis use, which had occurred or was about to in several states, including Colorado, would most likely increase usage. But current government regulations restrict research with the drug, which remains illegal at the federal level.
“If using cannabis encourages people to be sedentary and overeat, that obviously would be a concern,” Bryan said.
In a study published last month in Frontiers in Public Health, the researchers examined questionnaire responses from more than 600 men and women who used cannabis, most of whom said they also exercised at least sometimes.
The researchers had expected that some, but probably not a majority, of these people would report swallowing, smoking or slathering on cannabis before or after exercise. But they were wrong - and by a wide margin. It turned out that almost 82% of them said they used cannabis around the time of their workouts.
This group tended to be younger, leaner and more often male than those who did not use marijuana in conjunction with exercise. They also exercised more often and imbibed or slathered on more cannabis.
And about 70% of them reported that using marijuana increased their enjoyment of workouts, while nearly 80% felt it enhanced their recovery, and more than half were convinced it motivated them to be physically active.
Only about 35%, though, held that it actually raised their exercise performance.
These findings should not be seen an endorsement of marijuana as an adjunct to exercise, Bryan said. But they do suggest that some of our entrenched ideas about cannabis and lifestyle may be outdated.

In Austria, Calls to Oust Top Minister Further Chaos

Texto completo: BERLIN -- Austria's troubled coalition government descended deeper into chaos on Monday, with the far-right Freedom Party pulling out its remaining ministers and casting adrift important parts of the government.
The fresh turmoil came after the governing coalition collapsed this weekend, when a video was made public appearing to show the vice chancellor, Heinz-Christian Strache of the Freedom Party, promising government contracts to the niece of a Russian oligarch close to President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Strache quit on Saturday.
The scandal has raised concern in Austria and beyond of the influence the Kremlin wields with sympathetic far-right and populist parties around the Continent, just days before elections for the European Parliament in which nationalist forces are predicted to make a strong showing.
In response to the scandal, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Monday that he would ask the president to dismiss the interior minister, Herbert Kickl, a leading member of the Freedom Party. Mr. Kurz said he had failed to grasp the gravity of the scandal and failed to take firm action in its wake.
"In talks with him and others from his party since the video surfaced, I have not had the impression that there is an understanding for the dimension of the whole affair," Mr. Kurz told reporters in Vienna in announcing his decision. "I also had the feeling there is not the necessary sensibility for how to handle these accusations."
The Freedom Party quickly jettisoned its remaining four ministers in retaliation. They had held offices in the ministries of integration and foreign affairs, labor and social affairs, defense and transportation. Mr. Strache, in addition to serving as vice chancellor, also served as minister of sport.
Mr. Kickl served as general secretary of the Freedom Party for 13 years and remains a key figure in the party, one of the country's best-known politicians and a mastermind of the nationalist and populist slogans of the party's recent election campaigns.
Speaking after a meeting with the president earlier Monday, Mr. Kickl accused the chancellor of "calculated power politics" in seeking to return the Interior Ministry -- which commands the country's security apparatus -- to the hands of the conservative party that had controlled it for decades.
Under Mr. Kickl, the ministry ordered raids on the anti-extremism unit of its own domestic intelligence division, leading to calls from the opposition that he was trying to oust political opponents.
The leadership of the government ministries was assigned as part of the coalition agreement between Mr. Kurz's conservative Austrian People's Party and the far-right Freedom Party.
Any changes require the approval of the country's president, Alexander Van der Bellen, who called on Sunday for new elections in September. He will now need to appoint technocrats in charge of the abandoned ministries until a new government takes power.
"We will fill the free positions with experts or high-ranking civil servants to ensure that the government remains able to govern until the election," the chancellor said.
The scandal of recent days has brought an abrupt end to the government that Mr. Kurz, 32, had formed with the Freedom Party amid criticism that he was enabling the nationalist, far-right party after only 17 months in power.
The Freedom Party was founded by former Nazis in the years after World War II, and has long pushed a nationalist, anti-immigrant agenda that Mr. Kurz co-opted, repacked and rode to victory in elections in 2017. He has since depended on their support.
The Freedom Party's ties to far-right extremists, including Generation Identity, a group that is under investigation by several European intelligence services, are well documented.
The video showing Mr. Strache and another member of his party was filmed without his knowledge. The footage was obtained and published on Friday by the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, two respected news outlets.
The New York Times could not independently verify the contents of the entire video, in which he could be heard promising a woman, claiming to be the niece of a Russian oligarch, public road-building contracts in exchange for financial support for his party.
The video revived concern in Europe that forces from Russia were seeking to disrupt the democratic process, days before polls open in some of the 28 countries voting in the European parliamentary election. But Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, told reporters that the video "does not have and could not have anything to do with us."
Support for the Freedom Party dropped by 5 percent, to 18 percent, while Mr. Kurz's conservatives enjoyed a 4 percent increase in popularity to 38 percent, according to the results of a poll published on Monday by the online publication Österreich.
Within Austria that would leave the conservatives as the strongest force in the country, but not strong enough for them to form a government without including a smaller party.
In the rest of Europe, the impact of the scandal involving Austria's far-right nationalists will be seen once results of the European Parliament elections are announced on Sunday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: CARACAS, Venezuela -- When an image of the young Venezuelan girl first began to circulate last week, the reaction was almost instantaneous.
She is 2 years old, but malnutrition and untreated illness have wasted her body back to a state of virtual infancy. She spends her day on her back in her family's dilapidated hut.
Her name is Anailin Nava, and when readers saw the photograph of her in a New York Times article on the economic collapse of Venezuela, many had a common impulse: Helping her country out of a protracted humanitarian crisis may be difficult, but surely there was something that could be done for this one child.
On Sunday, aid began to arrive.
[You can read the original article on Venezuela's economic collapse here.]
Gasoline shortages have crippled much of Venezuela, but Fabiola Molero, a nurse with a Roman Catholic aid group, Caritas, packed a bag with a scale and a 15-day supply of nutritional supplements, milk and food, and hitchhiked from the western city of Maracaibo to Toas Island, where Anailin lives.
Ms. Molero has been working as a nurse in public hospitals for 20 years, but three years ago she quit and became a volunteer with Caritas so she could fight the hunger that was devastating the country.
"I worked in a hospital and quit because I couldn't handle the fact that children were dying in my arms for lack of food," she said.
When she set off on Sunday, her goal was to help Anailin, and also assess the condition of other children in her community.
The state of Zulia, which Toas is part of, has been particularly hard hit by the country's economic collapse. The island has been practically cut off from the mainland after the boats that served as public transport broke down for a lack of spare parts.
Bags of subsidized food from the government arrive every five months, but they are consumed by the families within a week, according to Anailin's mother, Maibeli Nava, and her neighbors.
Ms. Molero said Anailin's case was one of the worst she had seen. The family often could not afford to feed her more than once a day -- and sometimes only had rice or cornmeal to eat.
The child's severe malnutrition case was complicated by a genetic neurological disease, which causes convulsions and muscular problems, and makes digestion difficult, the nurse said.
Anailin, who weighs half of what she should, is too weak to travel, Ms. Molero said. But she can be treated at home until she is strong enough to be taken to a neurologist, she added.
"My baby had deteriorated and was in a very bad state," said her mother, Ms. Nava, who is 25. "I thought my daughter was going to die. She didn't even give me her hand when I tried playing with her."
The arrival of the nurse, and the food, made an immediate difference, Ms. Nava said: "Now she's cheerful."
Ms. Molero said her arrival prompted neighbors, among them the mothers and older people of the area, to line up outside the Navas' house, in one of Toas' fishing hamlets. They wanted to ask for help, she said.
"My neighbors are dying because of lack of medicine," Ms. Nava said.
The economic crisis has left the island without any medical supplies despite having two hospitals and three public first aid clinics. Toas used to be a tourist destination, but the deterioration of the country's economy and infrastructure have left it with frequent and prolonged blackouts in electricity and cell service.
"I'm worried because there are a lot pregnant women and the hospital is not working," said Ms. Molero.
Out of 26 children evaluated by Ms. Molero, 10 were malnourished. Almost all of them had blisters and abscesses in their skin caused by the poor water quality, the nurse said. The island's desalination plant has been out of operation for years.
"The condition of our children gets worse every day," said Ms. Molero, 43. Other volunteers who worked with her are planning a medical visit to the island to take nutritional supplements and to evaluate another 40 children.
Ms. Molero said shortages of dairy products, which used to come from the mainland, really hurt the children. Without milk, the most vulnerable families are resorting to making baby food out of plantain powder, she said.
And the gasoline shortage makes it very difficult to deliver help, the nurse said.
"We're working by the strength of our nails here because we barely have any resources," she said.

Texto completo: Deutsche Bank AG's shares traded at an all-time low Monday just weeks after talks with Commerzbank AG failed. Now bank officials, facing fresh investor doubts about the lender's ailing investment bank and overall strategy, are bracing for a barrage of criticism from shareholders at the bank's annual meeting Thursday in Frankfurt.
Shares hit a new intraday low of €6.617($7.382) in early afternoon Frankfurt trading. Deutsche Bank shares are down 39% in the past year as it loses market share while battling to stem compliance failures and high costs. German officials have fretted over its ability to compete on its own, potentially hurting Europe's biggest economy, which itself
is under pressure .
UBS Group AG analysts on Monday downgraded Deutsche Bank shares to "sell" from "neutral," citing a lack of strategic options and that the investment bank "has been losing revenues in absolute and relative terms." Talks with Commerzbank broke down last month , leaving questions about Deutsche Bank's immediate prospects.
Chairman Paul Achleitner and co-president Garth Ritchie, who oversees the investment bank , face individual shareholder proposals at the annual meeting aimed at their performance, as do two other senior bank officials. Deutsche Bank has told investors it supports them.
The two most influential shareholder-advisory firms this month took the rare step of urging investors to punish the bank's top executives en masse at this week's meeting by withholding confidence votes for the bank's two main boards.
The votes are often a formality, and largely symbolic. But this year they could fuse investor frustration over Deutsche Bank's continuing yearslong decline, Glass Lewis & Co. and Institutional Shareholder Services said in separate advisory reports.
Mr. Achleitner has met with around two dozen institutional investors in recent weeks, defending his oversight and the performance of executives, according to people familiar with the discussions.
In a private, personal plea, Mr. Achleitner and Chief Executive Christian Sewing wrote to BlackRock Inc. and other large investors this month asking them to refute the proxy advisers' recommendations and support Deutsche Bank's boards. The two officials cited their "different interpretation of the progress that we have made," according to a May 10 letter to BlackRock executives reviewed by the Journal. "We hope you will find our arguments persuasive."
Investors have questioned some 2018 executive pay packages, particularly a €3 million "functional allowance" the supervisory board awarded Mr. Ritchie, some of the people say. The cash allowance, described as for Brexit-preparation work, was equivalent to his base salary, the maximum that compensation rules allowed. It made him the highest-paid management-board member, with a total of €8.6 million ($9.6 million), more even than Mr. Sewing earned.
Mr. Achleitner is also chairman of the compensation committee, adding to pressures on him to defend the investment bank's performance, the people said.
Some investors want dramatic changes, such as closures of entire trading businesses. After he took over as CEO in April 2018, Mr. Sewing cut staff in the money-losing equities business, shrank other businesses and cut overall investment-bank costs. But many investors and analysts saw that as tinkering around the edges.
Executives this year have eyed equities, equity derivatives and portions of rates trading for downsizing, The Wall Street Journal reported in March. They have declined to comment publicly on any potential strategy shifts.
Some executives hoped the bank could unveil a retooling of parts of the investment bank weeks ago, but the work has taken longer, people close to the bank said.
ISS noted it previously gave Deutsche Bank executives the benefit of the doubt, citing difficulties in turning around a big bank in tough markets. But ISS this month called for a protest vote: "We believe it is time for shareholders to hold the boards accountable for the many years of substantial monetary and reputational costs to the bank borne by shareholders."
Glass Lewis singled out troubles with the investment bank and U.S. operations as focuses of investor ire. Debt-rating agencies have aired concerns about the bank's ability to make money. Again the investment bank, long fueled by trading revenue, is key: It contributed just over €13 billion, or 52% of the bank's total net revenues, in 2018. But the unit's revenues have been in steady decay.
Deutsche Bank said its share price doesn't reflect its strong financial position and that concerns raised are legacy matters. It noted the bank was profitable in 2018 for the first time since 2014, and said, "We have significantly improved our risk and control systems in the last three years and we will continue to do so."
There have been bright spots. Deutsche Bank regained some revenue-based market share in the first quarter in the business of advising on public offerings, leveraged buyouts and corporate mergers, according to Dealogic data.
Deutsche Bank has faced persistent concerns about legal liabilities tied to money-laundering controls in Europe and the U.S. It has said it is improving its oversight.
Financial-crime specialists in 2016 and 2017 recommended reporting transactions involving legal entities tied to Donald Trump and Jared Kushner but were rebuffed internally, the New York Times reported Sunday. A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman told the newspaper: "At no time was an investigator prevented from escalating activity identified as potentially suspicious." A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said the firm didn't know of such flagged transactions. A Kushner Cos. spokeswoman said any money laundering allegations were "totally false."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- In modern times, presidents have rarely been church mice afraid of a little salty language. But President Trump has grown increasingly willing in recent months to say in public what most of his predecessors tried to keep behind closed doors.
His is the profanity presidency, full of four-letter denunciations of his enemies and earthy dismissals of allegations lodged against him. At rallies and in interviews, on Twitter and in formal speeches, he relishes the bad-boy language of a shock jock, just one more way of gleefully provoking the political establishment bothered by his norm-shattering ways.
In a single speech on Friday alone, he managed to throw out a "hell," an "ass" and a couple of "bullshits" for good measure. In the course of just one rally in Panama City Beach, Fla., earlier this month, he tossed out 10 "hells," three "damns" and a "crap." The audiences did not seem to mind. They cheered and whooped and applauded.
"I'd say swearing is part of his appeal," said Melissa Mohr, the author of "Holy Sh*t: A Brief History of Swearing," published in 2013. "It helps create the impression that he is saying what he thinks, 'telling it like it is.' We tend to believe people when they swear, because we interpret these words as a sign of strong emotions. In his case, the emotion is often powerful anger, which his supporters seem to love."
While traditionalists may deem it unpresidential and a poor example for children, Martha Joynt Kumar, a longtime scholar of presidential communication, said gritty language was part of the show put on by Mr. Trump, the onetime reality television entertainer, for his fans.
"He knows they like him to use words that lie over the edge of the traditional boundary of presidential decorum," she said. "His controversial word choices are an aspect of his role as the disrupter he promised his constituents he would be."
But critics say the vulgarity comes at a cost. "No one has debased the civil discourse in this country more than President Trump, and the president really does set the tone in the country," said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California. "We see it reflected in our offices by the hateful, belligerent, obscene and violent calls that we get now that we didn't used to get."
Mr. Schiff has experienced it personally when Mr. Trump turned his name into a profanity last fall by nicknaming him "little Adam Schitt." Mr. Schiff said, "The last time that happened, the person who did that had their mouth washed out with soap by his mother."
An unscientific survey seems to suggest that if anything, Mr. Trump is growing more comfortable with crudeness. He used the word "bullshit" in public just once in his first two years in office, according to the Factba.se database that tracks his speeches, but on four occasions in the last three months.
He has either coarsened the public discourse or reflected it, or perhaps both, depending on your view of him, but he is not alone. Society in recent years has embraced what used to be considered profanity. Even The New York Times, the so-called Gray Lady with all the news that's fit to print, found it fit to print the B.S. word just 14 times in the many years before Mr. Trump's inauguration, according to a Nexis search, but has used it 26 times since -- not all in stories covering the president.
Other presidents, of course, have engaged in common language and found a connection to everyday people. Harry S. Truman was told to "give 'em hell, Harry," to which he famously replied: "I don't give them hell. I just tell the truth about them and they think it's hell." But in general, it used to be something of a mini-scandal when a president was caught cursing in public.
During a campaign event in 2000, George W. Bush was heard over a live microphone talking with his running mate, Dick Cheney, calling a Times reporter he did not particularly like a "major-league asshole." In 2004, as vice president, Mr. Cheney told a senator on the Senate floor to "go fuck yourself." His successor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., was overheard in 2010 using a variation of that profanity to tell Barack Obama what a big deal passage of health care legislation was.
Never has any president pushed the boundaries of language as far as Mr. Trump. He had a foul mouth long before politics, of course, but he seemed to try, however fitfully, to clean it up for a while when he set his sights on the White House. Still, he could not resist at times. At one rally during his 2016 campaign, he quoted a supporter calling a Republican rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a "pussy."
Once taking office, he tried, at least, to keep it private, but he was uninhibited when the cameras were not on. After the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was appointed, he told aides, "I'm fucked." Speaking with lawmakers, he called African nations "shithole countries."
Yet Mr. Trump feigned shock in January when the newly elected Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan said she and her fellow House Democrats were "going to impeach the motherfucker." The president told reporters that "she dishonored herself" by "using language like that in front of her son and whoever else was there."
Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, acknowledged a certain raw quality in Mr. Trump's discourse but dismissed its significance. "The president does use coarse language in private a lot with us," he told Jake Tapper on CNN after Ms. Tlaib's comment. "Many people do." But, he added, "I think there's more important things as to who's coarsening the language."
Any restraint Mr. Trump may have sought to exhibit early in his term seems to have eroded in recent months. In a January interview with The Times, he boasted that he had "beat the shit out of" Republican rivals in 2016. A month later, he told the Conservative Political Action Conference that his enemies were trying to take him out "with bullshit," a word he then took up with vigor.
A few weeks later, he told a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., that Democrats were peddling it. In April, he used it to describe some statements in the special counsel report.
By the time the president took the stage before the National Association of Realtors in Washington on Friday, he was in a feisty mood.
He recalled that a consultant tried to make work for himself by identifying environmental concerns on a property Mr. Trump wanted to develop. "I fired his ass so fast," the president recalled.
He told the Realtors that he used to refuse to pay brokers their traditional 6 percent commission and instead gave them just 1 percent. "I was famous for that," he said. When they booed, he quickly retreated. "Don't worry. Nobody accepted it. But I tried like hell."
Then he went after one of his favorite targets -- journalists -- claiming that recent reports of infighting within his national security team were made up. "There is no source," he said. "The person doesn't exist. The person's not alive. It's bullshit, O.K.? It's bullshit."
And with that, the television networks had to hit their bleeper again.

Texto completo: I.M. Pei, the architect revered around the world for iconic modernist structures including a section of the Des Moines Art Center, has died. He was 102.
Pei, born in China and educated at Harvard, was the creator behind structures like the glass pyramid at The Louvre in Paris, the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington and John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, among many well-known buildings in various corners of the world.
He died early Thursday, his son, architect Li Chung Pei, confirmed to the New York Times.
A spacious section of the Des Moines Art Center, made mostly of concrete, was designed by Pei in 1965 and opened in 1968. The addition expanded the Art Center, which was originally designed by Eliel Saarinen in 1948. A third wing of the building, designed by Richard Meier, was added in 1984.
The design of the I.M. Pei wing of the Des Moines Art Center compliments the original Saarinen design while maintaining the architect's trademark austere modernism and penchant for spaces made serene through the use of open space and glass.
The wing often houses the Art Center's sculptures and larger wall-mounted pieces due to its cavernous qualities.
In 2018, the I.M. Pei wing saw the installation of the "River," a curvilinear sculpture of the Mississippi River outline created by Dubuque native Jen Berven. The sculpture is embedded within the concrete walls and took 12 years to complete.
The eponymous wing of the Art Center was not Pei's only gift to the city of Des Moines.
According to former Register staff writer Eliot Nusbaum, Pei visited the city several times in the 1960s, during the wing's construction.
On a walk with David Kruidenier, then publisher of The Des Moines Register and Tribune, Pei asked, "Where's the center of town? I've been looking around, and I can't see it."
After Kruidenier said they didn't have one, Pei responded: "All great cities have an open space at their center."
The idea stuck with the publisher, who later helped lead fundraising that resulted in the building of the Des Moines Civic Center and the adjoining Nollen Plaza, now named Cowles Commons.
I.M. Pei designed a spacious segment of the Des Moines Art Center that often houses sculptures and larger paintings from its collection.

Texto completo: Bill de Blasio, the Democratic mayor of New York City, announced Thursday that he was running for president, seeking to show that his brand of urban progressive leadership can be a model for the rest of the nation.
It will be a steep challenge: He becomes the 23rd Democrat to enter the presidential race, and he does so against the counsel of many of his trusted advisers, and in the face of two centuries of history.
No sitting mayor has been elected to the presidency, and if de Blasio, 58, is to be the first, he must overcome daunting deficits in polls and fundraising.
His announcement, in a three-minute video titled “Working People First," comes after months of groundwork that has included visits to early presidential primary states, a fundraiser in Boston, and a circuslike news conference this week in the lobby of Trump Tower.
The video began with what has become the mayor's tagline this year, as he has flirted with declaring his candidacy. “There's plenty of money in this country, it's just in the wrong hands," he said, before highlighting his accomplishments as mayor and the ways that he has confronted President Trump over immigration and climate change.
“I'm a New Yorker, I've known Trump's a bully for a long time," he said.
De Blasio then appeared on ABC's “Good Morning America" with his wife, Chirlane McCray, seemingly intent on drawing the attention of Trump right out of the box, calling him “Con Don" — using Trump's tactic of coining demeaning nicknames for rivals.
It did not take long for Trump to respond on Twitter, calling de Blasio “the worst mayor" in the country.

Trump pardoned two with ties to him and his family
President Trump on Wednesday night pardoned two prominent conservatives who had already completed their sentences.
Trump pardoned billionaire Conrad Black, who a year ago published a book called "Donald J. Trump: A president like no other." The book is more hagiography than biography. It defends Trump against charges that he is a racist, stating flatly that he is not. It hails his "very successful" foreign policy ventures. It credits his "unquenchable energy," "sheer entertainment talent," and "raw toughness." It misleadingly hails his 2016 election win by saying he won "more votes than any previous Republican candidate for president," without noting that this was mostly a function of population growth and that Trump lost the popular vote. He called Trump's win a "stunning rebuff" of the media.
The second pardon went to Patrick J. Nolan, the former Republican leader of the California state assembly. Nolan has been a prominent conservative voice for criminal justice reform since finishing his sentence and has served in prison ministry. But he, like Black, is close to the Trump family. Appearing at a White House ceremony celebrating the passage of criminal justice reform legislation, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner called Nolan "my friend," and Nolan called Kushner "just a superstar. I'm impressed with him so much."

Flynn described efforts to interfere with cooperation
WASHINGTON — Former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn told the special counsel's office that people connected to the Trump administration and Congress sought to influence his cooperation with the Russia investigation, and he provided a voicemail recording of one such communication, prosecutors said in a court filing made public Thursday.
Meanwhile, the judge in the case ordered that portions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report that relate to Flynn be unredacted and made public by the end of the month.
Thursday's order from US District Judge Emmet Sullivan is the first time a judge is known to have directed the Justice Department to make public any portion of the report that the agency had kept secret. It could set up a conflict with Attorney General William Barr, whose team spent weeks blacking out from the report grand jury information, details of ongoing investigations, and other sensitive information.
Prosecutors revealed details about Flynn's communications in a court filing aimed at showing the extent of his cooperation with Mueller's investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Flynn, a vital witness in the probe, is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts during the presidential transition period in 2016 with the-then Russian ambassador to the United States.
Prosecutors did not identify the people with whom Flynn was in touch nor did they describe the exact conversations.
But they said Flynn recounted multiple instances in which "he or his attorneys received communications from persons connected to the administration or Congress that could have affected both his willingness to cooperate and the completeness of that cooperation." Prosecutors say they were unaware of some of those instances, which took place before and after his guilty plea, until Flynn told them about them.

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is reviewing the “very unusual” role that the so-called Steele dossier played in the Trump-Russia investigation.
In a Fox News interview that aired Friday, Barr said there were "clear mistakes" in the anti-Trump research. The government’s use of the dossier, whose unverified allegations were used to justify surveillance of a former Trump campaign associate, is “one of the questions that we’re going to have to look at” as part of his broader probe into the actions taken by the DOJ and FBI.
The dossier was authored by British ex-spy Christopher Steele and was packed with unverified claims about President Trump's ties to Russia. It formed a key part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications used to justify surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Steele was working for Fusion GPS which was receiving funding through the Perkins Coie law firm from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee — facts that were not communicated to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
Barr said that “it’s a very unusual situation to have opposition research like that — especially one that on its face had a number of clear mistakes and a somewhat jejune analysis.” Barr’s pointed critiques of the Steele dossier’s flaws comes after former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI General Counsel James Baker defended their handling of the dossier in recent days.
Comey said “the most important part” of the dossier was related to “Russians coming for the American election,” which he asserted was “consistent with our other intelligence” and “true.” Baker said the FBI treated the dossier “seriously … but not literally.”
Although Barr did not discuss the specific mistakes he was referring to in the dossier, it is likely that he was referring to newly released notes from an Oct. 11, 2016, meeting between Steele and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec, which cast doubt on the reliability of Steele’s dossier and called into question the information provided to the court in the FISA application that was submitted later that month. The notes, which Kavalec is believed to have emailed to the FBI in mid-October, indicate that Steele knew he had been hired by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee and had been told they wanted his findings made public prior to the 2016 election on Nov. 8.
The notes also show that Kavalec believed at least some of Steele’s allegations to be false. She said Steele alleged that, as part of Russia’s 2016 election interference efforts, there was a “significant Russian network in the U.S. run by the Russian Embassy that draws on emigres to do hacking and recruiting” and “payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami.” But Kavalec pointed out “it is important to note that there is no Russian Consulate in Miami.”
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in May that DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele. The report said the inspector general’s office “has been asking why the FBI continued to cite Steele as a credible source in the renewal applications.”
The New York Times reported in April that the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources in an attempt to determine their credibility, and as early as January 2017 agents had concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based upon “Russian disinformation.”
Horowitz, who launched his investigation in 2018, said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Carter Page]."
Horowitz further stated that he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source [Christopher Steele]. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.”
Barr has said Horowitz’s investigation should be completed in either May or June.

Multiculturalism being undermined

Texto completo: The white male racist patriarchy will not be denied. It is having a moment. It has its own president.
According to a Pew Research Center analysis of race/ethnicity and sex among validated voters in the 2016 presidential election, white men were the only group in which a majority voted for Donald Trump - 62% - although a plurality of white women did also - 47%.
We are living through a flagrant display of a white male exertion of power, authority and privilege, a demonstration meant to underscore that they will forcefully fight any momentum toward demographic displacement, no matter how inevitable the math.
The fear of white male displacement is a powerful psychological motivator and keeps Trump's base animated and active.
It keeps farmers holding out hope and making excuses for him, even as his trade war devastates their operations. It keeps coal country loyal, even as the promises of a revitalized coal industry ring hollow. It keeps white voters in the Rust Belt on the edge of their seats, waiting for the day that he will magically bring back manufacturing. It keeps white voters in the South heated over the issue of immigration and an "invasion" or "infestation" of Latin Americans.
Trump's central promise as a politician has been the elevation, protection and promotion of whiteness, particularly white men who fear demographic changes and loss of status and privilege.
As psychologist Jonathan Haidt recently told Vox:
"As multiculturalism is emphasized more and more, there emerges a reaction against it on the right, which is attractive to the authoritarian mind and also appeals to other conservatives. And this, I think, is what has happened, this is what Trump is about - not entirely, of course, but certainly this is a big factor."
It is about stacking the courts, controlling the bodies of women (look no further than the raft of state abortion restrictions recently passed, including the outrageous new abortion law in Alabama), fighting the redefinition of gender as personified by the advances in liberty among people who are transgender, restricting the voting of nonwhite, less conservative groups, and controlling the flow of migrants into the country who do not bolster the white population.
But the stacking of the courts may well be the thing that makes all the others possible.
While much of the country tries to contend with the unending stream of outrages in the White House, the Senate majority leader is pushing through a steady stream of Trump's far-right federal judges, often breaking precedent and allowing for their confirmations over their home state's senators' objection.
The recent confirmation of Joseph Bianco to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New York, was Trump's 38th confirmed circuit court judge, HuffPost reported last week, adding:
"That's more circuit judges than any president has gotten by this point in a first term, and means that one in every six seats on the nation's circuit courts is now filled by a Trump nominee."
These are lifetime appointments. Even if demographics change over one's lifetime, these judges will not.
As a recent Congressional Research Service report pointed out, 90% of Trump's circuit court nominees have been white and 92% of those confirmed have been white. 
Eighty percent of Trump's judicial nominees have been men, and men have been 74% of those confirmed.
Trump will be president for only two more years - or, God forbid, six more - but this tension and standoff over power and status will continue. At present, white men still control much of the power in this country.
Frederick Douglass once said, "Power concedes nothing without a demand." I speculate that this power may not concede until its death rattle.
Charles M. Blow writes for the New York Times.

POP MUSIC; Mighty roar in musical jungle; Who wrote 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'? A film on Netflix seeks answers and closure.

Texto completo: As a kid growing up in South Africa, Rian Malan vividly remembers his mother happily singing an infectious melody as she went about her day at home. That song had been popularized half a world away by the New York folk group the Weavers in the early 1950s, and again a decade later in a reworking by the doo-wop group the Tokens, which in 1961 turned it into the pop hit known around the world as "The Lion Sleeps Tonight."
It wasn't until adulthood, however, after Malan became a music journalist, that he discovered that the song had been born in his own backyard, in 1939 by South African Zulu musician Solomon Linda, a name virtually unknown to Malan, his mother or the millions who've ever fallen under the spell of "Wimoweh," or "The Lion Sleeps Tonight."
"In retrospect," Malan, 64, said last week, "it seems amazing that I, a self-styled leftist and hipster, should have been so totally ignorant about Linda and the story behind 'Lion Sleeps Tonight.'

"You could blame apartheid, I guess. But then again, I read a New York Times story the other day describing 'Irene Goodnight' as a Weavers' composition, and they learned that tune off [folk-blues musician] Lead Belly. So maybe Linda also deserves a shot at resurrection."
Linda is given that shot in "The Lion's Share," premiering Friday as part of the new "ReMastered" series of music documentaries on Netflix. This episode explores the twisting, turning history of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" and its legacy for its creator, who died in 1962, and his heirs, who've lived most of their lives in poverty.
The song has had a remarkable lifespan, thanks to subsequent versions that have kept it in listeners' ears for more than half a century. It's been recorded by musicians as disparate as the Kingston Trio, Robert John, Tight Fit, Miriam Makeba, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, R.E.M., Chet Atkins, Jimmy Dorsey and Kool & the Gang.
It also grabbed the spotlight in the Walt Disney Co.'s 1994 animated mega hit "The Lion King," and in turn the spinoff Broadway musical and, very soon, the new live-action reboot film, where "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" pops up in the trailer.
The song, as the "Lion's Share" documentary outlines, dates to 1939, and Linda, whose group the Evening Birds made the recording that found its way across the Atlantic and into the hands of folk music revivalists Pete Seeger and the Weavers, and then, with additional lyrics written by George David Weiss, to the Tokens.
That saga is the crux of the new film, directed by Sam Cullman and centering heavily on the back story unearthed by Malan, who, along with Linda and his daughters, are focal points of the documentary.
"I definitely experienced a bit of whiplash a number of times during production," Cullman said by phone from Brooklyn. "As we were filming and uncovering the story, we had to follow the truth of what we were uncovering, and not where our hearts were."
The simplistic version of the story would be that Linda was cheated out of his rightful songwriting royalties by scheming, heartless music business sharps. He originated the song "Mbube," the Zulu word for "lion," and during one of three attempts at the song in a South African recording studio, spontaneously spun out the soaring, bewitching falsetto melody that has defined every subsequent version of his song.
"The Lion Sleeps To- night" wound up generating millions of dollars over the decades, little of which ever reached Linda's family. It's a classic theme repeated countless times in the U.S. for black blues, R&B and soul musicians who often unknowingly signed away lucrative rights to their music.
The story gets richer through the interdiction of Malan, who explored its history in an extensive piece for Rolling Stone in 2000, writing: "This one's for Solomon Linda.... a Zulu who wrote a melody that earned untold millions for white men but died so poor that his widow couldn't afford a stone for his grave."
"I've been in the music publishing business for decades," said Randy Poe, president of Leiber & Stoller Music Publishing, which at one point administered copyrights for more than 50,000 songs. "I've written two books on the subject. The saga of 'Mbube' and 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' is one of the most complicated and convoluted music publishing-songwriting stories ever."
"Lion's Share" opens with fascinating biographical background on Malan, whose great-uncle, D.F. Malan, was the prime minister of South Africa who oversaw creation of the government's apartheid policies. In the film, Rian Malan says family history was a source of considerable guilt and shame for him growing up and a big part of his motivation to find a way to do something positive for the black community.
The trouble with Linda's song begins with the fact that it initially was not copyrighted.
Only later, after the Weavers' tune "Wimoweh" started up the charts in the U.S. in 1952, did an unwitting Linda sign publishing rights over to a South African company, Gallo Music, which subsequently negotiated licensing rights for "Wimoweh" and "The Lion Sleeps Tonight," because both were rooted in "Mbube."
The Tokens' version, which has been streamed more than 48 million times on Spotify, is still credited only to New York song- writer Weiss, who came up with the "In the jungle, the mighty jungle" lyrics, and RCA Records producers Luigi Creatore and Hugo Peretti, who hired Weiss to help craft the pop reworking of "Wimoweh." (Weiss died in 2010.) The copyright for "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" belongs to Weiss' publishing company, Abilene Music, now part of the Concord Music Group.
In 2004, a decade after the "Lion King" movie came out, Linda's family went to court against Disney, which initially tried to use its considerable muscle to quash the suit. With Malan's help, family members found a copyright law expert who helped them win an early ruling, prompting the entertainment giant and Abilene Music to propose a settlement, terms of which have never been publicized as part of the deal.
"I was pitched the story, and the original context was, 'Here's this horrible thing that happened and here's this happy ending,' " Cullman said, referring to the settlement. Something about that simplistic narrative didn't feel right. "What really jumped out for me was that Rian was no longer in touch with the family and there had been this 10-year gap after the settlement."
Indeed, the final third of the film reunites Malan with Linda's three surviving children -- Elizabeth, Delphi and Fildah Ntsele -- in 2018. Viewers learn that although they did receive significant money in the decade after the Disney lawsuit -- around $250,000 per daughter -- that represented only a fraction of the money that "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" and "Wimoweh" have generated over more than half a century. (Malan's Rolling Stone piece in 2000 estimated that "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" might have generated royalties of $15 million at that time from its multiple recorded versions, film, theater and TV uses, although such figures are extremely difficult to document.)
"A deal is a deal, and this one is done," said Malan, who also is bound by non- disclosure terms of the Disney settlement. According to Malan, the settlement bars the Linda family from making further claims against Abilene and the three Americans credited as composers of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight."
"It is entirely legal," he added. "But it is not fair. I find myself hoping that [the Linda family's story] catches the eye of certain Americans, who might just say, 'God, that's just not right -- let's give Linda's family a piece of the action.' "
Regardless of the business side of the tale, Malan still marvels at the improbability of it all.
"A Zulu on the far side of the planet writes a 13- note melody that flies off and takes root in the brain of a radical American folksinger who turns it into 'Wimoweh,' which in turn gives birth to 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight,' which goes through about 12 hit cycles over the next 60 years," he said. "I love that part of the story, the improbable cul- tural transfers and misunderstandings, the strange musical mutations, the rich mix of characters.... But that's a story about music. The parallel story about money has been less inspiring.
"I like to think that the various tellers of Linda's story have at least slightly altered the verdict of his- tory. Whenever 'Lion Sleeps Tonight' comes up on the radio here in South Africa, Solomon Linda's name will be mentioned.
"It's not great, but it's something."

Texto completo: Maximum Security was disqualified as the winner of the Kentucky Derby on May 4 after stewards determined he had interfered with other horses. The decision gave the victory instead to the 65-1 shot Country House. Both will be sitting out the 144th Preakness Stakes on Saturday, making it the first time in 23 years that there will be no Triple Crown on the line at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore.
The Preakness horses are listed in order of post position, with comments by Joe Drape and Melissa Hoppert of The New York Times. The morning-line odds were set by Keith Feustle of Pimlico.
[Read more here about how Maximum Security was disqualified at the Kentucky Derby.]
How to watch: Coverage on Saturday begins on NBC Sports Network at 2 p.m., Eastern Time, and continues on NBC at 5. The race is set to go off around 6:48 p.m. Coverage will also be streamed on NBC Sports Live.
Purse: $ 1.5 million guaranteed
Distance: 1 3/16 miles
Track record: 1:52.2 (Farma Way, 1991)

Our Picks
Joe Drape's win-place-show picks: Anothertwistafate, Owendale, Signalman
Melissa Hoppert's picks: War of Will, Bourbon War, Improbable
Here's how we see the field:
1. War of Will
Trainer: Mark Casse Jockey: Tyler Gaffalione Odds: 4-1
Drape: This colt lost all chance in the Kentucky Derby when he tangled with Maximum Security. It had to take something out of him.
Hoppert: The seventh-place Derby finisher can't catch a break: a stumble in Louisiana, a rumble in Kentucky and back-to-back No. 1 posts. Imagine what he could do with a clean trip.
2. Bourbon War
Trainer: Mark Hennig Jockey: Irad Ortiz Jr. Odds: 12-1
Drape: He likes running from the back of the pack and has a strong closing kick. A lot has to go right for him to win this.
Hoppert: He closed hard for fourth in the Florida Derby, behind Maximum Security, Bodexpress and Code of Honor (second in Derby), and has Ortiz in the saddle. Leave him off your tickets at your own peril.
3. Warrior's Charge
Trainer: Brad Cox Jockey: Javier Castellano Odds: 12-1
Drape: He has won his last two gate-to-wire. He is stepping up in company here, but this isn't a Derby-caliber bunch.
Hoppert: This pacesetter won his last two by a combined 12½ lengths, but he won't be as dominant in his first graded stakes race.
4. Improbable
Trainer: Bob Baffert Jockey: Mike Smith Odds: 5-2
Drape: A very talented colt who has failed to get to the finish line first this year. This underachiever is the morning-line favorite. No thank you.
Hoppert: The fourth-place Derby finisher has Baffert, tied for most Preakness wins with seven, and Big Money Smith on his side. Hard to bet against that.
5. Owendale
Trainer: Brad Cox Jockey: Florent Geroux Odds: 10-1
Drape: This colt is fast, maturing and well rested. In a field with no standouts, he is worth a shot.
Hoppert: An impressive rally in the Lexington Stakes, with Geroux in the irons for the first time, makes him an intriguing choice.
6. Market King
Trainer: D. Wayne Lukas Jockey: Jon Court Odds: 30-1
Drape: Over a storied Hall of Fame career, Lukas has won plenty of races he should not have with what, at least on paper, appeared to be hopeless long shots.
Hoppert: Lukas has six Preakness victories, but this horse, who has won once in eight tries, will not land him a seventh.
7. Alwaysmining
Trainer: Kelly Rubley Jockey: Daniel Centeno Odds: 8-1
Drape: There's always a local horse in this race whom Marylanders invest their hearts and dollars in. This one may actually win.
Hoppert: He has won six straight at Laurel and has a better shot than recent hometown favorites at becoming the first Maryland-bred to win the Preakness since 1983.
8. Signalman
Trainer: Kenny McPeek Jockey: Brian Hernandez Jr. Odds: 30-1
Drape: This colt is a live long shot in a wide-open race. His morning workouts have been eye-catching, and he might be sitting on a big one.
Hoppert: He's a hard-trying type who just missed qualifying for the Derby, finishing a close third in the Blue Grass. That said, he's a step slower than most of his competitors.
9. Bodexpress
Trainer: Gustavo Delgado Jockey: John Velazquez Odds: 20-1
Drape: Another that was involved in the Maximum Security pileup. Not seeing it.
Hoppert: He was impeded in the Derby and finished 13th, but he never had a shot anyway to secure his first win.
10. Everfast
Trainer: Dale Romans Jockey: Joel Rosario Odds: 50-1
Drape: Perhaps his trainer is taking a page from Lukas's you-gotta-be-in-it-to-win-it philosophy.
Hoppert: He won his debut, then lost nine straight. Next.
11. Laughing Fox
Trainer: Steve Asmussen Jockey: Ricardo Santana Jr. Odds: 20-1
Drape: Another colt who will do all his running late. He will need a lot of luck to get there first.
Hoppert: He won the Oaklawn Invitational after finishing fourth in the Arkansas Derby. He appears overmatched, but his trainer knows how to hit the board here.
12. Anothertwistafate
Trainer: Blaine Wright Jockey: Jose Ortiz Odds: 6-1
Drape: He has three wins and two seconds in six starts and has been carefully handled by his Bay Area-based trainer. Here's your winner.
Hoppert: The runner-up in the Sunland Derby and the Lexington Stakes picks up Ortiz as his rider, but that's not likely to be enough.
13. Win Win Win
Trainer: Mike Trombetta Jockey: Julian Pimentel Odds: 15-1
Drape: Cleverly named horse survived the Derby, but he didn't make an impact. Don't think he will here, either.
Hoppert: The ninth-place Derby finisher may be better suited for shorter distances.

Texto completo: As people continue to complain about the current season of "Game of Thrones, consider redirecting your attention to another series: the 22nd season of "Arthur.
In the season premiere, which aired Monday, Arthur and the rest of his ageless classmates learn that their third-grade teacher, Nigel Ratburn, is getting married. The episode quickly gained traction online among grown "Arthur fans, eliciting two major reactions: First, who among the non-parents knew PBS was still airing new episodes? But more importantly, fans joined the Lakewood Elementary kids in being pleasantly surprised by whom Mr. Ratburn had chosen to marry: an aardvark named Patrick.
The kids had worried that Mr. Ratburn, whom they had overheard talking about floral arrangements, was engaged to a bossy stranger named Patty. They spend several minutes of the show channeling their disappointment into playing matchmaker, only to discover at the wedding ceremony that Patty (voiced by Jane Lynch!) isn't actually their teacher's fiance, but a sibling. Muffy squeaks the question on all of our minds: "If Patty's his sister, then who is Mr. Ratburn marrying?
In comes the man of the hour, walking arm in arm with Patrick, a local chocolatier - straight out of a Nora Ephron movie, no? Cut to the dance floor, where Buster approaches his friends with a plate of "the best cake I've ever had, a nod to Mr. Ratburn's famous love of the dessert.
After Arthur exclaims, "Mr. Ratburn is married! I still can't believe it, Francine responds that it's "a brand-new world. There is no explicit reference made to Patrick's gender, furthering the message of acceptance. GLAAD was among many who congratulated the beloved teacher on Twitter. Several users referred to him as a gay icon.
Mr. Ratburn and "the Special Someone, as Patrick is referred to in the episode's title, join a small group of LGBTQ figures to appear in the "Arthur universe. In 2005, PBS pulled an episode of the spinoff "Postcards From Buster, which followed Arthur's rabbit friend as he visited different cities across North America. Margaret Spellings, a secretary of education under former president George W. Bush, had denounced the episode featuring the children of two lesbians living in Vermont because, according to a New York Times article from the time, she believed many parents wouldn't want to "expose their children to a same-sex couple.
"I am disappointed by PBS's decision, Marc Brown, author of the "Arthur books and creator of both television series, said to the Times in a statement. He added that "Postcards From Buster existed to "connect kids with other kids by reflecting their lives. In some episodes, as in the Vermont one, we are validating children who are seldom validated.
The only sense of discomfort in "Mr. Ratburn and the Special Someone comes from Francine, and it has nothing to do with her teacher's choice of partner. She looks to the other end of the dance floor and says with wide eyes, "But there's one thing that teachers should never, ever do.
"What? Buster asks.
"Dance, Francine responds, pointing to Mr. Ratburn and Patrick as they wow the crowd with their moves.

Met Museum: No more money from family connected to OxyContin

Texto completo: NEW YORK - The Metropolitan Museum of Art on Wednesday said it would stop taking monetary gifts from members of the Sackler family who are connected to the pharmaceutical company that makes OxyContin, cutting a longstanding philanthropic relationship at a time when cultural institutions are coming under increasing scrutiny over their donors.
The Sackler family overall has a multi-decade history with the Met and other cultural institutions, and there is a wing named for them at the museum that houses the well-known Temple of Dendur.
But there has been increasing criticism over institutions accepting money from the branches of the Sackler family that are connected to Purdue Pharma, which makes OxyContin.
Purdue and the Sacklers connected to it are being sued over accusations revolving around their role in the nation's opioid crisis.
Museum President and CEO Daniel Weiss said the family overall had "graciously supported the museum for 50 years but "nevertheless, in consideration of the ongoing litigation, the prudent course of action at this time is to suspend acceptance of gifts from individuals associated with this public health crisis.
In a statement to The New York Times, the Sacklers linked to Purdue Pharma said that "while the allegations against our family are false and unfair, we understand that accepting gifts at this time would put the Met in a difficult position. We respect the Met and that is the last thing we would want to do. Our goal has always been to support the valuable work of such outstanding organizations, and we remain committed to doing so.
The museum's decision follows similar moves by the Tate Modern in London and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City.

Alabama is the latest in a growing list of states passing bans on abortion in an attempt to get the Supreme Court to weaken or overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. Unlike most of the other state laws that have passed this year, however, the Alabama law would completely ban abortion except when the woman’s life was in danger from the pregnancy.
On Capitol Hill, separate bipartisan groups in the House and Senate unveiled draft proposals to address “surprise” medical bills that patients get when they inadvertently receive care outside their insurance network. The bills take different approaches, however, so it’s not clear where a compromise might lie.
And in Washington state, the legislature has approved a new “public option” health insurance plan — to be run by private insurers — that will become available for consumers who purchase their own insurance.
This week’s panelists are Julie Rovner from Kaiser Health News, Margot Sanger-Katz of The New York Times, Anna Edney of Bloomberg News and Alice Miranda Ollstein of Politico.
Among the takeaways from this week’s podcast:
The high court’s justices can pick and choose which cases they take, and many observers think that they are more inclined to deal with abortion on an incremental basis rather than through a radical change like Alabama’s law. A law from Indiana that bans abortions for particular reasons, including gender selection and disability, has been before the court for months. It’s not yet clear if the current spate of state bills will have an impact on the presidential election in 2020, but they could play a role in Senate races in Alabama, Georgia and Maine, among other states. As the effort on surprise medical bills works its way forward, keep an eye on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who chairs the committee that handles these measures. He has suggested that he will have another bill to offer on the subject. House Democrats have packed some popular bills to fight rising drug prices with measures to bolster the Affordable Care Act, and Republicans are crying foul. Once again, Sen. Alexander may be a critical player, because he is trying to pull together a measure that deals with drug pricing, surprise medical bills, the cost of health care and the Obamacare marketplaces. Washington has become the first state to embrace a public option insurance plan for its ACA marketplace. But the plan will be run by insurance companies and it’s unclear how that would lead to lower premium prices for consumers.
Plus, for extra credit, the panelists recommend their favorite health policy stories of the week they think you should read too:
Julie Rovner: The Atlantic’s “ Why the Government Pays Billions to People Who Claim Injury by Vaccines,” by James Hamblin
Margot Sanger-Katz: Journal of the American Medical Association’s “ Association of a Beverage Tax on Sugar-Sweetened and Artificially Sweetened Beverages With Changes in Beverage Prices and Sales at Chain Retailers in a Large Urban Setting,” by Christina A. Roberto, Hannah G. Lawman, Michael T. LeVasseur and others
Alice Miranda Ollstein: The New York Times’ “ Why Politics Should Be Kept Out of Miscarriages,” by Aaron E. Carroll

Texto completo: If you've been paying attention to the news, you know two things: Contempt is alive and well in America. The planet, on the other hand, is dying.
Earlier this month, headlines out of Paris announced sobering, widespread evidence of flora and fauna in rapid decline. Scientists now say that “around 1 million species already face extinction, many within decades." And the “alpha culprit" of this crisis, according to a recent New York Times editorial, is large-scale farming that willfully or ignorantly destroys the very land it aims to cultivate.
This should be reason enough for you to see “The Biggest Little Farm." But writer-director-cinematographer John Chester isn't taking any chances. Just in case you need to be sold on the theatrical entertainment value of a feature-length agri-activism documentary, he's also packaged his film for mass-market appeal.
Think “An Inconvenient Truth" meets “Babe," or “The Good Earth" meets a biodiverse “Marley & Me," with a dash of the Food Network's “Pioneer Woman" tossed in. Among other things, that means furry critters romping to a folksy soundtrack with tubas and banjos employed unironically. It means circle-of-life lessons and sun-dappled everything . It means check your cynicism and snark at the gate, if you dare.
To which I say: OK, Mr. Chester, you got me.
When I first saw this movie near the end of last year's Toronto International Film Festival, I was exhausted and probably starving for a feel-good nibble. That's how I justified falling hard for the sweet autobiographical chronicle of Chester and his wife, Molly, a food blogger and personal chef, who rescue a dog (Todd), move to the untamed hills outside of Los Angeles, and begin a daunting quest to transform 200 spent acres into a model of responsible commercial farming. My critical guard was down. Yeah, that's it.
Then I watched “The Biggest Little Farm" again, recently. Same result.
Maybe this time I noticed a few more layers of polish and genial manipulation, but second viewings always risk exposing the magic trick. I was still charmed and still invested in the journey of these intrepid organic entrepreneurs. How can you not love regular people hellbent on doing a difficult job right, led by an oddball guru named Alan York, who calmly surfs every wave of problems that the land and its inhabitants can conjure?
“Diversify, diversify, diversify," York says. And they do, plowing all of their savings into expensive upgrades and cover crops that only introduce more pests, until one day their endless web of woes becomes a glorious, self-policing habitat.
The soil regenerates. Adorable animals and their less-adorable predators find a way to coexist. And yes, even with so many obstacles, it all might seem too forcibly idyllic at some point. But if you're looking for proof that our ecosystem can survive pretty much anything we humans can throw at it — a reason to believe that the planet's scar tissue might not be 100 percent irreversible — this movie is like 91 minutes of the best kind of church.
It's truly food for the soul.
Sustainable food? Well, the Chesters' Apricot Lane Farms has evolved into a booming business that regularly supplies produce to LA's finest restaurants. Its eggs are so coveted that farmers' market patrons reportedly wait more than an hour to fork over $15 for a dozen. And portly Emma the pig, a breakout star of the film, just got her own children's book.
You can squint and see slick opportunism, if you want. But in Southern California, where advocacy and celebrity often intertwine, that's what they call a grassroots success story.
★★★½ The Biggest Little Farm
Directed by John Chester. Written by Chester and Mark Monroe. At Boston Common, Coolidge Corner, and Kendall Square. 91 minutes. PG (mild thematic elements: births, deaths, peril, feces).

Max Boot, media grifter, is projecting his own sin onto Trump

Texto completo: It’s hard not to laugh when anyone in Washington accuses President Trump of ushering in a gang of grifters, as if before Trump the city had been full of ethical people selflessly sacrificing for the common good.
Washington Post columnist Max Boot, the personification of all that is pure and bald, wrote Monday on conservatism devolving into a “racket,” with Trump and his associates serving as the ultimate beneficiaries.
“The grifter in chief is Trump himself,” wrote Boot in corny fashion. ”He marketed himself as a fabulously successful businessman. Except — oops — the New York Times revealed that he received much of his wealth from his father — more than $400 million — and that he had more than $1.1 billion in losses from 1985 to 1994. … So it turns out that Trump is a big loser.”
The clever burn about Trump not being as rich or successful throughout his life as he claims is always peculiar when you consider that he's done, and is doing, quite well. (Who's going to pay Boot a licensing fee to put his name on a luxury hotel?)
Boot said the origins of conservatism as a racket trace back to 1996, the year Rupert Murdoch created Fox News “to monetize right-wing outrage.” (Oops! Boot was fooled for 20 years?) I’m sure that line pleased Boot’s other bosses at CNN, where he works and which competes with Fox, a fact that notably went undisclosed within the column.
But in the Trump era, always look critically at the accusations lobbed by the self-anointed anti-Trump “former Republicans” and you’ll invariably find that they’re the guilty ones.
Boot “left” the Republican Party the instant it became profitable for him and anyone else in the national political media to rail against the GOP’s new leader. He was only hired by the Post in January 2018. That gig started earning him segments on CNN, then a paid contract. Now, this former Iraq War enthusiast routinely pushes the buttons Democrats and the national media require from any “former Republican." Two weeks ago, he called Attorney General William Barr a criminal. Last month, he heralded Democratic California Gov. Jerry Brown as “one of the most successful politicians in U.S. history,” then asked him “how to beat President Trump.” Ahead of the midterms, Boot called on voters to oppose all Republicans.
This is someone who for decades was a Republican, but who now miraculously sees the liberal light and has taken the exact opposite position he used to hold ... on nearly everything.
You could understand and believe a Republican who simply doesn’t care for Trump or the Republicans who support him. Such a person's sincerity would be demonstrated by his consistent application of the principles he's always held, and one could verify this by watching him accuse Trump of betraying those principles.
But to make the complete transformation from stalwart war-machine Republican to dummy for Democrats? California Democrats? That is the definition of grift.
Boot made a business decision based on ubiquitous media hatred for Trump. He's cashing in, capitalizing on Washington based on a swindle. He's a grifter. And he's not alone in the media.
Trump didn’t bring anything new to Washington. The Max Boots have been here all along, thinking about whatever they need to say next to collect a paycheck.

NYU Hires Law Firm to Investigate Behavior of Steinhardt, a Prominent Donor

Texto completo: NYU said on Monday that it had hired a prominent law firm to investigate whether the namesake of its school of education, Michael H. Steinhardt, had engaged in inappropriate conduct with students, faculty or staff.
The review will be headed by Joan McPhee, a lawyer who last year helped lead an investigation of Lawrence G. Nassar, a USA Gymnastics team doctor who last year was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison for sexually abusing young women. McPhee was hired by NYU as part of its response to a New York Times-ProPublica article that alleged a pattern of crude and demeaning sexual comments by Steinhardt toward women over decades.
Steinhardt, a hedge fund pioneer and philanthropist, denied many of the specifics of the allegations, saying that his behavior was always meant in jest, and never involved physical contact.
The NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development, the largest graduate school at the university, got its name after Steinhardt and his wife, Judy, donated $10 million to the school in 2001. It was the largest gift the graduate school had ever received.
The allegations, which were published in March, prompted some students to ask for the school to be renamed. The school's student body is predominantly women.
"As somebody who is graduating, I don't want to accept a diploma with this man's name on it," Beena Rachel Jacob, a 23-year-old senior in the education studies program at NYU Steinhardt, said on Monday.
After the article was published, the dean of NYU Steinhardt, Dominic Brewer, told the school's community in a statement that while the Steinhardts had been generous, "the kind of remarks and behavior recounted in the news story are out-of-step with our school's values and how we expect people to conduct themselves in this day and age."
The university, he wrote, would undertake a review of Steinhardt's interactions with NYU students, faculty and staff. Monday's announcement, which came as the academic year was ending, was the first update about the situation the school had provided.
"The only new development is the identity of the law firm that is handling the previously-announced investigation," said a lawyer for Steinhardt, Tom Clare.
The firm set up a phone number and email address where people could give an account of improper behavior. Clare called that step "routine" for this kind of investigation.

Women Who Worked with Billionaire Philanthropist Michael Steinhardt Say He Asked for Sex
“Institutions in the Jewish world have long known about his behavior, and they have looked the other way,” said one of seven women who have recounted Steinhardt making sexual requests. Steinhardt denied many of the allegations but apologized for “boorish” comments.
Carol Anne Spreen, an associate professor of international education at Steinhardt, said that the university's response should not just depend on what may have happened on its campus. "I know students are really upset," Spreen said. "It's about how the university gets represented out in the public. It's not just about their experiences with him."
In the article, six women said in interviews, and one said in a lawsuit, that Steinhardt asked
them to have sex with him, or made sexual requests of them, while they were relying on or seeking his support. He also regularly made comments to women about their bodies and their fertility, according to the seven women and 16 other people who said they were present when Steinhardt made such comments. None of the incidents described by the women were alleged to have occurred at NYU
"As I have said before, I deeply regret cavalierly making comments in professional settings that were boorish, disrespectful and just plain dumb," Steinhardt said in a statement in response to the article.
McPhee, formerly a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and now a partner at Ropes & Gray, did not respond to a request for comment. She was one of two lawyers commissioned by the United States Olympic Committee who led a 10-month investigation into Nassar.
Several students at NYU Steinhardt said in interviews on Monday that many of their peers were appalled after hearing allegations against the school's namesake. But efforts to hold protests or write petitions failed to gain traction, the college newspaper, the Washington Square News, reported in early April.
After the couple's initial donation in 2001, Steinhardt and his wife gave $20 million to NYU between 2006 and 2014 to support programs and fund scholarships. Judy Steinhardt is among the university's 61 voting board of trustee members.
Morin Mikaya, a 24-year-old who is studying for a master's degree in drama therapy, said Monday that she was encouraged by the call for people to report potential incidents of misconduct.
"I always think that these things should be done quicker," she said. "That's the thing with big universities. Everything moves slowly. There's a lot of bureaucracy. But this is a good thing."
At least one school has already responded to the allegations against Steinhardt. Abraham Foxman, the former longtime head of the Anti-Defamation League, was asked not to give a planned graduation speech this year at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, the nation's main Reform Jewish seminary, because of his remarks in support of Steinhardt in the Times-ProPublica article.
The seminary had asked Foxman for a public clarification of his remarks, "which appeared to dismiss the seriousness of sexual harassment and failed to condemn the behavior described," the college said in a statement. When Foxman declined to provide one, his invitation, which included an honorary degree, was rescinded. Foxman was traveling Monday and could not be reached for comment.
One of the women who had alleged inappropriate remarks by Steinhardt was a rabbi who had graduated from and taught at the seminary. Andrew Rehfeld, the seminary's president, said on Monday that he was proud of his students and alumni for voicing their concerns. "It is really a reflection of our values about treating every human being with dignity and respect," he said.
Edgar Sandoval contributed reporting.
Correction, May 13, 2019: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a $10 million gift was the largest N.Y.U. had ever received. It was the largest gift that the graduate school of education had ever received.

Texto completo: Logic, one of the top hip-hop stars in popular music, will perform at Allentown's PPL Center in November.
The rapper, whose first three albums sold gold and platinum, and who had the chart-topping hits "Sucker for Pain" and "1-800-273-8255," will perform at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 3. He will be joined by special guest J.I.D.
Tickets, at $39.99-$69.99, go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday at the PPL Center box office at 701 Hamilton St., Allentown; at www.PPLCenter.com, or by phone at 610-347-TIXX.
Logic will also offer VIP packages for the tour; those will be available at www.VIPNation.com.
Logic's latest single, "Homicide" featuring Eminem, got more than 30 million streams in one week upon its release and debuted at No. 1 on Spotify.
In a recording career of just five years, Logic has had 17 gold and platinum hits.
He catapulted to fame with his five-times-platinum song "1-800-273-8255 (National Suicide Prevention Lifeline)" featuring Alessia Cara and Khalid, in 2017.
The song got two Grammy nominations, including Song of the Year, and peaked at No. 3 on Billboard's overall singles chart, and No. 1 on Spotify.
The 29-year-old Logic released his debut disc "Under Pressure" in 2014, and it climbed to No. 2 on the Rap chart and No. 4 on Billboard's overall albums chart; it sold gold, and had four gold hits - the title track, "Gang Related," "Nikki" and "Till the End."
His sophomore disc, 2015's "The Incredible True Story," also went gold, topped the Rap chart, and peaked at No. 3 on Billboard's overall Albums chart. It had three gold hits with "Fade Away," "I Am the Greatest" and "Lord Willin'."
But it was his 2016 song "Sucker for the Pain" (with Ty Dolla Sign, Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa and Imagine Dragons featuring X Ambassadors), which appeared on the soundtrack for the movie "Suicide Squad," that made Logic a top name in rap. The song topped the Rap chart and went triple platinum.
Also that year, he had a mixtape, "Bobby Tarantino," that went to No. 2 on the Rap chart, and had two gold hits: "Super Mario World" and "44 Bars."
Logic's third album, 2017's "Everybody," topped both the Rap and overall charts, and sold platinum. Its song "1-800-273-8255" became his biggest hit, and also was nominated for a Grammy for Best Music Video. "Everybody" also produced the platinum title cut and the gold hit "Black Spiderman."
His 2018 mix tape "Bobby Tarantino II" topped both the Rap and overall Albums chart and went gold, and his fourth album, "YSIV," released in September, peaked at No. 2 on both charts.
His latest disc, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," was released Friday, and features guest appearances from rappers Eminem, Gucci Mane, G-Eazy, Will Smith and Wiz Khalifa.
He also recently released a novel, "Supermarket," that debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times best sellers list.

What's next for Philly's 76ers?

Texto completo: Brown had his playoff starting five — Embiid, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and J.J. Redick — for 10 regular-season games.
TORONTO — The Process is dead. Long live the process.
Asked where The Process is at this stage of his career, Philadelphia 76ers All-Star center Joel Embiid — dejected from losing to Toronto, 92-90 in Game 7 on Sunday — said, "I don't give a damn about The Process."
Quite the admission from Embiid, who came to embody the Sixers' divisive rebuild set forth by former general manager Sam Hinkie.
Regardless whether Embiid uttered his comment in the disappointment of defeat or if that's how he really feels, the Sixers have reached a critical moment in this era.
Where do they go from here? Who is the coach and who is on the team at the start of the 2019-20 season?
General manager Elton Brand has proven himself in his first season in the job following the Bryan Colangelo Twitter disgrace that resulted in Colangelo losing his job.
Brand acquired Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris in trades during the season, but the work gets more difficult, starting with what happens to Coach Brett Brown.
The New York Times reported that it will be difficult for Brown to save his job if the Sixers didn't advance to the conference finals. Ownership is on record saying the Sixers have the talent to beat anyone in the East, and Brand told reporters in April the goal was to get deeper in the playoffs than last season, which was a second-round exit, the same as this season.
Does Brown take the fall for that? Basing his future on an incredible buzzer-beater by Kawhi Leonard in a Game 7 seems short-sighted.
Brown had his playoff starting five — Embiid, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and J.J. Redick — for 10 regular-season games. He had to coach three iterations of 2018-19 Sixers: the team he had at a training camp, the team he had after the Sixers traded for Butler in November and the team he had when the Sixers acquired Harris from the Los Angeles Clippers in February.
A case can be made for bringing Brown back. But if the Sixers don't think he is the coach to get them to the next level, that's their prerogative. But it shouldn't be based on the outcome of a single Game 7 result on the road.
If Philadelphia makes a coaching change, Brand better have his replacement ready to go — like Toronto president Masai Ujiri replaced Dwane Casey with Nick Nurse following last season's playoff exit. If not, this has the potential to backfire.
The Sixers need to resolve that then focus on their roster. Jimmy Butler likely will become a free agent and Tobias Harris will be a free agent. Do those two want to come back, and at what price and length of contract? Giving up what they did in trades to get those two indicates they are willing spend to keep both.
A third starter, J.J. Redick, is also a free agent along with Mike Scott, Amir Johnson, Greg Monroe and Boban Marjanovic. Because Philadelphia has several young players on team friendly contracts, the Sixers have money to spend in free agency.
In the draft, the Sixers have one first-round pick and three second-round picks. While the draft is important, it's far less so compared to the coaching situation and free agency.
It's one of the more intriguing offseason story lines: how do the Sixers take the next step of their development? How do they become a championship contender?
It's a process, that's for sure, and it's in Elton Brand's hands.

Texto completo: STEVENS POINT – What does it take to print a best-selling book on a tight deadline?
If you ask employees of Worzalla Publishing Co. in Stevens Point, they can tell you – 1,934,100 pounds of paper; 456,314 pounds of ink; and 7,166 employee hours. The result: author Jeff Kinney's latest book, "Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid: Rowley Jefferson's Journal," which was released April 9.
Kinney is best known for his "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series, which follows main character Greg Heffley on his adventures as a middle-schooler. The new series focuses on Greg's best friend, Rowley Jefferson.
It has spent four weeks on the New York Times bestseller list for Children's Middle Grade Hardcover books and is currently at No. 1.
Worzalla is very familiar with Kinney and his books. The company has published every domestic copy of the "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series since the first batch of 25,000 copies in 2007. Last year, Kinney made a special stop at the Stevens Point plant to celebrate the 200 millionth copy of the "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series.
So, when Kinney branched out to launch his new series, his production team turned to Worzalla.
The task was a daunting one, employees said. They print large orders all the time, but they only had four weeks to finish a project that normally would take six weeks.
So, just how big was the order?
If you laid out all of the books' 41,654.551 pages end to end, you would cover the distance from Stevens Point all the way to Manila, Philippines.
Kathy Ladwig and April Kemnitz were part of the customer service team that led the project at Worzalla. Last October, Amulet Books — part of ABRAMS, the series' publishing company — reached out to Worzalla, exploring the idea of working together on the new series, Ladwig said. The Worzalla team was given a fake project name, too, as details, including the title, were still top secret.
By January, the team learned the order would be twice as big as originally planned. In February, they learned they would print fewer paperback copies and more hardcover books. The publishing company even pushed back installation of new equipment so it could focus solely on the Kinney project.
While the size of the project was not unusual, the quick turnaround time was, said Richard Letchinger, Worzalla's vice president of sales and marketing.
Worzalla printed almost constantly for a solid four weeks, met their goal, and even finished two days before their final deadline, Kemnitz said. And then they celebrated.
"Every time we're done with a Wimpy Kid job, we have a big pizza party for the whole plant," Kemnitz said.
This was Worzalla's fastest turnaround time for such a large volume with critical deadlines, said Jim Fetherson, Worzalla's president and CEO.
"Worzalla is so proud of all the men and women who worked long hours and gave up their weekends to finish this huge project," Fetherson said. "We are thrilled that our team exceeded expectations."

Texto completo: JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress appeared on Friday to be on track to retain control of South Africa's national government after last week's election.
But widespread voter disillusionment contributed to the party's weakest electoral showing since the start of democracy a quarter-century ago.
President Cyril Ramaphosa had hoped that a decisive victory would hand him a popular mandate to carry out far-reaching reforms.
But the results from Wednesday's election - though largely positive given a stagnant economy and the relentless revelations of corruption in the party - were unlikely to quell powerful party rivals, political analysts said.
"Nothing changes inside the ANC," said Ralph Mathekga, the author of "Ramaphosa's Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?" "His supporters will say that the results would have been worse without him, and his rivals will say the opposite," he added. "The internal battles will continue."
The African National Congress, was also at risk of losing its hold on the province of Gauteng, a major battleground that is home to Johannesburg and Pretoria, the economic and political capitals. If the party ends up with less than a majority in Gauteng, it will most likely be forced to enter into a governing coalition that would dilute its power in the province, the nation's richest, and reduce its control of the sizeable budget there.
Gauteng includes the biggest concentration of Black middle-class South Africans. With the votes counted in about 60% of the districts there, the party's share of the vote was less than a percentage point below 50%. In 2014, the African National Congress won the province with 55%.
Nationwide, victory for the African National Congress, which has governed continuously since the end of apartheid in 1994, had never been in doubt. And with votes tallied in about 90% of districts, the party had an insurmountable lead that ensured a five-year term for Ramaphosa, who had made fighting corruption a pillar of his campaign.
But the party had garnered only 57% of the vote nationwide by Friday - a drop from 62% in the last general election and the first time that figure had fallen below the symbolically important threshold of 60%.
The election results underscored the growing disillusionment with South Africa's political system and its young democracy. Voter turnout fell to 66%, from 73% in 2014 - low by the standards of a nation where Black South Africans earned the right to vote only a generation ago and where long, snaking lines outside polling stations were a staple of previous ballots.
On Wednesday, voters cast ballots for the national parliament and for legislatures in nine provinces in the sixth general election after the end of apartheid. But an increasing number of South Africans simply stayed home instead of handing their support to another party. The main opposition par:y, the Democratic Alliance, suffered a dip in support compared with its performance in 2014. The Economic Freedom Fighters, a party established in 2013, grew less than expected.
"A lot of people have simply given up on the parties, their leaders and democratic institutions," said William Gumede, a political scientist at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. "With no economic growth, this is a dangerous situation South Africa is in."

Rashida Tlaib says thinking of the Holocaust provides her a 'calming feeling,' shockingly claims Palestinians created 'safe haven' for Jews

Texto completo: Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., has made yet another shocking and historically ignorant claim: That thinking about the Holocaust gives her a "calming feeling" because her Palestinian ancestors provided a "safe haven" for Jewish victims of the tragedy.
Tlaib, a close ally of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who is no stranger to anti-Semitic controversies herself, made the latest statement on a podcast called "Skullduggery" in an episode titled "From Rashida with Love."
"There’s always kind of a calming feeling I tell folks when I think of the Holocaust, and the tragedy of the Holocaust, and the fact that it was my ancestors — Palestinians — who lost their land and some lost their lives, their livelihood, their human dignity, their existence in many ways, have been wiped out, and some people's passports," Tlaib said just after the 28 minute mark. "And just all of it was in the name of trying to create a safe haven for Jews, post-the Holocaust, post-the tragedy and the horrific persecution of Jews across the world at that time. And I love the fact that it was my ancestors that provided that, right, in many ways. But they did it in a way that took their human dignity away and it was forced on them.”
There are so many historical inaccuracies in one statement that it's difficult to even know where to start. But to highlight a few:
— The Jewish presence in the area currently known as Israel dates back thousands of years, and the modern migration of Jews back there pre-dated the Holocaust by many decades, starting with the migration of Jews from Yemen in 1881.
— With the Balfour Declaration of 1917, the British government supported the establishment of a Jewish state in the area, an idea rejected by Arabs.
— In 1937, the British Peel Commission proposed a two-state solution to Jews and Arabs, which the Arabs once again rejected because they could not accept any Jewish presence in the region.
— During World War II, the Palestinian leader at the time, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Muhammad Amin al-Husayni, met with Adolf Hitler and allied with the Nazis. As the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum recounts, "al-Husayni collaborated with the German and Italian governments by broadcasting pro-Axis, anti-British, and anti-Jewish propaganda via radio to the Arab world; inciting violence against Jews and the British authorities in the Middle East; and recruiting young men of Islamic faith for service in German military, Waffen-SS , and auxiliary units. In turn, the Germans and the Italians used al-Husayni as a tool to inspire support and collaboration among Muslim residents of regions under Axis control and to incite anti-Allied violence and rebellion among Muslims residing beyond the reach of German arms."
— After World War II, when the Jewish people declared the state of Israel, their official proclamation said, "We appeal - in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months - to the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the State on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions." Instead of choosing to live peacefully, however, Arab leaders encouraged Arabs to flee Israel, and the next day, the young nation was invaded by Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq.
— The terrorist group the Palestine Liberation Organization was founded in 1964, three years before Israel occupied the West Bank in the Six Day War, territories that we're now led to believe is at the heart of the conflict.
So, to sum up, Tlaib's claims that her Arab ancestors provided a "safe haven" to Jews after the Holocaust ignores the Jewish presence in the region and efforts to establish a Jewish state that predated the Holocaust, ignores that her ancestors allied with Hitler at the time of the Holocaust, and ignores decades of violence and terrorism directed at Israel both before, during, and after the Holocaust.
It should be noted that she was making this claim in the context of arguing for a one-state solution, the goal of which has always been for Arabs to overwhelm the Jewish population, and then force them as a minority to be governed by the people who are currently launching rockets at them.

Texto completo: In the summer of 1964, at the age of 19, I lived in a tiny apartment on the left bank of Paris, near the Pont Neuf. At night, I would meet up with friends from a grab bag of nations at a cafe directly across from Notre Dame, where we would talk, tell stories, invent tales and laugh together. A single beer sat at the center of the table, a sufficient investment by this ragtag collective to hold the table for several hours until we wandered off to a cheap restaurant or back to our beds. I often took a seat on the far side of the table, from where I could watch the changing mood of the cathedral, France's greatest icon, flow from golden sunset into night, looming high above us just 200 yards away. For me, even at a young age, that stunning building was Paris, the beating heart of this romantic city that wrapped me in its grasp and turned me into a lifelong Francophile.
Through its nearly 800-year history, Notre Dame de Paris survived the rioting of Protestant Huguenots in the 16th century, the radical sans-culotte of the French Revolution (who beheaded the cathedral's stone statues of biblical kings, mistaking them for former sovereigns of France), and two World Wars. It withstood its post-Enlightenment reincarnation as a temple to the Cult of Reason, until Napoleon Bonaparte returned it to the Church in 1801. Victor Hugo
gave it renewed vigor when he set his post-revolutionary novel on the folly of mobs, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, within the precincts of the famous
cathedral.
Last month, Notre Dame succumbed to a raging fire that took its wooden spire, most of its 13th-century roof and its original timber beams. Fortunately, it appears all three of its original circular rose windows as well as the narrower stained-glass windows that line the vault have been saved, along with the organ, sacred relics and many works of art. Nevertheless, it will take years to rebuild what has been lost. President Emmanuel Macron, speaking late in the Paris evening, promised that "We, all together," will rebuild the cathedral. "It is our common history," he said. "It is at the heart of our lives."
One thought kept coming to mind as I watched the flames consume the roof of the cathedral and the spire: This shocking fire is a metaphor of the times we are living in; it is an alert and a warning. The vicious calls to separation and division, to our lower natures, to rage that risks flaming up within us -- within both our individual selves and our collective self, our body politic -- are coming from the mouth of our highest political officer. There is not much space between those misguided lies and threats and yesterday's terrible fire.
In this holistic Earth we inhabit, causes and effects occur even at subliminal levels, no matter how difficult they are to measure or how facile they are to mock. We are connected, just as our actions and results are connected. When we understand this spiritual interrelationship of cause and effect, we may well rein in our worst gut responses and instead seek out the higher road to the galloping challenges of today and the future.
Rather than fanning the flames of hatred and disaffection, we would do better to extinguish them, as the Paris pompiers succeeded in fighting the
Notre Dame fire. Can't we find a better way -- through moderation, through dialogue and discussion, rather than running to our most flammable extremes -- to put out the fires that are ready to ignite all around us?
A young Parisian watching the fire through her tears on a nearby street told a New York Times reporter, "Everything is up in flames. It is apocalyptic."
It is time that what we do and say contribute to save the world, and not to summon a future apocalypse.

Texto completo: The New York Times style section declared 2017 the Year of the Goat, and TheOutline. com, a website that tracks internet trends, named goats the “hottest cultural trend” of 2018. Will 2019 be the year that goats join dogs, cats and parrots in the small pantheon of animals that have made the leap from wild to domesticated?
Traditional pets clearly don’t need to worry about being displaced just yet by these adorable horned and hoofed creatures, but goats are making inroads. According to the American Goat Society, the number of registered Nigerian Dwarf goats — one of the breeds most recommended as pets because of their small size — grew about 8 percent between 2014 and 2017.
If the current goat craze had a Big Bang moment, it was in the spring of 2016 on a farm in Oregon, where the idea of goat yoga (doing yoga while goats roam around you and sometimes on you) was born. Goat yoga went viral, and soon there were many offshoots, including golf with goats and a Goatel, an Oregon retreat center offering various forms of goat therapy. There are YouTube channels devoted to quirky goat videos, including those starring Pismo and Goatee, a pair of surfing goats in California (yes, they actually surf). Instagram has made minor celebrities out of many goats (some accounts have hundreds of thousands of followers), partly by dressing them up in outrageously cute outfits.
One of the more popular goat-centric Instagram accounts, @rescuegoats, is run by Puget Sound Goat Rescue in Maple Valley, Wash. , which annually rescues about 200 goats in the Seattle area (many of whom were destined for a slaughterhouse) and finds families to adopt them. Barbara Jamison, owner and director of the organization, rigorously screens prospective goat parents through a process that includes home visits to make sure people have the appropriate setup.
“We are careful about where our goats go. We don’t just adopt them to anybody who suddenly decides they want a pet goat,” says Jamison. “There’s this whole wave on the internet of goats running around in pajamas in people’s houses like it’s all good, but the reality is these are farm animals. ”
The most important thing to know about adopting a goat, says Jamison, is that you must adopt at least two: Herd animals are profoundly unhappy when alone. Space to roam and forage is essential; she recommends a minimum of a quarter acre for a pair of full-size goats and an eighth of an acre for a pair of dwarf goats — small urban yards simply won’t do.
They will also need a predator-proof, but well-ventilated shelter for sleeping and hanging out in bad weather. Goats are talented escape artists, so plan on sturdy 4-foot fencing, with wire mesh that extends 12 inches into the ground to thwart any coyotes or dogs that might try to dig under. While there is no shortage of goats doing cool things on Instagram, Jamison says goats are next to impossible to house train and, like their ancestors in mountainous regions of the world, instinctively climb to the highest point around — she suggests keeping them outdoors unless you don’t mind them jumping on the dinner table.
Laurie Hess, an exotic pet veterinarian in Bedford Hills, N. Y. , says that while goats are fairly hardy animals; they are prone to intestinal parasites, especially if their quarters are not cleaned regularly. Hooves need trimming every few weeks, but otherwise grooming needs are minimal. She recommends adopting de-horned goats as a safety measure if they will be around small children.
Goats’ reputation as stinky, ornery animals pertains to uncastrated males, which indeed develop a rank odor once they are sexually mature. “Intact bucks are aggressive and destructive,” says Hess, who recommends adopting females or neutered males. Also keep in mind that most vets, even those that specialize in exotic pets, do not treat goats, she says. Often a drive into the countryside is necessary to find a farm vet if your goat needs medical attention.
Goats have a profound desire to eat every bit of foliage in sight, so their fenced home must be separate from landscaped areas and free of any poisonous plants. This trait also makes it difficult to walk a goat like you would a dog — they will constantly pull on the leash in an effort to get at your neighbor’s roses.
Goats need high-quality hay, supplemented with fresh foliage, fruits and vegetables. Jamison recommends avoiding the grain-based chow used on dairy farms, because it is not necessary for goats that aren’t lactating and is highly addictive: “It becomes all they think about when they see a human, and they can become quite pushy and aggressive. They make better pets without it. ”

Texto completo: Over 130 students received diplomas Saturday morning at Unity College's 50th commencement.
Veteran, quadruple amputee Travis Mills reminds students to embrace change, ‘be a champion’

UNITY — Staying headstrong and embracing change — even when it’s hard, even when it’s scary — are some of the most important tools for success, retired army Staff Sgt. Travis Mills told the graduating class of Unity College as its members prepared to accept their degrees.
Over 130 students received diplomas Saturday morning from what is billed as “America’s Environmental College.” Roughly 1,300 family members and friends filled Tozier Gymnasium to watch the ceremony, according to Unity College’s associate director of media relations, Joel Crabtree.
Mills, who lost all four of his limbs in an improvised explosive device blast on his third tour of Afghanistan, told the audience Saturday what he learned through his recovery. He is one of five quadruple amputees to have survived severe war wounds suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan, Unity’s President Melik Peter Khoury noted in his introduction. In the seven years after his injury, Mills has penned a New York Times best-selling memoir, “Tough as They Come,” and also founded the Rome, Maine-based Travis Mills Foundation to support veterans wounded in combat. He was given an honorary doctorate in sustainability science Saturday.
“(The first life lesson I learned) is don’t dwell on the past, reminisce it,” Mills said. “I was in a hospital bed with no arms or legs. I lost 140 pounds. I would close my eyes and I would pray. … I was telling myself, ‘How do I go back in time? How do I make this not happen?’ After about two weeks of that, it kind of dawned on me, I’m never going to change the fact that I was injured. I’ll never change the fact that I have no arms and legs. I had 25 wonderful years and one bad day at work up until that moment … (and) I’ve had seven amazing years since my explosion.”
He added that it is unproductive to focus on the fairness of an unfortunate reality or try to erase something undesirable.
“You can’t control your situation, but you can control your attitude,” Mills said. “It’s up to you to make the best or worst of it.”
Even when you think you don’t have anything left to give, you do, he said. Mills wants everyone to see themselves as “a champion.”
“Look around and see all of the support you have,” Mills instructed graduates.
Student speaker Emily MacDonald spoke of the sense of community among the class of 2019 and noted the changes its members collectively have embraced already: seeing the college presidency change hands, new residence halls rise and mindsets expand from their teenage versions.
“We are adaptable,” she said. “We’ve learned to see things through, even if it’s not what’s on the original road map.”
MacDonald added that it will be necessary to continue to lean into change as the world confronts global warming, rising sea levels and other environmental problems. Each student sees the world differently and can contribute a unique perspective to spur progress, she noted.
“To solve the global climate crisis, the solution is not about plastic straws, it’s not about reusable bags, and its not about solar panels,” MacDonald explained. “It’s about active and conscious efforts from people to evolve. We as graduates of America’s Environmental College are the people ready to embrace the solution and take on the challenges.”
In his opening statement, Khoury echoed this sentiment.
“From here, you are beginning your journey to become … developers of sustainable salmon fisheries, rangers in national park systems, … just to name a few,” Khoury said. “You will go on to lead your own research, start your own business business, … and (help) solve the 21st-century environmental issues of our time.”
He wished “passion, compassion, humor and most importantly, knowledge” upon the new graduates.
“If you keep working hard, it will continue to be worth it,” Khoury said, closing with: “May the grass be green, the rain be clean and your hearts be pure.”

Rich Lowry: There are no mysteries with Donald Trump

Texto completo: The surprise about the big New York Times story on Donald Trump’s tax returns is that there are no real surprises.
Trump's taxes have been an obsession of the left since he, in violation of a long-standing norm, reneged on his promise to release his returns during the 2016 campaign.
Pieces were written urging some brave whistleblower to come forward with them, and Democrats counted as one of the advantages of taking the House that they could demand Trump's returns. The dispute resulting from the administration's refusal to turn them over is now probably headed to the Supreme Court.
All the while, the expectation, or at least the suspicion, was that the returns contained some awful secret, perhaps evidence that he is a tool of the Russians.
And here, The New York Times has obtained Trump's tax information spanning a decade from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s, and the revelation is that he wasn't doing as well as he said in public and lost a boatload of money in a period that nearly destroyed him. In other words, exactly what anyone paying any attention would have expected.
Yes, the amount of the reported loss, $1.17 billion, is remarkable (although inflated for tax purposes), and some of the details memorable.
Trump doesn't like having all the particulars on the record to be discussed and mocked, but can anyone say that they are surprised?
Trump himself, the Washington Examiner notes, talked about his precarious financial state in this period on the first episode of "The Apprentice." In fact, he may have exaggerated, saying that he had been "billions of dollars" in debt.
As for Trump's use of tax loopholes, he said in a debate with Hillary Clinton that if he didn't owe any tax liability, that made him "smart."
There really are no Trump mysteries. His flaws aren't hidden away. He often attests to them himself, or demonstrates them publicly. For someone who cares so much about his image, and so assiduously crafts it, he's a relative open book.
No blockbuster report has more than a passing effect because each dispatch is, ultimately, another dot in a pointillist portrait of the president that was largely completed long ago.
This is also why the hope that we are one investigation, tax return or subpoena away from the revelation that will finally bring Trump down — or even make a difference — is almost certainly forlorn.
Obviously, it was news that he had paid off a porn star during the presidential campaign, and highly embarrassing. This is why Trump denied it for so long. But he'd already told us about his womanizing in his own words, often on "The Howard Stern Show."
Likewise, the most blameworthy conduct regarding Russia's election interference in 2016 was out in the open — the Trump campaign was happy to derive any possible advantage from the WikiLeaks disclosures, and Trump tried to deny the obvious Russian involvement.
We didn't need a 400-page special counsel report to break this news.
Even some of Trump's alleged obstruction, which you'd expect to involve back-channel scheming (and there was certainly that), was out in the open.
He pressured Jeff Sessions in public to un-recuse. He publicly called Michael Cohen a rat. He told Lester Holt on a TV news broadcast that he fired James Comey because of the Russia investigation (specifically that it didn't have anything to do with him). And he's made no secret that he yearns for an attorney general who will protect him.
You can add lurid details to this basic picture, and Mueller did, but it's hard to find a game-changer.
None of this is to defend or excuse Trump's business practices, or his conduct in office. It is merely to say that he's an extravagantly known quantity, and will likely win or lose in 2020 based on what we already know rather than the fruits of further investigation and fact-finding.

Texto completo: SYDNEY, Australia -- A mystery witness who lawyers had hoped would provide evidence of an alleged pattern of inappropriate behavior by the actor Geoffrey Rush in his defamation battle against Rupert Murdoch's Nationwide News has been formally identified as the Australian actress Yael Stone.
The Federal Court of Australia on Friday lifted an order suppressing the identity of "witness X," as she was originally called, revealing her to be Ms. Stone, who is best known for her work in the Netflix series "Orange Is the New Black."
In an interview published in December, Ms. Stone, 34, told The New York Times that Mr. Rush danced naked in front of her when both were starring in a 2010-11 Sydney production of "The Diary of a Madman." She also alleged that he used a mirror to watch her while she was in the shower and sent her sexually suggestive text messages. At the time of the alleged incidents, she was 25 years old and Mr. Rush was 59.
[Read Yael Stone's interview with The New York Times about Geoffrey Rush.]
The identification of Ms. Stone inserts a potential new element into the legal battle over Mr. Rush's reputation, just a month after he won his defamation suit against Nationwide News, which publishes the Sydney tabloid newspaper The Daily Telegraph.
Mr. Rush was awarded 850,000 Australian dollars, or nearly $ 600,000, in initial damages. Damages for his economic losses are still to be determined, but could run into the millions of dollars.
Mr. Rush, 67, argued during the trial that two front-page articles published in The Daily Telegraph in late 2017 wrongly portrayed him as a "sexual predator" and a "pervert."
The articles suggested that the Oscar-winning actor behaved inappropriately toward an unnamed female co-star, later revealed to be Eryn Jean Norvill, during a 2015-16 Sydney Theater Company production of "King Lear." One article was accompanied by a photograph of Mr. Rush in character with the headline "King Leer."
Midway through the two-week trial late last year, Nationwide News called on Ms. Stone (then known publicly only as witness X) to provide evidence in its defense. However, Justice Michael Wigney rejected the last-minute bid and ordered Ms. Stone's identity suppressed.
Nationwide News is now appealing the defamation verdict. A key element of the appeal is that the judge refused the publisher's application to amend its defense to include evidence from Ms. Stone.
Nationwide News has also requested that Justice Wigney recuse himself from hearing the application.
"One of the issues that the appeal court will need to decide is whether or not the judge made the right decision when deciding to exclude that evidence," said Sophie Dawson, a Sydney-based partner at the law firm Bird & Bird and an expert in media and defamation law.
"The fact that Yael Stone has been revealed as witness X doesn't really change a lot for the case at this stage -- it is likely that the court knew her identity," Ms. Dawson said. "The lifting of the suppression order has just made it available to the public."
Lawyers for both Mr. Rush and Ms. Stone refused to comment.
The court has continued to suppress the exact nature of Ms. Stone's allegations against Mr. Rush.
In her December 2018 interview with The Times, Ms. Stone recalled, in particular, an incident with Mr. Rush in the shared dressing room showers.
"I remember I looked up to see there was a small shaving mirror over the top of the partition between the showers and he was using it to look down at my naked body," she said in the interview. "I believe that it was meant with a playful intention, but the effect was that I felt there was nowhere for me to feel safe and unobserved."
She added of her decision to come forward: "I feel a responsibility to speak."
In a statement, Mr. Rush said that Ms. Stone's allegations "are incorrect and in some instances have been taken completely out of context."
"Clearly Yael has been upset on occasion by the spirited enthusiasm I generally bring to my work," he said. "I sincerely and deeply regret if I have caused her any distress."

Texto completo: A son reads his father's erotic novels in a new comedy special. And Emma Thompson hosts "S.N.L."
What's on TV
MY DAD WROTE A PORNO (2019) 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. When Jamie Morton, a British writer and director, discovered that his father had written an erotic novel, he shared it with his friends James Cooper and Alice Levine. The three marveled not just at the fact that Morton's dad had produced the work -- he's written four books so far -- but that much of the writing was, well, not great. In 2015, they created the podcast "My Dad Wrote a Porno," in which Morton reads a chapter from the series while Cooper and Levine provide commentary. Since then the show has been downloaded more than 160 million times and has spawned a book and quirky merchandise. (Morton told The Financial Times that his father loves it, even though it mocks his own work: "Fundamentally, my dad doesn't quite grasp that he's a bad writer at all," he said.) In this new comedy special, the three perform a reading in London and invite audience members to join the fun onstage.
NIGHT SCHOOL (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish star in this comedy about a high school dropout who takes night classes to earn his G.E.D. after losing his job. The duo make for comedic gold, but somehow their chemistry couldn't lift this movie up to its fullest potential. The plot "sometimes accelerates in the direction of genuine hilarity," A. O. Scott wrote in his New York Times review, "only to downshift into sloppy, easy jokes and gags."
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. Emma Thompson hosts "S.N.L." for the first time, while the Jonas Brothers perform. Thompson returns to the big screen on June 7 in the comedy "Late Night," in which she plays a late-night host who hires a female writer (Mindy Kaling) in hopes of breathing new life into her show. Also on June 7, the Jonas Brothers will release their first album in six years, "Happiness Begins."
What's Streaming
SOMETHING IN THE AIR (2013) Stream on Hulu or Mubi; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes or YouTube. With Olivier Assayas's new dramedy, "Non-Fiction," in theaters, revisit his semi-biographical drama "Something in the Air." It follows Gilles (Clément Mettayer), an aspiring painter who gets swept up in political movements in France after the student protests of May 1968. He tries to find himself amid the fervor and slips in and out of relationships with two women: the free-spirited Laure (Carole Combes) and the more serious and politically minded Christine (Lola Créton). All of the characters search for a salve for their post-revolution disillusionment; in Gilles' case, the remedies are sex, exploration and art. A. O. Scott described Assayas's method as "observant and immersive" in his review in The Times, adding that the "somewhat messy narrative is propelled by fidelity to feeling rather than by the machinery of plot."

Texto completo: JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's long-governing African National Congress party appeared headed for a victory in national elections, partial results showed Thursday, though its support seemed to have dipped under the leadership of President Cyril Ramaphosa.
The ANC had won 57% of the vote with 60% of the polling districts counted, according to results announced by the electoral commission. It received 62% of the entire vote five years ago.
The Democratic Alliance received 22% of the vote so far, the most of any opposition party, about the same share it received in 2014. The populist, leftist Economic Freedom Fighters increased its share of the vote to nearly 10% support. Both opposition parties made graft a main campaign issue.
The government's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and some local news organizations projected that the ANC would end up with less than 60 percent of the vote - a symbolically important threshold that the party has not failed to cross since coming to power in 1994 at the end of apartheid.
The party needs only a majority of seats in Parliament to remain in power and to give Ramaphosa a five-year presidential term.
But Ramaphosa's allies had hoped for a decisive victory that would hand him a strong mandate to silence rivals and fulfill his pledge of rooting out corruption in the party and in government. In the last general election, in 2014, the ANC won 62 percent of the vote under Jacob Zuma, the scandal-tainted leader that Ramaphosa ousted as South Africa's president last year.
Ramaphosa's allies had hoped that he would halt the decline of the ANC, whose share of the national vote peaked at 70 percent in 2004, but has been falling steadily since.
In the northern province of Gauteng, a key battleground, the race to control the legislature was too close to call, with the ANC getting just 50 percent with ballots tallied at about 27 percent of polling stations.
If the party fails to win a majority, it could be forced to form a coalition to keep control of Gauteng, home to Johannesburg and Pretoria, the commercial and political capitals, and home to the nation's largest concentration of Black middle-class voters.
Nationwide, the incomplete results indicated voter turnout of 66 percent, down from 73 percent in 2014. Political analysts and party officials attributed the decline to several reasons: increasing disillusionment w:th South Africa's political system; apathy, especially among younger voters; and inclement weather on Election Day in many parts of the country.
Long, serpentine lines have been part of the landscape of recent elections in South Africa - where Black citizens earned the right to vote only a generation ago. But lines at voting stations were visibly short in Gauteng on Wednesday. A radio journalist, covering the vote from a helicopter, asked, "Where are the voters?"
Lines were particularly short in Black townships and other ANC strongholds.
In Sharpeville, where anti-apartheid activists were massacred in 1960, Lazarus Mohapi, 51, said he had never seen such a small turnout at the school where he has voted in every election since 1994.
"It seems people are staying away because they are tired of the ANC," Mohapi said.
He had voted, reluctantly, for the ANC, he said, adding that he was disgusted by the party's corruption.
"It wasn't easy," he said of the decision, "but I'm giving the ANC one last chance."
Though Ramaphosa served as deputy president under Zuma for nearly four years, he presented himself as an agent of change who would renew the party and the nation. In December 2017, he was narrowly elected president of the ANC despite fierce opposition from Zuma.
Two months later, he forced Zuma out of office and promised a "new dawn" for South Africa. But the initial excitement over his presidency - called "Ramaphoria" - fizzled in the face of the profound challenges.
His pledge to revive a moribund economy yielded little. His efforts to reform government agencies and state-owned enterprises were eclipsed by mismanagement at the state utility, Eskom, which led to the country's worst blackouts in years.
And his rivals in the party - led by figures closely tied to the endemic corruption of the Zuma years - remained as powerful as ever.

Presidential primary wins OK from Maine legislative panel but cost remains a sticking point

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- Democrats on a legislative committee endorsed a bill Friday that would have Maine switch from nominating caucuses to a state-run primary for the 2020 presidential election in a national transition away from the few remaining caucuses.
Maine had presidential primaries in 1996 and 2000. In the latter election, more than 2 1/2 times as many voters turned out as the 15 percent of Democrats and 7 percent of Republicans who voted at the party-run caucuses during the 2016 open-seat presidential election.
Those caucuses were messy. The Democratic ones were held at the municipal level and were swamped with voters. Republicans held regional caucuses that were harder for many to attend. After that, legislative leaders from both parties and former Gov. Paul LePage enacted legislation aimed at shifting to a primary.
That shift will require legislative action in 2019. A bill from Secretary of State Matt Dunlap that would slate Maine's primaries for March 3, 2020 -- or Super Tuesday, a date used by 13 states -- faced opposition from minority Republicans on the Legislature's voting committee Friday.
That is important because the Legislature's fiscal office estimates that a primary shift would cost the state $122,000 in ballot printing and postage costs that will have to be funded during bipartisan negotiations around a two-year budget due in June. That budget requires two-thirds support in both legislative chambers. Municipalities would foot an estimated $857,000 more.
Sen. Louis Luchini, D-Ellsworth, who co-chairs the voting panel, said on Friday he was "surprised to see it fall on party lines," noting past bipartisan support. Democrats' need for a primary is more urgent, with 21 major candidates running for their nomination to take on President Donald Trump, a Republican who likely won't face a serious primary challenge.
"In both cases, people chose not to vote because it was so inconvenient," Luchini said of the 2016 caucuses.
Rep. Scott Strom of Pittsfield, the lead Republican on the committee, said he has heard dueling concerns from his party. Activists have told him they want caucuses because they're easier to control, while lawmakers have largely cited the cost to taxpayers for another election.
Maine's two major parties haven't taken formal stances on the change, but Katie Mae Simpson, a spokeswoman for the Maine Democratic Party, said a primary has "broad support among Democrats." Jason Savage, the executive director of the Maine Republican Party, said he was "skeptical" of what Democrats are "trying to accomplish, the reasons and the cost."
Maine was among 10 states that held nominating caucuses in 2016, where Republicans backed U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrats picked Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ended being the runners-up for the nominations. Six of those states have already switched to primaries, and other caucus states could, according to The New York Times.

Texto completo: To the editor:
Regarding today's article in the FF and BDN on the MDOT calling off $45 million worth of infrastructure projects in Maine, including three here in The County, this is a direct result of Trump's tariff wars. Today Trump more than doubled tariffs on $250 million worth of goods coming from China. He has been saying all week that China is paying these tariffs. The truth is that the importers of these goods pay the tariffs, not China. And the importers pass the costs along to us consumers.
A year ago, China was buying 25 percent of our farmers' soybeans. Today it is down to almost zero. Washer and dryer prices are up 15 to 20 percent. I could go on and on. How anyone in this country can still be supporting Trump is just beyond my comprehension.
I downloaded and read the entire Mueller Report, that Trump claims exonerates him completely. In fact, there are 11 separate indictable obstruction incidents outlined in detail in the report. He was not indicted because of a Justice Department opinion/policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. The appropriate response is for Congress to impeach. And while we have a House that would vote to impeach, we have a Senate of the super rich who will never vote to convict and remove him.
A year and a half ago, Trump declared a national emergency on the opioid crisis in America. Fifty seven thousand dollars was allocated out of the federal budget to address this. A few months ago, he declared a national emergency on the southern border and diverted billions from our military budget to address the "crisis."
Trump paid no income taxes and lost over a billion dollars on business deals from 1985 to 1994, according to the New York Times. He is running the highest federal budget deficits in history because of his tax giveaways to the rich. It is in the trillions.
I could go on and on. How could anyone support this man?

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy's office on Thursday confirmed a Politico report that the 27-member Florida congressional delegation will meet with the FBI to discuss the hacking attempts of the state's elections systems in 2016.
Politico reported that the meeting would be held May 16.
Murphy, D-Winter Park, and U.S. Rep. Michael Waltz, R-St. Augustine, jointly requested the classified briefing last week in a letter to Attorney General William Barr. U.S. Sen. Rick Scott also requested a briefing along with Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The redacted version of the Mueller Report released in April stated the FBI believes "at least one Florida county" was infiltrated in 2016 with malicious software sent out by Russian intelligence agents to 120 Florida election office email accounts.
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, confirmed to the New York Times that there was a successful intrusion and hackers were "in a position" to change voter roll information, but it didn't appear they did.
DeSantis and Secretary of State Laurel Lee have said the state had not been informed of the successful intrusion and still did not know as of April which county or counties were compromised.
In a statement last week, Murphy said Florida voters "have the right to know the extent to which foreign actors may have breached our state's election security systems, and what the federal government is doing to prevent it from happening again."
Waltz said in a statement the FBI "needs to brief the Florida delegation on exactly what Russia did and which counties were involved so we can protect our elections and the voters."

Owens talks nature, Asheville and sex

Texto completo: I never understood the hype around movies like the "Avengers: Endgame" or shows like "Game of Thrones."
That is, until the night of May 8, when Delia Owens came to Asheville.
She is, I would say, the current literary equivalent of the uncontrollable, mind-losing hysteria to those screen phenomena.
Owens is the author of a debut novel, "Where the Crawdads Sing," which takes place in North Carolina, mostly in the coastal marsh, but Asheville pops up in some pivotal scenes.
If you haven't read her novel (where have you been, out in a marsh?), you're missing out, so read it.
Not only is it beautifully written, with haunting portrayals of loneliness, vivid descriptions of sea, mud, grass, birds, plants and fish that make the North Carolina coastal marsh come alive, it has heroes and villains, and our fair city of Asheville also plays a role, appearing several times in Owens' debut novel.
Which, by the way, was published last August and has been on the New York Times Best Sellers List for 35 weeks. It is currently No. 1.
But if you don't want to read it, I guess you can stick around for the movie. Owens has sold the movie rights and Reese Witherspoon will produce it.
But just looking at the lines of people wrapped around Haywood and Walnut streets, waiting for Malaprop's Bookstore and Café to let them in, was really quite something, when you think they were all waiting to hear a 70-year-old who wrote a novel about a "Marsh Girl."
Stephanie Jones-Byrne, Malaprop's director of marketing and author events, said the store held a capacity crowd of more than 200 people, and had to cut off dozens more from entering the store, although they were allowed to come in after the talk for the book signing.
The excitement level among mostly middle-aged ladies, and some men, was so high, the chattering while waiting for Owens to step in front of the mic was deafening, that Jones-Byrne had to take control by leading some calming, pulse-lowering deep breaths for the audience.
"We know that people are very passionate about the book. That was first time I did the breathing, and it felt like the thing to do," she said.
The last time there was such a crowd was when Leonard Pitts came to town, drawing about 150 people.
Owens, 70, who was much tinier, funnier and livelier in person than I had imagined, is a zoologist who spent 23 years living in the remotest parts of Africa studying lions, elephants and brown hyenas. She herself said she could feel the feverish level of palpable breathlessness in the bookstore.
"I'm not used to this many people," she said. "The feeling that I get here is the same level of expectancy I get as being charged by a wild lion."
Was her appearance worth the hype and the wait? I think so.
Owens was gracious enough to give me a few minutes before her talk for a sit-down. My first question was why did Asheville keep popping up in the book, given that, depending on where the fictional coastal fishing village of Barkley Cove was located, it would be at least an 8-hour drive to Asheville.
Her answer: "Sex, to be very blunt. If it was a day trip, the story's not there," she told me about the scene when two characters take that trip across state to the mountains.
Since Owens was adamant about not spoiling the plot for those who haven't yet read the book, neither will I. Just go ahead and read it.
Owens, who now lives in the remotest region of Idaho, 20 miles from the Canadian border, and doesn't see people for weeks at a time, grew up in Southern Georgia. She said as a child her family often came to the Asheville area for vacations, so she always loved the area, and maintained contacts here.
I will say, though the sex might have been a plot tool, it was a very small part of the book. There's also some chase scenes, and a good murder mystery. Oh, and fireflies.
The dominant themes seem to be the power of nature as a life-giver, companion, teacher and protector, and the animal instincts of humans, who at times do not seem to have evolved much from their primate ancestors.
Owens is a true outdoors girl. She said she was fortunate to have a mother who was "not only a beautiful Southern belle, but a real outside girl. She would encourage my girlfriends and I whether we were exploring on foot or on horses, to go as far out into the woods as we could go. She wanted me to experience real nature."
Her mother would tell her to "go way out yonder where the crawdads sing. I don't think she ever dreamed how seriously I would take her advice until she saw me boarding a plane for Africa with a one-way ticket."
Owens is also the co-author of three internationally best-selling books, including "Cry of the Kalahari," about her adventures living and studying wildlife in Africa.
She has won the John Burroughs Award for Nature Writing and has been published in Nature, The African Journal of Ecology, and others.
She said the idea for "Crawdads," which focuses on the heroine, Kya Clark, who is abandoned by her family as a child in the marsh to fend for herself, was percolating in her for more than a decade.
"One facet of animal behavior that interested me very deeply was those species of mammals that live in closely bonded groups, like the pride of lionesses and herd of elephants. They're made up only of females. Males, once they reach adolescence, they leave and spend the rest of their lives going from one group to the next mating," Owens said.
Watching the pride of lionesses in the late afternoon before they went out hunting, tumbling and playing with each other's cubs, made her realize how much she missed her "pride of girlfriends" back home.
"I was a female isolated from my group. I realized how much isolation and loneliness can affect a person, because we are social," she said.
"Since we know human females have a genetic propensity to belong to a group, what about writing a story asking the questions, how would a young girl forced to grow up alone, how would that affect her, how would she behave?" Owens said.
She summed up her book as "an intense love story, a murder mystery, a courtroom drama, but more than anything it is an exploration into the raw core of human nature. Not until the last words is the culprit revealed and the reason for the behavior laid bare."
Owens said she is also now working on her second novel, set in northern Florida.
So do crawdads really sing?
No. But Owens said her mother was a wise woman.
"I learned from my mother that if you go deep enough into the wilderness you will hear them anyway. My mother was right," she said. "We need to go way out yonder, where the crawdads sing because in the wild is where our secrets lie.
After having lived in such lonely places for so long, is Owens ready to gather her own lioness pride?
I asked her, given her close group of friends in Asheville, would she consider moving here?
Her answer? "Maybe! Maybe!" Ooh. The plot thickens.

S CHOOL GIRLS; OR, THE AFRICAN MEAN GIRLS PLAY
Play by Jocelyn Bioh. Directed by Summer L. Williams. Presented by SpeakEasy Stage Company. At Roberts Studio Theatre, Calderwood Pavilion, Boston Center for the Arts, through May 25. Tickets from $25, 617-933-8600, www.speakeasystage.com
On Monday, the New York Times reported that a significant milestone has just been reached: For the first time, the crowns of all three major beauty pageants — Miss America, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA — are simultaneously held by African-American women.
But deep within that story there was a caveat, voiced by Ashley Nkadi, a former Miss Black Ohio who has written about the lack of inclusivity in American beauty pageants. Nkadi noted that pageant winners do not tend to be “plus-size" and seldom have darker skin, adding, “I definitely still think the Eurocentric beauty model still dominates."
The prevalence of that model and the way it has given rise to “colorism," both outside and inside the black community, form the twin subjects of Jocelyn Bioh's “School Girls; Or, the African Mean Girls Play." After premiering two years ago in New York under the direction of Rebecca Taichman (currently at the helm of Paula Vogel's “Indecent" at the Huntington Theatre Company), “School Girls" is now receiving a first-rate SpeakEasy Stage Company production, directed by Summer L. Williams.
Though deceptively small in scale and often comic in tone, “School Girls" packs a considerable emotional wallop. Set in a girls' boarding school in central Ghana in 1986, the play tracks the competition within a group of friends to become contestants in the Miss Ghana pageant, with the hope of going on to the “Miss Global Universe" pageant. It's not really much of a competition, though, because most of the girls expect the self-assured leader of their group, Paulina (Ireon Roach), to be chosen.
Until, that is, a lighter-skinned American transfer student named Ericka (Victoria Byrd) arrives at the school. Suddenly, the balance of power shifts, with implications for the worldview of Paulina (who might not be as confident as she appears) and also her hitherto cowed followers: Nana (Shanelle Chloe Villegas), Ama (Sabrina Victor), Mercy (Tenneh Sillah), and Gifty (Geraldine Bogard).
Bioh, whose parents immigrated from Ghana to the United States, know how to distribute the weight: She smartly does not overload her 80-minute play, and director Williams keeps it moving at a fleet pace. One of Williams's specialties is working with young actors, and that pays off here: Her endearing cast adeptly mines moments small and large for laughs. (An extended scene in which the girls take turns soloing on Whitney Houston's “The Greatest Love of All" is priceless.)
But beneath the animated surface of “School Girls" lie resonant and wrenching depths, and both Bioh and Williams make sure to take us there. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, “School Girls" suggests, we need to examine how much that vision has been clouded by invidious cultural assumptions that work against darker-skinned women. The play asks us to consider the ways in which discriminatory beauty standards can damage self-image.
At first, Roach's Paulina projects an air of absolute command. With every look, gesture, and icy vocal intonation, the actress captures the quintessence of the high school queen bee. When one of her friends laughs at a joke told by Ericka, Roach's Paulina swivels her head and freezes the girl with a glare. Playwright Bioh clearly understands, however, that not just intimidation but seeming to be in the know can vault you to the top of a social hierarchy — especially during adolescence, when teenagers feign more knowledge than they actually possess.
So while Paulina exerts control over the other girls by weaponizing their insecurities about their looks, family backgrounds, and status — a particular target of her bullying is bashful Nana, who struggles with her weight — Paulina also inspires their awe by boasting of her supposed knowledge of American fashion, cuisine, and pop culture. However, in a further demonstration of Bioh's savvy about the social dynamics of high school, there are signs of latent rebellion by the girls early on, and Paulina's mystique crumbles utterly when Ericka captures the excited attention of the recruiter for the Miss Ghana pageant, played by Kris Sidberry.
It's a welcome return to a Boston stage for Sidberry, whose last local performance was in SpeakEasy's 2016 production of “Significant Other," and who endows the recruiter in “School Girls" with just the right combination of glamour, ambition, and self-absorption. Also a decided asset is Crystin Gilmore, who played the sensual Shug Avery in SpeakEasy's 2014 production of “The Color Purple." In “School Girls," portraying the school's headmistress, Gilmore nicely balances steeliness and compassion.
Compassion abounds in this play as well, and it very much extends to Paulina as well as the rest of the girls. We come to care about all of them. And by the end of “School Girls," after they've learned the unjust ways of the world, they all seem a little older.

Texto completo: (CAMERA) The New York Times severed its relationship this week with CartoonArts International after the paper published an anti-Semitic cartoon in last Thursday's international print edition.
But Andrea Levin, executive director of the media watchdog organization CAMERA, said she fears the paper may be jettisoning CartoonArts to distract attention from the Times's "well documented pattern of bias" against Jews and Israel.
"The onus is really on The New YorkTimes to do something about the institutional culture that made it possible to publish rank anti-Semitism," Levin said.

On Trump's tax returns, many unanswered questions

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is prone to upending tradition and shattering presidential norms. His refusal to follow other recent presidents in releasing his tax returns to the public – and his fight against a demand by House Democrats for six years’ worth of his personal and business returns – is but one battle in a broader war against oversight demands by congressional Democrats.
The fight over Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal’s demand for the returns is about to head to federal court, but an incomplete picture of Trump’s taxes and finances has emerged from media investigations.
Trump’s tax returns hold the promise of information about his business entanglements, whether he has been truthful in reporting the val- ue of his assets, relationships with foreign creditors and governments, and whether he got a personal windfall from the 2017 tax bill.
Here’s where things stand:
What do we know?
Thanks to reporting this week from The New York Times, which was given copies of summaries of Trump’s tax returns from 1985 to 1994, we know that Trump, a developer and real estate investor in Manhattan, suffered enormous business losses over that period. Those losses exceeded $1.1 billion, according to the Times, from bad investments such as now-defunct Eastern Air Lines and the Trump Taj Mahal hotel and casino in Atlantic City.
Taking to Twitter on Wednesday, Trump seemed to confirm the gist of the Times investigation.
“You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes....almost all real estate developers did – and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport,” Trump tweeted.
Earlier reporting by the Times about the Trump family finances found that Trump “participated in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud” to reduce taxes paid as his father’s holdings were transferred to him and his siblings.
Trump has also been a party in numerous lawsuits over the years that have provided many glimpses into his business dealings. He has frequently skated close to and over ethical lines, critics charge. His tax lawyer testified that Trump’s 1984 tax return was fraudulent.
What don’t we know?
A lot. This week’s Times report relies on summaries of Trump’s returns but lacks details to answer basic, obvious questions.
For starters, Trump’s critics say he has long exaggerated his wealth, and the returns promise answers on that front. They would also reveal how much he has paid more recently and what techniques he uses to avoid taxes.
Much of what is known about Trump’s taxes dates to the 1980s and 1990s, when Trump was a casino magnate and a more active developer. His businesses have changed since then.
Trump’s Washington, D.C., hotel on Pennsylvania Ave blocks from the White House hadn’t been developed yet, for instance. He has also shifted toward licensing deals, where a developer essentially pays the Trump Organization to use his name.
A key period for investigators could be recent years when Trump was running for president and whether that affected his businesses. Ways and Means Chairman Neal has requested Trump’s returns from 2013 to 2018.
What are Democrats looking for?
Plenty. Trump’s former attorney and “fixer” Michael Cohen testified before Congress that Trump would falsify financial records when seeking loans or filing his taxes. Trump’s returns would help lawmakers sort out if this is true.
Then there’s the question of how Trump financed his businesses. How much foreign money is involved? Who does he owe money to and what is their business before the U.S. government?
“There are a lot of dots that are out there not yet connected,” said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va.
“The situation with Donald Trump and the myriad ways in which he could potentially be compromised – specifically with who is holding his enormous debt ... these are all absolutely major reasons why it is legitimate to see the tax returns,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa.
The Democrats have asked the IRS to provide Trump’s personal and business returns for 2013 through 2018.

James Comey defends FBI’s use of Steele dossier

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey defended the FBI’s use of British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s unverified dossier during a CNN town hall on Thursday.
He brushed aside pointed questions from moderator Anderson Cooper, saying “the most important part” of the dossier was on “Russians coming for the American election,” which he asserted was “consistent with our other intelligence” and “true.”
Steele’s dossier was used in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications to justify surveillance warrants against Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Comey personally signed off on three of the applications before he was fired by President Trump in May 2017. Steele’s dossier was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and the opposition research group Fusion GPS, which had reached out to and contracted Steele.
A Wall Street Journal report this week said that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is investigating the FBI’s reliance on the dossier “despite questions about [Steele’s] credibility" as part of an inquiry into alleged FISA abuse and more. The report said Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele. A report from The Hill showed Steele admitted to a top State Department official that he was encouraged by a client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation.
Cooper told Comey that “just today [Trump lawyer] Rudy Giuliani was raising questions about how well you, the FBI, vetted the dossier." He cited a tweet from Giuliani that said “the Steele dossier was unverified," Comey “never tried to verify it,” and “deliberately avoided discovering the truth.” Cooper asked Comey: “What do you think about what he says and how much work did the FBI do to verify the dossier?”
Comey said these critiques were “false in two respects.”
“First, I told President Trump that the particular allegation about him being involved with prostitutes in Moscow was unverified, but I felt it important that he know about it,” Comey said. “More broadly, the bureau began an effort after we got the Steele dossier to see how much of it we could replicate. That work was ongoing when I was fired.”
"Some of it was consistent with our other intelligence, the most important part," Comey said, adding, “the Steele dossier said the Russians are coming for the American election.”
“It's a huge effort. It has multiple goals, that I laid out for the audience, and that was true,” Comey said. “There were a lot of spokes off of that that we didn't know whether they were true or false, and we were trying to figure out what we could make of it.”
According to a New York Times report in April, the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources in an attempt to determine their credibility, and as early as January 2017 agents had concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed some of Steele’s information may have been based upon “Russian disinformation.”
Among the dossier's harshest critics is journalist Bob Woodward, who has been calling it “garbage” for more than two years. Former CIA Moscow station chief Daniel Hoffman said: “I called what bullshit the dossier was a year and a half ago … It’s likely FSB [the successor agency to the KGB] disinformation.”
In the town hall, Cooper reminded Comey of an April 2018 interview with George Stephanopoulos in which he appeared to lend credence to the most salacious of the unverified claims in Steele’s dossier. When asked by Stephanopoulos whether he believed Trump’s denials, Comey said, “I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I don't know whether the current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013. It's possible, but I don't know.”
Cooper, noting that special counsel Robert Mueller's final report did not corroborate the dossier's allegations about tapes and prostitutes, asked Comey if he regretted making comments "which some would see as sort of stoking the fires or leaving as an open question."
Comey stood by what he said. “No, I was trying to give an honest answer, and my answer would be the same today," he responded.
Cooper said Comey “could have just said those were unverified" and asked if it is possible that “the Russians have leverage over President Trump."
Comey said “yes," but did not elaborate.
Despite Comey’s defenses of the dossier, a number of Steele’s biggest claims, including its allegation from “Kremlin insiders” that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had met in Prague with Putin associates and foreign hackers, were knocked down by Mueller's report. Mueller did not charge Trump or any Trump associates, or any Americans for that matter, with criminal collusion with the Russians.

For years, she’d made it her mission to cook a new chicken recipe every Friday. As the sun set, she blasted Josh Groban, and, wine in hand, she’d season the meat with the gusto of a conductor rousing an orchestra.
Whatever the recipe, she shook in copious quantities of garlic powder and salt. All of it made her smile. Her food contained so much joy that it would have been fine if it had tasted lackluster, but it never did. My mother was the poultry whisperer.
At age 10, I wrote her an acrostic poem for Mother’s Day that said: “T is for the tasty turkeys you cook.” Eating at her table was festive and filling. As my husband likes to remember, “Any time you’d stop to talk, or put down a fork, she’d say, ‘There’s plenty of food’ — after you’d already eaten so much food.”
Two of my mother’s specialties were her turkey matzo ball soup and her Rock Cornish hens a l’orange. As journalist Laura Silver writes in Knish: In Search of the Jewish Soul Food, “Marcel Proust had his madeleine, Jewish New Yorkers had their knishes.” And I, Jewish New Yorker though I am, have my mother’s chickens.
To make my mother’s Cornish hens, I follow her instructions: Rinse, take out the inside schmutz and dry. I hear my mother’s words, feel her anxiety. The hardest part of the recipe is keeping the hens from cooling. Flip them over without ripping the skin, she says. I armor each with foil, as instructed, while I make the sauce. The sauce requires boxed white wine, orange juice, beef bouillon, orange bits, cornstarch and half a cup of Grand Marnier. I don’t drink, but the birds do.
When my childhood home in New Jersey was sold after my mother’s death seven years ago, I received her cookbooks. I can hold her favorite one, the 1973 edition of The Good Housekeeping Cookbook, and see her creative process. The front is stuffed with recipes from friends, articles on foods to try, and the invaluable excerpt from Nora Ephron’s Heartburn with the perfect recipe for artichoke vinaigrette.
Tucked inside is the newspaper clipping that started it all — a New York Times article from 1999 titled, “From Poussin to Capon a Chicken in Every Size.” It calls Rock Cornish hens “celebratory and a bit decadent” and contains a recipe with an orange. Her trajectory is clear. She must have flipped straight to the Good Housekeeping recipe for duckling a l’orange — the page most splattered with sauce, most kissed by her signature dinners — and then tweaked it to make it her own.
Mom’s cookbook is so worn that the pages fall in clumps into my hands. In this way, our fingerprints still meet.
In The Order of Time, theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli writes, “If I observe the microscopic state of things, then the difference between past and future vanishes.” At that level, the only difference between past and future is the way we observe the transfer of heat. Molecules move from an ordered state to a disordered one. We perceive this as an ever-increasing blur. And because of that blur, we can no longer distinguish cause from effect, past from future. Our days become a bleary, endless march toward disorder.
But amid the deaths, the disappointments, the joys and the intimacies, you can instead choose to restore order. By applying energy in one moment, in one place, you can increase order for just that moment, and then it is as if you are returning to an earlier state.
I like to think that by applying my energy to cooking these chickens, I am, effectively, for that moment, reclaiming the past.
Cooking chicken incites memories of both my mother and what I know of our ancestors. In the eastern European shtetls, and long before, Jewish families planned all week for their Friday Shabbat meal. They’d make chicken soup for that meal that was supposed to give them a taste of The World To Come.
What I want is a taste of The World That Was. I still have keys to my childhood home. But that house has been sold, smashed and turned into someone else’s mansion. So I must return by other means. I turn to my mother’s help.
While the l’orange sauce thickens, I plate the wild rice and the green beans. They frame the hens like a picture from my childhood. The picture is missing my mom’s face, but I feel her warmth. One whiff of that sauce, and it’s like she just put that plate in front me. With the smell, I begin to travel. And it’s the taste, the taste that brings me home.
Cornish Hens a l’Orange
Makes 4 to 8 servings.
The roasting pan(s) you use should be sturdy enough to withstand stove-top heat; the sauce finishes on a burner. You’ll need an instant-read thermometer.
From a mash-up of recipes adapted by freelance writer Julienne Gray.
Ingredients
For the hens
4 Cornish hens (each at least 1½ pounds; giblet packets removed), patted dry with paper towels
1 cups vegetable oil
2½ teaspoons kosher salt
6 teaspoons granulated garlic (aka garlic powder)
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
2 navel oranges
For the sauce
2 cups dry white wine
2 cups fresh orange juice
2 rounded/heaping teaspoons Better Than Bouillon beef base
4 teaspoons cornstarch
8 tablespoons orange liqueur, such as Grand Marnier
Kosher salt
Steps:
For the hens: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease the bottom of a large, shallow roasting pan with cooking oil spray. Alternatively, a large ovenproof skillet can be used.
Coat the Cornish hens inside and out generously with the oil, then the salt and garlic powder. Coat them on the outside with paprika. Arrange the birds breast sides down in the pans. Roast for 20 to 30 minutes, then use tongs to carefully dislodge and turn them over, without tearing the skin. Increase the heat to 425 degrees; roast for 30 to 40 minutes, or until your instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh meat (taken away from the bone) registers 165 degrees.
Meanwhile, rinse the oranges, then cut them into thin rounds.
When the hens are done, transfer them to a platter and tent loosely with aluminum foil to keep them warm while you make the sauce.
For the sauce: Drain the fat from the roasting pan but leave the browned bits. Place on the stove top over medium heat. Add the wine, stirring to dislodge those browned bits. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes or until the wine has reduced by half, then stir in the orange juice and the bouillon base, until well incorporated. Reduce the heat to low.
Whisk together the cornstarch and orange liqueur in a liquid measuring cup, until smooth; this is your slurry, to thicken the sauce.
Increase the heat to medium; pour the slurry into the pan and stir until the sauce is bubbling, and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and leaves a trail when you run your finger through that coating. Lay half the orange slices in the sauce.
Taste, and season with salt, as needed. When ready to serve, uncover the hens. Cut them in half for serving, if desired. Drizzle them with the sauce and arrange all the orange slices (sauced and not sauced) on and around them. Serve warm.

Texto completo: Billy Bush appears headed back to TV this fall.
People is reporting that Bush will host "Extra Extra," a new version of the current syndicated entertainment show, "Extra," currently hosted by Mario Lopez. (Lopez is rumored to be headed to another entertainment show.)
"We all have to be able to evolve as we grow," Bush, 47, told People. "The guy that left the scene in 2016 was already a changed person [since 2005], but I had the opportunity to grow up a little bit. Facing adversity in some way is good. And I feel I'll be better at my job than I ever was. This is my next step."
In 2016 Bush was fired from NBC and the Today Show after a tape from a 2005 "Access Hollywood" interview surfaced of him speaking with then-"Apprentice" star Donald Trump, who boasted about groping and kissing women.
"It was a bad moment. And I was in it. But one moment doesn't define your life," Bush said to the magazine of the leaked tape.
Trump went on to win the presidency. Bush was out of show business.
Bush pushed back against the president, who was saying that it wasn't him on the tape, in a 2017 column in The New York Times, where he wrote "President Trump is currently indulging in some revisionist history, reportedly telling allies, including at least one United States senator, that the voice on the tape is not his. This has hit a raw nerve in me."
"Extra Extra" is set to premiere Sept. 9. on Fox stations.

Texto completo: When Margaret Carnegie was born in March 1897, the only child of Scottish-American industrialist and steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, she entered a life of wealth and privilege. Often cited as one of the richest people in history, the elder Carnegie transformed his early modest existence into a life in which he owned numerous residences, including Skibo Castle in Scotland, a structure that dates to 1212.
On April 22, 1919, just four months before her father's death, Margaret married Roswell Miller Jr. at the Carnegie family home at 2 East 91st St. in New York City. Miller was a successful civil engineer and real estate executive, and the wedding received extensive coverage in The New York Times.
In the mid-1920s, along with other families of wealth in search of upstate property, Miller purchased 700 acres in Millbrook and enclosed the entire parcel with a 12-foot wire fence to protect his private herd of deer and elk. He established two entrances to the estate, one along Route 44 west of the Hamlet of Mabbettsville, and the other on Butts Hollow Road.
In 1927, financed by a gift from Margaret's mother, Louise Whitfield Carnegie, Miller had a 22-room stone and wood mansion built on the estate in the style of Skibo Castle. It was named Migdale after his wife's nickname, Midge.
Guests visiting the expansive, opulent structure arrived at a majestic porte cochere and into a 20- by 30-foot entrance hall that featured a grand staircase leading to the second floor. Entertaining was not a problem in the mansion's 35- by 58-foot living room.
Dinner parties were held in a 20- by 30-foot dining room, and to maintain a tranquil atmosphere for adults, the house was also fitted with a separate dining room for children. And with 10 bedrooms, nine bathrooms and another eight half-bathrooms, overnight guests were well accommodated, perhaps more so than in their own homes.
Each of the first-floor rooms featured exposed beam ceilings and dark oak wood floors. An unusual but welcoming feature in the dwelling was a 30- by 30-foot conservatory, where the Millers housed tropical birds and plants.
"I arrived in Millbrook in 1970 and two weeks before Christmas I received an invitation to attend a carol singalong at Migdale," said David Brinkerhoff. "Apparently, Roswell invited everyone in the community to his annual event. There were 200 to 300 people there and I recall an impressive 6-foot-long fireplace and someone playing an organ while everyone sang. Roswell greeted everyone as they arrived."
The grounds featured a 35- by 75-foot swimming pool with three diving boards. Among the outbuildings on the estate, Miller added a four-car stone garage, an eight-room superintendent's house, a gardener's cottage, three greenhouses and four barns.
While some of the surrounding estate owners used their respective properties for weekend and/or summer getaways, the Millers maintained Migdale as their primary residence. That said they were known to spend long periods at Skibo Castle in Scotland, the very structure after which their home was designed. To facilitate an easy traveling option, following World War ll, Miller had a 2,500-foot landing strip installed on the estate to accommodate private aircraft.
"The Roswells were wonderful people," said John Kading. "They were members of Lyall Memorial Federated Church, where I went, and he invited the Christian Endeavor Society to Migdale for Easter. We were 12-14 years old at the time and it was just wonderful."
Miller and Margaret Carnegie divorced in 1953, with Miller retaining the Millbrook estate and Carnegie relocating to Connecticut. He died in 1983, at 88 years old, while Margaret lived to the age of 93, passing away in 1990.
In 2000, the current owners of Migdale purchased the estate and embarked on a four-year renovation of the four-story residence. The 34,000-square foot home was fitted with a number of modern amenities.
Migdale is at 3872 Route 44, Millbrook.

DeVos pushes for robust school choice

Texto completo: Education secretary Betsy DeVos continued to advocate for robust school choice in front of a room of several hundred journalists attending the Education Writers Association's annual conference in Baltimore Monday.
In a wide-ranging interview, the Department of Education's controversial leader defended her push for a federal tax credit that would fund scholarships for students to attend private schools and other educational programs.
She said she is reaching out to Congress members on the other side of the aisle to garner support for "Education Freedom Scholarships." For too long, DeVos argued, educators have been trying the same approaches with little positive change.
"More choices and more freedom in education will ultimately mean better experiences and more excellence at every school," she said. "Whether it's a neighborhood school or one across town that you choose to go to because it has a specific program that you're interested in."
She defended her department's decision to rescind Obama-era guidance to local schools that attempted to reduce suspensions of black and special education children, groups that have been more frequently targeted for discipline.
She said the guidance was not linked to the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last year and had been criticized as making schools unsafe as it reduced zero-tolerance discipline practices.
"We felt it was an overreach by the previous administration," she said.
While acknowledging that some teachers need to be better paid, DeVos was critical of the teacher strikes which have happened from West Virginia to California in the past two years.
"Great teachers need to be well paid," she said, but "I think it's important that adults have adult disagreements on adult time."
DeVos took a direct swipe at Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the nation's largest unions.
"Great teachers perhaps should be making at least half as much of what Randi Weingarten does at half a million dollars a year," she said.
Weingarten responded with a statement saying, "I'd be delighted if Betsy wants to get all teachers close to $200,000-they deserve that-and so much more."
She also ribbed reporters, saying that while "many in the media use my name as click-bait," coverage should not be focused on her.
"Education is not about Betsy DeVos, nor about any other individual," she said. "It's about students."
Asked during the interview with New York Times education reporter Erica L. Green whether she would agree to serve for another four years if Trump is re-elected, DeVos was noncommittal.
"I'm not sure my husband would be OK with that," she said.

Showing signs of illness, Derby winner Country House will skip Preakness

Texto completo: Country House, the controversial winner of the Kentucky Derby, will not run in the Preakness Stakes on May 18 in Baltimore because he has shown signs of illness after Saturday's Run for the Roses. He is the first Kentucky Derby winner to skip the second leg of the Triple Crown since Grindstone in 1996.
"He developed a little bit of a cough this morning," trainer Bill Mott told the Daily Racing Form on Tuesday. "His appetite is good. He doesn't have a fever. But he's coughing. We drew blood. He's acting like he's going to get sick. He's off the training list, and if he's off the training list, he's off the Preakness list."
"It's probably a little viral thing," Mott added. "Hopefully it doesn't develop into anything serious. Usually when something like this happens, a horse misses a couple weeks of training. He's not seriously sick right now. But he's showing indications that something is going on."
Country House has remained at Churchill Downs in Louisville since Saturday's race, which he won as a 65-1 shot after wire-to-wire leader Maximum Security was disqualified for impeding the progress of other horses. Mott said his first thought immediately after Saturday's race, when he thought Country House had finished second, was to save the horse for the Belmont Stakes, the final leg of the Triple Crown, on June 8.
But the decision to award the Derby to Country House forced him to consider running the horse at Pimlico.
"Having the Derby winner, you're pretty much forced to go into the Preakness," Mott said Sunday.
Mott told the New York Times on Tuesday that Country House could still run in the Belmont Stakes.
It is rare for the Derby winner to skip the Preakness. Grindstone was retired just five days after his 1996 Kentucky Derby victory after knee chips were discovered in his leg. He became the first Kentucky Derby winner since 1926 to be retired immediately following the victory.
In 1985, Kentucky Derby champion Spend a Buck skipped the Preakness to compete for a $2 million bonus at the newly reopened Garden State Park in New Jersey. Three years earlier, Gato Del Sol's handlers decided that the two-week span between the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes was too short for the horse to overcome, and the unlikely winner at Churchill Downs was held out until the Belmont Stakes. He finished second, 14 lengths back.
As of Tuesday, only three horses who ran in the Kentucky Derby have been announced as running in the Preakness: Improbable (fourth), War of Will (seventh) and Bodexpress (13th). On Monday, Maximum Security owner Gary West said his horse would not be heading to Pimlico. Second-place Code of Honor also will skip the Preakness.
The absence of a Triple Crown possibility has historically depressed TV ratings for and betting on the next race in the series. With no horse gunning for the Triple Crown in 2016, one year after American Pharoah became the first Triple Crown winner since 1978, that year's Belmont Stakes was the lowest-rated and least-watched since 2010, and the total amount bet on the race fell from $82.4 million to $52.2 million. Attendance also fell, from 90,000 to 60,114.

The company seemed like a model for the modern economy. It was growing so fast in the clean-energy field that New Jersey awarded it $ 7.2 million in tax incentives to keep adding jobs installing solar panels.
But six black men who worked for the company, Momentum Solar, painted a far different picture: They contend that the managers of its operation on Long Island fostered a racially hostile work environment and fired employees who complained about it.
The managers made frequent use of racist slurs, routinely called black men "boy" and paid them less than white workers, a lawsuit filed on Monday alleged.
The suit, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, seeks class-action status on behalf of all employees who worked out of the company's warehouse in Plainview, N.Y. It accused the company's managers of engaging in systemic discrimination against black workers and retaliating against those who filed complaints.
The company responded that there was "no basis in law or fact for the claims" asserted in the suit.
"The six disgruntled former hourly employees were terminated for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons including unacceptable workplace behavior, fighting, poor performance, failure to show up for work and violations of material company policies and procedures," a statement from an outside lawyer for the company said. "The company intends to vigorously defend all claims."
Momentum Solar, which is based in Metuchen, N.J., claims to be one of the fastest-growing companies in its industry, with more than 1,200 employees across the country. Last year, it received $ 7.2 million in tax incentives from New Jersey's Economic Development Authority for its plan to add more than 150 jobs over three years.
The state's tax-incentive programs have come under scrutiny after recent revelations by The New York Times that tax breaks were awarded to politically connected companies, though Momentum was not one of the firms cited in the The Times report.
Momentum, which was founded in 2009, said it would create a new location within 10 miles of its current headquarters.
"What Momentum's investors and clients and the taxpayers who help foot the bill for its operations do not know is that the management at the company's New York-based warehouse fostered a work environment permeated with vile racism," the complaint stated.
The former employees are represented by Michael J. Willemin of the Wigdor law firm in Manhattan.
One of the former Momentum workers, Shaddon Beswick, said in an interview that he was subjected to frequent use of the "N-word" and called "panel boy" as he lugged 50-pound solar panels up a 40-foot ladder to the roofs of two-story houses.
"It was just random racism," said Mr. Beswick, who is an electrician. He said he put up with it for a while because he had a baby daughter and bills to pay. But when he noticed that white workers were getting better assignments while he was consistently given "grunt work," he complained to his manager, he said.
The manager dismissed his complaints, telling him that there were "always three sides to a story: your side, his side and the truth," Mr. Beswick recalled. A day after lodging one of these complaints, he said he was fired and told, "It just didn't work out."
Tevin Brown, one of the plaintiffs, said he started out at $ 15 an hour and never received a raise in his five months with Momentum. One day, a new white employee with no experience in solar installation told Mr. Brown that he was receiving $ 22 an hour.
Mr. Brown said he eventually told a foreman that he was tired of being called "boy" at work. He was abruptly shifted from that crew and, within weeks, was fired, he said. His replacement: the inexperienced white worker who was earning $ 7 an hour more, he said.
Another plaintiff, Garreth Murrell, said he left a job with Tesla and took a pay cut to join Momentum, believing that he would receive a raise after "I show them how I work." Mr. Murrell was promoted to a foreman position, overseeing an all-black crew of installers, but he was "shamelessly paid less than his white counterparts," according to the complaint.
In a conversation that Mr. Murrell recorded, according to the complaint, the general manager told him: "I almost fired you. I kept your job. That was a mistake right there. That was my mistake because we're still having this conversation."
After Mr. Murrell complained, the company "began a campaign of blatant and unlawful retaliation against Mr. Murrell in an apparent bid to force him to quit," the complaint said. Foremen and managers engaged in racially hostile behavior in a group text chat, saying "Make Momentum Great Again!" a phrase the plaintiffs argue is loaded with racism and xenophobia.
After Mr. Murrell took his complaints beyond the general manager to an executive in New Jersey, he was fired by text message, he said.
"I got a text message saying we don't need your services any more," he said.

Texto completo: Michael Cohen, eager masochist and former gofer to President Trump, couldn’t go to prison without one last act of self-humiliation.
Everything ever written about Cohen paints a cautionary tale for young boys. Now, son, here’s a man you don’t want to become. Whether he’s confessing his unrequited love for his boss (“I’m the guy who would take a bullet for the president”) or taking “responsibility” for his years of bank fraud and his taxi medallion scheme (he also neglected to claim income from the sale of a luxury purse), there is no redeeming quality to Cohen’s public life.
And yet he insists on making it public, like some weird, degrading kink.
Before going away to federal prison for three years, Cohen had yet another embarrassment to bring on himself.
"I hope that when I rejoin my family and friends that the country will be in a place without xenophobia, injustice, and lies at the helm of our country,” he read from prepared remarks, no doubt feeling his heart pound with adrenaline. “There still remains much to be told and I look forward to the day that I can share the truth.”

The day that he could “share the truth” was apparently not any of the days since Nov. 29, 2018, the day he pleaded guilty to a litany of charges. “Much to be told” was apparently too much for his two days of congressional testimony in February.
Cohen is apparently under the impression that the public is desperate to hear more from the guy who once dreamed like a child of being mayor of New York. We’ll all certainly be on the edge of our seats for three years to hear once again from the guy who stupidly pleaded guilty to a ridiculous campaign finance violation — in addition to tax evasion, bank fraud, and lying to Congress.
It’s as if Cohen googled “media expert,” clicked on the first result and then paid $1,000 for advice on what to say before going to prison. The result was his condemnation of Trump’s “xenophobia, injustice, and lies.”
How very novel. We haven’t heard any of that before on CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, the Washington Post, Time magazine, the Associated Press, ABC, CBS …
Go away, Michael Cohen. There are, I’m guessing, equally exhilarating ways to embarrass yourself in prison.

Texto completo: Gail Horn moves oils into a pot to make a new batch of soaps at her shop, The Soap Chest, in Camas on a recent Tuesday.
Nathan Howard/The Columbian
Gail Horn moves bars of soap from a curing rack while preparing to cut them into their final size. Horn makes around 112 bars of soap a day. They have to cure for four weeks before being sold. The process includes melting oils, such as avocado oil, and mixing lye and water. “What's happening is saponification. The chemical reaction for lye and water and oils becomes soap. You blend it until it's thick like pudding, and pour it into a mold,” she said.

Gail Horn moves bars of soap, cut to their final size, from a slicing rack at The Soap Chest. Do-it-yourself soap-making has grown in the United States and soap can usually be found at places like local farmers markets.
Nathan Howard/The Columbian
Gail Horn organizes bars of soap after cutting them to their final size. “There is a lot of chemistry involved, especially with new recipes,” Horn said.
The Soap Chest's building includes a small green space in the back where Horn keeps a garden. She picks herbs such as lavender and sage to include in her soaps.
Nathan Howard/The Columbian
Gail Horn collects herbs from the garden behind The Soap Chest, which she uses for some of her handmade
Hand-crafted soap. Kind of like do-it-yourself beer brewing and kombucha, homemade soap is everywhere these days.
Head to any farmers market, and no doubt you'll find several people selling these multicolored square bars with scents and ingredients like “lavender chamomile” or “lemon rosemary goat milk.”
“Want to Sell Handmade Soap? Join the Crowd” a 2017 headline in the New York Times read. The story reported that there were 300,000 soap-making businesses in the United States, according to the Handcrafted Soap & Cosmetic Guild, and growing.
“I think it's because people are very conscious now about natural products,” Camas soap-maker Gail Horn said. “All the sudden I'm like ‘What am I putting on my skin? Maybe I should be concerned about what's in there.' ”
Horn, 54, owns a storefront devoted to the product. She jumped on the trend a bit earlier, starting her business at home back in 2000 after her family opted for a handmade-only Christmas. Working as an accountant didn't indulge her creative side, so she found joy in the process of making soap. Though making soap can be creative, it's technical too, requiring a working knowledge of basic chemistry and how ingredients like lye and water react to one another.
“When I started this I was like, ‘OK, this is back to high school chemistry, how did that go?' There is a lot of chemistry involved, especially with new recipes,” she said. She makes up to 112 bars of soap a day and takes pride in a “from scratch only” approach.
Horn's husband, a graphic designer for C-Tran, helped support development of the business, she said. They bought the plot of land in 2014 at 521 N.E. Everett St., Camas, for a commercial structure for $45,000, when Horn felt she had a large enough clientele to sustain a brick-and-mortar business.
Walking into the The Soap Chest, you're predictably greeted by an invisible mountain of pleasant aromas and seemingly endless types of soaps. A new type she had just concocted, still drying on racks in the back room: Columbia River Gorgeous, featuring crushed walnuts as the riverbed and blue swirls above it like water. The Columbian caught up with Horn at her shop to learn about how she's surviving in soap-making.
How do you sustain your soap-making business?
There are a lot of soap-makers these days. You can find it anywhere. So I guess consistency, and at the same time, new things. I'm always trying a new scent or blend or color. My kind of niche is everything is handmade and from scratch, down to the herbs that I put in from my garden.
What are some challenges?
Well, the online part of it. How do you get ranked higher on Google? I was just at a workshop on Monday: How do I get my website ranked higher? The strategy I had two years ago might not work now. And I am off the beaten path. Fourth Avenue, which is just the next street down, is where the main part of our businesses are. I call this area the “Pearl of Camas” (referring to the district in Portland) because we're just north of downtown, but we're hip and cool.
Do you sell to any other businesses?
No big-box stores. My wholesale accounts are niche stores; for instance I do soap for a lavender farm in Hood River (Ore.) and for a chocolate shop in Seattle. I couldn't discount my soap enough to put it in a big-box store. You have to discount your soap to wholesale and yet you don't have to sell it yourself either. It's a balance there. If I only wholesaled I'm not sure I could make it. You can raise your prices, but I didn't want to do that. I don't want it to be just a luxury thing that you keep; “I paid $20 for this soap and I can't use it, it's too expensive.”
What is required with wholesaling to a big-box store?
The main thing is, they're national so I'd have to make so much soap that it would be impossible for my size of business. I was in New Seasons for a while.
Why did you stop?
A multitude of reasons. It became too difficult for a small business to do. The paperwork was overwhelming, and I'm a paperwork person. I'm an accountant. Paperwork doesn't bother me but it became so arduous that it wasn't worth it for the amount of sales that I had there.
Do you feel it's actually more difficult to sell online because there's such a bottomless pit of competition with sites like Etsy?
Even online I'm relying on word of mouth. Somebody will come up on vacation, they're visiting their relatives, they come in the shop, and they'll buy some things. They'll go home to Virginia and place an order. It's a competitive market online.
Do you have to be certified or inspected by the Food and Drug Administration or any other agency to do this?
No, I actually am a certified soap-maker, but it's not through the government; it's through the Handcrafted Soap & Cosmetic Guild. Last year I took the test to be certified. But there's no governmental certification you need to make soap. It's not a cosmetic, so you don't have to have FDA approval or anything.
Are there like, rogue soap-makers making horrible soaps out there?
There are all levels, there really are. I want to keep learning as long as I go. The guild is good for that. I mean you might find handmade soap out there that's … interesting. That's a weeding out thing, because you buy it, you use it, and go “Oh, that was slimy, I won't buy that again.” Unless soap-makers are honing their craft, they aren't going to survive.

The Trump Whisperer and his dark worldview

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Understanding Donald Trump’s foreign policy is a challenge, since the president has written and spoken little on the subject for most of his life. So how to make sense of his worldview? Is there a Trump Doctrine?
Michael Anton, a former Trump national security official, believes there is, and he explains it in a new essay in Foreign Policy. The Trump Doctrine, Anton argues, is simple: “Let’s all put our own countries first, and be candid about it, and recognize that it’s nothing to be ashamed of.” But, as Daniel Larison responds in the American Conservative, “That isn’t a doctrine. It is a banality.” What country has not put its own interests first? What president has argued to give preference to “global interests” over American ones?
Anton outlines a certain kind of nationalist conservatism that does seem at the heart of Donald Trump’s worldview. More important -- since Trump is rarely consistent and could change his mind tomorrow -- it reflects the views of the man closest to him on foreign policy, national security adviser John Bolton.
Bolton has been variously described as a neoconservative, a paleoconservative and a conservative hawk. In fact, he is simply a conservative, in the oldest, most classical sense, someone who has a dark view of humankind. As a former U.S. official told the New Yorker, Bolton believes that Thomas Hobbes’ famous description of life without order applies precisely to international life - “nasty, brutish and short.”
Bolton believes that to protect itself and project its power, the United States must be aggressive, unilateral and militant. Bolton seems to share the worldview that animated Dick Cheney, who after 9/​11 spoke openly about the need to “work ... the dark side” and to “use any means at our disposal basically to achieve our objectives.”
There are some in the foreign policy establishment who believe that a revanchist Russia poses a grave threat to America. Others worry about a rising China or an ideological Iran. For Bolton, it’s all of the above and more. He has at various points warned darkly about the mortal threat posed to the United States by Cuba, Libya, Syria and of course, Iraq.
A longtime fan of regime change, he recently labeled Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua a “triangle of terror” and said the U.S. “looks forward to watching each corner of the triangle fall.” It seems he wants them to fall not to usher in an era of democracy, but because they resist American power and influence. “The Monroe Doctrine is alive and well,” Bolton told the New Yorker’s Dexter Filkins. “It’s our hemisphere.”
This kind of conservatism believes that national interests are worth pursuing not because they are virtuous -- about democracy and freedom -- but because they are ours. This view originates in a cultural chauvinism and can easily morph into racism.
And sure enough, a senior State Department official, Kiron Skinner, this week explained that the challenge with confronting China is that it is “a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.” She noted: “The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family.”
Where to begin? The Cold War was an existential struggle because the Soviet Union believed it had a superior ideology of economics, politics and society that it would impose on the rest of the world. That is why it was called “totalitarian.” China’s rise to power is the standard process by which a new powerhouse economy tries to find a space on the international stage. China’s system, incidentally, is largely a mixture of two Western ideas, capitalism and communism -- Adam Smith and Marx -- which is why The New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof has aptly described it as “Market-Leninism.”
By Skinner’s logic we had more in common with Hitler’s ideology than with the Chinese because the Nazis were Caucasian, which is both historically uninformed and morally grotesque.
The more practical problem with the Cheney-Bolton worldview is that it is profoundly inaccurate. The world is not nasty, brutish and short. Life has improved immeasurably over the last 100 years. Political violence -- deaths from wars, civil wars and terrorism -- has plummeted. And this has happened in large part because human beings also have the genes to cooperate, to compete peacefully and to weigh the costs of war against their benefits.
Bolton says that he might well invoke the “Roosevelt Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine -- which asserts that the U.S. can use force unilaterally anywhere in the Western hemisphere. If he does, what is the argument against Russia doing the same in Ukraine, China in the South China Sea, and Iran in Yemen? Without rules and norms, the U.S. would have to militarily thwart every such effort or else accept a world of war and anarchy. You see, nationalist assertiveness works as long as only you get to practice it.

Texto completo: Headnote 2020 ELECTION
LONDONDERRY, N.H. - On his third trip to New Hampshire recently, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., had a new and very specific focus: his "baby bonds" proposal to combat income inequality by giving every child a government-funded savings account.
His plan would eliminate the racial wealth gap, Booker promised voters, and "create a fairer playing field where everybody has a stake in this economy." He has since embarked on a 15-day national tour where he touted numerous economic policies, including a broad rewriting and expansion of earned-income tax credits, a plan his campaign is calling the "Rise Credit."
One of Booker's main rivals, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has touted her own plan to close the wealth gap, which she calls the "LIFT Act." It would provide a refundable tax credit worth up to $6,000 for households.
As income inequality becomes an increasingly central issue in the Democratic primary, the plans offered by Booker and Harris are a microcosm of the larger competition between two Democrats who have long been vying for similar sources of support. As the leading African American candidates in the race, they are waging a primary within the primary for the right to claim a valuable prize: recognition as the consensus choice of black voters, donors and community leaders in a crowded Democratic field.
"I think they'll both have strengths in the African American community, but to get the numbers that you need to get in a crowded field, they'll both need to have crossover appeal," said Stephen Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, South Carolina. Benjamin has engaged with both candidates, but is waiting until it gets closer to his state's primary in February 2020 to make an endorsement.
"So, yes, it's a collision course between the two African-American candidates, but they must also carve out their own lane," he said.
Former Vice President Joe Biden has tried to position himself as the continuation of former President Barack Obama's legacy Since entering the race last week, and enjoys deep relationships with Black leaders in the Democratic Party. In several national polls, which can provide an early reading of the electorate, Biden leads among all demographics, including Black voters. Harris has slipped to single-digits in recent weeks after a strong opening month and Booker continues to languish.
For Harris and Booker, the path to the 2020 presidential race began more than a decade ago. At the Democratic National Convention in 2008, the two barrier-breaking Black officials were featured during a luncheon for rising stars in a party that was already being reshaped in Obama's image. Harris at the time was the San Francisco district attorney; Booker was in his first term as mayor of Newark, New Jersey.
Harris' election to the Senate in 2016 raised her national profile and established her as a likely presidential contender. Booker won his Senate seat in 2013, cementing his national ascendence.
Since then, they have crossed paths repeatedly as they jockey for support from influential Black leaders, and for top billing at a similar set of events. They have both shown up, for instance, at a 2017 weekend in the Hamptons for the Black Economic Alliance; at a race and criminal justice panel held by BET earlier this year; and for the NAACP Image Awards in March, where they presented together.
Both senators have faced skepticism from the party's left at times during their career - Booker for his ties to Wall Street, his record on policing while mayor, and his embrace of charter schools, and Harris for her mixed record on criminal justice reform. And both have structured their presidential campaigns around an economic policy proposal aimed at reducing the wealth gap, while carefully avoiding the anti-Wall Street rhetoric associated with Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
Booker's "baby bonds" proposal calls for every child born in the United States to be given a $1,000 savings account that the government would fund annually on a tiered basis, depending on family income. The lump sum would be presented when the child turns 18 and could only be used for education, investing in a business or buying a home.
Conservatives and some economic experts say the proposal is a fantasy that could never be realized; Hillary Clinton was heavily criticized by Republicans when she proposed a similar idea in 2007 and quickly backed off the proposal.
But many on the left say it represents the kind of bold policy approach they are seeking, and experts like Kilolo Kijakazi, a fellow at the Urban Institute, have said it could directly narrow the racial wealth gap.
Harris' policy, called LIFT the Middle Class Act, would provide lower-income families up to $500 in monthly payments, on top of existing tax credits and public benefits. It has been praised as a rare tangible benefit to the working poor, the kind seldom seen in Washington.
But some progressives view it as not bold enough - calling it an expansion of the earned-income tax credit by another name - and say it will not lift up the neediest Americans. Harris has also attempted to use the policy as a catchall description of her economic vision, reframing questions about the racial wealth gap and reparations, for instance, into a broader discussion of racial disparity.
Recently, some scholars who previously praised the policy have made sure to clarify it is not a panacea.
The LIFT Act "won't do much for wealth concentration, and it won't do much for altering the position of people with the lower end of the wealth distribution," said Sandy Darity, a Duke University professor who is a leading scholar on reparations and the racial wealth gap.
The reactions to the two economic plans underscore not only the lingering skepticism about Harris' progressive bona fides, but also the divergent strategies she and Booker are using to present their campaigns to voters.
In private conversations, Harris' allies acknowledge they are making a different bet than Booker and other rivals like Warren and Sanders. Harris has leapt into the top tier of candidates - she was second to Sanders in first-quarter fundraising - with a less radical policy agenda. Her campaign's first policy rollout was a federal investment in teacher pay, an almost universally supported idea among her Democratic colleagues.
Rather than trying to appease the party's left wing with policies that focus on large-scale wealth redistribution and structural change, Harris has staked her bet on an incrementalism more reminiscent of Obama or Clinton.
Felicia Wong, president of the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank, who has tried to push candidates to embrace bolder economic policies, said Booker has gone to greater lengths to match his policies with the progressive moment.
"It's notable that Sen. Booker, for the last year, has focused on issues at the top of the economy, like corporate concentration of power, and he's connected that with people's daily lives," Wong said. "In contrast, Sen. Harris' policy pieces, while maybe good individually, don't yet hang together."
Though he leans heavily into bolder policies, Booker has recently attempted to distance himself from unyielding candidates on the party's left flank, like Sanders. "A real progressive movement does not hold progress for communities like mine hostage today for promises that perfection will come tomorrow," he said recently at his hometown kickoff rally.
Still, there is no shortage of reasons Harris' bet on pragmatic liberalism may work, and she currently enjoys a significant edge on Booker in early indicators such as fund-raising, polling and national campaign apparatus.
In South Carolina, though Booker's snagged the first endorsement from a state legislator, Harris recently earned the support of Bakari Sellers, a former state representative and one of the state's most sought-after surrogates. In announcing his endorsement, Sellers praised Harris' teacher pay plan in particular.
"These issues hit home for me, and Kamala has repeatedly offered clear solutions for each one, proving there is no problem or person too small to be heard," Sellers said.
Both campaigns view the early South Carolina primary as essential to their prospects. Other contenders, particularly Biden, enjoy deep relationships among the Black political class there. But Booker and Harris have already invested heavily in the state, in an attempt to secure staff and early endorsements.
Harris' campaign has also raised eyebrows for a reluctance to engage presidential forums related to Black voters.
Harris, for instance, has yet to agree to attend the Black Economic Alliance's presidential forum on Black wealth in South Carolina, though Booker and other presidential contenders have said yes. She the People, the advocacy group for women of color that hosted a presidential forum in Houston last week, announced a lineup that originally included almost every top presidential candidate besides Harris. "You have to ask her campaign," said the group's founder Aimee Allison, when asked about the absence.

Texto completo: Conventional wisdom says bonds zig when stocks zag, smoothing out volatile periods for investors with blended stock-and-bond portfolios.
Yet, last year that didn’t happen. Corporate and government bond indexes dipped with stocks, raising the question: “What good are they, really?”
To answer that, let’s explore some basics – what bonds actually do in portfolios and what makes them tick.
First: Bonds are simply loans. Buying a bond from a government or company means they borrow your money for a fixed period, promising to pay regular interest, and repay your principle at the end. In between, the bond’s value will fluctuate.
Women and work: Why a growing share of women are working or looking for jobs.
Tracking your retirement: Checked your Social Security statement? If not, you should
Second: Interest rates underpin those fluctuations. Bond prices and interest rates sit on opposite ends of a seesaw. When rates rise, bond prices fall – and vice versa. Pretend you own a Treasury bond paying 2% and maturing in 2029. If 10-year Treasury rates subsequently rise to 3%, your bond’s price will decline. Fewer people want to buy it when they can get a 3% interest rate. But, if 10-year Treasury rates instead fall to 1%, your higher-yielding bond becomes more attractive – its price will rise.
Third: For long-term government bonds, the main interest rate driver is future changes in inflation expectations. When everyone expects faster inflation, they’ll demand higher interest rates to offset it.
Corporate bonds have more variables, including the company’s changing creditworthiness and growth prospects. These will influence its ability to repay you later on. In this way, corporate bonds’ and stocks share some similarities – your first clue they don’t always move oppositely. More mathematically, consider correlations: They measure how closely related two assets’ movements are. Identical movement score is 1. 00; exact opposite is -1. 00. What's the correlation between stocks and seven- to 10-year corporate bonds? It's -0. 01. That's almost exactly midway. In other words, corporate bonds zig with stocks almost exactly as often as they zag against them.
Even Treasurys move with stocks more often than commonly thought. Why? Because a “Goldilocks” economy with moderate growth and low inflation, like now, keeps a lid on interest rates. Their correlation with stocks: -0. 28.
Fourth: While the zig-zag effect of bonds helps sometimes, it isn’t what makes them helpful for blended portfolios. What is? Said simply, their wiggles, both up and down, are smaller. If you’re taking big cash flow from your retirement investments, this can be a big deal.
Fifth: The sharp ups and downs stocks bring can make cash flow-planning difficult. A slug of bonds dampen the swings somewhat. The relatively smoother ride means modestly lower long-term returns than 100% stocks. But that trade-off may be worth it for those relying on their investments for living expenses.
Regardless, growth remains important to offset inflation and generate enough future wealth to prevent you from running out of money. So owning too much in bonds becomes hugely risky for those with long future needs. But dampening volatility really does benefit those with shorter time horizons.
From this standpoint, bonds “worked” last year. They fell, but markedly less than stocks. That cushioned the blow somewhat for investors who owned both, while interest payments helped fund folks’ cash flow needs. The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 4. 4% last year, but a broad gauge combining U. S. corporate and government bonds fell just 0. 8%.
Finally: Bonds can rise in basic value. Like stocks, bonds have enjoyed a V-shaped recovery so far this year, thanks to falling long-term interest rates and easing recession worries. Corporate bonds have done particularly well, and their bounce likely slows now. But benign long-term interest rates and strong overall corporate fundamentals point to a fine year for the category overall.
Next week: a closer look at bonds’ risks. Yes, they have them.

Chalking of car tires rubs court wrong way

Texto completo: From the dome to your home. Ramblings, mutterings, keen observations and things you ought to know out of Helena from the mind of Phil Drake.
CHALK IT UP: I read in "The Week" magazine that the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled the longtime law enforcement practice of marking a car tire with chalk to help with parking enforcement is unconstitutional.
Believe it or not, marking car tires is a form of trespass on private property.
The case was born in Saginaw, Michigan, where an attorney was ticketed while sitting in a chalked vehicle, according to the magazine.
I wondered what it meant for Great Falls.
Craig Raymond, director of planning and community development, took my call.
"We are aware of the court decision," he said, adding they were evaluating.
He said Great Falls does chalk tires and at this time it is the city's understanding the decision out of the 6th District does not apply to Montana.
Raymond readily offers that nobody likes getting a parking ticket.
And he says there are other ways to monitor how long a vehicle has been parked in a certain spot, such as "electronic chalking" or license plate recognition, in which the license plate is scanned and the information is relayed to a pay station.
I asked if any residents have let him know about the court decision.
"Oh my goodness. We have had a number of people say 'Hey, did you see this?'" Raymond said, adding good-naturedly he would not "verbally express" what he thought about the ruling when he learned of it.
A MATTER OF TIME: One news agency has given a general time period as to when Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock will announce a run for president: the week of May 13.
That was pretty much what I had heard and/or figured, and it's about the same time estimate that I heard from other reporters. I guess I wasn't smart enough to write a story about it. Montana Television Network said anonymous sources told them of the plans to announce the run during the week of May 13.
I knew it would be after the legislative session but quick enough that he can get in the running as the field is filling up.
We will see.
COLUMBUS DAZE: I've been reading where a couple states have chucked or will chuck Columbus Day for Indigenous Peoples' Day.
"There is power in a name and in who we choose to honor," Gov. Janet T. Mills of Maine said in a statement about the bill, which she signed into law on April 26, the New York Times reported.
New Mexico's governor signed a similar bill in April, and Vermont's legislature also passed a law, which is awaiting the governor's signature.
Vermont Gov. Phil Scott said he would likely sign the bill, according to USA TODAY.
"I see no reason that I would not sign it," he said.
Indigenous Peoples' Day did not have such a warm welcome in Montana. While House Bill 219, sponsored by Rep. Shane Morigeau, D-Missoula, passed the House 62-35 on Feb. 14, it was stalled in a Senate committee on March 13.
During the House discussion, many of the Native American members spoke in favor of the bill. One said Columbus Day celebrates a man who killed and tortured Native American people and compared it to having a holiday that would celebrate Nazi Germany.
Morigeau said shortly after the Senate committee hearing he would continue to try to get his bill passed.
BYE THE NUMBERS: I was looking at the Montana State Legislature website the other day, and it said there were 270,131 floor votes during the 2017 session.
I couldn't have even begun to tell you how many.
There's a little more trivia at https://leg.mt.gov/
MILK RIVER: I got an email this week that U.S. Sens. Jon Tester and Steve Daines and Rep. Greg Gianforte have introduced legislation to increase investments in the Milk River Infrastructure Project "that thousands of Montana farmers rely on for access to reliable irrigation water in northcentral Montana."
The St. Mary's Reinvestment Act will have the federal government picks up 75 percent of the costs for upgrades to the century-old water project. Currently, the federal government funds 26% of the project, leaving local users with the responsibility to pay the rest.
The delegation's bill will cover 75% of the cost of upgrading and operating the Sherburne Dam and Reservoir, Swift Current Creek Dike, Lower St. Mary Lake, St. Mary Canal Diversion Dam, and the St. Mary Canal.
The Milk River Water Project provides water to 18,000 Montanans and irrigates enough cropland to feed 1 million people, the news release states.
Stay tuned.
EDUCATED: Tara Westover, whose bestselling memoir "Educated," about the transformative power of an education, will speak Aug. 22 at MSU's 2019 Convocation in Brick Breeden Fieldhouse.

A test for reformers

Texto completo: Valley News Columnist
Now that Jim Parker is seeking an early release from prison, the good liberals of the Upper Valley who support criminal justice reform are about to be tested.
Do they think that even a violent offender such as Parker deserves a break? Or does their compassion and belief in the powers of rehabilitation have limits?
Parker has spent 18 years in the New Hampshire State Prison for his part in the murders of Dartmouth professors Half and Susanne Zantop at their Etna home on a Saturday morning in January 2001. At the time of the grisly crimes, Parker was 16 years old.
Parker, now 34, is asking that the remaining seven years of his minimum sentence of 25 years be suspended so he can get on with his life. Under New Hampshire law, an offender who has served two-thirds of his minimum can go back to court to show he’s a changed man.
By all accounts, Parker has been a model prisoner. He’s earned a master’s degree and improved the lives of other inmates through his art, music and theater projects.
James Brown, a lieutenant at the state prison, called Parker the “most industrious individual I have observed in my 25 years working in this environment,” according to Grafton Superior Court documents filed in advance of Parker’s hearing scheduled for Aug. 2 in North Haverhill.
In another filing, Cathy Green, Parker’s attorney, wrote that Robert Kinscherff, a forensic psychologist, had evaluated Parker for his risk for future criminal behavior and determined that “Jim scores at the very low end for risk of violent behavior and reoffending.”
But should any of that matter?
Probably not to law-and-order types. A growing number of people, however, are rethinking the country’s reliance on incarceration in the name of public safety. They point out that national crime rates have fallen sharply since the early 1990s, but the U.S. still has more than 2 million people behind bars.
“There’s good reason to think the United States could safely reduce the number of people in prison and jail by half or even more,” writes legal journalist Emily Bazelon in her new nonfiction best-seller Charged.
Bazelon, a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine and lecturer at Yale Law School, gave a public talk in Norwich last Wednesday about the “battle to end mass incarceration.” Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan joined Bazelon in the discussion, which was part of the nonprofit Vermont Humanities Council’s “1st Wednesdays” series, at the Norwich Congregational Church.
They talked a lot about the power that prosecutors wield in determining who gets charged and with what crimes, which is the focus of Bazelon’s book. They also delved into America’s tendency — an obsession, really — to put retribution ahead of rehabilitation.
“We have this myth that if you pay back your debt to society, we let you back in,” Donovan told the crowd of about 75 people. “That’s not true.”
Which brings me back to Parker, who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for the killing of Susanne Zantop. He also agreed to testify against Robert Tulloch, his Chelsea schoolmate who pleaded guilty to first-degree murder for the killing of Half Zantop. Tulloch, who was 17 at the time of the murders, is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.
Mustering support among progressive thinkers for reducing the country’s prison population is easy when dealing in the abstract. It’s about believing that people can change and that lengthy sentences are ineffective in reducing crime.
But when the conversation turns to a specific offender who has committed a brutal crime and the victims are well-respected members of their community?
It’s too close to home. People aren’t so willing to forgive or believe an offender — even when he committed his crime at 16 — has turned his life around.
After Wednesday’s event, which was hosted by the Norwich Public Library and the Norwich Historical Society, I talked with Donovan and Bazelon about Parker’s request for early release.
Discussing reducing the prison population by freeing violent offenders is “where it gets hard,” Donovan said. “People start to worry about public safety.”
Many states, including Vermont and New Hampshire, have made measurable gains in reducing their prison populations by releasing people early for drug-related offenses. (Or better yet, not incarcerating them in the first place.)
But there’s only so much “low-hanging fruit,” Bazelon said. Further reductions require getting the public (along with politicians, prosecutors and judges) to recognize that violent offenders who have completed their rehabilitation don’t need to stay locked up for decades.
When the Zantops were murdered, Saul Lelchuk was a senior at Hanover High School. After reading about Parker’s petition for early release, Lelchuck, now an author (his first novel was released in March) and Dartmouth lecturer, recently shared his viewpoint in this paper’s Forum section.
“Sentencing guidelines are in urgent need of reform,” he wrote. “There are thousands of incarcerated men and women who should not be where they are.
“James Parker is not one of them. He is already serving a far less sentence than he deserves. At the very least he should serve it to the end, without parole.”
I don’t agree with Lelchuk, but I think he’s done a valuable service. He’s pushed the discussion about whether Parker has adequately repaid his debt to society into the public square.
Since his letter was published, Lelchuck told me that he’s heard from a lot of people who were living in the Upper Valley in 2001. “Some of them strongly support the sentiment that I expressed,” he said. Others have asked him, “What good is having Parker spend seven more years in prison going to do?”
It’s a question we all should be asking.

Texto completo: Russia didn't help Donald Trump's presidential campaign. OK, it did help him, but the campaign itself wasn't involved. OK, the campaign had a lot of Russian contacts and knowingly received information from the Russians, but that was perfectly fine. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="7960">
If you've been trying to follow the Republican response to revelations about what happened in 2016, you may be a bit confused. We're not even talking about an ever-shifting party line; new excuses keep emerging, but old excuses are never abandoned. On one side, we have Rudy Giuliani saying that "there's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians." On the other side, we have Jared Kushner denying that Russia did anything beyond taking out "a couple of Facebook ads."
It's all very strange. Or, more accurately, it can seem very strange if you still think of the GOP as a normal political party, one that adopts policy positions and then defends those positions in more or less good faith.
But if you have been following Republican arguments over the years, you know that the party's response to evidence of Russian intervention in 2016 is standard operating procedure. On issue after issue, what you see are multiple levels of denial combined with a refusal ever to give up an argument no matter how completely it has been discredited.
I first encountered this style of argument a long time ago, over the issue of rising inequality. By the early 1990s, it was already obvious that growth in the United States economy was becoming ever more skewed, with huge gains for a small minority at the top but lagging incomes for the middle class and the poor. This was an awkward observation for a Republican Party that then, as now, wanted to slash taxes for the rich and dismantle the social safety net. How would conservatives respond?
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="7965">
The answer was multilayered denial. Inequality wasn't rising. OK, it was rising, but that wasn't a problem. OK, rising inequality was unfortunate, but there was nothing that could be done about it without crippling economic growth.
You might think that the right would have to choose one of those positions, or at least that once you'd managed to refute one layer of the argument, say by showing that inequality was indeed rising, you could put that argument behind you and move on to the next one. But no: Old arguments, like the wights in "Game of Thrones," would just keep rising up after you thought you had killed them.
And this is still going on. Even as you read about the superrich buying $240 million apartments and demanding ever-bigger mega-yachts, there's a whole industry of people denying that inequality has gone up.
You see the same thing on climate change. Global warming is a myth - a hoax concocted by a vast conspiracy of scientists around the world. OK, the climate is changing, but it's a natural phenomenon that has nothing to do with human activity. OK, man-made climate change is real, but we can't do anything about it without destroying the economy.
As in the case of inequality, refuted climate arguments never go away. Instead, they become intellectual zombies that should be dead but just keep shambling along. If you think Republican arguments on climate have gotten more sophisticated, wait for the next snowstorm; I guarantee you'll hear the same crude denialist arguments - the same willful confounding of climate with daily weather fluctuations - we've been hearing for decades.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="7971">
What the right's positioning on inequality, climate and now Russian election interference have in common is that in each case the people pretending to be making a serious argument are actually apparatchiks operating in bad faith.
In each case those making denialist arguments, while they may invoke evidence, don't actually care what the evidence says; at a fundamental level, they aren't interested in the truth. Their goal, instead, is to serve a predetermined agenda.
Thus, inequality denial is about using whatever argument comes to hand to defend policies that benefit the rich at the expense of working Americans. Climate denial is about using whatever argument comes to hand to defend fossil fuel interests. Russia denial is about using whatever argument comes to hand to defend Donald Trump.
All of this is or should be obvious. After all, it's a pattern that goes back decades. But my sense is that the news media continue to have a hard time coping with the essential fraudulence of most big policy debates. That is, reporting about these debates typically frames them as disputes about the facts and what they mean, when the reality is that one side isn't interested in the facts.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="7976">
I understand the pressures that often lead to false equivalence. Calling out dishonesty and bad faith can seem like partisan bias when, to put it bluntly, one side of the political spectrum lies all the time while the other side doesn't.
But pretending that good faith exists when it doesn't is unfair to readers. The public deserves to know that the big debates in modern U.S. politics aren't a conventional clash of rival ideas. They're a war in which one side's forces consist mainly of intellectual zombies.

Absorbing life of a deeply flawed diplomat

Texto completo: It seems unpromising: a massive, sprawling biography of Richard Holbrooke, whose name you may dimly remember from the Bill Clinton years and his late-life efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. A diplomat, you may vaguely recall. Big fellow, big ego. (Both indisputable.) Something about the Balkans. (And the peace he crafted in the unlikely environs of Dayton, Ohio.) Yesterday's man. (With the fading interest of yesterday.)
But by the end of the second page, maybe the third, you will be hooked. You'll come to understand that the author, New Yorker writer George Packer, understood Holbrooke, understood power, understood America in its eclipse at the end of the 20th century and into the 21st. You'll come to understand that Packer knew the great man, in fact thought he was great: great of ambition, of character, of intelligence, of intuition, of impulse, and, above all, great of flaws, including betrayal. And you'll realize that Holbrooke, who died nine years ago, was central to what was central to much of postwar American life, and that in a terrifying way his story is America's story.
There never was a diplomat-activist quite like him, and there seldom has been a book quite like this — sweeping and sentimental, beguiling and brutal, catty and critical, much like the man himself. Packer interviewed 250 people who knew Holbrooke — he was at the center of a vast Venn diagram of thinkers, lawmakers, diplomats, world leaders, rogues and charlatans. And journalist Kati Marton, his last wife, though not his last lover, gave Packer access to a trove of documents, diaries, billets-doux. She imagined Packer would use them brilliantly, and he did, but she can't have imagined the undercurrent of poignancy that runs throughout.
The driven Holbrooke achieved much, but his tragedy was that he never reached the commanding heights of American public life, never realized his dream of being secretary of state, and always was the reluctant, resistant, even rebellious hostage of some patron or other. Surely he must have contemplated Samuel Johnson's definition of a patron as “a wretch who supports with insolence, and is paid with flattery."
For this book is Holbrooke's life unexpurgated, and unsparing. Here is laid out his treachery toward friends. The shabby way he treated his first wife. The impertinent way he talked to president-elect Jimmy Carter. The way he cheated with his best friend's wife. The contempt in which he was held by Barack Obama and, by the end, almost everyone in power, except Hillary Rodham Clinton (who, like John Kerry, would've likely lifted Holbrooke up, had either moved into the Oval Office). Most of all, this book screams a lesson about the perils of substituting ambition for the true distilled idealism of youth. It is a treatise of loyalties abandoned, chances squandered, promise wasted.
But it is also a story of luck. As a young man he ensconced himself in the family of his friend David Rusk, son of Dean Rusk, Kennedy's secretary of state. He wangled himself an internship with The New York Times. There he came under the thrall of Gay Talese. He entered the Foreign Service. His first assignment, in the pungent year 1963, was a backwater called Vietnam. There he fell in with David Halberstam and Neil Sheehan, the signature reporters of that early stage of the American war. He played tennis with General (and later ambassador) Maxwell Taylor. That was his entree to Taylor's close friend, Robert F. Kennedy.
That sort of thing happened to him repeatedly. He was an opportunist, to be sure, and often an obnoxious one. Packer sketches this life with authority and perception and, it must be said, with panoramic beauty. And with some sympathy and admiration. “He was exceptional from the start," he writes, “not just because he was brilliant and curious and widely read, but because he was unafraid to face the truth, cared enough to act on it, and was willing to take the consequences."
Holbrooke, however, is not the sole focus of Packer's mastery. He also brings to vivid life the age and the men, for they are mainly men, who ran the country (and thus much of the world). Early on, for example, Packer takes on a Massachusetts mastodon, barely settled in his Saigon embassy: Henry Cabot Lodge — “who had been in the country less than a week and admitted that he barely knew Vietnam at all . . . [suggested] over lunch at the ambassador's residence that the primitive superstitions of the Vietnamese people made them hard to understand and their politics unworthy of serious respect, a plaything compared to the high level of American politics."
So what was Holbrooke's appeal? That he was a curious mix of the intelligent and the indefatigable. That he was a master of the political arts — one of which was persuasion — and also of simply, in the vernacular, sucking up. It did not hurt that he was what Packer called “polychromatic company." People liked to have lunch with him, which is a favored, valued skill in Washington. Sadly for him (despite all the sound advice he offered on Afghanistan that fell on ears made deaf by his pummeling insistence) people simply didn't like him. It turns out that matters.

Making Wall Street Pay for Foreclosure Crisis

Texto completo: Last week, as Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) convened a House Financial Services Committee hearing, featuring the CEOs of Wall Street's biggest banks, the financial watchdog group Better Markets released a stunning report on the banks' criminal records: Wall Street's Six Biggest Bailed-Out Banks: Their RAP Sheets and Their Ongoing Crime Spree.
The report profiled the records of Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. Detailing the staggering $8.2 trillion that was committed to bail out these banks when their excesses blew up the economy in 2008, the report laid out what it called their RAP sheets - the record of illegal activity for which they have been fined a cumulative total of $ 181 billion in over 350 major legal actions. The report concludes that these big banks "have engaged in - and continue to engage in - a crime spree that spans the violation of almost every law and rule imaginable.
... That was the case not just before the 2008 crash, but also during and after the crash and their lifesaving bailouts. ... In fact, the number of cases against the banks has actually increased relative to the pre-crash era."
The scope of the illegal activity is breathtaking - overcharging soldiers on their mortgages, conspiring to fix the price of credit card fees, massive improper foreclosure practices, billing customers for services never provided, rigging interest rates, violating sanctions against countries like Iran, and more. The large fines are, for these mega-banks, merely a cost of doing business. And so the crime wave continues.
The banks particularly prey on the vulnerable, regularly pleading guilty of discriminating against African Americans and Latinos. Long after the bailout, for example, JPMorgan Chase paid $53 million to settle charges that it had discriminated against minority borrowers by charging them more for a mortgage than white customers.
The banks were at the center of the housing bubble and its collapse. About 10 million people were displaced from over 4 million homes across the country. Minority neighborhoods were hit the hardest.
For decades, the banks red-lined minority areas, depriving residents of access to mortgages or loans for small business development. Then, when the banks inflated the housing bubble, they targeted minority neighborhoods, peddling predatory mortgages to customers who they knew could not afford them. As one former Wells Fargo mortgage broker explained in a sworn affidavit, "The company put 'bounties' on minority borrowers. By this I mean that loan officers received cash incentives to aggressively market subprime loans in minority communities."
At the height of the rapacious lending boom, nearly 50 percent of all loans given to African American families were deemed "subprime." The New York Times described these contracts as "a financial time bomb."
When housing prices cratered, the bomb exploded. Mass evictions left entire neighborhoods scarred by empty houses. The banks then failed their legal duty to keep the homes up, with neighborhoods turning into waste pits. With homeowners evicted, local revenues declined. Stores were shuttered; schools closed; local services decimated.
Those victimized were most often those who did the right thing: working steadily, putting together the money for a down payment on a home for their children. A rising African-American middle class was eviscerated. In 2012, the National Fair Housing Alliance reported that African Americans suffered "the largest loss of wealth for these communities in modern history." Between 2009 and 2012, African Americans lost just under $200 billion in wealth, bringing the gap between white and black wealth to a staggering 20:1 ratio.
According to the Better Markets report, the six biggest banks have paid over $181 billion in fines and settlements for their criminal activity. This money generally goes back into the general fund, unless the settlement agreement provides for some relief to those injured.
That too often leaves those most injured by the illegal practices out in the cold. What would make sense is that any fines that aren't used to recompense the direct victims be put into a fund to rebuild the communities most injured. Supplement that with revenues from sensible taxes on the banks - like Elizabeth Warren's call for a simple corporate tax on the profits they report - and a multibillion-dollar fund could be created to help repair the communities most impacted by the bankers' crimes. Use that money not to line the pockets of the big banks again, but to seed community banks and cooperatives, to support nonprofit affordable housing development, to create postal banking services that could liberate the poor from the usurious charges of payday lenders.
That might not end Wall Street's addiction to crime, but it would help repair the communities that they have devastated. One would think that law-and-order conservatives might support this act of simple justice.

Texto completo: In the early 1960s, when newly famous Bob Dylan needed to escape New York City — where constant fan attention was becoming a drag — he moved upstate and into the guest quarters of his manager's vacation home in Woodstock, an artsy village on the edge of the Catskill mountains. There he rode (and famously crashed) his motorcycle along winding roads and lounged around Café Espresso on Tinker Street, the town's main thoroughfare. “Soon Dylan was spending so much time at the Espresso — drinking coffee, playing chess, reading The New York Times — that the [owners] asked if he wanted to work in the room above it," music journalist Barney Hoskyns writes in his book Small Town Talk, which explores the village's musical pedigree. The typewriter-equipped upstairs bedroom became Dylan's hideaway — and a favorite writing spot.
I'm standing on the balcony outside my room at the recently opened Woodstock Way Hotel (845-684-5911, woodstockway.com), gazing the 100 yards toward the rear windows of Dylan's old haunt, which is now the Center for Photography, an arts nonprofit. The boutique hotel, which opened last fall, celebrates this region's musical legacy. Photos in the lobby recall the 1969 Woodstock concert festival (which, due to zoning disputes, actually took place 60 miles from here). All rooms feature coffee-table books commemorating the concert, plush bathrobes, CBD-infused drinks in the minibar, and an outdoor firepit overlooking a small waterfall. Our room is also equipped with Bluetooth turntables and Bose speakers and a small collection of vinyl that includes The Monkees, Wings, Steve Martin, and Blues Traveler. The hotel is a two-minute walk from the heart of the village and proves an ideal spot for my wife and me to spend our anniversary weekend.
It's our first time here, but I've been hearing about Woodstock for years. In the 1990s, when I worked at a magazine in New York, several high-ranking editors had summer places here, in keeping with the cultural stereotype: Wall Streeters head east to the Hamptons, creatives head north to the Catskills. Although The New York Times recently reported that this region is seeing a rise in multimillion-dollar properties, we see little evidence of this glitzification. Instead, we observe ramshackle rural homes, art galleries, and a noticeable lack of trendy chains (not a Starbucks or a SoulCycle in sight). Despite too many souvenir stores hawking '60s-era memorabilia, Woodstock remains noticeably chill even as the 50th anniversary of the famed concert approaches this August.
We begin our first morning by heading 3 miles out of town to the Karma Triyana Dharmachakra (845-679-5906, kagyu.org), one of the largest Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the United States. Each day it opens its doors to the public at 6 a.m., and by 8:30 a.m., we find ourselves perched on round, firm pillows inside the main temple as a volunteer taps a resting bell and begins chanting. She repeats the lines three times in Tibetan, then once in English. (“From the stormy waves of birth, old age, sickness, and death / from the ocean of samsara, may I free all beings.") For the next 25 minutes, my wife and I, along with two others, sit in silence, meditating. After a five-minute break to stretch and chat, a new volunteer solemnly announces, “sitting meditation" and rings the bell, and we sit in silence some more. Driving back toward town afterward, hips sore from an hour on the pillows, we notice how many houses are adorned with fluttering multicolored prayer flags, a sign that the counterculture spirit of the '60s is alive and well.
But humans require more than spiritual sustenance, and on that front there's good news: Woodstock knows how to cook. For breakfast, start at The Mud Club (themudclub.com), which opens at 7 a.m. and offers bagels cooked in a wood-fired oven, or try the all-vegetarian (and mostly vegan) fare at the Garden Cafe (845-679-3600; thegardencafewoodstock.com), which also offers brunch-appropriate cocktails. For lunch, stop by Tinker Taco Lab (845-679-8226, facebook.com/tinkertacolab), which goes beyond the basics to offer more unusual items such as beef tongue tacos, fried avocado tacos, and yam tamales. For snacks, go to Nancy's (845-684-5329, nancysartisanal.com) for artisanal ice cream, or Peace, Love and Cupcakes (845-247-3687, woodstockcupcakes.com), whose treats are named after musicians who played the 1969 festival.
At dinner, fancier options abound. Cucina (845-679-9800, cucinawoodstock.com) offers contemporary Italian fare in a rambling yellow farmhouse just east of downtown. Forgoing the long communal table, we take a two-top near a front window, from which we imagine dining al fresco on the wide porch on a warmer, drier summer night. The food — bruschetta with prosciutto, fig spread, and burrata, followed by orecchiette with lobster, roasted tomato, and jalapeño — is imaginative and hearty. If we lived nearby, we'd eat here often.
For Saturday night dining, locals suggest upscale Silvia in the heart of downtown (but it's fully booked), Miss Lucy's Kitchen in Saugerties (a 10-mile drive), or The Red Onion (3 miles from downtown). We prefer to stay within walking distance of our hotel, so we type “vegetarian" into the Yelp search field and take a chance on Woodstock Pizza Theater (845-679-2700, woodstockpizzatheater.com), on the western edge of downtown. Although less renowned than Cucina and Silvia, the Pizza Theater proves a fine option for a more casual, less expensive meal. The menu is peppered with vegan and “vegetarian option available" items, including many with house-made meat alternatives that use tempeh or seitan. Its pizza, with a slightly salty, spongy-light crust, proves impossible to stop eating; a tuna, shrimp, and chicken taco special arrives with a homemade coconut-cilantro sauce I'd spoon over anything. As we linger at the bar watching a ballgame, the chef joins us to chat.
There's no shortage of live music options on many evenings in Woodstock. During our weekend stay, we're uninterested in the folk singer playing at The Colony, a renovated concert hall that offers ticketed shows, and Levon Helm Studios, the venue created by the drummer from The Band who was a long-time Woodstock resident before his 2012 death, is closed this spring weekend. We grab a drink amid a mostly local crowd at Station Bar & Curio (845-810-0203, stationbarandcurio.com) as a band sets up its gear on the outdoor stage. We consider staying for the show but grow impatient and leave after the bartender's playlist cycles through Jimi Hendrix's “Foxey Lady" twice in 20 minutes. (If you go out at night in Woodstock, be prepared to hear a lot of music from the 1960s.)
More contemporary songs emanate from the speakers at A&P Bar (845-684-5395, aandpbar.com), a two-year-old establishment tucked in the rear of what was once Woodstock's primary supermarket. These days the tall shelves of bottles highlight A&P's status as the region's cocktail mecca. At 9 p.m. on a Saturday in July, this area would be jammed with patrons — but tonight there's just a handful of people finishing meals or enjoying a nightcap. Bartender Carl Bester prepares one of his signature drinks, the Dawa: apple vodka, lime, mandarin orange, and sugar, which is served with a thick wooden muddler coated in whipped honey. “It's a different drink with every sip," Bester says, explaining how the gooey honey slowly melts into the drink. He's right: It starts out astringent and vodka-dominant, but by the last sip, the honey's sweetness has mellowed and balanced everything out.
As we drink and talk, Bester pours, stirs, sniffs, and tastes. He's experimenting. He takes a sip from a new drink and passes me the glass. It's the same cocktail I'm drinking, but he's replaced the apple vodka with a curried vodka. To me it tastes like a boozy Thanksgiving side dish, but Bester raves about its complexity, passing the glass to waitstaff and fellow patrons. Next he takes a Mason jar from a high shelf and mixes a new version, this one containing a homemade chili concoction. He sips and grimaces. “Wow. Serious heat." I sip, immediately regretting it. “TOO HOT," cries the waitress after her try. Becker tastes again. “I'm going to feel this tomorrow," he says.
When the weather cooperates, Woodstock is best experienced outdoors: the nearby Catskills offer spectacular hiking. The area's best-known route goes 2.4 miles up Overlook Mountain. Partway up lie the remains of an abandoned 1920s hotel; at the top of the 3,150-foot peak is a fire tower offering Instagram-worthy views. It rained at the start of our weekend, but late one afternoon, as things begin drying out, we drive up the curvy mountain road to the trail.
This turns out to be a popular idea: The parking lot is jammed, so we follow signs to a satellite lot that adds an extra mile of walking (each way) just to get to the trailhead. We start off enthusiastically. Our energy ebbs slightly as the trail (and our pants and shoes) become muddy. Although the trail's website describes it as a “gradual but nonstop incline" that rises 1,370 feet, it feels far steeper than that. The mud makes it slippery and slow going. Winded, I stop for a break.
It's now 4 p.m., we're only halfway up, and most of the other hikers we encounter are on their way down. In theory we have at least two hours until sundown, but this is starting to feel like one of those Everest disaster movies in which the protagonists' irrational pursuit of the peak leaves them in the “death zone" as temperatures drop and daylight wanes. I suggest we turn around.
My wife ponders our options. “If we bail, are you going to say it was because of safety, or because you're out of shape?" she asks.
“Definitely safety," I say between breaths.
Tired and back in our hotel room, we put a record on the turntable and pull out our phones, Googling to see who can find the best photo from the top of the mountain we failed to climb. The views remind us of the lyric from The Who: “I can see for miles and miles" — and provide yet another reminder of why Dylan and so many others found this area so special. Next time, with better weather and an earlier start, we plan to see that vista for ourselves.

BY THE TIME WE GOT TO BETHEL Travel writers are supposed to know the ins and outs — to show you the way. Sometimes, however, they provide a cautionary tale. This is one of those times.
Imagine you're visiting Woodstock. You like music and history, so of course you want to visit the site of the 1969 music festival. You know the concert actually took place miles away in Bethel, now site of the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts (845-583-2079, bethelwoodscenter.org), which contains a Woodstock museum. But it's a nice day for a drive. Why not tuck a trip to Bethel into your weekend in Woodstock?
Bad move. The 60-mile drive, on rural roads with village speed limits routinely dipping down to 30 miles per hour, takes longer than you'd expect. (Figure at least 90 minutes.) And because Bethel is southwest of Woodstock, if you're heading back to Boston after your museum diversion, you've just added 50 miles to the drive home. (Figure on four hours back to Boston.)
The museum is hosting a special exhibition celebrating the 50th anniversary of the concert, featuring memorabilia, photography, and films. Many of the docents leading tours attended the concert themselves. Together, the exhibits do a fine job of explaining how 400,000 people flocked to nearby fields for “3 Days of Peace and Music" — and places the event in context against the backdrop of the Vietnam War and the social unrest of the 1960s. The surrounding fields, once Max Yasgur's dairy farm, are open to the public during the summer.
So if you're especially interested in '60s history and culture, by all means plan a visit, and consider seeing a show while you're there: Dave Matthews, Jackson Browne, Elvis Costello, and Sheryl Crow are all playing the grounds at Bethel Woods this summer.
But unless you enjoy long road trips, don't try to experience Woodstock-the-concert and Woodstock-the-village in the same weekend. Make separate trips.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
First, the Syracuse man repeatedly called a senator's office in Washington and said he planned to kill former President Barack Obama, using a racial slur in his threat, the authorities said.
A year later, the same man, Stephen J. Taubert, called the California office of Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat, and vowed to kill her and her staff members. Once again, he spouted violent rhetoric over the phone, using racist epithets.
On Tuesday, Mr. Taubert, 61, was sentenced to 46 months in prison for the phone calls.
His sentence was handed down in the Federal District Court in Syracuse. It came six weeks after a jury found Mr. Taubert guilty of threatening to kill a former United States president, transmitting a threat in interstate commerce and making a threat to influence, impede or retaliate against a federal official.
The jury also found that Mr. Taubert chose to make threats against Mr. Obama and Ms. Waters, two black Democratic Party leaders, because of their race, a distinction that allowed prosecutors to seek an enhanced sentence.
"Racist threats to kill present and former public officials are not protected free speech, but serious crimes," Grant C. Jaquith, the United States attorney for the Northern District of New York, said in a statement on Tuesday.
Mr. Taubert's lawyer, Courtenay K. McKeon, declined to comment. But in court on Tuesday, she and Mr. Taubert both said that he was mentally ill and deserved a more lenient sentence, according to The Syracuse Post-Standard.
Mr. Taubert blamed social media and his conservative politics in part for his behavior, the newspaper's website reported. Mr. Taubert, who said in court that he once served in the United States Air Force, worked as a janitor at a variety of offices, including some government employers, until 2011, when he had a stroke and had to stop working, according to court papers.
"Probably the worst thing for me is social media," Mr. Taubert said during the sentencing hearing, the Post-Standard reported. "I should stay off of it. When I hear all these people knocking the president, it upsets me."
Mr. Taubert threatened Ms. Waters and her staff members last July, when the congresswoman was in a high-profile verbal feud with the Trump administration.
The previous month, White House officials had been heckled at restaurants by protesters opposed to the administration's "zero tolerance" immigration policy that separated children from their families.
At a rally, Ms. Waters, a frequent critic of the White House, commended the protesters and encouraged her supporters to take similar actions. She specifically told them to "show up" wherever they had to, "create a crowd" and "push back."
Some conservatives took issue with her comments, arguing that "push back" had a physical connotation that was tantamount to inciting assault.
Two days after Ms. Waters's remarks, President Trump joined in the criticism, writing on Twitter that the California congresswoman had called for "harm" to his supporters. Then he warned her to "be careful what you wish for."
Roughly a month after Mr. Trump's tweet, Mr. Taubert called Ms. Waters's office in Los Angeles. Using pejorative slurs for women and African-Americans, he said that he planned to attend all of Ms. Waters's public events and vowed to kill her and her staff, prosecutors said.
When asked about that call by police officers, Mr. Taubert repeated his racial slur against her, according to court papers. He also called Ms. Waters "low I.Q.", a comment that mirrored the language of Mr. Trump's tweet.
The call to Ms. Waters's office came 13 months after Mr. Taubert made multiple calls to the Washington office of Al Franken, then a Democratic senator from Minnesota. In two of those calls, Mr. Taubert said he was planning to go to Washington the next day to "hang" Mr. Obama at his home.
Prosecutors said that Mr. Taubert had a history of threatening phone calls dating back to 2013, when he said he was going to burn down the N.A.A.C.P.'s building in Baltimore.
In letters of support filed with the court and provided to The New York Times, Mr. Taubert's family and friends said he had apologized several times for the calls. They portrayed him as a man who exercised poor judgment but who had no intention of following through on his threats.
But Judge Glenn T. Suddaby cited Mr. Taubert's history of menacing phone calls as he handed down the sentence.
"They claim he'd never hurt anybody," Mr. Suddaby said in court, The Post-Standard reported. "Mr. Taubert, you've repeatedly hurt people with your words."
Mr. Taubert was ordered to pay a $ 1,000 fine, and will face three years of supervised release after completing his prison term.
A representative for Mr. Obama declined to comment. Representatives for Ms. Waters did not immediately respond to requests for comment, though in March, after Mr. Taubert was found guilty, Ms. Waters said in a statement that she was pleased by the conviction.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Times adds safeguards after offensive cartoon

Texto completo: The fallout from the New York Times's publication of an anti-Semitic cartoon continued on Wednesday, with the news organization's publisher issuing steps designed to prevent a repeat of the incident.
Publisher A.G. Sulzberger said in a staff memo that the Times will stop publishing cartoons produced by nonstaff members and will take unspecified "disciplinary steps" against the editor who selected the cartoon that enraged many readers.
The Times's global edition, which circulates outside the United States, published the cartoon on Thursday. It depicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a guide dog with a Star of David dangling from his collar as he leads an apparently blind President Trump, wearing a yarmulke, around by a leash.
The image brought widespread condemnation, including from President Trump, for echoing Nazi and white supremacist propaganda about Jews.
The Times tweeted an explanatory editor's note about it on Saturday, and then a full apology on Sunday.
Sulzberger, whose family has owned the Times for generations, called the image "offensive and inconsistent with our values" in his staff memo Wednesday.
The Times said an unnamed editor in Hong Kong made the decision to publish the cartoon, which was created by a Portuguese artist, António Moreira Antunes, and first published by Expresso, a newspaper in Lisbon. It was distributed by syndication service called CartoonArts International.
Antunes has said he intended his cartoon to be critical of U.S. and Israeli policy, and was not intended as an attack on Jews or Judaism.
Sulzberger outlined steps to address the incident, including changing the editing process "to ensure adequate oversight" of the international opinion page; banning all syndicated cartoons from the Times; canceling its contract with the syndication service; disciplining the editor involved; and updating employee "unconscious bias" training to focus on anti-Semitism.
"Though I've been assured there was no malice involved in this mistake, we fell far short of our standards and values in this case," he wrote, adding, "We have tried to approach this mistake transparently and to use it as an opportunity to improve."
He quoted a line from a Times's editorial that criticized the publication of the cartoon and decried the rise in anti-Semitism: "Apologies are important, but the deeper obligation of The Times is to focus on leading through unblinking journalism and the clear editorial expression of its values."

From Trump Tower to WikiLeaks, the Mueller report offers window into Trump campaign, presidency

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Special counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of collusion between the Russians and Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, but the 448-page report outlining the results of his nearly two-year investigation is chock full of interesting tidbits.
The Mueller report, which Attorney General William Barr made public on Tuesday, offers enticing behind-the-scenes details about some of the more notable events of Trump’s campaign and the early days of his presidency.
It was a joke, people!
At a news conference in July 2016, Trump encouraged Russia to hack into Democratic rival Hillary Clinton’s personal emails. "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” he said.
But Trump told Mueller he was joking. Trump said he made the statement “in jest and sarcastically” and said it should have been apparent to “any objective observer. ”
Trump also told the special counsel that he had not been informed during the campaign of any efforts by Russia to infiltrate or hack Clinton’s emails.
But it turns out the Russians were listening.
Within about five hours of Trump's request, Russian military intelligence agents "targeted Clinton's personal office for the first time" and "sent malicious links targeting 15 email accounts," including one belonging to a Clinton aide whose name was redacted, according to the report.

Trump Tower meeting
A now-famous meeting between three senior members of Trump’s presidential campaign and a small group of Russians at Trump Tower in June 2016 fueled suspicions the Russians meddled in the presidential election.
Yet some key questions have remained unanswered: What did Trump know about the meeting? And when did he know it?
Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. , agreed to the meeting after Hollywood publicist Rob Goldstone sent him an attention-grabbing email claiming that “the Crown Prosecutor of Russia” had information to share that would incriminate Clinton “and her dealings with Russia. ”
“If it’s what you say, I love it,” Trump Jr. wrote back immediately.
But the meeting was a bust: The Russian lawyer offered just vague remarks about Russian fund-raising for Democrats and, after a few minutes, switched gears and started talking about U. S. -Russian adoption policies.
So what did Trump know? Not much, he says.
Trump told the special counsel’s office in writing that he had “no recollection” of learning about the meeting in advance. Nor did he recall knowing during the campaign that the meeting had taken place or that Trump Jr. had been in contact with Goldstone or the Russian pop star who's outreach to Goldstone was the impetus for the gathering.
Trump said he didn't even recall where he was that day, although he conceded that his calendar put him in New York City.

'It said too much'
Trump may not have known about the Trump Tower meeting in advance, but he eventually did find out about it and try to put his spin on what happened.
The Mueller report confirms news accounts that Trump personally dictated a misleading statement about what went on in the meeting.
On July 7, 2017, about six months into his presidency, Trump was in Hamburg, Germany, for the G-20 summit when his aides learned The New York Times was working on an article about the meeting.
The next day, on the flight home, Trump's communications director Hope Hicks gave the president a draft statement that was to be released by Trump Jr. , which acknowledged the meeting came about because of the possibility the Russians might have information valuable to the Trump’s campaign.
The president, however, "directed that the statement not be issued because it said too much,” the Mueller report says. “The president told Hicks to say only that Trump Jr. took a brief meeting and it was about Russian adoption. ”
The final statement issued to the Times described the meeting as “a short introductory meeting” and said the participants “primarily” discussed the adoption of Russian children. It made no mention that the presidential campaign had been discussed or that the Russians had managed to get the meeting by offering to divulge dirt on Clinton.

Comey and 'what really happened'
Two days after he fired FBI director James Comey, Trump gave an interview to NBC in which he contradicted his previous statements and those of his staff on the reasons for Comey’s dismissal.
The day of the firing, the White House claimed that Comey’s termination resulted from the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy over Comey’s mishandling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails.
But Trump had in fact decided to fire Comey before hearing from the Department of Justice, the Mueller report confirms.
Not happy with how his aides were spinning the story, Trump decided to give an interview to NBC’s Lester Holt, telling the White House counsel’s office in advance that “the communications team could not get the story right” and that he was going to tell Holt “what really happened,” according to the Mueller report.
Trump told Holt he decided to fire Comey in part because “this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. ”

After it released a trove of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in 2016, WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange tried to place the blame on Seth Rich, a young DNC staffer who had been murdered just a few weeks earlier.
Rich, 27, was shot to death July 10, 2016, in what Washington, D. C. police say was a random robbery attempt. But conspiracy theorists have tried to tie him to the release of thousands of DNC emails that hobbled Hillary Clinton's campaign for president.
Assange and WikiLeaks made a number of statements that falsely implied Rich had been the source of the stolen emails, according to the Mueller report. WikiLeaks even offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich’s killer.
Asked in an interview why he was so interested in finding Rich’s killer, Assange said, “We’re very interested in anything that might be a threat to alleged WikiLeaks sources. ”
But the Mueller report outlines what it says was an elaborate effort by the Russians to obtain the emails and says that the special counsel’s investigation discredited WikiLeaks' claims regarding the source of the stolen materials.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submitted his resignation Monday after a two-year run defined by his appointment of a special counsel to investigate connections between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia.
His last day will be May 11, ending a tumultuous relationship with Trump and a tenure that involved some of the most consequential, even chaotic, moments of the president’s administration.
When Trump wanted to fire then-FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing the Russia probe, Rosenstein wrote the memo that the White House used to justify the dismissal. But eight days later, Rosenstein took a step that Trump feared would end his presidency: appointing Robert Mueller as special counsel. The move made Rosenstein the frequent target of Republican wrath and angry Trump tweets and left him repeatedly appearing on the verge of being fired.
Yet in the end, he was largely in Trump’s corner.
He joined Attorney General William Barr in determining that Trump had not obstructed the Mueller investigation — reaching a conclusion that Mueller himself pointedly did not make. He defended Barr against criticism that he was spinning Mueller’s findings in the president’s favor and stood silently behind him as Barr praised Trump’s cooperation at a news conference before a redacted version of the report was released.
In his resignation letter to Trump, Rosenstein paid tribute to the Justice Department’s accomplishments and to Trump himself, even praising the sense of humor of a man who once retweeted an image that showed Rosenstein and other officials jailed for treason.
“I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity, because ‘a nation exists to serve its citizens,’” Rosenstein wrote to Trump.
Rosenstein’s departure had been expected following the confirmation of William Barr as attorney general. The White House nominated a replacement for the No. 2 slot, Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Rosen, weeks ago.
In his resignation letter, Rosenstein said most deputies stay in their post for about 16 months; Rosenstein will have served about two years.
Rosenstein intended to leave around mid-March but stayed on for the completion of Mueller’s investigation. His exit will leave the department without the Justice Department leader most closely aligned with the probe as officials grapple with continued public and congressional scrutiny of the special counsel’s findings and the department’s handling of the report.
Rosenstein was part of a small group of department officials who reviewed the document and helped shape its public release after Mueller submitted the document last month.
Integral to the start of the probe, Rosenstein was also present for the very end. After Mueller didn’t reach a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed the investigation, Barr and the deputy stepped in and determined the evidence wasn’t enough to support such an allegation.
The deputy attorney general position is a hugely significant job, responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the Justice Department and the work of United States attorneys across the country. But it’s largely an anonymous, behind-the-scenes position. Rosenstein even joked about telling one of his daughters not to expect to see his picture in the newspapers.
That wasn’t the case, though, for Rosenstein, who was thrust into Justice Department drama even before his arrival on the job because of Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ earlier recusal from the Russia probe.
Rosenstein’s May 2017 memo criticizing Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation laid the groundwork for the FBI chief’s firing, though Rosenstein privately made clear that he was unhappy that the White House was publicly characterizing the move as his idea instead of Trump’s, according to Mueller’s report.
Trump later said he would have fired Comey even without the Justice Department’s recommendation and said he was thinking of “this Russia thing.”
Rosenstein appointed Mueller one week later, supervising his work and defending the investigation against attacks from congressional Republicans and Trump, who repeatedly blasted the probe as a “witch hunt.”
Over the next two years, with Sessions recused from the Russia investigation because of his work on the Trump campaign, Rosenstein set the boundaries of Mueller’s investigation, approved investigative steps and, in place of the rarely seen special counsel, twice announced criminal indictments from the Justice Department podium against Russians accused of election interference.
The investigation overshadowed the rest of Rosenstein’s work even as he promoted the president’s agenda, including announcements on combating violent crime and opioid addiction.
“The Department of Justice made rapid progress in achieving the Administration’s law enforcement priorities — reducing violent crime, curtailing opioid abuse, protecting consumers, improving immigration enforcement, and building confidence in the police — while preserving national security and strengthening federal efforts in other areas,” Rosenstein wrote in his resignation letter.
Though Rosenstein’s exit was orderly, and he endured in the job well beyond Sessions, his relationship with the president waffled over time and often appeared in the balance.
That was especially true last September after The New York Times reported that he had discussed secretly recording Trump and invoking a constitutional amendment to remove him from office.
The Justice Department issued statements challenging the reporting, but former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe — who was in the room — has said he got the sense that Rosenstein was “counting votes” about which Cabinet members he could enlist in the effort.
Rosenstein arrived at the White House days after the reporting expecting to be fired, but he was instead allowed to stay on after private conversations with Trump’s then-chief of staff, John Kelly, and the president himself.
In the summer of 2017, with Mueller new in his job, Trump tweeted: “I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt.”
The president lashed out the following April after the FBI raided the office of his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and months later retweeted the image that showed Rosenstein, Comey and other investigators behind bars.
In his resignation letter, Rosenstein may have made an oblique reference to those chaotic moments and the media attention surrounding them.
“We enforce the law without fear or favor because credible evidence is not partisan, and truth is not determined by opinion polls,” Rosenstein wrote. “We ignore fleeting distractions and focus on the things that matter, because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle.”

Texto completo: It's a sentence you probably thought you'd never read: Rock icon Sting is playing in Taos.
Touring with his new album of reinterpreted Police and solo classics, My Songs, Sting will perform at Taos' Kit Carson Park on Sept. 2 at the tail end of Labor Day weekend. The tour "Sting: My Songs" begins in Paris in late May.
Tickets for the Taos show go on sale at taos.org/sting at 10 a.m. Friday. They run at $82 online and $92 at the gate. The park will accommodate about 8,000, said Jamie Lenfestey, director of Santa Fe operations for producer/promoter AMP Concerts.
"We are working with the town of Taos to promote their park venue and the town as a concert destination," Lenfestey said. "Our goal is to eventually create a scene akin to what Telluride has developed there. So attracting artists like Sting is a step in that direction."
With a high-profile career spanning four decades, Sting is certainly a familiar and lauded name -- 18-time Grammy winner, a five-time Emmy winner, an Oscar nominee and, since 2003, a member of the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame for his time with the Police. The artist reportedly has sold close to 100 million albums, including those produced by the Police and in his solo career, which he began in 1985 with The Dream of the Blue Turtles.
My Songs, which goes on sale May 23, features tunes written by the 67-year-oldBritish singer, including "Walking on the Moon, "Every Breath You Take" and a live version of "Roxanne."
"Some of them reconstructed, some of them refitted, some of them reframed," he wrote on his website. "But all of them with a contemporary focus."
The most important element in music is surprise, Sting told the New York Times in 2016. "When I listen to music, I want to be surprised. When I compose music, I want to lay a surprise within a certain number of bars. And then, when I choose to do the music I want to present to the public, again, I want to surprise them."

Texto completo: Maddie Moravek, a Woodlands Academy of the Sacred Heart sophomore from Libertyville, is a big fan of Jean Kwok’s work. Thanks to support from Ragdale Center for the Arts and a Lake Forest resident’s donation, Maddie was able to enjoy an informal lunch with the best-selling author April 25 as part of a select group of fellow students sharing a strong interest in writing. She described the experience as truly inspiring.
"I’ve always liked writing, so it was great to hear from someone who has actually made it a career," Maddie said. "I’m so grateful to have had this opportunity to meet with and learn from such a successful author. It was amazing all around and truly a highlight of the school year for me."
Kwok, the New York Times and international best-selling author of novels that include "Girl in Translation" and "Mambo in Chinatown," also gave a formal presentation focusing on her life story and the craft of writing to Woodlands Academy 8th period English classes. She then answered questions from students at the all-girls college-preparatory day-and-boarding high school in Lake Forest.
The students were fascinated by Kwok’s dynamic storytelling as well as her description of the real-life events that inspired aspects of her novels, according to Woodlands Academy English teacher Jennifer Brostrom.
"The opportunity to learn first-hand from an award-winning author was immensely motivating," Brostrom said. "Jean Kwok’s message for our Woodlands students was to embrace their own unique potential, to reject limitations, and to recognize that failure is an inevitable experience on the road to success."
Kwok immigrated to Brooklyn from Hong Kong when she was 5 years old and worked in a Chinatown clothing factory for much of her childhood. Her literary work has been published in 18 countries and taught in universities, colleges and high schools across the world. Kwok has been selected for many honors including the American Library Association Alex Award, the Chinese American Librarians Association Best Book Award and the Sunday Times EFG Short Story Award international shortlist. She currently resides in the Netherlands with her husband, two sons and four cats.
In addition to her recent appearance at Woodlands Academy, Kwok has spoken at many schools and venues including Harvard University, Columbia University and the Tucson Festival of Books.
Financial support from Molly Sarver, parent of a Woodlands Academy sophomore, in collaboration with Ragdale’s A Novel Affair program, made the April 25 event at Woodlands possible.
### Founded in 1858, Woodlands Academy is an independent Catholic college preparatory day and boarding high school for young women. It’s part of a worldwide network of Sacred Heart Schools that spans the United States and 40 other countries. A nonprofit, Woodlands Academy’s identity is rooted in Saint Madeleine Sophie Barat’s desire to inspire young hearts and minds to excel, to lead lives of integrity and to serve.

Texto completo: Sure, I think Savannah is an exceptional place, but that doesn't mean that we need to craft new policies from scratch all the time.
Many other cities have been experimenting with affordable housing policies for decades, so we should be able to learn much from their successes and failures.
We also need to understand that demographic pressures in Savannah mirror the pressures in other cities.
To put it simply, neighborhoods in downtown areas across the nation are seeing an influx of new residents, largely white ones, who can spend more on housing than the long-time residents, many of whom are African-American.
At the same time, predominantly white neighborhoods in outlying areas are becoming more racially diverse.
For a variety of reasons, I think that Savannah will be a stronger city through the rest of this century if we implement policies to increase population density and to maintain racial and economic diversity in the historic neighborhoods of the city.
But our recent modest efforts to boost downtown residential density fall short of these goals.
A new analysis by the New York Times - "The Neighborhood Is Mostly Black. The Home Buyers Are Mostly White." - details how the trends are playing out in individual Census tracts around the country.
Consider the Census tract where I live, which is bounded by Price Street, 34th Street, Park Avenue and Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard.
Majority African-American for decades, the tract was 53 percent white in 2012 and could now be 60 percent white. About 90 percent of home loans in the tract are going to white buyers, according to the Times' analysis.
In the African-American majority Census tract bordered generally by Price, 34th, Paulsen and Bolton streets, white buyers account for about 80 percent of home loans and have average incomes more than twice as high as existing residents.
We are seeing similar changes in Census tracts north of West Gwinnett Street in West Savannah, north of East President Street, in the Waters Avenue corridor north of Victory Drive and in the Montgomery Street corridor between Park Avenue and 60th Street.
I do think the word "gentrification" is broadly applicable here, but the word itself does not capture the nuances of the changes that we are seeing on the ground.
With our low population density in much of the downtown area, we have the opportunity to build stronger neighborhoods by welcoming new residents of all income levels.
But with each passing year, the trends will become more difficult to address.

Texto completo: Insurgent Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, visited Harlem on Monday to discuss issues facing black Americans and spoke also about being another type of "other": an openly gay man.
"I don't believe it makes me any better or worse at my job," Buttigieg told reporters. "I do believe that anybody who has had some experience of being viewed as 'an other' might be able to draw on that experience to help them make sure that they tackle other patterns of exclusion."
Buttigieg, 37, dined with the Rev. Al Sharpton at soul food restaurant Sylvia's, long a favorite gathering place for New York's political figures.
The mayor has surged recently in national polls. He has moved from being virtually unknown to competing with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) for third place - albeit a distant third - behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
Buttigieg, a Navy veteran who served in Afghanistan, a Harvard University graduate and a Rhodes scholar, was cheered on by fans outside the lunch, some shouting, "Welcome to Harlem!"
Sharpton said he and Buttigieg talked "frankly" about Buttigieg's leadership of South Bend. Buttigieg has faced scrutiny over his 2012 dismissal of South Bend's first black police chief, who was alleged to have taped the phone calls of white officers believed to have used racist language. According to The New York Times, Buttigieg said then that he had lost faith in the chief upon learning that the FBI was investigating the secret taping of calls.
Buttigieg said he and Sharpton, a civil rights leader and former Democratic presidential candidate himself, spoke about the mayor's agenda for closing the racial economic gap by focusing "on home ownership, entrepreneurship, health, education and criminal justice reform - in the context of making sure our democracy is accessible to everyone."
Buttigieg is to return next week to the early-primary state of South Carolina, where black voters make up the majority of the Democratic primary electorate.
Jonathan Smith, 54, Washington Heights, who wore a T-shirt that read "Pete 2020," stopped by Sylvia's to show his support.
"We need to turn a page, we need to turn a chapter, we need a new book," Smith said. "And I think he represents that possibility to just forget the infighting and partisan bickering ... Let's move forward in a new directi

Texto completo: PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France met the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia in Berlin on Monday, reaching toward a large prize: a path to a peace settlement between the two Balkan nations, almost 20 years after a war between them came to an end.
But if they are to have any hope of easing tensions between Kosovo and Serbia, and breaking a deadlock in talks on the normalization of relations, then analysts say they may first have to broker another peace, between Kosovo's two leaders.
President Hashim Thaci of Kosovo and his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic, suggested at a meeting in Austria in August that a final settlement could include an exchange of territory and border changes.
Mr. Thaci believes that "such an agreement would result in Serbia's recognition of Kosovo." That would unlock a lot of potential gains: Though Kosovo formally declared independence in 2008, after NATO wrested it from Serbia's control in a 1999 air campaign, Serbia has so far blocked it from joining the United Nations and other international bodies, and scores of other countries still decline to recognize it. A settlement might also remove a barrier to Serbia one day becoming a member of the European Union.
But Kosovo's prime minister, Ramush Haradinaj, is adamantly opposed to any territorial concessions. He has described the idea as "a shortcut to tragedy." And his stand has proved a potent weapon in his long rivalry with Mr. Thaci.
The proposals are profoundly unpopular both with Serbs -- most of whom continue to consider Kosovo a part of Serbia, one that holds a foundational place in its national story -- and with Kosovars, who regard what is under discussion as a partition of their young country along ethnic lines.
In Kosovo, Mr. Thaci's popularity has plummeted. He is denounced in graffiti across the capital, Pristina, as linked to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
"Kosovo is not Crimea," read one phrase in English.
Mr. Haradinaj has capitalized on resentment of what is sometimes seen as the president's warm relationship with Serbia by moving in a direction that many say strengthens Kosovo's statehood. In December, the Parliament overwhelmingly approved legislation to form an army, prompting criticism from NATO, which has been keeping a tense peace in the area.
A few days later, Mr. Haradinaj's government imposed 100 percent tariffs on Serbian exports to Kosovo in retaliation for Belgrade's sabotage of the accession of Kosovo to international institutions such as Interpol and Unesco. Both decisions were among the most popular by any government in Pristina in a decade of independence.
In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Thaci dismissed a suggestion of a power struggle with Mr. Haradinaj, the prime minister. He said the two men had been "comrades" in the independence struggle, and "now we are friends."
But they do have differences, he acknowledged.
"I am an optimist. I believe that we can achieve an agreement that will bring recognition of Kosovo by Serbia, while the prime minister is more of a skeptic on this matter," Mr. Thaci said.
Mr. Haradinaj was blunt.
"Experimenting with borders is unconstitutional," he said in a separate interview with The Times. "It has nothing to do with personality or power. It has everything to do with the fate of our nation."
He added, "Whoever is advocating it on behalf of Kosovo, is wrong. It's not on behalf of Kosovo, but on behalf of one man only -- the president."
"If any piece of paper says that he had agreed to change the borders he will leave his job," Mr. Haradinaj said.
Lulzim Peci, formerly Kosovo's ambassador to Sweden and now a director of the Kosovar Institute for Policy Research and Development in Pristina, said people had had enough of bickering.
"These two leaders are leaders of the past," Mr. Peci said. "Their animosities are toxic for the future of Kosovo that should be a multiethnic and a civic state with human rights for all."
Their meeting in Berlin was a "burial ground for ethnic partitions and land swap ideas that are not part of the future in this region," Mr. Peci added.
A land swap deal would involve a significant shift in position for Ms. Merkel, who has previously declared that borders in the western Balkans are not up for negotiation. German diplomats warn that redrawing boundaries in a region still reeling from war would court disaster.
But there are other believers in the border-change idea, according to Western diplomats. Austria and Hungary appear to be on board.
The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, has endorsed the idea of alterations as long as the demarcation would be in line with international and European law. And, to the surprise of many, John R. Bolton, the Trump administration's national security adviser, said last year that the United States would be open to such a deal.
But the emotions roused when Mr. Vucic and Mr. Thaci floated the idea of exchanging territory may have made a discussion about any settlement impossible, some analysts say, driving Kosovo and Serbia into a chain of tit-for-tat moves against one another and deepening divisions within the two societies.
"We need to focus on the big picture here," said James Ker-Lindsay, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics and a Balkans expert. "We need a final settlement between Serbia and Kosovo to get Kosovo a seat in the United Nations and set Serbia on the accession path to the European Union."
In Serbia, faced with months of opposition protests, Mr. Vucic has been using Western pressure on Belgrade as an excuse to strengthen his authoritarian rule and maintain tight control over the country's economy.
Serbia is being pushed to recognize Kosovo and get nothing in return, he said. "Nothing good awaits us there and I expect nothing good," Mr. Vucic was quoted as saying last week about the Berlin meeting. "The only thing I expect is a start of requests for a new format where the goal would be a recognition of independence without getting anything."
Srdjan Cvijic, a senior analyst with the Open Society European Policy Institute in Brussels, said Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron wanted to affirm that the European Union is united behind the way to reach a final settlement -- resumption of dialogue on normalization of relations, "minus the land swap ideas."
"It's an attempt to dispel the narrative that they stand on the opposite sides of a possible solution to the dispute between Kosovo and Serbia," he said, referring to France and Germany.

Texto completo: Reigning "Jeopardy!" champ James Holzhauer faced real jeopardy Monday, narrowly winning his 18th straight contest by just $18.
By winning, the 34-year-old professional sports gambler from Las Vegas added to his impressive earnings on the challenging quiz show, picking up $54,017 for a total of $1,329,604.
Runner-up Adam Levin just missed dethroning the champ, finishing with $53,999.
Holzhauer is second in "Jeopardy!" prize money, trailing only computer programmer-turned-author Ken Jennings, who won 74 games in 2004.
Holzhauer is still far behind Jennings, but he's closing in on No. 2 Julia Collins (20 wins) and No. 3 David Madden (19).
Although Holzhauer's winning streak is impressive, it's his aggressive bidding approach and the speed of his prize haul that's truly jaw-dropping. He's more than halfway to Jennings' record money total of $2,520,700 in fewer than a quarter of the all-time champ's appearances.
More: A five-time 'Jeopardy!' champ explains what makes current star James Holzhauer a game-changer
Although Monday's winning total is huge in comparison to the average champion's haul, it pales next to Holzhauer's own record for a single show, $131,127.
Holzhauer explained his wagering strategy in a Q&A last week with The New York Times. Unlike most players, he picks the highest-value clues first.
"You can see as soon as I get control of the board in the first game I’m going for the $1,000 clues whenever I have the opportunity," he said, likening his approach to a poker strategy.
"There are big advantages to having a lot of chips early on in a poker tournament," he told the Times. "You can make plays that other people can’t. "
Eddie Timanus, a five-time "Jeopardy!" winner who compiles the college coaches polls for USA TODAY Sports, describes Holzhauer as "a game-changer. "
Timanus notes Holzhauer's mastery of the signaling buzzer, but says he really stands out in his aggressive bidding.
"While many players, myself included, prefer to play categories from top to bottom and try to stick to them, Holzhauer clears the big-dollar clues first. Thanks to his ability to ring in first consistently and rarely miss, he usually has a considerable total built up by the time he uncovers a daily double. He finds most of them since he’s able to maintain control of the board for long stretches, and, as we've seen, he's not afraid to bet big" Timanus says.
His overall assessment of Holzhauer the player: "Speed, instinct, confidence and knowledge — pretty SICK, wouldn’t you say?"

Texto completo: NAPERVILLE NATIVES & ENTREPRENEURS TO APPEAR ON ABC’S ‘SHARK TANK’ Brothers from Naperville, IL will attempt to impress investors on the 10th season of ABC’s multi-Emmy® Award-winning entrepreneurial-themed reality show Los Angeles, Calif. – Cubicall, a custom phone booth manufacturer, is set to continue its growth as they appear on the tenth season of ABC’s "Shark Tank." In front of a national TV audience, co-founders Anthony and Nick Pucci, brothers who grew up in Woodridge/Naperville, IL, will attempt to impress the Sharks with their efficient privacy solution that addresses the shortcomings of open-office design. To learn more about Cubicall click here.
"Having the chance to pitch proven business experts and investors on the tenth season of Shark Tank is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," said Anthony Pucci, co-founder of Cubicall. "We’ve come a long way since creating a phone booth out of personal necessity two years ago. We’re now in a position to sell the Sharks on our unique value proposition – and we’re confident they’ll see the market opportunity."
Open-office floor plans represent 70-80% of offices around the world. While the modern design became popular due to its perceived benefits, recent research into the trend has revealed its shortcomings, namely employees are less productive, unhappy with their work environment, and disengaged.
Cubicall brings productivity back to modern offices through phone booths that deliver visual and acoustical privacy – offering employees a space to focus, hold private communications, or break from the distractions of open office design.
"We started this company when we created our own solution to the problems we experienced when working in an open office," explains Nick Pucci, Cubicall co-founder. "After selling two phone booths the very first weekend we put our phone booths online, we knew we weren’t alone with our frustrations."
Anthony and Nick Pucci, natives of Woodridge/Naperville, now reside in Los Angeles, CA. But entrepreneurship runs in the family with deep roots in Chicago. In 1922, their great grandfather opened Cicero Macaroni, a pasta factory in Cicero, IL. Their grandfather eventually eventually sold the business to Riviana Foods Inc. (No Yolks & Wacky Mac noodles).
Having launched Cubicall in 2017, market potential was quickly realized when the two brothers from Illinois began selling Fortune 500 companies, including: IBM, SAP, Lyft, and Cisco; along with educational institutions like the University of Wisconsin Madison. The phone booths have been featured on Fox Business Channel, The New York Times, Interior Design, Fast Company, Inc. and was called "an efficient privacy solution to open-plan distractions" by Forbes.
Cubicall's simple and efficient design aligns with today's modern design trends. The phone booths ship flat, are easily assembled and are Made in Los Angeles. The bifold door allows Cubicall to fit into offices where every inch of space is critical and helps more businesses comply with International Building Codes. Cubicall’s unique design allows for the customization of the phone booth to match an organization’s branding, office style or communicate a marketing message.
"My brother and I have been "Shark Tank" fans since season one," says Nick Pucci. "Getting a chance to pitch the Sharks is really a dream come true and we believe we have a good shot at making a deal."
Tune into the Pucci brothers and Cubicall as they appear on "Shark Tank", airing Sunday, May 5th, 9:00 – 10:00 p.m., ET/PT on ABC.

Reverse mortgages carry big risks

Texto completo: TV commercials label reverse mortgages simple fixes for elderly homeowners needing cash – a financial easy button.
Sorry, there is no such thing.
Yes, reverse mortgages can be attractive. Folks older than 62 can unlock cash from their home without selling. They can simply draw monthly income, a line of credit or lump sum from their home equity, with no repayment until the home is no longer their primary residence. Staying current requires covering property taxes, homeowners insurance and maintenance.
But be careful. Read the fine print. This isn't money you lend yourself. It's a loan using your home equity as collateral. That means interest, typically at a high rate, plus other fees and costs. Worse than paying that interest monthly, it compounds, magnifying what you owe. When you sell, you repay the principal plus all compounded interest.
Elderly retirees need their finances to be simple, clear and available until they die. Reverse mortgages' ballooning costs can cut against those basic needs.
Reverse mortgage calculators show interest's huge impact. Pretend you did one borrowing $2,000 per month for 10 years – $240,000 in total. At a 4.5% interest rate, your total due after 10 years would $303,530 – before fees. That's $63,530 in interest alone. Bump it to 20 years of payments and your final bill is $779,160 – $480,000 in principal plus $299,160 in interest. Thirty years? You owe $1,524,468. Less than half of that, $720,000, is your principal. The majority is interest. The longer, the uglier – until your home's entire value is the lender's.
These loan amounts aren't realistic for everyone. They're illustrative, showing the key risk: underestimating your life expectancy, living far longer than you anticipate, and ending up aged and broke, unable to meet late-life health expenses. If you're in great health with a good family history, you could live into your 90s or beyond. Planning for a longer life is key to not exhausting your money. Reverse mortgages often do the opposite, with perverse incentives. The longer you live, the bigger the lender wins, while your compounding interest burden balloons. Do you really want to be cash-strapped and in debt while trying to fund late-life care?
Some disagree, arguing reverse mortgages can insure against depleting your savings before you die, working alongside an investment portfolio. They can. This view rightly considers folks' assets in totality, rather than in buckets, avoiding a common error.
But it requires the elderly to invest well. Are you a strong investor? Will you be? Are you willing to risk being forced to sell your house late in life to cover a ginormous compounded interest debt, hoping there is enough left to live off of? At an age when most people need simplicity and ease, this seems unwise.
Beware products charging big fees for something you can do easily with cheaper, more simple investments. If you're younger, save now and invest in your 401(k), reaping compound growth's rewards rather than having them work against you. Stay invested throughout retirement without excessive binge-type withdrawals.
More security, less debt. Wouldn't you rather have that control?

Texto completo: Early in the N.B.A.'s only first-round playoff series that stretched to seven games, it was suggested to Tim Connelly, the Denver Nuggets' president of basketball operations, that a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs was actually a good thing for his young team.
Facing the Gregg Popovich-led Spurs, Connelly was told, would be like going to Playoff School for Denver, a group that brought the West's No. 2 seed to the matchup -- but virtually no postseason experience.
"They're the gold standard of the N.B.A., with maybe the best coach of all time," Connelly countered, shooting down the theory as quickly as he heard it.
"You never want to see the Spurs."
To Connelly's delight, Denver went from nearly losing the first two games at home to the uber-prepared No. 7 seed to staring the Spurs down and closing them out Saturday night. In a winner-take-all Game 7, Nikola Jokic (21 points, 15 rebounds, 10 assists) posted another triple-double, and the Nuggets hung on for a 90-86 victory. The result was a series that felt like an upset no matter what the regular-season standings said -- especially since it ended with Popovich inching onto the Pepsi Center floor during live play in the final seconds and screaming in vain for LaMarcus Aldridge or Patty Mills to commit a foul that never came.
Imagine that: A remedial execution error sealed the Spurs' second straight first-round ouster. Veterans like Aldridge and Mills shouldn't have to be told to foul when trailing by 4 points inside the closing 30 seconds.
Not long after Kawhi Leonard rumbled for a decisive 45 points in Toronto's series-opening victory over Philadelphia, Popovich was thus left to process back-to-back Round 1 exits for the first time in his storied coaching career.
A foul, of course, was unlikely to have saved the visitors at that stage, with Denver holding a two-possession lead. Yet it was a decidedly un-Spurs-like ending to a first season post-Kawhi that generally exceeded expectations -- an ending that, just like that, ushered Pop and Co. to a real crossroads.
After an N.B.A. record 22 consecutive playoff appearances by the Spurs, all overseen by Popovich, all of San Antonio now awaits a firm declaration from the coach who is synonymous with the Alamo City's beloved Spurs that he intends to return.
In January, when The New York Times asked him directly if he planned to carry on, Popovich admitted that "I don't know the answer."
After the Spurs' elimination late Saturday, Popovich was asked about his expiring contract and coaching this group next season. He spoke for a full 40 seconds -- far longer than he usually grants from the postgame interview podium. His answer, though, included no mention of signing a new deal. Popovich, in fact, didn't address his status at all, focusing on the fact that the projected return of the injured guard Dejounte Murray ensures that "it won't be the same team."
Clarity could be coming this week, perhaps as early as Monday, as Popovich typically conducts one last session with the news media shortly after the Spurs' final game. Yet there has been no formal update on the matter since our story in January, when Connelly's San Antonio counterpart, R. C. Buford, would only say, "He'll coach as long as he wants to coach."
This much is certain: Popovich is committed to coach the United States men's national team -- his dream job -- for the next two summers. It is a commitment that has led numerous league observers to surmise that coaching the Spurs for one more season and walking away after the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo is the most natural scenario.
Yet it must be noted, once again, that there is less than two weeks between the FIBA World Cup in China from Aug. 31 to Sept. 15 and the start of Spurs training camp. For just the fourth coach in league history to do this job at age of 70, that would offer an extremely short turnaround.
Hard as it can be to try to read the former Air Force Academy officer who once aspired to a career in military intelligence, it is also natural to wonder whether Popovich still finds the grind sufficiently enjoyable to persist. There have been enough credible rumblings to the contrary over the season to believe that the campaign was much more of a strain than it appeared.
This wasn't merely the first full season of his coaching life in which Popovich couldn't lean on Tim Duncan, Tony Parker or Manu Ginobili. It was also Year 1 after Leonard became the first Popovich-era player to force his way out of town via trade.
San Antonio had to overcome the season-ending loss of its top defender in Murray in October, along with an 11-14 start, just to keep its seemingly interminable streak of reaching the postseason intact. In the Denver series, on a personal level, Popovich coached the Spurs to a Game 3 victory at home on the same night that was the one-year anniversary of the death of his wife, Erin, after a lengthy illness.
It was ultimately San Antonio's failure to hold the two 19-point leads it built in Game 2, rather than the chaotic scenes of Game 7 crunchtime, that cost the Spurs their shot at a second-round date with the star of the playoffs so far: Portland's Damian Lillard. But after the final game, Popovich chose to laud the Nuggets for their breakthrough instead of lamenting the lost opportunity.
"I'm really happy for them in a strange sort of way," Popovich said.
The Spurs can likewise take solace in the knowledge that, as long as they still employ the shrewd Buford, Popovich can count on a roster to entice him to keep going.
I wrote earlier this season about how the struggles of Manchester United in the English Premier League to replace the iconic Sir Alex Ferguson had to be daunting for Spurs officials and fans as they are increasingly forced to imagine who could successfully succeed Popovich. United is on its fifth managerial successor to Ferguson in six years, and England's 20-time champions still are not sure they have it right.
But the difference between rudderless United and ever-steady San Antonio is the scouting eye of Buford, who found Parker (No. 28) and Ginobili (No. 57) with ridiculously late draft picks and who may have done it again with his two No. 29s: Murray and Derrick White.
White had a dreadful series after his 36-point masterpiece in Game 3, but this essentially was his rookie season. The Spurs look like they have something with the trio of Murray, White and Bryn Forbes -- along with two more first-round picks coming in June -- and the team could have salary-cap space to spend in the summer of 2020 if it decides to move on from Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan.
Yet there is only one Pop -- as Denver Coach Mike Malone repeatedly said these past two weeks. The series started with Malone's joking about trying to live up to Pop's five championship rings with just his "wedding ring." It ended with the 54-win Nuggets finding a way to survive Playoff School -- barely -- but not before Malone likened Popovich to Bobby Fischer, the famed chess champion.
"Sometimes things work, and sometimes they don't," Popovich said after Game 6 when pressed on strategy. "But I'm probably not going to discuss the plan with you, with all due respect. I'm not sure why I should do that."
The same clearly applies to his future. This is Gregg Charles Popovich, and whether you like the manner in which he answers reporters' questions or not, he'll tell us when he's ready.

Texto completo: Slippery Rock University officials are responding after Dr. Phil McGraw named the institution during an interview with People about the college admissions scandal.
Sixteen parents, including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, allegedly committed fraud to get their kids into top universities.
In an interview Thursday, McGraw said, "They're not buying their kids an education. That's not what it's about, it has nothing to do with the education. I think this is jewelry for a lot of people. The kids are leaving high school, they don't want to say, 'My kid's going to the junior college. They want to say, 'My kid's going to Harvard, my kid's going to USC or Yale.' I think it's bragging rights for them and they don't want to be the one parent that says, 'Well, yeah, my kid's going to, like, Slippery Rock.' "
In a letter posted to the university's Facebook page, Slippery Rock University President William Behre cites the school as an affordable option where "students whose parents work to pay their mortgage will find quality institutions that open doors to the American dream."
Facebook post
Acknowledging McGraw's background at Midwestern State College and the University of North Texas, Behre said McGraw should understand the importance of a regional public school, adding that students who attend Slippery Rock can get an education for the price of McGraw's 1957 Chevy Bel Air convertible.
"Education is the single most important means of improving mobility and leveling social and economic differences," Behre wrote. "Universities like Slippery Rock University are key to social mobility in America and should be applauded for their efforts to narrow the gap between the haves and have-nots."
Behre invited McGraw to visit the Butler County school this fall to meet students and alumni.
Comments on the Facebook post showed support from alumni and students for the school.
A total of 50 people were charged by prosecutors in early April, including college consultant William Singer. Parents are accused of paying Singer to bribe coaches and athletic officials to get kids into the school or to arrange for cheating on entrance exams like the SAT or ACT, The New York Times reported.
Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges.

Texto completo: When Russian interference in the U.S. election campaign was first detected in 2016, some confusion about its extent and import might have been understandable. Today, there can be no confusion. As the Mueller report says, “the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.”
Unfortunately, the first family remains in denial about this. President Donald Trump, who benefited from the interference, says the investigation was a “witch hunt” and a “hoax.” His son-in-law, Jared Kushner,dismissed it as a “distraction” at a panel sponsored by Time magazine on Tuesday. He said, “You look at what Russia did - you know, buying some Facebook ads to try to sow dissent and do it - and it’s a terrible thing. But I think the investigations, and all of the speculation that’s happened for the last two years, has had a much harsher impact on our democracy than a couple of Facebook ads.” He added, “Quite frankly, the whole thing is just a big distraction for the country.”
This is just plain wrong. Russia’s social media offensive originated at the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, was financed by a crony of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and developed themes and tactics to use on social media to help Trump and disparage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. According to the report, Facebook identified 470 Internet Research Agency-controlled accounts that collectively made 80,000 posts between January 2015 and August 2017, reaching as many as 126 million people. In January 2018, Twitter said it identified 3,814 Internet Research Agency-controlled Twitter accounts.
Two units of Russian military intelligence carried out a second prong of the Russian attack, breaching 29 computers at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and 30 computers of the Democratic National Committee. The operation siphoned 70 gigabytes of data from the DCCC file server and raided thousands of emails and attachments from the DNC, including its opposition research on Trump.
The Russians also used spear-phishing to break into Clinton’s campaign and stole tens of thousands of emails; they organized rallies on divisive topics; planted malware in election equipment systems; and disseminated materials to harm Clinton’s candidacy.
Not just “a couple of Facebook ads.”
The false reading of history matters because the White House should be leading the nation’s defense against another possible assault on election integrity. But how can Trump and his team do so if they cannot acknowledge what already happened? The New York Times reports that Trump’s acting chief of staff is wary of bringing before the president any proposals to prevent Russia from further interference. That amounts to a dereliction of duty.

HBO looking beyond 'Game of Thrones'

Texto completo: When the last drop - or gallon - of blood is shed and an exultant victor has ascended to the Iron Throne, viewers may be split over how HBO's fantasy saga ended but they'll be joined in deprivation.
"What do you do without 'Game of Thrones?'  " will be the lament heard after the May 19 finale, said media industry analyst Larry Gerbrandt. The question is even more critical to the pay-cable channel, which soared on dragon's wings with its hugely popular, eight-season adaptation of George R.R. Martin's novels.
Keeping subscribers on board means more than another hit, even one as globally dazzling as "Game of Thrones" proved to be. But it's where HBO can start to protect its brand and position, observers say, an effort both demanded and compounded by an increasingly congested small-screen landscape and the expectations of the channel's corporate owner since 2016, AT&T.
"I think they need a prestige show on this level to remain HBO," said Bill Carter, a media analyst for CNN and former reporter for The New York Times. But "more than ever, it's really hard to find a hit show and to break through in this marketplace."
The season premiere on April 14 underscored the point, with "Game of Thrones" drawing a series-high record of 17.4 million viewers on TV and streaming. It set a streaming record for HBO and reinforced its standing as one of television's most popular shows.
THE HUNT IS ON
The channel is well into the hunt for a worthy successor, with one possibility an untitled prequel to "Game of Thrones" created by Martin and Jane Goldman and starring Naomi Watts. Set to begin shooting a pilot in June, it's among several potential "Thrones" spinoffs being weighed, with discussions at HBO about "how many is too many," said programming chief Casey Bloys.
"We have high hopes" for the pilot, he said. "But I want to be clear, nobody is going into this thinking that we're going to do a prequel and all of a sudden everybody who automatically watched 'Game of Thrones' is going to watch this. ... It'll have a different feel and different rhythm. We're not trying to do the same show again."
That begs the question of what more HBO has to offer, he said. During a period in which "Game of Thrones" was off the air for scheduling reasons, series including "Westworld," "Sharp Objects" and "Barry" proved strong draws, Bloys said.
"I'm not going to argue that we won't miss 'Game of Thrones.' It's been a fantastic show for us, but life does go on," he said. He points to a deep bench of returnees, including Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon's "Big Little Lies," and newcomers including the graphic novel-based "Watchmen" from "Lost" producer Damon Lindelof.
HBO, which launched in 1972 and whose cachet has long justified the boastful slogan, "It's not TV. It's HBO," has reached this crossroads before. At the turn of the century, pop-culture sensations "The Sopranos" and "Sex and the City" boosted the channel's visibility and subscribers and made it a serious player for prestige awards - including cable's first-ever Emmys for best drama and comedy series. After the shows wrapped, the channel moved nimbly on with audience-pleasers including "Six Feet Under" and "True Blood."
MORE COMPETITION
But that was then, and this is the time of streaming - or, in shorthand, Netflix, along with a growing host of others including Amazon and Hulu - and a shoulder-bumping rush for stars and show makers to churn out more and more fare for outlets already awash in programming.
HBO, no longer a singular alternative to staid broadcast networks, also got new corporate ownership when AT&T bought its parent company, Time Warner. HBO recently saw the exit of its chief executive, Richard Plepler, who had been with the channel for nearly 30 years and guided it to "Game of Thrones" glory.
With AT&T's resources, HBO has stepped up production and will see a 50 percent increase in the number of original program hours this year, Bloys said, arguing that volume doesn't preclude high quality: "There's nothing in 2019 that we're putting on the air because we're trying to hit an hour count. ... We haven't lowered any of our standards to reach a certain level of programming" and there is no pressure to do otherwise from WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey, he said.
SUBSCRIBERS DECIDE
Subscribers ultimately will decide whether the shows are what they want. But expanding the pipeline is unavoidable, said Tuna Amobi, a media and entertainment analyst with investment firm CFRA.
"It's a very different competitive landscape for HBO than it was when they launched 'Game of Thrones,' and they realize that. That's why you see them ratcheting up their investments in their programming," Amobi said. Also key is how HBO's online platform is integrated with planned WarnerMedia streaming offerings to reach the broadest audience possible and make full use of its content, he added. HBO "cannot rely on the old ways of doing things and hope that being a premium channel will bail you out," he said.
"Game of Thrones," which debuted in 2011, has flourished despite the confounding number of small-screen choices. From its first-season average weekly tally of 9.3 million cumulative viewers, the series rose to a seventh-season high of 32.8 million across all HBO platforms, including the channel itself and streaming services HBO Go and HBO Now and over a period extending 30 days beyond the season's end.
SPECATACULAR LOCALES
It benefited from the devoted following for Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" clutch of novels. It was richly and painstakingly produced, filmed in 10 countries including Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Morocco, Iceland and Canada. Its appealing cast became household names, and the female characters that grew in stature and strength as the drama unfolded are routinely namechecked as part of the female-empowerment zeitgeist.
"Game of Thrones" could boast of its Emmy dominance as well, with 47 trophies to date including three best drama series awards. Last year, it denied a second consecutive win to a worthy opponent, Hulu's "The Handmaid's Tale," but HBO itself lost valuable Emmy bragging rights: It was surpassed in total nominations for the first time in 17 years and by relative newcomer Netflix, and the streamer tied HBO in wins.
Analyst Gerbrandt, of Media Valuation Partners, isn't counting the channel out. Many viewers still like so-called "curated" TV delivered to them, as opposed to searching online through dozens or hundreds of offerings, he said. There's also the power of perception at work.
"If there's a brand that survives strictly on name, it's probably HBO," he said.

Texto completo: Melinda Gates has always had an independent streak. When she was still Melinda French and a young employee working at Microsoft in 1987, Bill Gates flirted with her in the parking lot and asked if she would go out with him in two weeks.
"That's not spontaneous enough for me," she told him. "Ask me out closer to the date."
An hour or two later, Bill Gates phoned her and invited her out for that evening. "Is this spontaneous enough for you?" he asked.
And then they lived happily ever after.
Actually, not exactly. Melinda Gates has written a smart new memoir, "The Moment of Lift," recounting how she ended up a feminist - and arguing that the American workplace needs a makeover.
Some of her story is deeply personal. She endured an abusive relationship. She felt out of place in Microsoft's high-testosterone environment. And then she struggled to forge an equal relationship with Bill (it helped that she beat him at a math game).
I hugely admire what Bill and Melinda Gates have done to alleviate global suffering. Hundreds of thousands of children now survive each year who wouldn't have without the Gateses' money, advocacy and ingenuity. They have also been steadfast in advocating changes in tax laws - raising the inheritance tax, for example - to create a more fair society.
During interviews with Bill and Melinda over many years, I've often tried to get them to dish on their relationship, as a way of spicing up discussions about global health and their foundation work. They resolutely resisted my interrogations.
Fortunately, in her book, Melinda comes clean on marital tensions - the kind in any relationship - as a way of recounting her feminist voyage. 
One of Melinda's first challenges came in the harsh, male-dominated techie culture at Microsoft. "It was just so brash, so argumentative and competitive, with people fighting to the end on every point," she writes. She began thinking about quitting.
Then she found a woman colleague, Charlotte Guyman, who felt the same. With other women employees, they began to create oases in Microsoft where courtesy was not seen as a sign of weakness. A critical mass of women employees helped civilize the company.
Yet while women were 35% of the computer science graduates in the U.S. in 1987, when Melinda graduated from Duke with such a degree, the share has now dropped to 19%. Only 2% of venture capital partners in America are women. Much of the U.S. workplace remains tilted against women, especially moms.
"We're sending our daughters into a workplace that was designed for our dads - set up on the assumption that employees had partners who would stay home to do the unpaid work of caring for family," Melinda writes.
After the marriage, in 1994, Melinda still struggled, and one flashpoint was the annual letter that Bill had been writing for the foundation they had established. Melinda was co-chair of the foundation and wanted to write it with him in 2013. Bill didn't like the idea. "We both got angry," Melinda writes, adding: "I thought we were going to kill each other. I felt, Well, this just might end the marriage right here.'"
In the end, Bill wrote the letter for 2013 but included a section by Melinda. In 2014, it became a joint letter, but mostly written by Bill. Finally, in 2015 it morphed into a truly balanced letter.
That's how equal marriages are built: not just on romance but also on hard work and grumpy compromises. And equal marriages help build fairer societies. When their eldest child, Jenn, began school an hour round-trip drive away, Bill volunteered to take her to school two days a week. That changed the norms, and abruptly other dads at the school began sharing the driving as well.

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio confirmed Friday there was an intrusion into Florida's elections systems by hackers in 2016, according to the New York Times.
Rubio would not say who was behind the hacking, saying he was constrained by his position on the Senate Intelligence Committee, but the redacted version of the Mueller Report released April 18 stated the FBI believes "at least one Florida county" was infiltrated with malicious software sent out by Russian intelligence agents.
Rubio's statement contradicts the Florida Secretary of State's office, which maintained last week that its elections systems weren't hacked. Secretary Laurel Lee also said at the time that the FBI hadn't told the state which county they believe was compromised.
Rubio said the information was discovered through an intelligence operation, not a criminal investigation,
"Everybody has been told what it is they need to do to protect themselves from the intrusion," Rubio told the Times. "I don't believe the specific victims of the intrusion have been notified. The concern was that in a number of counties across the country, there are a couple of people with the attitude of: 'We've got this; we don't need your help. We don't think we need to do what you are telling us we need to do.'"
The hackers, were "in a position" to change voter roll information, he told the Times, but it didn't appear they did.
Gov. Ron DeSantis had said at a press conference in Orlando last week that he didn't believe any breach would have affected vote totals.
But in Miami on Thursday, according to Politico, he was critical of the FBI, telling reporters, "They won't tell us which county it was, are you kidding me? Why would you have not said something immediately?"
DeSantis and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott will meet with the FBI in coming weeks to discuss the Russian hacking attempts on Florida counties in 2016.
Scott's office said the FBI has reached out to him and is working on scheduling a briefing in the next few weeks. DeSantis' office said no date has yet been set.
The report stated that in November 2016, Russian intelligence officials "sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. election."
The emails contained an attached Word document with malicious "Trojan" software that would have permitted Russian intelligence to access the infected computer. But none of the 52 Florida counties that had contracts with VR Systems, the Tallahassee company who was allegedly impersonated, has admitted to opening that document.
Volusia County elections supervisor Lisa Lewis said Thursday the office opened one of the infected emails in 2016, but not the infected attachment. Broward County supervisor Peter Antonacci said this week the county received the email, but it was quarantined by anti-virus software and officials wouldn't have had the opportunity to open the attachment.
Last year, then-U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., warned Russians had gained access to Florida voter data but declined to identify which county or counties had been penetrated, saying the information was classified. No other officials backed up Nelson's claim, including Rubio, and Scott and national Republicans attacked Nelson for what GOP campaign emails called his "alarming claims" and "extremely reckless behavior."
Rubio did warn repeatedly in 2016 that "state election systems are potentially vulnerable to Russian cyber attacks."

For Muslims Who Identify with Our History in America" A Mid-Atlantic Address of July 19, 2003 - Part II

Texto completo: Headnote From Imam W. Deen Mohammed
I can't recall exactly who the first one was, but I believe the first one that I know of to have a doctorate degree in the following of the Hon. Elijah Muhammad was Dr. Lonnie Shabazz from Washington, D.C.
Maybe Dr. Salaam, who was a dentist, maybe they came in around the same time. But I think Lonnie Shabazz was before him, coming in earlier.
The head of the school, when I was a high school student, was Bro. James Shabazz, and he was only a high school student; he never had any college education. So the head of our school had no college education but was a very devoted, excellent teacher.
And I used to think about that and I'd say, "Well, Master Fard sure used some masterful psychology on us" - calling us the "University of Islam" and we didn't even have a college teacher with any college education - teaching the high school.
I used to think about that and I'd said, "He was some kind of man.'" He really could stretch it and get results. Until I did some reading on the history of the founding of African American colleges and found that most of them had no college man over those institutions.
They were not college graduates themselves, but they started colleges and did a great work. So that seems to go for practically everything that Fard did that seemed like he was doing it first.
He wasn't doing it first. He just found (it) in history. He studied; the man was very wise. He studied what had already occurred in our people. And he just took it out and used it in such a powerful way to empower us, to make us feel strong and valuable and powerful.
He did a masterful job, there's no doubt about it - even calling the white man a devil. We think, "Oh Master Fard, he told us the white man was the devil." No, it was a slave that associated the white people with devils, named Julia, long before Master Fard ever came.
It's written in a book that she said, "You all look like G-d in the face." Now, what did she mean by that? They gave her the picture of Jesus Christ and said that was G-d.
And she was saying, "You all look like him (Jesus) in your face, but you're the devil in your hearts." That's what she said about them, You're the devils in your heart."
But she's not the only one. You should listen to what Frederick Douglass said. Frederick Douglas said, You all claim Jesus, you claim to be Christians and claim Jesus Christ, but your behavior is such that would shame a nation of savages." That's what Frederick Douglass said.
So Mr. Fard wasn't the first one to attack the credits of white folks. Others had attacked those credits. And I can go on to more. There's the big preacher, Father Divine. When he said "Father Divine," was he saying he was G-d?
Father Divine. Divine is G-d. Anything divine is godly, isn't it? You can use it very loosely, and it won't mean G-d, you know? But if you use it seriously, it's supposed to mean G-d.
And he was using it very seriously. He told his following, "If you want to see Jesus, look at me." That's what he told his followers. And this was before Mr. Fard introduced his teachings.
So when you study exactly - without even being trained but with my own intelligence; the Hon. Elijah Muhammad and Clara Muhammad, the leaders of the Nation of Islam who were associated with me and my family, who became so close to us they were like uncles or aunts to us; that environment that I was in, including my own family - my older sisters and brothers and other relatives in the family, they gave me a kind of circumstance or an environment that made me a very special guy.
See, you are the product of your environment. I don't care who it is you're talking about. The Imam here, to my left, Imam Yusuf Saleem - before he came to the Nation of Islam, if we want to know what produced him, we have to study his environment: his parents, the house that he was raised up in, where he lived.
But not only that, everything close to him; his close friends, the involvements that he had that were close to his life... When you study all that, then you'll understand what produced Yusuf Saleem, the man who was not Yusuf Saleem but Joseph - before he joined the Nation of Islam.
If you want to know what accounts for the man that he is now, you have to know that. And in addition, you have to know what has impacted his life since he became a member of the Nation of Islam and now with us.
If you can do that, you can write his blueprint. You can draw a blueprint to reproduce him; you have a pattern on him.
Well, without me going to a higher institution to learn this, this is just naturally in my mind. And because of the circumstances I was put in, to make me think a certain way, I was able to go back and do research.
I studied that time that Mr. Fard came in, and I studied what he taught. And I made the connection for what he taught, and what was happening in his time. And that caused me to really see him.
I think nobody in this community, then and now, know Mr. W.D. Fard or Mr. Fard Muhammad like I know him. Nobody! No sir, you don't know him. But G-d has revealed him to me. I know him.
G-d has guided me to what will make me know him, and G-d has also made me understand things that he said and did that helped me to know him. I know him very, very well.
And he did a masterful job, and we don't want to play down the importance of his work. We want to preserve and respect the importance of his work.
They accuse me of being the one who did away with everything, but if you read what these learned people are saying, quoting me and talking about me, and giving it to the general public, like in the New York Times and in other publications - there's a magazine coming out soon, produced I'm told mainly for bookstores.
It might be in Borders; you can get it from there. It's called T and the World." And this writer is sharing with the readers, the public, the important things that have happened in my life to shape me and make me the person I am.
If you do a worthy work and you remain sincere, you don't have to worry about it being preserved. G-d will preserve it. Allah, Most High, will have it preserved.
And I knew that as long as we just stayed within the walls of the temple or the mosque, or masjid, and did our work just among ourselves, we wouldn't be protecting it for the future.
The history of our people tells us that we keep things too private, and our children go out and they leave us with nobody to inherit it. Leaders sometimes go back or go in the streets, just give it up.
Nobody's valuing it enough to preserve it for generations to come. So I feel that the best way to protect us from that, being in a situation like that in the future, was for me to take my ministry out of the Nation of Islam. And that's what I did.
I established my own ministry out of the Nation of Islam. And right now I'm established outside of ASM (American Society of Muslims), though I'm a spiritual leader for ASM.
My ministry is separate from ASM, WDM Ministry, or The Mosque Cares office, which is a legal name now for The Mosque Cares office. It's separate. It's on its own. It's a separate legal entity.
So G-d is saving our good works and preserving it for generations to come. But at the same time, I've been working with you all, too, pressuring you all to take it serious and to not trust your history to writers who are not you, not one of you.
You haven't done anything yet, but I think you'll do something before I'm gone. I hope that I'll be able to read it. I may be so old and blind, I can't even read it. I may have to say, "Read it to me, brother."
I don't expect to live that long, though. I don't think I'd get that decrepit. I think I'll just stop eating and die. No, I like life. I don't like to hang around.

Buffett sees most newspapers as 'toast' after ad decline

Texto completo: Warren Buffett, the man behind a print-media empire that includes the Buffalo News and Omaha World-Herald, doesn't think most newspapers can be saved.
The decline of advertising gradually turned the newspaper industry "from monopoly to franchise to competitive, the billionaire chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. And now most newspapers are "toast.
"The world has changed hugely, Buffett said in the interview with Yahoo Finance, which will serve as the livestream host for Berkshire's shareholder meeting.
The bleak outlook echoes Buffett's remarks at last year's annual meeting, when he lamented the state of the newspaper industry. Berkshire's BH Media, which owns papers across the country, has been cutting jobs to cope with declining advertising revenue.
Berkshire struck a deal last year for Lee Enterprises Inc., which owns papers including the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, to manage its newspapers and digital operations in 30 markets.
Buffett, 88, said last year that it wasn't of much economic consequence to Berkshire because the company bought its papers at "reasonable prices.
Readers sought out newspapers when they were packed with ads about bargains, jobs and apartments, Buffett said. But Craigslist and other sites have taken over that role.
By 2016, the newspaper industry's ad revenue was nearly a third of what it was a decade before, falling to $18 billion from $49 billion, according to Pew Research Center.
"It upsets the people in the newsroom to talk that way, but the ads were the most important editorial content from the standpoint of the reader, Buffett said.
Not all papers are doomed, though. The New York Times, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal will survive, he said.

Gov. Janet Mills will address business interests on Friday after privately meeting with Democrats on a controversial transmission line proposal as lawmakers advance bills on returning to a presidential primary, allowing sports betting and immigration.
The governor will speak at an energy summit put on by a key corridor backer after trying to sell Central Maine Power's unpopular project to Democratic lawmakers. Mills will speak at an energy summit held by the Maine State Chamber of Commerce at Maple Hill Farm in Hallowell on Friday afternoon where the future of Maine's energy market and electric vehicle use will be discussed. The elephant in the room will be the $1 billion transmission line proposal from Central Maine Power, which the governor supports alongside the chamber.
The corridor, which would deliver Quebec hydropower to the regional power grid, is deeply unpopular in the western Maine region it would pass through -- including Farmington, where Mills lives -- despite winning a key permit at the Maine Public Utilities Commission earlier this month.
Legislators have also proposed measures to blunt or stall it, including a carbon emissions study championed by Sen. Brownie Carson, D-Harpswell, and endorsed already by a legislative committee. Mills has increasingly signaled her opposition to that bill as it has advanced.
Mills appeared at private meetings of the Democratic caucuses in the Senate and House of Representatives on Wednesday and Thursday. Few details of the Senate meeting leaked out by Friday, but one attendee of the House meeting said Mills took questions from representatives and "changed some minds" on the corridor.
The corridor has looked somewhat unpopular in the Legislature. Dylan Voorhees, clean energy director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, which opposes the corridor, said about 30 lawmakers attended a Thursday briefing on the project by his group and it was nearly evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.
Bills that would return Maine to a presidential primary and open the state to sports betting will have hearings on Friday. The highlights of a slim legislative committee schedule today are a bill from Sen. Louis Luchini, D-Ellsworth, the chairman of the voting and gambling committee, that would return Maine to a taxpayer-funded presidential primary after using party-run caucuses since 2004 and a raft of bills from Republicans and Democrats to legalize sports betting after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year allowed states to begin regulating it.
Luchini's bill looks to be a good bet to be the vehicle that advances a presidential primary, something the Legislature has been working on since 2016, when Democrats had long lines at their presidential caucuses and many Republicans had to travel long distances to get to theirs. Other bills want to open primaries to independents and implement ranked-choice voting in the new presidential primaries, but Luchini's bill would simply establish them in early March.
The sports betting bills look to have Maine join the seven states that have already legalized that betting, according to Legal Sports Report. Luchini's committee will take testimony on five bills aimed at it on Friday after the primary hearing.
Noncitizens in the country legally might soon have access to benefits that were cut in 2011. A bill from Rep. Drew Gattine, D-Westbrook, that earned committee support on Thursday would allow many income-eligible legal immigrants access to MaineCare coverage and state-funded food assistance programs, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families cash benefits. The bill, which would apply to any noncitizen pursuing legal status, including those seeking asylum and others granted citizenship under the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, carries a fiscal note of $14.5 million through 2021 and would reinstate budget cuts made in 2011 under former Gov. Paul LePage.
King to brief media on Iraq trip
Maine's junior senator is scheduled to brief the media tonight on his trip to Iraq as part of a bipartisan delegation. U.S. Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, has been in Iraq this week with Sens. Johnny Isakson, R-Georgia, and Tammy Duckworth, D-Illinois, for meetings with U.S. officials from the U.S. military, intelligence branches and Department of State and Iraqi officials.
King took another trip to Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Qatar in 2014 and U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, took 2006 and 2009 trips to Iraq. King will talk to media members at 6 p.m. on military and political affairs in Iraq Friday at the Portland Transportation Center after returning.
Correction: An earlier version of this item misstated the location of King's media availability. It is the Portland Transportation Center.
Reading list
-- Maine's governor and chief justice backed a bill to replace masculine pronouns in state statutes with gender-neutral terms. Mills and Chief Justice Leigh Saufley gave committee testimony Thursday in support of the bill from House Majority Leader Matt Moonen, D-Portland. An early version of Moonen's bill sought to change only language referring to the governor and the judicial branch, but upon finding "dozens and likely hundreds" of masculine references across Maine's Revised Statutes, Moonen added two amendments. The amended version now proposes revising the statutes to replace masculine pronouns with gender-neutral titles. The Judiciary Committee unanimously endorsed the bill, which now moves on for House and Senate votes.
-- Maine is on the verge of preventing minors from being charged with prostitution. The Senate gave final passage to a bill from Sen. Bill Diamond, D-Windham, that would align state law with what has been prosecutorial practice for years. Proponents of the measure say that people younger than 18 who are enlisted to work as prostitutes should be treated as sex trafficking victims, not criminals. Maine would become the 21st state to bar prosecution of minors for the crime of engaging in prostitution. All Senate Democrats present for the vote backed the bill alongside seven Republicans. Another seven Republicans -- including the two party leaders -- opposed it.
-- Your Styrofoam lobster roll container could soon become a collector's item. Maine Public reports that the Senate sent to Mills a bill that would ban most uses of polystyrene food containers by Jan. 1. 2021. The vote was 23-10, with some Republicans arguing that it would drive up costs for businesses in the state.
-- A small Maine city is grappling with a new challenge in its budget planning. In addition to the standard budget stresses like health insurance cost increases and valuation changes, the death of a resident who regularly used Belfast's ambulance to get to and from dialysis treatments had a significant impact on revenue. That individual was single-handedly responsible for $200,000 worth of ambulance receipts, and when the person died, the city saw a shortfall of roughly $265,000 in anticipated ambulance service revenue.
Angry birds
A "murder bird" in Florida has gotten a lot of media attention this week, and on Saturday, you can begin bidding to make it yours.
For those of you who have been focused on more important matters -- such as the coming-of-age sagas of Arya Stark and N'Keal Harry -- the "murder bird" is a cassowary that killed its owner on April 12 at the exotic wildlife compound he ran until the exotic wildlife caused his exotic wild death.
Apparently, Marvin Hajos was checking on the bird's big blue eggs when one or more flightless, 6-foot avian assassins attacked him. Cassowaries have quite an arsenal of deadly appendages, including knife-like talons and three-toed feet that each have a claw that can grow five inches long. The natives of Southeast Asia and Australia are essentially "Mad Max" emus or modern-day velociraptors. In fact, the claws do look alarmingly like a fossil claw that helped scientists determine that velociraptors were the Tasmanian devils of an earlier epoch.
Unless he aspired to be a Bond villain, why would Hajos keep these monsters around? I side with death investigator Bill Grotjahn, who determined that Hajos died from "bird-inflicted trauma."
"I've been doing this for 18 years and I've never had a thing like this," he told the New York Times. "I've had them killed by alligators and snakes but never by a bird like that. Cassowaries are an extremely, extremely dangerous bird. You don't want to fool around with them. They have no sense of humor."
Tomorrow, when the bidding starts, we'll find out who thinks Big Bird With A Vengeance would make a good pet. Maybe they could become a bigger, badder version of " guard geese" at Mar-a-Lago. Here is your soundtrack. -- Robert Long

Texto completo: President Trump disputed Thursday that he had told then-White House counsel Donald McGahn to seek the firing of Special Counsel Robert Mueller in the midst of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The episode, detailed in the report by Mueller that was publicly released last week, is among those being scrutinized by Democrats as they continue to investigate whether Trump sought to obstruct Mueller's probe. In a morning tweet, Trump sought to blame the media for misreporting what happened.
"I never told then White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller, even though I had the legal right to do so," Trump wrote. "If I wanted to fire Mueller, I didn't need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself. Nevertheless, Mueller was NOT fired and was respectfully allowed to finish his work on what I, and many others, say was an illegal investigation."
McGahn emerged as a key witness in Mueller's 448-page report, detailing several occasions when Trump ordered him to "do crazy s---," according to the special counsel's findings. That included trying to persuade the Justice Department to get rid of Mueller, according to the report.
McGahn didn't and almost resigned over the episode. He also refused to issue a public statement denying that the reports Trump wanted to fire Mueller were true when the president asked him to, the report says.
Though Trump has claimed "total exoneration" by the Mueller report, he and his aides have continued to attack Mueller and his team and aggressively dispute some of the more damaging details it contains. Trump declined to sit for an interview with Mueller in which he would have had an opportunity to rebut other testimony.
The Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena this week ordering McGahn to testify before the panel next month and hand over documents and records pertaining to federal investigations of Trump, his finances, his campaign, and charges that he sought to obstruct justice.
The White House is resisting the move, along with other efforts by Democrats to call key figures in the Mueller probe to testify before Congress.
Trump and McGahn had an adversarial relationship at times during his tenure in the White House, with McGahn contemplating quitting at several points. But he was also key to some of the president's primary accomplishments, including the confirmation of two Supreme Court judges and a record number of federal judiciary appointments.

Buzzfeed pulls out of daily Trump pool
Traveling with President Trump isn't doing the trick for BuzzFeed these days. The digital news outlet on Wednesday confirmed that it had withdrawn from a pool of media companies that chip in to follow the president around to his rallies and his golfing weekends at Mar-a-Lago.
"We decided not to continue in the smaller group that makes up the traveling pool, but remain enthusiastic members of the in-town print pool," noted BuzzFeed spokesman Matt Mittenthal, referring to media collectives that team up to ensure day-in, day-out coverage of the president.
It follows a round of layoffs in January that eliminated 15 percent of BuzzFeed's workforce, including more than 40 journalists.
The withdrawal will not hobble the domestic travel pool, according to Todd J. Gillman, Washington bureau chief for the Dallas Morning News and a board member of the White House Correspondents' Association.
Gillman oversees a complicated process in which 15 news organizations — Agence France-Presse, Christian Science Monitor, Dallas Morning News, Daily Mail, The Hill, HuffPost, Los Angeles Times, McClatchy, New York Times, Politico, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, Washington Examiner, Washington Times, The Washington Post — rotate into a print-coverage seat on domestic trips aboard Air Force One. (The Christian Science Monitor and Dallas Morning News share a "seat" in the rotation.)
Each of these organizations is billed proportionally for its share of all travel costs of each trip.
All this organizing goes toward filling one of 13 press seats on the president's domestic trips.
The others are filled by the wire services, TV outlets, and so on.
News outlets are constantly weighing the benefits of traveling with the president. The argument against: It's pricey and, depending on the administration, access can be limited and perfunctory. Plus: the president's rage-tweets, his frequent madcap Q-and-A sessions, his Fox News interviews, the Mueller report, leave an ample information trail for news organizations that are disinclined to travel.
The argument for: Journalism requires being there, a dynamic that's particularly critical under this presidency; Trump has a knack for doing newsworthy things wherever he happens to be traveling. During a 2017 trip to France, for example, the president made a number of comments to reporters on an off-the-record basis.
He then asked New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman why she hadn't written anything based on the comments, at which point the White House got busy releasing excerpts on the record.

The U.S.' immigration laws of inequality

Texto completo: Headnote IMMIGRATION KORNER
The hypocrisy and inequality of America's immigration law was recently highlighted in an opinion piece by Kriston Capps in The New York Times.
Under the headline: "Another Reason to Hate Hudson Yards," Capps, a staff writer for CityLab, pointed out that the new. shiny $25 billion Manhattan development was financed in part through the EB-5 preferential investor immigration program.
This is a program under U.S. immigration law that "allows foreign nationals to purchase a family pack of visas by investing capital in job-creating businesses in the United States" to the time of $500 K to 1 million, minimum.
It is much like the Citizenship by Investment programs run by some Eastern Caribbean island nations that are constantly criticized and slammed by the U.S. while it runs its own. But that's another story for another day.
According to Capps, Related, Hudson Yard's project developer was allowed to raise more than $1.2 billion in EB-5 financing at the lower $500,000 tier rate reserved for urban areas with severe unemployment rates.
So, for$500,000, any "investor" in Hudson Yards got a U.S. green card.
As background, the U.S. Congress created the program in 1990 to stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors. In 1992, Congress created the Immigrant Investor Program, also known as the Regiontil Center Program. It set aside EB-5 visas for participants who invest in commercial enteqirises associated witii regional centers approved by USCIS and based on proposals tor promoting economic growtii.
Ai EB-5 investor must invest the required amount of capital in a new commercial enterprise that will create full-time positions for at least 10 U.S. citizens, lawful pennanent resident or otiier immigrant audiorized to work in the United States.
this allows anyone witii money to simply roll in and attain permanent residency while leaving the tired, poor raid huddled masses in limbo or subjected to xenophobia, insultsand political soccer.
Take the case of Roxana, an immigrant who has lived in the United States for 32 years-nearly her entire fife. She has worked her way up from a waitress, to a nurse, a scientist. a Pli.D. candidate, and a teacher.
Now she's researching how to keep agricultural workers safe, and she teaches the next generation of nurses, who will help patients from all walks of life in America
Yet, because of her Temporary Protected Status, Roxanne raid more tiian 1 million Dreamers, TPS holders, and Deferred Enforced Departure, migrants who have been making a difference in their communities for years and paying their fair share of taxes, are living in constant fear that the Trump administration will lake away their ability to live in and contribute to the country they call home.
Why? Simple! They are poor and according to Trump, America is full and closed to such immigrants.
It has a lot of room though for the rich around the world-as long as they can shell out $ 500,000 at minimum. Wire cares if they even live here full-time, pay taxes or really w'ant to contribute to the community tiiey live in? Wire cares if tiiey are even part of a community but instead choose to fly in and out at whim and simply decide tiiey want a green card to own property or a business here?
How can you compare the value of the work Roxanne and millions more have been putting into this countryover decades to $500,000?
Isn't it a wf iole lot more? So why are they not given a similar option? Why is Congress still languishing on measures that would make these hardwodang immigrants pennanent residents while someone witii $500,(XX) can buy their way in in a matter of weeks?
The answer is exactiy what keeps millions of Americans in poverty while the wealtii of the super-rich, including the same lawmakers elected to represent us, continues to grow as millions five paycheck to paycheck. It is thatugly word INEQUALITY that few wrant to address but which continues to win again and again in the rigged process allied The Ameriam Dream.

Texto completo: Thanks for The Big 10 with Jeff D'Alessio on April 21. There's another great source for scientific refutation of climate denial myths: skepticalscience.org. But the time for debating with the scientifically illiterate is over. We need to act now, and that means supporting candidates for Congress who will pass the Green New Deal's energy plan.
We have only a decade left to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent if we are to prevent "catastrophic" global warming (National Academy of Sciences).
The Green New Deal energy plan aims for at least a 50 percent cut and closer to 100 percent by 2050.
Fortunately, the rapid national transition to clean energy will also have massive economic benefits.
By scaling up solar and wind, the GND's energy plan would make clean energy "essentially free" by 2030 (Financial Times, UBS, August 2018). It would cost about $5 trillion (New York Times, April 18), but mainly because of all that "essentially free" energy, it would add $6.5 trillion to the U.S. economy (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).
It would also create 10 to 15 million good-paying, local, permanent (40-year) jobs with good benefits, the kind of jobs our country has been losing for decades.
Making emissions cuts with the speed and scale the GND proposes would also prevent more than $160 trillion in future economic damage from climate disasters we'd otherwise suffer (Forbes, April 2019).
Just a half-degree increase in global temperatures will cost the U.S. economy $13 trillion (IPCC). We'd be fools not to support the Green New Deal's energy plan.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former Vice President Joe Biden, who announced his candidacy for president on Thursday, has spoken with Anita Hill and expressed his regret for the way she was treated during the 1991 Supreme Court hearings on Clarence Thomas.
"They had a private discussion where he shared with her directly his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country," said Biden’s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield.
But the conversation wasn't enough for Hill, who told the New York Times that she does not believe Biden understands the harm he caused to her in 1991 when she gave testimony alleging sexual harassment by Thomas, then a Supreme Court nominee.
Biden chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee during the contentious hearing, a source of criticism for the Democratic presidential candidate as he faces off with a wide pool of candidates vying for the White House. Biden drew scrutiny for the questioning Hill faced during the heavily publicized hearing. Critics said Hill was badgered by Senate inquisitors, particularly Republicans.
"I cannot be satisfied by simply saying I’m sorry for what happened to you. I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose," Hill told the Times. She declined to call Biden's words to her an apology.
Biden on Anita Hill: Joe Biden regrets how Anita Hill was treated, says Kavanaugh accuser should get more respect
Allegations against Biden: Joe Biden vows to be 'more mindful' on same day as three more women make accusations
She continued, telling the Times, Biden "needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw. And not just women. There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence. "
Criticism over the hearings have followed Biden and re-emerged in 2018 after Christina Blasey Ford accused then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a party as a teenager.
Before Ford testified at Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, Biden told NBC News that he regretted how Hill was treated during the contentious hearings. During the hearings, Biden said he hoped Ford would not be treated like Hill. He also explained that Senate rules prevented him from reining in questions by other committee members during the Hill hearings.
"What should happen is the woman should be given the benefit of the doubt and not be, you know, abused again by the system," Biden said at the time in an interview with NBC News. "What happened was she got victimized again during the process. "
Biden criticized: Joe Biden jokes about touching allegations at first public event, leading to criticism
Trump chimes in: As Biden faces accusations of improper conduct, Trump jokes, 'You having a good time, Joe?'
The former senator from Delaware said too many of his colleagues "vilified" Hill during the 1991 hearings, and, "I wish I could’ve done more to prevent those questions, the way they asked them. "
Asked what he would tell Hill, Biden replied: "I’m sorry I couldn’t have stopped the kind of attacks that came to you . . . But I never attacked her, I supported her. I believed her from the beginning. "
Months after Kavanaugh and just weeks before he launched his presidential bid, Biden again found himself on the defense after a string of accusations from women claiming Biden had hugged, kissed or rubbed noses with them without permission.
Biden said April 3 he'd be more "mindful and respectful," saying the touching was all about making a "human connection. "

Texto completo: In her new memoir, "Life Will Be the Death of Me," comedian, author, and talk show host Chelsea Handler writes about how the election of President Donald Trump drove her to therapy, where she unraveled a rich tapestry of issues dating back to the death of her brother. She writes about how she is now a better, calmer person, the kind of person who meditates.
She also -- and this is the part everyone wants to talk about -- details her infatuation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. His still-impressive abs and hair inspire "strong sexual feelings," she writes, as does his stern dedication to bedrock legal principles. There's more, but we can't print it.
If there is one thing Handler has learned on her ongoing promotional tour (which reaches the Athenaeum Theatre on Friday night for a show that will also feature "Will & Grace" star Sean Hayes), it's that she is not alone. "There are millions of other people, there's a whole underground railroad of people, that are attracted to Robert Mueller and didn't know it was OK to say it," Handler marvels in a phone interview. "And his sunglasses! Did you see the picture of him yesterday pulling into work? I mean, he's so hot. I'm sorry, there is no one hotter than Robert Mueller."
Until November 2016, Handler lived a prickly but essentially unchallenged life. She hosted several talk shows, including "Chelsea Lately" on E!, and more recently, "Chelsea" on Netflix, had a successful stand up career, and was a bestselling memoirist. Handler, 44, born and raised in New Jersey, had a house in Bel Air, A-list friends like Jennifer Aniston, and a raft of assistants upon whom she was so dependent, she was unable to bathe without her housekeeper, because Handler couldn't figure out how to turn the shower on.
After the election, the primal howl of the outside world, or the Democratic part of it, anyway, began to pierce the mortifying bubble of her privilege. "When you make a living out of being a loudmouth and telling everybody what's wrong with them, but never, ever having to tackle what's wrong with you, and you get rewarded for that behavior, you think that's good," she says. "You think, OK, this is cool. I can say whatever I want, and I just keep getting rewarded for it. A TV show, a book deal, a stand up tour. You become very spoiled. I did. I became very entitled, and there was always something kind of digging at me."
Handler entered therapy, where she realized that her inchoate postelection rage might not have had much to do with the election, after all. "My brother died when I was nine, and my family kind of fell apart," she says. "I lost my brother, and then my father may as well have been gone, too. That was a trigger for me, Trump's election, and 'trigger' is not a word I love to throw around, but it was the best way to describe what happened to so many of us. Trump becoming president felt like the world was unhinged."
In therapy, Handler realized that the death of her brother, the person to whom she was closest in a family she felt otherwise unconnected to, untethered her connection to others, and to her own feelings. "I didn't realize it, but people thought I had no emotion," she says.
As an adult, she was the one her friends turned to in a crisis, the one who coolly took charge. She could feel sympathy, but not empathy. She was sorry for people when bad things happened to them, but was incapable of understanding how they felt. Empathy was something she only recently learned. "I practice it every single day: 'OK, what's it like to be that person? Think about what that person goes home to.' It was a muscle that I didn't have."
Handler, who had spent years in a constant whir of work and travel to avoid spending time with her feelings, still screams at parking attendants -- look, she's not perfect -- but generally is a more patient, grounded person than she used to be. She feels happier, and almost normal. "This is the beginning of being on the right track again. Sometimes we get off track in our lives, and it's usually a result of something that happened many years prior. When faced with it, and really digging deep, you can really clean out that injury. I have a whole new world ahead of me, now that I don't have to carry that around."
Helping with all this is the fact that Handler smokes a lot of pot (she loves pot, she's coming out with her own brand of pot), which quieted her mind to the point where she could learn how to meditate, which she now does every morning. After a career spent skewering Hollywood types, Handler has become the kind of person she used to make fun of. She takes consciousness-expanding drugs with a shaman, and talks a lot about being "present." She says she doesn't worry about losing her edge. "I'm not going on, like, a silent retreat any time soon. I'm still cynical. The funny and the silly and all that, I still have it in spades."
Handler has dedicated much of her new life to activism. She wants to do things that matter, things that are real. She sponsors Syrian refugees, is working on a documentary for Netflix about white privilege, and hopes to write more "serious" books like "Life Will Be The Death of Me," which currently tops The New York Times' bestseller list.
Even for a professional Oversharer, it's a disarmingly, unblinkingly honest work, and Handler has been gratified by the warm public reaction. "I've never been vulnerable before, so people are just pouring out their stories to me. I've heard so many stories about death and grief. I'm so overwhelmed and I love it. I'm like, 'Oh. This is what it's like to do something good.' "

Texto completo: Re "The citizenship question," editorial, April 24
It has been said that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. cares greatly about the reputation of the U.S. Supreme Court as a nonpartisan branch of government. All that concern will be for naught if he votes to allow the citizenship question to be added to the 2020 census.
We know that Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census, is not being honest when he says the purpose of including a citizenship question is to better enforce the Voting Rights Act.

If Roberts votes with the Trump administration, he will join his fellow Republicans on the court in thinking that helping his party gain seats in Congress is more important than upholding fairness.
Alex Magdaleno
Camarillo
::
In an editorial about migrants (no paperwork), the L.A. Times uses "immigrant" five times with no mention of migrants.
Immigrants arrive here with paperwork and religiously follow all the rules to keep the avenues open to eventually apply for citizenship. Migrants avoid paperwork.
Mixing migrants and immigrants together makes any rational discussion impossible -- which is precisely what the Democrats want as urban areas balloon in migrant population, requiring more districts that elect Democratic representatives.
Bob Munson
Newbury Park
::
California and other blue states should start a media campaign to urge everyone, regardless of citizenship, to refuse to answer a citizenship question on the census.
While it might be a federal crime to refuse to answer part of the census, prominent Republicans (including then-Sen. Trent Lott and then-presidential candidate George W. Bush prior to the 2000 count) have historically urged people to not answer questions they found intrusive.
We need to start the "just leave it blank" movement now.

Foul mouths and their president
Re "County leaders hear flood of [expletives]," April 22
It isn't any wonder that the incidence of profanity and brutish disregard for other people attending L.A. City Council and County Board of Supervisors meetings has risen so drastically.
The threats, name-calling and profanity that spew from the mouth of the president of the United States have inspired the angriest, most destructive members of our society to embrace their lowest impulses and intentions.
President Trump did not invent hatred, greed or disrespect, but he has recognized their usefulness and put them to work to aggrandize himself in the eyes of a certain subset of Americans at the expense of the rest of us.
Ina Scott
Lancaster
::
Government officials are helpless to curtail profanity because they have been told by judges that such abusive language in public meetings is protected speech.
But do the same judges tolerate such abusive speech in their own courtrooms? Of course not. Even though courtrooms are intrinsically just another type of public meeting, they are also the last vestige of royalty in which members of the public would be instantly held in contempt for using such language.
Perhaps officials could pass an ordinance that all public meetings should be conducted with freedom of expression, subject to the same degree of decorum as in public courtrooms.
Cyril Barnert
Los Angeles
::
It's a sad state of affairs when people attending meetings of the Board of Supervisors and the Los Angeles Police Commission can use slurs and profanity. It's a reflection of the general lack of civility in our society.
The use of this language demeans the public hearings to the point where people who want to attend will instead skip these meetings because they do not want to subject themselves to this disgusting behavior.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled there are limits to our freedoms of speech and expression. This problem is serious enough that the county and city must appeal any court losses to the highest courts of the land.
Robert Newman
West Hills
::
Perhaps people shouting expletives are simply channeling Mayor Eric Garcetti.
At a public celebration of the L.A. Kings winning professional hockey's Stanley Cup in 2014, Garcetti said to the crowd, "This is a big f------ day." It was heard loud and clear.

Is a CEO worth $65 million?
Re "Iger's payday called 'insane,' " Business, April 23
The $65-million compensation package for Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Robert Iger may be extreme, but it fits a pattern in which Fortune 500 CEO pay has increased from about 30 times the median worker wage in the 1970s to 300 times or more today.
In effect, these CEOs are telling their employees that they have lost 90% of their value to their companies relative to top corporate officers over the decades. But of course this can't be true.
No matter how they try to rationalize it, the explanation lies in a single word: greed.
Alan B. Posner
Santa Barbara
::
Disney is a greedy company under the leadership of Iger and previous CEOs, and this shows especially at the company's resort in Anaheim. That was not the case during founder Walt Disney's days.
In 1996, the city of Anaheim agreed to build a massive parking structure for Disneyland's guests. To rent this facility, Disney pays Anaheim $1 per year, and yet it charges customers $20 to park there. When the city finishes paying off the bonds it sold to finance construction, it will transfer ownership to Disney, as reported by the L.A. Times.
This year, Disneyland started paying a minimum hourly wage of $15, which is good news, but it is due to the tight employment market and political pressure more than generosity. Plus, how many of these hourly workers are full-time employees with benefits?
Over the years, Disney is estimated to have received more than $1 billion in subsidies from the city of Anaheim, even though it reaps huge profits from its theme parks and raises the price of admission to whatever the market will bear.

The Russians didn't win in 2016
Re "Mueller indicted a gullible public," Opinion, April 21
The American public isn't nearly as gullible as Virginia Heffernan suggests.
It is true that Russia interfered with our democratic process by offering aid to the Trump campaign and seeding anti-Hillary Clinton postings throughout social media. But the primary messenger for Donald Trump was Donald Trump.
His bombastic views about immigrants and foreigners threatening America resonated with millions of voters. Heffernan's advice to Americans to "refuse to be drafted into the next infowar" won't make a dime's worth of difference to people who genuinely believe Trump represents their "values" and is making America great again.
Trump's election wasn't a result of gullibility; it was a result of relatability. It wasn't the Russians who threw our election process into disarray and sent us down the populist road we are now traveling. It was us.
That more than anything else is what was un-American about 2016.
Kenneth Konecnik
Mundelein, Ill.
::
Did I miss something really important? Could Heffernan have discovered that Justice Department special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had "indicted a gullible public"?
More importantly, can she explain how whatever the Russian government said in 2016 was more important to the public than what the American media said? Large newspapers like the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times vigorously opposed Trump.
Is the voting public's sin that it did not do what the L.A. Times wanted?
Arthur Armstrong
Manhattan Beach
::
The only gullible members of the public are the blind partisans buying into media liberals like Heffernan.
Clinton lost the 2016 election because she felt entitled to the presidency and, like most in the press, was arrogantly condescending to opponents.
As Heffernan and pundits who agree with her extend their juvenile insults and attacks beyond Trump to all his supporters, they go beyond a disreputable irrelevancy to become a total laughingstock.

Kellyanne Conway: Democrats 'desperate' to stop Trump-like Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said on Wednesday that Democrats are scrambling to kill off the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. because he’s too popular for the party’s own good.

“The Democrats seem really desperate to find an alternative to Bernie Sanders,” Conway said on Fox News. “He’s the clear, announced front-runner right now, in the polling and on the ground.”

Conway was asked about an impending announcement from former Vice President Joe Biden, who is expected to declare a run for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday.

She said Biden represents a more mainstream voice to which Sanders is the antithesis. This, she said, scares Democratic Party leadership.

“Bernie Sanders has a lot in common with Donald Trump,” Conway added. “Which is he doesn’t really care what his party thinks about his candidacy, at this point in the primaries, he’s connecting directly with the voters and raising small dollar amounts.”

Bernie has polled well in the early going of the 2020 Democratic primary. According to a RealClearPolitics average of polls, he trails only Biden.

South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, also a 2020 candidate, told the New York Times he doubted the resolve of Sanders’ coalition and said the self-described democratic socialist lacked the novelty he possessed in 2016.

Sanders was surprisingly competitive in the 2016 primary, and emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and published by WikiLeaks showed that some officials sought to tilt the contest in favor of Hillary Clinton. Although Clinton won the nomination and Sanders went on to support her candidacy, members of his base were resentful.

This time around, the issue of general election defectors remains a factor.

A so-called “Bernie or Bust” wing of Sanders’ base claims they’ll switch over after the primary election should Sanders lose and vote for Trump in 2020, like 12% of them did in 2016. A new Emerson College poll revealed that even more could be susceptible to voting for Trump instead of a similar left-wing candidate to Sanders.

“The only difference between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump,” Conway said. “ ... is that Bernie Sanders’ ideas are terrible for America.”

Texto completo: “Me pregunto si The New York Times se disculpará conmigo por segunda vez, como lo hicieron después de las elecciones de 2016. Pero esta vez tendrá que ser una disculpa mucho más grande y mejor. En este caso, tendrán que arrodillarse y pedir perdón, ¡son verdaderamente el Enemigo del Pueblo! ”, escribió el mandatario Donald Trump el martes en Twitter.
Según él, el diario más importante del país debe “arrodillarse y pedir perdón” por su cobertura negativa de su presidencia, como parte de un desgarro de Twitter ayer contra una variedad de medios de comunicación.
El presidente también criticó a Paul Krugman, columnista de ese diario, cuyo último artículo de opinión dice “uno de nuestros dos partidos”, en referencia al Republicano, “ya no cree en los valores estadounidenses”.
La columna criticaba a Trump y los resultados de la investigación del fiscal especial Robert Mueller sobre la supuesta injerencia de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016 , afirmando que el mandatario estaba consciente de la intervención en su campaña por parte de una “potencia extranjera hostil” y, una vez en el cargo, trató de obstruir cualquier investigación sobre ese hecho.
“Paul Krugman, de Fake News New York Times, ha perdido toda credibilidad, al igual que el mismo Times, con sus escritos falsos y altamente inexactos sobre mí. Él está obsesionado con el odio, al igual que otros están obsesionados con lo estúpido que él es. Dijo que el mercado se estrellaría, ¡Sólo los máximos históricos!”, escribió Trump en Twitter.
Añadió: “¡Los radicales demócratas de izquierda, junto con sus líderes en los medios de noticias falsos, se han vuelto completamente locos! Supongo que eso significa que la agenda republicana está funcionando. ¡Manténte sintonizado, viene más!”
También cuestionó a Chris Cuomo de CNN y al canal por darle un programa en horario estelar. Y a Joe Scarborough de MSNBC, diciendo que el presentador de “Morning Joe” ha “caído en picada” y lo llamó “demasiado enojado, tonto y enfermo”.
Paul Krugman, of the Fake News New York Times, has lost all credibility, as has the Times itself, with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me. He is obsessed with hatred, just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. He said Market would crash, Only Record Highs!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019
I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger & better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!

Texto completo: NEW YORK (AP) — The Oscars have tweaked a few rules, but not any that would limit the eligibility of Netflix films at the Academy Awards.
The Academy of Motion Pictures' board of governors early Wednesday announced a handful of changes passed during its annual April rules meeting. But the biggest news was what the 54-person board elected not to alter: the one-week theatrical release required for an Oscar nomination.
Many in Hollywood, including some academy board members, have argued that a more substantial release should be required than what the academy's Rule Two stipulates: a seven-day run in a commercial Los Angeles County theater with at least three screenings a day.
Netflix premieres most of its movies directly on its streaming platform, but last year made exceptions for a handful of titles, most notably Alfonso Cuaron's "Roma. " The film was nominated for 10 awards and won three. Major theater chains have refused to screen movies that don't adhere to the traditional 90-day theatrical window.
In a statement, academy president John Bailey said the issue "weighed heavily" in the board's discussions. But for now, a brief theatrical release remains the bar for entry.
"We support the theatrical experience as integral to the art of motion pictures, and this weighed heavily in our discussions," said Bailey. "Our rules currently require theatrical exhibition, and also allow for a broad selection of films to be submitted for Oscars consideration. We plan to further study the profound changes occurring in our industry and continue discussions with our members about these issues. "
Among those reportedly interested in expanding the academy's eligibility rule was Steven Spielberg, who has previously said streaming films ought to win Emmys, not Oscars. But Spielberg has also said initial reports mischaracterized his attitudes. In a New York Times story published Tuesday, Spielberg said he advocates for the survival of the theatrical experience but believes that, big screen or small screen, "everyone should have access to great stories. "
The board did elect to rename the best foreign language film award the best international feature film award. Larry Karaszewski and Diane Weyermann, co-chairs of the category's committee, said the term "foreign" is "outdated within the global filmmaking community. " The category's shortlist will also be expanded from nine to 10.
"We believe that 'international feature film' better represents this category, and promotes a positive and inclusive view of filmmaking, and the art of film as a universal experience," they said in a statement.
The makeup and hairstyling category will also grow from three nominees to five.

Deportaciones de inmigrantes con esta característica crece 266% en Nueva York

Texto completo: La mano dura de ICE bajo el gobierno de Donald Trump se sigue sintiendo con fuerza en la vida de inmigrantes que nunca han cometido un delito.
Según un reporte del New York Times la deportación de inmigrantes del área de la ciudad de Nueva York sin antecedentes penales, incluidos solicitantes de asilo con órdenes de deportación de años o décadas anteriores, aumentaron a 1,144 en el año fiscal de 2018 pasando de 313 deportaciones en 2016, lo que representa un aumento del 266% por ciento, según un informe reciente del contralor de la ciudad.
“Ese es el mayor aumento porcentual de cualquier oficina de campo de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas en el país”. , asegura el reporte.
La administración de Trump dijo que los agentes de ICE están siguiendo la ley al tratar de devolver a los solicitantes de asilo que han perdido sus casos y que por lo tanto no tienen derecho a permanecer en el país. Política que va de la mano con el aumento de la tasa de denegación de asilo que fue de casi el 62% en 2017, frente a un 57% por ciento en 2016, según el Foro Nacional de Inmigración.
Durante el gobierno de Obama, los jueces de inmigración recibieron instrucciones de utilizar su discreción para permitir que indocumentados sin pasado judicial permanecieran en el país, como solicitantes de asilo que habían perdido sus casos, pero a quienes se les daba la capacidad de permanecer y trabajar legalmente en los Estados Unidos mientras se registraran con ICE. Sin embargo bajo la administración de Donald Trump esa política ha cambiado drásticamente.
Uno de estos es el caso de Indra Sihotang , un inmigrante que literalmente se aferró a una silla cuando los funcionarios de ICE trataron de cargarlo en un vuelo de regreso a Indonesia, donde ” la persecución de cristianos como él” se “intensificó”, continuó el New York Times .
Sihotang al igual que muchos otros inmigrantes, fue arrestado durante lo que supuso que era un registro de rutina de ICE. Los defensores de los derechos de los inmigrantes han apodado este tipo de arrestos como “redadas silenciosas”.
Tras la escena en el aeropuerto, ni a Sihotang ni a ICE se les permitió abordar el vuelo comercial. ICE una vez más intentó deportarlo, y él estaba sentado en una camioneta de camino al aeropuerto cuando los agentes recibieron una llamada para detener su deportación.
Si bien Sihotang había perdido su caso de asilo hace cinco años, “un juez determinó que el Sr. Sihotang enfrentó miedos creíbles de persecución en Indonesia y reabrió su caso de asilo, que sigue sin resolverse”.

Wrestling superstar John Cena called the 'Babe Ruth' of the WWE on his birthday

Texto completo: World Wrestling Entertainment boss Vince McMahon on Tuesday bestowed the ultimate compliment on John Cena,a West Newbury native who's parlayed his career as a WWE grappler into colossal movie and music stardom.
McMahon tweeted out a birthday message to Cena, who turned 42 on Tuesday, and compared him to baseball legend Babe Ruth.
“Happy birthday to @WWE's Babe Ruth, @JohnCena!," McMahon tweeted. “I really can't describe in words how much @JohnCenameans to me and the @WWEUniverse. #HustleLoyaltyRespectLove."
Former boxing champ Vinny Paz, a Cranston, R.I. native, seconded the sentiment, replying to McMahon, “All 4 of those. That's amazing for one person to have all of them. They don't make them like this anymore."
Cena, meanwhile, tweeted out photos of his shirtless, chiseled frame to his 11.6 million followers.
“Turned 42 today," Cena wrote. “Shot these and realize that by sharing I open the door towards ANY comments you have. But I share these for the message within them. WE ARE THE SUM OF OUR ACTIONS. 42 is usually a forgettable # but it's special for me."
How?
“I found my passion for fitness by beginning a dedicated workout/nutrition program at (yes this is correct) age 12," Cena tweeted. “This year I celebrate 30 years of chasing the unattainable, and never giving up. 30 years of pushing beyond limits, never giving up."
He said Tuesday marked “30 years of overcoming failures, literally facing the man in the mirror, and knowing that growth will come thru pain and discomfort, and never giving up. Find your passion. The thing you can do for 30 years and hope for 30 more. And chase it. With the 'best you' everyday."
Cena also included a word of caution amid the inspirational verbiage.
“No matter what you chase, it is NOT easy, even when you enjoy it!" he wrote. “Because we all have good and bad days, embrace the good and fight like hell thru the bad. Never give up. 30 years. Straight. And I'm just getting warmed up! Own Your Everything!"
Cena's biography on the WWE website lists a number of his accolades in and out of the squared circle.
“He's a 16-time World Champion, New York Times best-selling author and record-setting Make-A-Wish granter," the bio says. “He's released a hit album, starred in blockbuster movies, and carried the torch for WWE since he first set foot in a WWE ring nearly two decades ago. If you really can't see John Cena at this point, chances are you simply aren't looking."
Plus he's defeated a number of other leading lights in tights.
“Cena's resume of defeated foes comprises future WWE Hall of Famers like The Rock, Randy Orton, Batista, Brock Lesnar and Triple H and some of WWE's new guard in Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, Rusev, Kevin Owens and Bray Wyatt," the bio says.
It should be noted that pro wrestling matches are scripted slobberknockers that feature acrobatic moves, flamboyant costumes, and splashy rhetoric from combatants to the delight of a rabid fan base.
But while the outcome's predetermined, you still have to sell it.
“Cena still finds time to adjust attitudes and knuckle-shuffle fools into defeat on the regular," his bio says. “Sure, a few detractors might chant 'Cena sucks,' but for John Cena, rising above hate is just part of the job description, and he's still making camp on the mountaintop waiting for someone to take a swing."

Biden Plans to Shutter His Foundation When He Enters 2020 Race

Texto completo: Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to wind down his personal charity, the Biden Foundation, when he enters the 2020 presidential race, people briefed on the preparations said on Monday.
Mr. Biden, the former vice president, and his wife, Jill, formed the nonprofit group after he left office in 2017. The group had raised $ 6.6 million by the end of that year, financing initiatives on issues like expanding gay rights, making college more affordable and ending violence against women.
The Biden Foundation also became a gathering place for Mr. Biden's longtime allies and political advisers in advance of a likely presidential campaign, with a board chaired by his former chief of staff, Ted Kaufman, and an executive director, Louisa Terrell, with deep experience on Capitol Hill and in the Obama administration.
By preparing to unravel his flagship organization, Mr. Biden may be hoping to avoid some of the financial and conflict-of-interest questions that shadowed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election, when her family foundation continued to operate and receive large donations and grants as she was pursuing the White House.
The people who confirmed Mr. Biden's intention to shutter the group spoke on condition of anonymity, in order to discuss confidential preparations for his presidential campaign. The Biden Foundation would likely suspend its activities immediately and then begin a longer process of gradually dismantling itself.
The people familiar with the foundation's plans declined to discuss many of the specifics, including whether some of its staff and programs could be spun off or preserved in another form.
Bill Russo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, and Melanie Fonder Kaye, a spokeswoman for the Biden Foundation, both declined to comment.
Mr. Biden is expected to announce his presidential candidacy as soon as the middle of this week.
The Biden Foundation is not the only nonprofit entity he created after leaving office, and the fate of the wider network of groups and university centers associated with him remains to be seen. He has backed other charities, including the Biden Cancer Initiative and the Beau Biden Foundation, and academic institutions like the University of Pennsylvania's Biden Center for Diplomacy and Public Engagement.
A number of the senior officials at those organizations are people who have long been expected to join Mr. Biden's presidential campaign or advise it on policy from the outside.
A New York Times review found earlier this year that Mr. Biden's various entities had no fewer than 49 staff or board members who had worked for Mr. Biden, for former President Barack Obama's administration, or for one of the Obama or Biden presidential campaigns.
Of all his projects, Mr. Biden's personal foundation may have offered the clearest display of his political and financial network.
The group disclosed its donors online, listing large contributions from influential figures like Tim Gill, the Colorado software entrepreneur and gay-rights activist; Bernard Schwartz, an investor and longtime Democratic donor; and Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles.
At least some of his foundation's financial supporters are expected to help underwrite his presidential candidacy.
Mr. Biden's web of financial supporters has never been as extensive or prolific in its contributions as the one assembled over the years by Hillary and Bill Clinton. Partly as a result, Mr. Biden's charities have operated on a tiny fraction of the scale of the Clinton Foundation.
Rather than financing international humanitarian projects and high-profile events like the meetings of the Clinton Global Initiative, much of the Biden Foundation's funding has gone toward staff salaries. Its only grant in 2017 totaled about half a million dollars, which was used to spin off the Biden Cancer Initiative as a separate project.
But in a sign that Mr. Biden was seeking to minimize his political vulnerabilities well in advance of the 2020 election, aides said he had declined to accept foreign funding for any of his nonprofits. And his cancer-research group is said to refuse donations from pharmaceutical companies.
Should Mr. Biden back away from the race at the last minute, his foundation would likely continue operating, people familiar with the plans said.
But Mr. Biden's closest allies expect him to become a candidate within days, and Mr. Biden began accepting checks for a presidential campaign last week.

Byron York: For some Dems, breaking up with dossier is hard to do

Texto completo: The Steele dossier, that collection of incendiary allegations against Donald Trump compiled for the Hillary Clinton campaign by the former British spy Christopher Steele, was already widely discredited before the release of the Mueller report. Now, the report has hammered a few additional nails in the dossier's coffin.

Mueller's work "underscored what had grown clearer for months," the New York Times reported recently, "that while many Trump aides had welcomed contacts with the Russians, some of the most sensational claims in the dossier appeared to be false, and others were impossible to prove." Mueller, the Times noted, included a number of references to the dossier's allegations, "but no overall assessment of why so much did not check out."

The dossier alleged a massive, long-running conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, complete with money, politics, and sex. Among its most sensational charges:

** The allegation that in 2013, in a Moscow hotel room, Trump watched as prostitutes performed a "golden showers" show on a bed in which former President Barack Obama had once slept, while Russian spy cameras recorded the whole thing.

** The allegation that the head of Rosneft, the giant Russian state-owned oil and gas company, offered low-level Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page billions of dollars in return for ending U.S. sanctions against Russia.

** The allegation that in August 2016 Trump fixer Michael Cohen met Russian officials in Prague to arrange secret payments to Russian hackers who attacked the Clinton campaign.

** The allegation that short-term Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort managed a "well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between [the campaign] and the Russian leadership," including "an intelligence exchange [that] had been running between them for at least eight years," and that Manafort was succeeded in that job by Cohen after Manafort left the campaign.

None of Steele's charges were confirmed in the Mueller report. Some were specifically debunked. Others were ignored. In short, the report's release was not good news for Christopher Steele.

In the wake of Mueller's findings, there are videos going around the Internet of liberal media figures saying embarrassingly credulous things about the dossier. They even invented a new standard of evidence -- "not proven untrue" -- to justify believing it long after its main claims had been either discredited or were dying for lack of proof.

But that's just TV talk. What was remarkable about the dossier was that some Democrats in key positions in government -- lawmakers who had access to the nation's deepest secrets -- embraced the dossier and used its allegations against the president even though they knew, or should have known, there was no evidence to support them.

It can be difficult to remember how completely those Democrats embraced the dossier. But start more than two years ago, on March 20, 2017, when the House Intelligence Committee held a hearing entitled "Russian Active Measures Investigation," featuring testimony from FBI director James Comey and National Security Agency chief Michael Rogers. Committee Democrats made the dossier a key part of their attacks on the president.

It began with Rep. Adam Schiff, who was the ranking Democrat at the time and is now the committee's chairman.

"According to Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who is reportedly held in high regard by U.S. intelligence," Schiff began, as he detailed the dossier's unsupported Carter Page/Rosneft allegation.

And then: "Also according to Steele's Russian sources," Schiff said before outlining the dossier's unsupported allegation that Russia offered the Trump campaign documents damaging to Hillary Clinton.

And then: "According to Steele," Schiff said before recounting the dossier's unsupported allegation that Manafort managed the Trump-Russia conspiracy.

And then: "Is it a coincidence that the Russian gas company Rosneft sold a 19 percent share after former British intelligence officer Steele was told by Russian sources that Carter Page was offered fees on a deal of just that size?"

And then: "Is it a coincidence that Steele's Russian sources also affirmed that Russia had stolen documents hurtful to Secretary Clinton that it would utilize in exchange for pro Russian policies that would later come to pass?"

And that was just Schiff. Then came Democratic Rep. Andre Carson: "In fact, the dossier written by former MI6 agent Christopher Steele alleges that Trump agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue which is effectively a priority for Vladimir Putin. There is a lot in the dossier that has yet to be proven, but, increasingly, as we will hear throughout the day, allegations are checking out. And this one seems to be as accurate as they come."

And then came Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier: "In July of 2016, [Page] gives a graduation speech at the New Economic School, denies meeting with the Prime Minister. Christopher Steele in his dossier says he met with, again, Igor Sechin, offering a 19 percent interest in Rosneft. It becomes the biggest transfer of public property to private ownership."

And then came Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro, now a candidate for president, who based his entire questioning on the dossier. Forgive the long quotation:

"I want to take a moment to turn to the Christopher Steele dossier, which was first mentioned in the media just before the election and published in full by media outlets in January. My focus today is to explore how many claims within Steele's dossier are looking more and more likely as though they are accurate...
The reputation of the author, Christopher Steele, as a former accomplished British intelligence officer with a career built on following Russia, is important. This is not someone who doesn't know how to run a source and not someone without contacts.
The allegations it raises about President Trump's campaign aides' connections to Russians, when overlaid with known, established facts and timelines from the 2016 campaign, are very revealing. So let's begin...
The dossier definitely seems right on these points. A quid pro quo relationship seems to exist between the Trump campaign and Putin's Russia. A July 19, 2016, entry, for example, asserts that Russians were receiving intel from Trump's team on Russian oligarchs and their families in the United States.
An entry from June 20, 2016, states, quote, "Trump and his inner circle have accepted regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals," unquote, which is something for something.
A July 30 entry likewise states that, quote, "a source close to the Trump campaign confirms regular exchange with the Kremlin has existed for at least 8 years, including intelligence fed back to Russia on oligarchs' activities in the United States."
And I know that my colleagues have touched upon this, but I think it is important, in the context of Christopher Steele's dossier, to bring it up again. So my question is, is it likely or plausible that the Russians might seek out Americans for Moscow's purposes?...
So the dossier states in an entry dated August 10, 2016, that a, quote, "Kremlin official involved in U.S. relations," unquote, suggests that Moscow might offer assistance to, quote, "sympathetic U.S. actors." Does this sound like a plausible tactic out of the Russian playbook? ...
Now, let's get even more specific. Among the U.S. actors this Kremlin official mentions are Carter Page and Michael Flynn, whom my colleagues have already discussed at length and which the dossier describes as, quote, "examples of successes" by the Kremlin official. We know Carter Page went to Moscow on July 7 to give a speech to the New Economic School. We are in possession of the slide deck from his speech there. And we know Carter Page obtained approval from the Trump campaign manager at the time, Corey Lewandowski, as reported in Politico, citing national security campaign official J.D. Gordon. Now, let me ask you another question with respect to somebody else. Is it correct that Igor Sechin, the president of Russian oil giant Rosneft, is a former member of Russian intelligence and a longtime aide and confidant to Vladimir Putin? ...
In an October 18, 2016, entry, the dossier states that, during Page's visit to Moscow, he met with Igor Sechin, offering, quote, "Page and Trump's associate the brokerage of up to 19 percent stake in Rosneft," with Page conferring that, quote, "if Trump were elected U.S. President, sanctions on Russia would be lifted." And although, fortunately, the White House hasn't been so naive as to unilaterally lift sanctions on Russia, it was widely reported that on January 27 of this year Rosneft sold a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft in what Reuters calls, quote, "one of its biggest privatizations since the 1990s." Furthermore, Reuters reported that, quote, "public records show the ownership structure of the stake ultimately includes a Cayman Islands company whose beneficial owners cannot be traced." What a coincidence...
An entry from July 19, 2016, in the dossier states that a Trump associate knew that the Kremlin was using WikiLeaks in order to maintain, quote, "plausible deniability of its involvement." Three days after this entry, WikiLeaks carries out the Kremlin's wishes and publishes upwards of 20,000 stolen DNC emails and 8,000 associated email attachments. And the rest, as they say, is history.
Another entry, dated August 17, has Carter Page and a Russian associate discussing WikiLeaks publishing emails in order to swing Sanders supporters away from Clinton and to Trump. And, again, from a September 14 entry of the dossier: "Kremlin has further compromising material on Clinton in the form of emails and considers disseminating after parliamentary elections in late September." And on October 7, WikiLeaks publishes John Podesta's hacked emails. So the coincidences keep piling up.

Again, apologies for the long quotation. And things went on from there. Suffice it to say Democrats relied -- heavily relied -- on the dossier.

The problem was, proof of the dossier's claims was not forthcoming. Since the allegations were so spectacular, House Intelligence Committee Republicans were eager to know what the FBI was doing to verify the charges and whether the bureau had had any success. House GOP investigators -- remember, they were in the majority at the time -- issued request after request, and finally a subpoena, to the FBI for information about dossier verification efforts.

The bureau resisted for months. Finally, in November 2017, FBI and Justice Department officials admitted to the House that they had not been able to verify any of the dossier's substantive allegations.

That did not stop Schiff. "A lot of it has turned out to be true," he told the Wall Street Journal that November, after the FBI and DOJ briefings. "The biggest thing that I think people need to realize about the dossier is that Christopher Steele discovered that the Russians were embarked on a broad effort to help the Trump campaign before our own intelligence agencies came to the same conclusion. In the broadest outline of what he investigated, he proved more than prescient -- he proved accurate in terms of the Russian involvement and what their motivations were."

Thus was born the "broadly accurate" argument about the dossier. Maybe Steele got some details wrong, the argument went. But he got the big picture -- collusion -- right.

The problem was, months went by and still the U.S. government failed to corroborate the key accusations of the dossier. And as they failed to verify the dossier's particular charges, they also failed to verify the big picture. Out of sight, Mueller was failing, too. The special counsel interviewed Steele, and the Mueller report contains several references to Steele's reporting, although it never uses the word "dossier." And it confirmed nothing.

In the wake of the Mueller report, the question is not whether the dossier's charges were accurate, but why they were so wrong.

"How the dossier ended up loaded with dubious or exaggerated details remains uncertain," the New York Times reported, "but the document may be the result of a high-stakes game of telephone, in which rumors and hearsay were passed from source to source."

In retrospect, it was entirely wishful thinking to believe that a set of false allegations would somehow add up to a true big picture. And -- this was clear from the start -- the parts of the dossier that were accurate, like the fact that Carter Page traveled to Moscow in July 2016, were publicly reported at the time. Steele was a bad spy, but he could at least read the newspaper.

"Many of the validated assertions were already percolating in the press and Western intelligence agencies by the time Mr. Steele began compiling the dossier in the summer of 2016, including that Russia was trying to harm Mrs. Clinton," the Wall Street Journal recently reported.

Yet some of the Democrats who embraced the dossier years ago cannot seem to let it go. Now in charge of the House Intelligence Committee, Schiff has begun an all-new Trump-Russia investigation. As part of that, he has hired as an investigator former federal prosecutor Daniel Goldman, who just a few months ago said of the Steele dossier, "Nothing has been undermined thus far."

Another Intelligence Committee Democrat, Rep. Eric Swalwell, is now running for president and is still sticking up for the dossier. In a surreal exchange with Fox News' Martha MacCallum recently, Swalwell refused to find any fault with Steele's work.

"So it doesn't bother you," MacCallum asked, "that the Clinton campaign paid for a dossier to be put together by someone who had all kinds of ties to intelligence and put together something that turned out to be not necessarily factual?"

"Which part -- which part of it hasn't been proved factual?" Swalwell responded.

"Well, Christopher Steele himself said it was not a finished work product -- " MacCallum said.

"He doesn't say it wasn't factual, though," Swalwell said. "Which part was not proved factual?

"I mean, are you serious?" MacCallum asked.

"Yes," said Swalwell. "Tell me. I'm here. Tell me."

"So you think that the dossier -- "

"Which part wasn't proved factual?"

"Okay, for one thing, Michael Cohen said he never went to Prague," MacCallum said. "Do you agree with that?"

"But which part has been proved to be not factual?" Swalwell said.

For the record, the Mueller report confirmed that Cohen never went to Prague. But in a larger sense, what is the lesson of the Swalwell interview? It is that some Democrats, even those who have access to highly classified intelligence and should know better, will give up the dossier only when, as gun lovers used to say, you pry their cold, dead fingers from it. Mueller report or no Mueller report, for some high-ranking Trump adversaries, the dossier lives on.

Texto completo: BATH — The internationally renowned Celtic super group, Cherish the Ladies, bring their “Heart of the Home” world tour for their only New England performance to the Chocolate Church Arts Center at 7:30 p.m. Friday, May 3, at 804 Washington St.
Cherish the Ladies is celebrating 33 years of making music with their recent world tour. This is sure to be a big Celtic celebration featuring some of the best Celtic musicians, singers and dancers as the band celebrates 34 years of making music.
“It is simply impossible to imagine an audience that wouldn’t enjoy what they do,” says the Boston Globe speaking of Cherish the Ladies, the long-running, Grammy-nominated, Irish-American super group that formed in New York City in 1985 to celebrate the rise of women in what had been a male-dominated Irish music scene and has since toured the world, played the White House and the Olympics, recorded 17 outstanding albums, including a live recording, “An Irish Homecoming,” which was simultaneously videotaped for a Public Television special that aired across America and won an Emmy.
Under the leadership of All-Ireland flute and whistle champion Joanie Madden, named by the Irish Voice Newspaper as one of the top 25 most influential Irish Americans of the past quarter century, the women create an evening that includes a spectacular blend of instrumental talents, beautiful vocals, captivating arrangements and stunning step dancing. Their continued success as one of the top Celtic groups in the world is due to the ensemble’s ability to take the best of Irish traditional music and dance and put it forth in an immensely entertaining show.
The New York Times calls their music “passionate, tender, and rambunctious,” and the Washington Post praises their “astonishing array of virtuosity.” They’ve won recognition as the BBC’s Best Musical Group of the Year and were named Top North American Celtic Group at the Irish Music Awards.
This is an opportunity for the whole family to experience one of the most celebrated Celtic bands in the world and it’s a perfect present for Mother’s Day.
Tickets are $35 advance, $40 door $15 student. Tickets and more information can be found at www.chocolatechurcharts.org or call the box office at 207-442-8455.

Resumen: We recommend an excellent history of the Apollo 11 mission, Alexander McCall Smith’s foray into the Scandinavian crime novel genre, and other gems.

Texto completo: Monitor reviewers were captivated this month by a raft of offerings, from memoirs and meditations to books about historic events and social issues. The April releases proved to be a boon for book lovers of all tastes. 
1 The Department of Sensitive Crimes, by Alexander McCall Smith
Detective Varg investigates crimes too odd or baffling for the police department in Malmö, Sweden. An imaginary boyfriend is reported missing. A man is stabbed – in the back of his knee. Varg is a quiet crusader for justice who doesn’t miss a detail. Chicanery is exposed; mercy is exacted. It’s hard to imagine a less dark Scandinavian police novel, or one that is more winning.
2 Lost and Wanted, by Nell Freudenberger
Physicist and mother Helen Clapp is a highly accomplished author and professor. When her best friend Charlotte (“Charlie”) dies, her world changes as she engages with Charlie’s family and friends. Timely and delightfully observant of relationships, this novel is deeply heartfelt, amazingly intellectual, and beautifully thought provoking.  
3 Charged, by Emily Bazelon
Journalist and lawyer Emily Bazelon shines light on the under-examined role of prosecutors in America’s crisis-level incarceration rates. This rigorous, compassionate, and vital book argues that district attorneys who focus more on mercy and less on simply locking people up have a pivotal role to play in fixing the criminal justice system. 
4 The League of Wives, by Heath Hardage Lee
When their husbands were taken captive in Vietnam, military wives were told to keep quiet until the U.S. government could bring them home. In this new lens on the Vietnam War, Heath Hardage Lee shows how the “reluctant sorority” of POW and MIA wives evolved slowly, and sometimes painfully, into warriors in their own right, confronting senators, ambassadors, and even the president in the effort to save their loved ones.
5 American Moonshot, by Douglas Brinkley
The 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969 has provoked a stream of books, and one of the best to appear in the early part of the year was written by popular historian Douglas Brinkley. His book makes the space program even more dramatic by matching it with the life story of President John F. Kennedy.
6 Falter, by Bill McKibben
Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, the first  organization to combat climate change, is done playing Mr. Nice Guy and has ramped up his efforts to save us from ourselves. “Falter” lays out in blunt terms how and why the human game went wrong, who and what was responsible, and how we, if we are determined enough, can fix it. There is no time to lose. “Falter” is a rallying cry for the environmental movement.
7 Possessed by Memory, by Harold Bloom
Harold Bloom, America’s preeminent literary critic, is lying awake at night reciting lines from poems. It’s not a way to count sheep; rather, he’s gleaning from the verses the “inward light” that will comfort him as he enters the “elegy season.” This audacious personal odyssey offers readers a cosmos of possibilities when contemplating what happens once we “shuffle off this mortal coil.”
8 Solid Seasons, by Jeffrey S. Cramer
As in all long friendships, Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson had their periods of revelations and frustrations. Jeffrey S. Cramer explores their relationship through their own words, demonstrating that Thoreau could not fully appreciate Emerson, and he lacked Emerson’s ability to love another person, warts and all.
9 Save Me the Plums, by Ruth Reichl
How we’ve missed sitting down to a virtual meal with Ruth Reichl. The latest memoir from the food writer covers her decade as the final editor of Gourmet magazine, bringing us into an elite world that mixes “Top Chef” with “The Devil Wears Prada.” Reichl is reflective, dishy, deeply personal – and even willing to share a few recipes. 
10 K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches, by Tyler Kepner
Baseball junkies will love this book. Even casual fans will get a kick out of it. The New York Times baseball writer Tyler Kepner examines America’s pastime through the squinty eyes of a pitcher. The author captures the glory and quirkiness of the sport he clearly loves, from the spitball to the “scroogie.”

On Earth Day, let's restore bipartisanship on the environment: Feingold and Thompson

Texto completo: The environment has become a polarizing issue in recent years, but as honorary co-chairs of the “Year of the Environment” launching Monday on Earth Day, we are hoping to help make it a bipartisan cause again.
The initiative, aimed at commemorating a half-century of bipartisan environmental progress, will include 12 months of celebrations, special events and public lectures leading up to next year’s 50th anniversary of the first Earth Day, brainchild of the late Wisconsin senator and governor, Democrat Gaylord Nelson.
It’s kicking off at the Gaylord Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which hosts an annual Earth Day Conference conducted in the spirit of the original 1970 “teach-in. ” The event is called Imagine and Adapt: Possibilities in a Changing World.
We urge Americans to become what the Nelson Institute calls “New Environmental Citizens” — people who understand that the environment is at work all around us, including (and especially) in cities. The environment is not some abstract concept, but something that connects and unites us all. The environment is embedded in our everyday lives, whether it’s the food we eat, water we drink, air we breathe, or communities where we live.

Mayors: As floods deluge Midwest towns, where is national response to climate disasters?
A brief history of President Trump's environmental record. (Hint: It's long and troubling)
Greta Thunberg, student protesters should demand better solutions to climate change
As Gaylord Nelson put it, “The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment. "
As a nation, we’ve made great progress in cleaning up our water and air since the first Earth Day, which was a unifying event, but that unity has eroded in recent years, as the global conversation has shifted to combating the effects of climate change.
First Earth Day was life-changing
In 1969, after a massive oil spill in Santa Barbara, California killed thousands of birds, fish, and sea mammals, then-Sen. Nelson called for a nationwide teach-in on the environment in a speech in Seattle. The first Earth Day was held April 22 the next year.
“If the environment had any enemies they did not make themselves known,” the New York Times observed.
On that original Earth Day, Congress adjourned for the day so members could speak at events — and two-thirds of them did so. An estimated 20 million people participated in cities and towns, at 2,000 college campuses, 10,000 elementary and high schools, and other venues, including Fifth Avenue in New York City, which Republican Mayor John Lindsay closed to traffic as thousands mobbed the city’s central artery.
But as Adam Rome wrote in “The Genius of Earth Day: How a 1970 Teach-in Unexpectedly Made the First Green Generation,” the teach-in went well beyond numbers.
“Because Earth Day 1970 was unprecedented, the organizers had to plan everything in their communities from scratch, and the effort was life-changing,” Rome wrote, noting that thousands of organizers and participants across the country decided to dedicate their lives to the environment.
Later that year, Republican president Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and signed into law the Clean Air Act. The Senate had passed it unanimously.
Common ground is conservation
Finding common ground again is critical, and there have been a few hopeful signs in recent months. In February, overwhelming majorities of both houses of Congress passed a comprehensive public lands conservation bill, which will protect more than a million acres of wilderness and permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. President Donald Trump signed the bill into law last month.
The bill’s passage demonstrates that even in today’s polarized atmosphere, Republicans recognize that there is strong public support for conservation.
Working in our different leadership roles, we’ve tried to do our part for the environment. One of us made purchasing and saving lands for conservation a major priority as Wisconsin governor. And the other founded the Wilderness Caucus in the U. S. Senate, to help lawmakers learn about and defend wilderness areas.
As a conservative Republican and a progressive Democrat, we don’t agree on many things, but we both believe that Americans need to be good stewards of the natural resources upon which our environment, economy and public health are dependent.
We need to put partisanship aside and focus on finding commonsense solutions that will make this world more prosperous for this and future generations.

Texto completo: What do Nike and Google have in common? Both faced European Union (EU) antitrust fines in March – $14 million for Nike, $1. 7 billion for Google.
Whenever companies get slammed with fines, people get confused, presuming bad behavior. That’s true sometimes – BP’s penalties related to 2010’s oil spill come to mind. So do bank fines for employees opening fake customer accounts and the LIBOR rigging scandal. But often, penalties symbolize a government taking its cut – an alternate form of taxation. The government put time and money into an investigation and wants pay-out to avoid embarrassment.
Cars on the edge: Convertibles aren't quite dead yet as models hang on
What's new in food: Pucker up, Vlasic is developing pickle chips made of actual pickles
It’s a basic fact of life: When a business grows large, governments start seeking ways to squeeze it. A few million here, a couple billion there. Lather, rinse, repeat every few years. Google has suffered three EU fines since 2017. The one in March won’t be the last. Apple suffered a $15. 3 billion EU fine in 2016 over tax grievances. Facebook may be hit with roughly $1. 6 billion in EU fines over data breaches.
These amounts sound big. To these companies, a couple billion is tiny. The $1. 7 billion was a teensy 0. 2% of Google’s market cap the day the EU fined it. Apple’s $15. 3 billion fine, announced in 2016, was 2. 7% of market cap. Nike’s fine? It was 0. 01%. Peanuts, all.
Usually, when a firm pays 1% to 3% of its value in fines, it probably did nothing critically wrong. Governments have extortive capabilities to say, “Pay or we’ll run you through the ringer!” America has done this for eons. Europe has ratcheted it up lately, often on tech companies that slip through its tax net.
The process is mostly pomp and circumstance. There’s always an investigation, but they usually find little justifying prosecution and lengthy court proceedings. If they really had something, they’d identify perpetrators, bring charges and pursue due process through court. Fines would be far bigger.
The governments effectively say, pay this, without admitting or denying guilt, and we’ll leave you alone for a while. Otherwise, we’ll hassle you for years, and you’ll spend more fighting it than you would on the fine, and we’ll hurt your reputation. Companies rarely appeal and fight. Most are content to simply pay the pests to go away. Fighting back could make the company look like the bad guy. Nike wants to sell sneakers, not be perceived as sneaky.
For investors, small fines are good news. They put the investigation and uncertainty behind everyone. This is especially true when the issues are foggy and alleged misdeeds unclear. A fine totaling roughly 1% to 3%, or less, of market cap means there’s no "there" there. Markets price this "tax" near instantly – and move on.
Even with substantive issues, bigger fines are usually backward-looking confirmation of past troubles. The Justice Department announced BP’s final fines in October 2015 – right before its stock soared after years seesawing sideways. An extreme example, but illustrative.
Yes, there is real wrongdoing sometimes. But the huge majority of teensy tech fines currently are signs of success for the businesses in question. Governments know where the cash is! They also suggest, intuitively, that political wailing for Big Tech to get broken up won’t fly anytime soon. Companies would fight that hard, via lobbying and court. Governments would look bad if they lost . . . and they probably would.
So while campaigning politicians will talk tough, governments instead will keep taking their cut. As a stock investor, always see these relatively small fines as the buy signal they really are.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Addressing reporters from the White House lectern, press secretary Sarah Sanders made a startling claim shortly after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey two years ago.
"I've heard from countless members of the FBI that are grateful and thankful for the president's decision," she said, refusing to back down when pressed on the issue. "Between emails, text messages, absolutely," she insisted.
It wasn't true.
She later told prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller that her comments were a "slip of the tongue."
It's a crime to lie to federal investigators or Congress, a lesson that many of Trump's associates found out the hard way. But it's not a crime to lie to reporters and the American people.
The redacted, 448-page Mueller report released Thursday exposed in voluminous detail how the Trump White House is comfortable not only spinning the truth, but outright demolishing it.
Sometimes the president did the lying himself. Sometimes he had others tell lies for him. And sometimes people just lied because they thought it was required of them.
After the president fired Comey, the White House issued a statement saying that Trump had acted on a recommendation from the Justice Department. But Trump had previously decided to sack Comey, and Reince Priebus, then chief of staff, told investigators he believed the president personally dictated the misleading statement.
Days later, when Mueller was appointed special counsel, White House officials told reporters that Trump was undisturbed by the development.
In fact, he was devastated.
"This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency," he said, according to notes taken by an aide.
Trump sometimes lied to his own aides. One episode involved a resignation letter prepared by Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, who had infuriated Trump by recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation.
The president decided not to push out Sessions at the time, but he brought the letter with him on a trip to the Middle East, showing it to senior advisers aboard Air Force One.
Priebus was concerned that the president planned to use the letter as leverage over Sessions, and he asked about it during the trip. Trump falsely said the document was back in his White House residence.
Later that year, Trump tried to prevent the truth from coming out about a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower with a Kremlin-connected lawyer and senior campaign officials.
Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, recalled telling Trump that emails setting up the meeting looked "really bad."
The messages showed that the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was told the lawyer was working on behalf of the Russian government and would bring damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Then Trump Jr. had emailed back, "If it's what you say I love it."
The president "directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails," the report said.
When the meeting was revealed by The New York Times on July 8, 2017, Trump edited a public statement to conceal crucial details. He removed a line admitting the meeting involved someone who "might have information helpful to the campaign," and he emphasized that participants talked about the adoption of Russian children. The statement was issued under Trump Jr.'s name.
The embarrassing emails soon leaked, contradicting the statement dictated by the president, but the lies continued.
"Over the next several days, the president's personal counsel repeatedly and inaccurately denied that the president played any role in drafting Trump Jr.'s statement," the report said.
Once the president's role was revealed, he downplayed the importance of being honest with the public. "It's a statement to The New York Times. That's not a statement to a high tribunal of judges," Trump told reporters.
The report makes clear that Trump leads a White House where falsehoods and misrepresentations are common practice.
Sanders tried to do damage control on her credibility Friday, insisting that her comments after Comey's firing were made in the "heat of the moment" and that she hadn't intentionally misled the American public.
"I said that it was in the heat of the moment, meaning it wasn't a scripted thing," she said on "CBS This Morning." "But the big takeaway here is that the sentiment is 100% accurate."

Mueller report exposes all the president's liars; Culture of dishonesty pervaded the White House, with officials routinely mangling truth to serve Trump.

Texto completo: Addressing reporters from the White House lectern, then-Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made a startling claim shortly after President Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey two years ago.
"I've heard from countless members of the FBI that are grateful and thankful for the president's decision," she said, refusing to back down when pressed on the issue. "Between emails, text messages, absolutely," she insisted.
It wasn't true. She later told prosecutors working for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III that her comments were a "slip of the tongue."

It's a crime to lie to federal investigators or Congress, a lesson that many of Trump's associates found out the hard way. (Just ask former national security advisor Michael Flynn or disbarred lawyer Michael Cohen; they're among several who pleaded guilty.) But it's not a crime to lie to reporters and the American people, and for that the president's team can be grateful.
The redacted 448-page Mueller report, released Thursday, exposed in voluminous detail how the Trump White House is comfortable not only spinning the truth, but outright demolishing it.
Sometimes the president did the lying himself. Sometimes he had others lie for him. And sometimes people lied because they thought it was required of them.
Sanders refused to back down Friday when questioned on ABC News. She insisted that she had misspoken about "countless" FBI agents "in the heat of the moment," even though she repeated the claim multiple times.
"It wasn't a scripted talking point," she scoffed. "I'm sorry I wasn't a robot like the Democrat Party."
Not everyone around Trump has been willing to lie on his behalf.
After a March 22, 2017, Oval Office meeting, the president asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats to say publicly that Trump didn't have any links to Russia, the report said. The claim would have been false, since Trump sought to build a luxury skyscraper in Moscow while running for president.
Coats declined, telling Trump "it was not his role to make a public statement on the Russia investigation," according to the report.
Others also pushed back. When Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017, he asked Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod Rosenstein to hold a news conference.
"Rosenstein responded that this was not a good idea because if the press asked him, he would tell the truth that Comey's firing was not his idea," the report said.
But the report showed numerous others were willing to spread falsehoods on Trump's behalf.
After the president fired Comey, the White House issued a statement saying that Trump had acted on a recommendation from the Justice Department. But Trump had previously decided to sack Comey. Reince Priebus, then chief of staff, told investigators he believed the president personally dictated the misleading statement recommending the firing.
Days later, when Mueller was appointed special counsel, White House officials told reporters that Trump was undisturbed by the development. In fact, he was devastated.
"This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency," he said, according to notes taken by an aide.
Trump sometimes lied to his own aides. One episode involved a resignation letter prepared by Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, who had infuriated Trump by recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation.
The president decided not to push out Sessions at the time, but he took the letter with him on a trip to the Middle East, showing it to senior advisors aboard Air Force One.
Priebus was concerned that the president planned to use the letter as leverage over Sessions, and he asked about it during the trip. Trump falsely said the document was back in his White House residence.
Later that year, Trump tried to prevent the truth from coming out about senior campaign officials' June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower with a Kremlin-connected lawyer.
Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, recalled telling Trump that emails setting up the meeting looked "really bad."
The messages showed that the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was told the lawyer was working on behalf of the Russian government and would bring damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. had emailed back, "If it's what you say I love it."
The president "directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails," the report said.
When the meeting was revealed by the New York Times on July 8, 2017, Trump edited a public statement to conceal crucial details. He removed a line admitting the meeting involved someone who "might have information helpful to the campaign," and he claimed that participants talked about the adoption of Russian children. The statement was issued under Trump Jr.'s name.
The embarrassing emails soon leaked, contradicting the statement dictated by the president, but the lies continued.
"Over the next several days, the president's personal counsel repeatedly and inaccurately denied that the president played any role in drafting Trump Jr.'s statement," the report said.
Once the president's role was revealed, he downplayed the importance of being honest with the public.
"It's a statement to the New York Times.... That's not a statement to a high tribunal of judges," Trump told reporters.
Pervasive lying is an unsurprising result of having a president whose dishonesty has been a hallmark for years, whether it's exaggerating the height of his buildings or claiming that President Obama wasn't born in the United States.
While every administration is accused of dissembling or worse at times, the report makes clear that Trump leads a White House where falsehoods and misrepresentations are common practice.
When a Washington Post columnist reported on Jan. 9, 2017, that Flynn may have discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition -- contradicting what Flynn had told other administration officials -- Trump was furious.
"What the hell is this all about?" Trump asked Priebus, who told Flynn that Trump was unhappy. Flynn then asked his deputy, K.T. McFarland, to help "kill the story," the report said.
McFarland called the columnist and denied that Flynn and the Russian ambassador had talked about sanctions, even though she "knew she was providing false information," according to the report.
Flynn was forced out of the administration about three weeks after Trump's inauguration. He has pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents, and he's awaiting sentencing as he cooperates with another investigation involving his business associates and undisclosed Turkish lobbying.
Mueller's report includes new details on how Cohen prepared his false congressional testimony about plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow.
During those months in 2017, Cohen was in a joint defense agreement with Trump, and he discussed his upcoming testimony with the president's legal team. Cohen said the lawyer, who was not named, told him "the president loves you" and would have his back if he stayed on message. Unless Cohen "went rogue," he would be protected, according to the report.
A draft of Cohen's testimony was circulated among members of the joint defense agreement, and a key line about "limited contacts with Russian government officials" was deleted. Cohen had, in fact, spoken with a Kremlin office about the proposal.
The testimony also included the falsehood that work on the proposal ended in January 2016 rather than several months later, after Trump had secured the Republican presidential nomination.
Cohen told prosecutors he wanted to adhere to the "party line" by downplaying Trump's ties to Russia, according to the report. He's been sentenced to three years in prison for lying to Congress and several other crimes, and he's scheduled to report to prison on May 6.
But Cohen didn't just lie to lawmakers. Months beforehand, he misled a New York Times reporter about the Moscow project negotiations, the report said. He told the special counsel's office the lies were intended "to dismiss the idea of a substantial connection between Trump and Russia."
They were part of a "script," Cohen told prosecutors, that he developed with others -- including the president himself.

Former governor Whitman to lead major 'civility' group

Texto completo: A deeply alarmed Christie Whitman has tried a variety of ways to stem the rising tide of Trumpism.
The former New Jersey governor made headlines (and videos) calling Trump "unfit" for office and urged him to resign. Whitman, a lifelong Republican, endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. And Whitman compared the president — an ex-casino mogul she once clashed with during her tenure as governor in the 1990s — to some of the "worst dictators in history."
Her one-woman resistance hasn't worked.
Now, Whitman has ditched the frontal assault and has embraced a long-range, grass-roots approach. Whitman has been named advisory board co-chairwoman of the National Institute for Civil Discourse, an eight-year-old advocacy and training group that seeks to reverse the deepening polarization of the body politic.
Whitman replaces former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement from public life last October. The group's other co-chairman is former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
The institute has a fairly simple overarching plan. It wants political foes to begin treating each other with respect. And with respect comes a tendency to listen, and maybe negotiate along a common ground — a tradition that eroded under the Tea Party fury a decade ago and has all but vanished in Trump era
"You've got to have the conversation and you've got to start listening," Whitman said in a recent interview.
The institute was created shortly after the shooting in Tucson, Arizona, that killed six people and wounded 13 others, including former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. Ironically, days before the shooting, Giffords began discussions about creating a center to advance civil conversation, according to the NICD's website.
The group's mission of restoring civility at the grass-roots level of politics was spawned by an across-the-aisle concern that echo-chamber partisanship is destroying the art of compromise, and hence the very underpinnings of Democracy. Partisan voters took their cues from the loudest demagogues, who drown out the demands of the nation's vast middle of independents and moderates.
Attacks on lawmakers — the Giffords shooting, the shooting of House Republican leader Steve Scalise, the 2001 anthrax mailings to political figures, including Daschle — also stirred worries that a breakdown in civil discourse was giving way to extremism.
Trump's election, fueled largely by a mobilized right-wing base, has brought all of those worries to a boil.
Unlike other newly elected presidents, Trump refused to broaden his agenda and his appeal beyond his hard-line, white nationalist supporters, who view compromise as weakness, even betrayal.
And for Whitman, Trump's personalized attacks plunged sharp-edged political dialogue to a crude new low. She singled out Trump's mocking of a New York Times reporter with disabilities during the 2016 campaign.
"This isn't who we are," Whitman lamented.
Keith Allred, the institute's executive director, said Trump's style helped crystallize the long-brewing concerns about polarization and decline in civility.
"There are deeper, systemic things that are going on that will be with us long after Trump," he said in an interview. "But he has put such a kind of extreme and vivid face on the problem that I think he has gotten people to wake up to it and focus on it."
The institute doesn't simply broadcast a clarion call for civility through its network of prominent political and media figures — the NICD's board ranges from former President Bill Clinton and former Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright to NPR host Scott Simon and Yahoo News anchor Katie Couric.
The organization conducts a series of workshops in schools, community groups and, perhaps most importantly, legislatures, which have traditionally served as the de facto training ground for future members of Congress. Half of New Jersey's House delegation, for example, are former state legislators.
The group's "Building Trust through Civil Discourse" workshop has been held in 16 states, is a half-day attempt to prod officials to reconsider each other on common ground. Participants are prodded to craft "rules of engagement" for the discussion, which effectively serves as a manifesto of civility — no talking past each other, a ban on disparaging each other, and a commitment to "listen first."
They are asked to explain, "not in a canned campaign speech," about what brought them into politics, Allred said. They then explain why they love their home state. From there they break out in groups and make recommendations.
In Maine, lawmakers agreed to alternate legislative seating between Democrats and Republicans rather than have the parties segregated, as is commonly done.
The effort has led to more bipartisan legislation, increased dialogue across the aisle, significant procedural changes, and legislators holding civil conversations with their constituents, the NICD contends.
"They start seeing fellow legislators as human beings," he said. More than 850 lawmakers have participated in the workshops.
With the power of party bosses and county chairmen in New Jersey's politics, high-minded workshops might seem like a waste of time. This is also a state that produced Chris Christie, a smash-mouth politician known for his name-calling skills, and who happens to be Trump's chief defender in New Jersey.
Just last week, the former governor broke his vow of silence and unleashed a Trumpian attack on his successor, Democrat Phil Murphy, at a hunters' event last Sunday, mocking his manner of speech and asserting that Murphy is "not from here," a reference to Murphy's Massachusetts upbringing.
Yet New Jersey has a long tradition of transactional politics, which has led lawmakers to abandon their partisan loyalties in pursuit of a good deal. And that "deal" often includes a hefty price tag.
For Whitman and the NICD, the campaign is less about the outbursts of the moment and more about the conduct of the future.
Allred noted confidently that the nation has gone through deep, seemingly unbridgeable divides in the nation's history, only to rebound when the public realizes that things have reached a crisis stage.
Ironically, Trump's conduct has helped the group make its case.
"You've got to start somewhere," Whitman said.

Texto completo: A deeply alarmed Christie Whitman has tried a variety of ways to stem the rising tide of Trumpism.
The former New Jersey governor made headlines (and videos) calling Trump "unfit" for office and urged him to resign. Whitman, a lifelong Republican, endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. And Whitman compared the president — an ex-casino mogul she once clashed with during her tenure as governor in the 1990s — to some of the "worst dictators in history."
Her one-woman resistance hasn't worked.
Now, Whitman has ditched the frontal assault and has embraced a long-range, grass-roots approach. Whitman has been named advisory board co-chairwoman of the National Institute for Civil Discourse, an eight-year-old advocacy and training group that seeks to reverse the deepening polarization of the body politic.
Whitman replaces former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement from public life last October. The group's other co-chairman is former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
The institute has a fairly simple overarching plan. It wants political foes to begin treating each other with respect. And with respect comes a tendency to listen, and maybe negotiate along a common ground — a tradition that eroded under the Tea Party fury a decade ago and has all but vanished in Trump era
"You've got to have the conversation and you've got to start listening," Whitman said in a recent interview.
The institute was created shortly after the shooting in Tucson, Arizona, that killed six people and wounded 13 others, including former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. Ironically, days before the shooting, Giffords began discussions about creating a center to advance civil conversation, according to the NICD's website.
The group's mission of restoring civility at the grass-roots level of politics was spawned by an across-the-aisle concern that echo-chamber partisanship is destroying the art of compromise, and hence the very underpinnings of Democracy. Partisan voters took their cues from the loudest demagogues, who drown out the demands of the nation's vast middle of independents and moderates.
Attacks on lawmakers — the Giffords shooting, the shooting of House Republican leader Steve Scalise, the 2001 anthrax mailings to political figures, including Daschle — also stirred worries that a breakdown in civil discourse was giving way to extremism.
Trump's election, fueled largely by a mobilized right-wing base, has brought all of those worries to a boil.
Unlike other newly elected presidents, Trump refused to broaden his agenda and his appeal beyond his hard-line, white nationalist supporters, who view compromise as weakness, even betrayal.
And for Whitman, Trump's personalized attacks plunged sharp-edged political dialogue to a crude new low. She singled out Trump's mocking of a New York Times reporter with disabilities during the 2016 campaign.
"This isn't who we are," Whitman lamented.
Keith Allred, the institute's executive director, said Trump's style helped crystallize the long-brewing concerns about polarization and decline in civility.
"There are deeper, systemic things that are going on that will be with us long after Trump," he said in an interview. "But he has put such a kind of extreme and vivid face on the problem that I think he has gotten people to wake up to it and focus on it."
The institute doesn't simply broadcast a clarion call for civility through its network of prominent political and media figures — the NICD's board ranges from former President Bill Clinton and former Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright to NPR host Scott Simon and Yahoo News anchor Katie Couric.
The organization conducts a series of workshops in schools, community groups and, perhaps most importantly, legislatures, which have traditionally served as the de facto training ground for future members of Congress. Half of New Jersey's House delegation, for example, are former state legislators.
The group's "Building Trust through Civil Discourse" workshop has been held in 16 states, is a half-day attempt to prod officials to reconsider each other on common ground. Participants are prodded to craft "rules of engagement" for the discussion, which effectively serves as a manifesto of civility — no talking past each other, a ban on disparaging each other, and a commitment to "listen first."
They are asked to explain, "not in a canned campaign speech," about what brought them into politics, Allred said. They then explain why they love their home state. From there they break out in groups and make recommendations.
In Maine, lawmakers agreed to alternate legislative seating between Democrats and Republicans rather than have the parties segregated, as is commonly done. The effort has led to more bipartisan legislation, increased dialogue across the aisle, significant procedural changes, and legislators holding civil conversations with their constituents, the NICD contends.
"They start seeing fellow legislators as human beings," he said. More than 850 lawmakers have participated in the workshops.
With the power of party bosses and county chairmen in New Jersey's politics, high-minded workshops might seem like a waste of time. This is also a state that produced Chris Christie, a smash-mouth politician known for his name-calling skills, and who happens to be Trump's chief defender in New Jersey.
Just last week, the former governor broke his vow of silence and unleashed a Trumpian attack on his successor, Democrat Phil Murphy, at a hunters' event last Sunday, mocking his manner of speech and asserting that Murphy is "not from here," a reference to Murphy's Massachusetts upbringing.
Yet New Jersey has a long tradition of transactional politics, which has led lawmakers to abandon their partisan loyalties in pursuit of a good deal. And that "deal" often includes a hefty price tag.

Allred noted confidently that the nation has gone through deep, seemingly unbridgeable divides in the nation's history, only to rebound when the public realizes that things have reached a crisis stage.

"You've got to start somewhere," Whitman said.

Pentagon downplays North Korean weapons test: ‘not a missile’

Texto completo: MESSAGE UNCLEAR: Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan is not reading too much into North Korea’s announcement that it tested a “new-type tactical guided weapon” Thursday. Speaking to reporters while meeting with Albania’s defense minister, Shanahan noted the test was of some sort of tactical or battlefield weapon, not a missile that would violate Kim Jong Un ’s self-imposed moratorium on testing ICBMs.

“The test or the launch, depending on how you want to characterize it, was not a ballistic missile. So I think that's a statement in and of itself,” Shanahan said.

If it’s intended as a message, it’s not clear what Kim is saying, he added. “You know, when you integrate these other messages, you could derive many different conclusions,” he said. “Let us look at the intelligence that we've gathered and then formulate, really, kind of what the message is. You could interpret a lot of things. I'm not going to rush to judgment.”

Earlier the Pentagon said there has been no change in procedures at U.S. Northern Command or U.S. Strategic Command, the two commands that monitor North Korea missile launches. “No change to our operation or posture,” said Shanahan. “And I'm not being, you know, cagey here. It's just that what's important is it wasn't ballistic.”

STILL HOPEFUL ON TURKEY: Shanahan, who huddled with Turkey’s defense minister, Hulusi Akar , at the Pentagon Wednesday, said he understands his Turkish counterpart is in a tough spot, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insisting on taking delivery of a Russian air defense system the United States says is incompatible with Turkey’s participation in the F-35 program.

“He's got a very difficult job, and he's managing many, many different issues,” Shanahan said. “In many areas, we're very much aligned. And in others, you know, we have, you know, real difficult challenges to solve.”

Shanahan did not indicate that any progress has been made in persuading Turkey to give up the Russian S-400 missiles, but he nevertheless expressed optimism that the impasse, which threatens Turkey’s relationship with America and NATO, would be resolved favorably and said the meeting had been productive.

“I told him I'd be happy to come visit him when we deliver the Joint Strike Fighter,” Shanahan said, later explaining that comment was based more on feeling than any specific progress. “It was an expression of optimism to defense minister Akar. The fact that I would go to deliver the F-35 represents that we resolve the S-400. And that's what I am expecting we'll be able to solve.”

A WAIVER FROM TRUMP?: Reuters reports that Turkish officials appear to be pinning their hopes on direct intervention from President Trump to grant Turkey some sort of exception.

“We are getting signals that Trump pursues a more positive attitude than Congress,” a senior Turkish official told Reuters. “There might certainly be some steps to be taken but the search for common ground will continue.”

The first batch of S-400s is due for delivery in Turkey in June. This week, a team of senior Turkish ministers was in Washington for talks aimed at easing the crisis, culminating in an unexpected Oval Office meeting with the president, Reuters said.

HAPPENING TODAY: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan co-host the U.S.-Japan 2+2 Ministerial at the State Department, with their Japanese counterparts foreign minister Taro Kono and defense minister Takeshi Iwaya attending.

All four will take part in a joint press availability scheduled for 9:50 a.m. Shanahan will meet with Iwaya one-on-one at the Pentagon at 1 p.m.

NO REQUEST FOR TROOPS: Despite President Trump’s public statements that he plans to send more active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, the Pentagon said yesterday it has yet to receive any request for additional personnel from the Department of Homeland Security. “I can tell you … there's no RFA [request for assistance],” acting chief spokesman Charles Summers said at an off-camera briefing yesterday.

He knocked down a Newsweek report from a few days ago that quoted Pentagon planning documents that appeared to show between 9,000 and 10,000 more U.S. service members heading to the southwest border over the next few months. “There are no plans to deploy anywhere near 9,000 to 10,000 troops,” Summers said.

HASC CHAIR UNHAPPY WITH BARR: Setting aside the questions of collusion and obstruction of justice, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith , D-Wash., argues that Congress needs an unredacted copy of the Mueller report purely on national security grounds.

“There is no more important task than safeguarding our country’s democratic process. Congress has a duty to make informed legislative, oversight, and authorization and appropriations decisions to safeguard the country. To do that, we need unfettered access to all the information contained in Special Counsel Mueller’s report. Our national security, and the American way of life depend on it,” Smith said in a statement last night.

“I cannot underscore how disappointed I am with Attorney General William Barr ’s continued unresponsiveness to congressional oversight committees, with relevant jurisdiction, regarding access to the unredacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’s report,” he added.

TRUMP TOUTS ARMY’S BELTS: In his remarks yesterday at the Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride, President Trump riffed on one of his favorite subjects: how his administration has been rebuilding the depleted military he inherited. “We're rebuilding our military like never before. Brand new fighter jets. Brand new ships of all kinds. Every soldier has the best equipment,” Trump said before turning to the new Army uniform, which will be a throwback to the “pinks and greens” of the World War II-era.

“In the Army, we're even getting new uniforms and those beautiful new uniforms with the belt. It was a big deal, the belt,” Trump said, referring to the return of the classic belted jacket.

“And if you think those uniforms were inexpensive, they were very expensive. They were very. But they wanted it and we got it,” Trump added.

The new “Army Greens” will be phased in this year, beginning with Army recruiters, but the new service uniform won’t be in full production until next year.

Texto completo: French leaders and architects are at odds over how to rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral.

After the historic and religious landmark was damaged in a fire Monday, the question is: Should it be restored to its former condition, or should it include contemporary reforms?

“Something contemporary will be safer and faster to rebuild,” said architect Christiane Schmuckle-Mollard, who was involved with the restoration of Strasbourg’s cathedral, to the New York Times.

French culture minister Franck Riester said how to rebuild would ultimately fall to the state, but encouraged discussions about what the reconstruction would look like.

“We mustn’t say to ourselves, by dogmatism, that we must absolutely redo the cathedral as it was,” said Riester. “We won’t decide to do something modern or something new just for the sake of it.”

In particular, there is debate over Notre Dame’s famous spire, which collapsed in the fire.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who said the cathedral would be restored within five years, signaled he could get on board with constructing a new spire with “a contemporary architectural gesture.” But others don’t want contemporary touches included in the reconstruction.

For example, French architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte argued that a “pastiche” of the fallen spire would be “grotesque,” during a radio interview with Franceinfo.

Meanwhile, right-wing candidate for the Republican Party François-Xavier Bellamy argued: “Before proclaiming ourselves builders, let us recognize first that we are inheritors.”

“Notre-Dame de Paris does not belong to us,” he said. “We are the first to see it burn: Our only duty is to restore her, with the patience that an absolute masterpiece requires, to pass it on the way we received it.”

Marine Le Pen, the head of the far-right National Gathering party, also has opposed suggestions from Prime Minister Édouard Philippe to hold an architectural contest. In response to one of Philippe’s tweets on the matter, Le Pen tweeted the hashtag #Don’tTouchNotreDame.

A delegation from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization met with Macron on Friday, and concluded that the cathedral could be modified while preserving the building's “integrity and authenticity," the Associated Press reports.

The Associated Press reported Thursday that a French judicial police official said investigators have conducted a preliminary assessment of the cathedral as they continue to investigate. According to the official, an electrical short circuit was the likely culprit behind the fire earlier this week.

Construction of the cathedral began in 1163 and wrapped up in 1345. The cathedral endured some destruction from the French Revolution during the 1790s but was repaired starting in 1845.

It wouldn't be the first time one one of Paris' most well-known landmarks got a modern facelift. President Francois Mitterand initiated the Grand Louvre project in 1981 to modernize the famous museum, previously a royal estate first built around 1190. The museum was also given a new entrance: a controversial glass pyramid. Architect I.M. Pei has said that he predicted 90% of people were opposed to the pyramid when it was first unveiled to the public.

Texto completo: Imagine that. Playoff thrills locally, after all.
It was supposed to be over by now. The Lakers left us months ago except for their managerial meltdown. The Clippers were supposed to be finished off by Golden State before anyone noticed they were in the postseason.
Instead, in yet another miracle, the Clippers staged the biggest playoff comeback in NBA history, coming from 31 down to win Game 2 in Oakland to make a series of it, after making a season of it when no one expected that.
Or, as Coach Doc Rivers told his players: “We don’t die. We multiply. We’re like roaches.”
Whatever they are, they have a promising future as well as a lot of heart, about to pursue Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard with salary cap space, with charismatic figures such as Rivers and Jerry West to lead their recruiting effort and an inspiring story to tell.
Then there are the Lakers … or there would be if they weren’t in hiding.
Since Magic Johnson dropped the big one on them – 12 days ago – no team official has appeared in public. This suggests its own message:
The Lakers’ road ahead involves massive secrecy and an inability to handle hard times?
Suggesting how overwhelmed Jeanie Buss is, she hasn’t told her people to make an appearance, or said anything herself, other than her flowery Twitter paean to Johnson (“Earvin, I loved working side by side with you. You’ve brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you.”)
Did Jeanie miss the one about someone trying to pin the blame for drafting Lonzo Ball on her?
Oh, well, kids fight in the best of families.
There has been no sign of General Manager Rob Pelinka, whom Buss is standing by after Magic reportedly tried to fire him for “back-stabbing” him.
LeBron James, the mainstay of social media, has yet to mention Magic’s departure or his own hopes going forward.
Of course, no one has glimpsed the secretive Kobe Bryant, who declined Jeanie’s offer to take over with Magic in 2017 and doesn’t look interested in doing it now.
If no one knows what’s going on, it’s likely that she has reached out to Bryant.
A source says Kobe’s importance to Jeanie explains why Pelinka, Kobe’s former agent whom Magic gored, remains in place with enhanced powers and no thought of replacing him.
Elsewhere, Pelinka is regarded with open skepticism. The New York Times’ Marc Stein called him “a polarizing figure” with “numerous reports of trust issues – not only in his dealings with other teams and former rivals in the agent world but also former Lakers players (Larry Nance Jr. and Andrew Bogut) who were jettisoned after broken promises.”
Actually, “broken promises,” or reassurances that don’t turn out to be true, are common enough for GMs.
Nevertheless, Pelinka did, indeed, have a controversy-filled career as an agent. Now in the bullseye after Magic’s accusations – if only for joking, “Where’s Earvin?” – the buzzards have come home to roost.
As for any hope that Bryant will ride to the rescue, he’s not one to agonize about decisions. If he had any interest in taking over, we would have heard about it by now.
Kobe isn’t taking questions about it but did in March, telling Slam Magazine’s Tzvi Twersky, “The answer is no, I’m not doing it.
“I’m not interested … not even (for) a couple years. I’m just not interested. I don’t want to be a GM. I don’t want to own a team. I don’t want to coach. I have no interest in any of that. That’s an easy answer for me.”
Of course, Kobe might still be in the loop, even if he has no desire to run anything day by day. As such, he’s like the man behind the curtain in “The Wizard of Oz.”
Whether Kobe’s counsel is helpful remains to be seen. Bold and intelligent as he is, he has no experience running teams and enthusiastically endorsed Magic’s half-baked idea about not needing shooters.
In a perfect irony, there is one former Lakers great who’s still in the game and would have been invaluable. Of course, that’s West, whom the Lakers – presumably, Magic – declined to hire when he was hoping to be invited back.
Jeanie is widely considered good people, but her obsession with Lakers Family … which she treasures as her birthright from the father she worshiped … keeps her from thinking clearly, or at all.
Outside her cocoon, it looks like they’ve gone as far as they can with former Lakers … the approach that backfired so badly with Magic proving temperamentally unsuited to his job … but it’s continuing.
With the Lakers’ marquee stature and the vast resources conferred by a $3 billion TV deal, they should attract top management people like Golden State GM Bob Myers, San Antonio’s R.C. Buford, Oklahoma City’s Sam Presti or Houston’s Daryl Morey.
Reaching out to them would have meant asking their teams for permission. Nothing like that happened.
The well-regarded David Griffin, a LeBron ally as Cleveland GM, was available. With no Lakers interest, he accepted a job with New Orleans days after Magic stepped down.
“Jeanie is great,” a GM said, “but she is too insulated and has made no effort to expand her knowledge base outside the Laker family. They won’t get A.D. (Anthony Davis) because they don’t have the best package.”
Ominously for whoever’s in charge, the Lakers’ scheduled return to greatness is based on acquiring Davis in a trade with New Orleans, which looks ever-more problematic.
For months, I wrote the Lakers were the favorites as A.D.’s preferred destination. Now NBA people say several Western Conference contenders, desperate at being capped by the Warriors, could make attractive offers without assurances he will re-sign in the summer of 2020.
Teams never used to run such risks, but things have changed.
Toronto did it a year ago, trading DeMar DeRozan to San Antonio for Leonard.
Presti did it two years ago, trading Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to Indiana for Paul George, who was supposedly Lakers-bound but re-signed in OKC. If that wasn’t enough, Presti might be ready to offer Steven Adams for A.D.
Houston, run by Morey, another tightrope walker, could offer Clint Capela.
Meanwhile, in Portland, Trail Blazers players are wooing A.D. openly, as if they were Lakers.
“I’m saying, ‘OK, Anthony Davis, we’ve got a winning culture. We win. We’re not jealous of each other. We have a good time,’ ” Damian Lillard told The Ringer.
“He’ll win. He’ll get to be himself and he’ll get to be on a team that fits. I think he would be perfect for us.”
By week’s end, the Warriors had reasserted themselves, leading the Clippers by 36 in Game 3 at Staples Center and winning by 27, showing what happens when you get them mad.
Still, it was magical for the Clippers, if only for the three days between Games 2 and 3.
As for the Lakers, everyone might have to scale down hopes. At present, their fans just want to make sure they haven’t left town.

A book and a movie, torn from today's headlines

Texto completo: Illustration

"The Hate U Give" is a coming-of-age story by Angie Thomas that debuted at the top of the "New York Times" Young Adult Bestseller List in 2017 and remained there for fifty weeks. Interest in this acclaimed book surged again when it was made into a major motion picture.
Starr Carter, the sixteen-year-old main character, is constantly switching between two worlds—the poor, mostly black neighborhood where she lives and the wealthy, mostly white prep school that she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is soon shattered when she witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend at the hands of a police officer. Facing pressure from all sides of the community, Starr must find her voice and decide to stand up for what's right.
These events may sound familiar from headlines of recent years. The book delves deep into complex problems. But as people like Dr. Martcn Carcasson emphasized at our recent Current Affairs series, we can find hope and meaningful solutions through listening and positive dialogue.
This is definitely the kind of book you read and find yourself wanting to discuss with others. We'll be doing just that through several gatherings in the coming weeks. It begins with a Book Discussion program on Monday, April 29 at 6 p.m. Seating is limited, so register at estesvalleylibrary.org .
We've been aligning our Library programs with what the community has asked us for. A high priority are programs that bring readers together in shared literary experiences, and which provide opportunities to discuss today's current affairs. As we delve into "The Hate U Give" this season, we're also collaborating with some key community partners.
One of those partners is Estes Valley Restorative Justice. They've been bringing their skills at facilitating positive discussions to several recent Library programs, and they'll guide our conversation on April 29.
The book will also be discussed by teens at a special discussion at Estes Park High School. We thank the schools for making this possible.
As a movie, "The Hate U Give" succeeded in adapting the powerful narrative of the novel to the screen. "The best-selling novel makes for a riveting, funny, incisive big-screen drama anchored by outstanding performances," said Alissa Wilkinson in her film review for Vox.com .
Whether or not you read the book, mark your calendar for a special screening of "The Hate U Give" at Reel Mountain Theater on Thursday, May 2 at 7 p.m.
No advance registration is needed to attend the film. Simply show your Estes Valley Library card for free admission. We thank Craig Conley and the staff of Reel Mountain for making this program possible.
We love encouraging dialogue around books, whether it's our recurring Books and Authors discussions and events, or providing ongoing support of local book clubs. Shared literary experiences bring readers together and help to foster community in the Estes Valley.

With Felina, chef Anthony Bucco takes on Ridgewood

Texto completo: Chef Anthony Bucco, who four months ago opened the much-ballyhooed contemporary Italian restaurant Felina in Ridgewood, does not lack confidence. The convivial, fast-talking chef ("I have a lot of energy," he explains) has reason to be self-assured.
He worked for James Beard Award-winning chef Jonathan Waxman. He received four-star reviews for his work at the cherished Stage Left in New Brunswick, the beloved Uproot in Warren, the celebrated Ryland Inn in Whitehouse Station and the acclaimed Restaurant Latour in Hamburg. In fact, he helped reopen the Ryland Inn — and was rewarded with the first four-star review from New Jersey Monthly in a decade. He has received an Excellent from the New York Times and AAA's esteemed Four Diamond Award.
Impressive. So why does his food at Felina lack the certitude he seems to have in spades?
The chef's admittedly endearing self-assurance isn't missing from the look-at-me decor of the 120-seat restaurant, formerly an old bank building that last housed the restaurant Fish. It's striking, with multi-leveled glowing orbs, a big oval bar, a spacious airy dining room, a sizable open kitchen, an eight-seat chef's counter, lovely reclaimed wood floors and a formidable vaulted ceiling. The best part perhaps: a semi-private dining area contained inside the beautifully polished bank vault with hundreds of gleaming safety deposit boxes. And, not to be missed, a rooftop bar — Ridgewood's first.
If only the food and drinks were consistently as impressive and bold.
While the chef's culinary mastery is made obvious in some dishes, most noticeably in a perfectly cooked octopus that had me dreaming for days and a delectable pasta primi called paprika creste de gallo, too many dishes lacked oomph. It was as if Bucco, talented, skilled and confident, suddenly was afflicted with a rather serious bout of cooking timidity.
Take the fluke crudo ($16), a gorgeous appetizer that could easily pass for a main course because the portion size is quite generous. There's much to like about this refreshing raw fish dish: fabulously crunchy little tempura bits, splendid black olive caramel and lovely lavender-hued sliced radishes. If only Bucco had added a touch more salt, a bit of citrus, or a soupçon of olive oil, it would have been a winner.
The roasted beets appetizer ($15), too, lacked zest. The plating was lovely and the multi-colored beets were well cooked and appropriately sweet, but the dish fell flat. I would have loved more dressing. High marks, though, for the delightfully crispy cracker served with it.
Both the rigatoni rosemary ($25) and the paprika creste de gallo ($26) were delicious, if not quite home-runs. The garlic-infused sauce that laced the rooster's crest-shaped pasta was heady, though I'm not sure the nuggets of pork sausage added much, and the hint of earthy rosemary in the rigatoni was lovely, though there was no hint of guanciale that the menu promised.
The least successful dish was the Glenwood Mountain pork ($35), a thick boneless chop that was overcooked and served with overworked polenta. And while the chop and polenta were accompanied by a nicely charred and tasty roasted cabbage, none of the elements brought color to the plate, making for a monochromatic and dull presentation.
The plating for the braised short ribs ($35) was lovely. And no complaints with the just-barely-cooked, slightly-crunchy celery root that accompanied them, nor the pickled celery. The ribs were perfectly cooked — nice and fork-tender — but as with other dishes, they lacked brio. How I longed for a more flavorful braise.
As for drinks? Beverage director Christopher James, 2013's Iron Shaker winner — Iron Shaker is N.J.'s statewide competition for the best bartender — offers a slew of cocktails, with playful names such as The Bitter Flamingo, Heavy Metal and Style Collision. I asked James to choose one of his special cocktails for me, letting him know that my drink of choice is a Negroni and that I don't like sweet cocktails. He served me a mezcal drink called Low Hanging Fruit. It was ... sweet. On another night, I asked for a Negroni; it was superb.
Superb, too, is the homemade focaccia — thick, rustic, and heavily sprinkled with coarse sea salt — that chef de cuisine Martina Krowicka, a Food Network "Chopped" winner and a former chef at Latour, baked. Krowicka offers five desserts, among them a Nutella budino ($12). The three-layer concoction of Nutella custard, cinnamon streusel and salted caramel isn't showy — no daring threads of caramel, no wine gelée, no towering constructions -- just a gratifying honest treat that feels grown up and fun.
Speaking of fun: Felina has brought excitement and vigor to the dining landscape in Ridgewood — make that North Jersey. Most every night, the place is filled with diners thrilled to be in a sexy new spot with an award-winning chef and team. And Bucco and his business partners are planning more Felinas; they are seriously looking at a spot in downtown Newark.
When they get more of the chef's spirit into his dishes, this Felina, and any future siblings, should make for a superb night out.

Q&amp;A with AMANDA PALMER

Texto completo: Amanda Palmer has had a thrilling past seven years. She gave a TED Talk in 2013 called "The Art of Asking," which she then turned into a New York Times-bestselling book of the same name. She gave birth to her first child, and her openness about her life has helped a lot of people, as a perusal of the replies to her Twitter feed indicates.
Amanda Palmer has also had a bruising last seven years. She's lost people to suicide, dealt with rough patches in her marriage, and watched her best friend die of cancer. She's dealt with the everyday inequities of how the music industry treats men and women. She's had a miscarriage.
"There Will Be No Intermission," the 42-year-old's latest album, tries to embody both of those truths, to reconcile life's highs and lows. "A lot of this album," she says, "is the marriage of those two sides of myself."
We caught up with Palmer on her tour, which she said will only be coming around once per city (she plays three hours a night, onstage with only herself), to talk criticism, funding and performing tough material live.
You've mentioned in the past that your Patreon funders have changed the way you write. In what way?
I began using Patreon about four years ago. As far as I knew, it was just going to be this fantastic financial security system, because I've spent my life hustling as an indie artist and the idea of having an automatic check every month to support whatever work I felt like doing was pretty miraculous. And that has been, but what I did not anticipate was that the financial and emotional safety net of having a bunch of people unconditionally supporting my voice has made me infinitely braver as a songwriter. I didn't really see that one coming, and I didn't really notice it while it was happening, but in retrospect I look back at my earlier work, and my relationship with major labels, and my relationship with the music media and what I was able to do and create with Kickstarter - but I still had to really go out and hustle and sell that last record. This record had no bounds, because it was presold to 15,000 people and I was able to take emotional and musical risks that I'm not sure I would have taken if I had had to stick this album in a portfolio and march it up to Steve and Dave in marketing. Especially being a woman and writing about abortion and miscarriage, with these really noncommercial songs that run up to 10 and 11 minutes, it was almost that I realized that I had a lot of Kool-Aid still swirling around in my body from the old days about what art had to sound look and be like in order to be sale-able. That really liberated me in a way that I didn't know I needed liberating.
This album deals with some pretty heavy topics. What has that meant for the live show?
It makes the concerts pretty extraordinary, because I'm not getting up there and posing as an enigmatic rock star. I'm getting up there and really opening myself up and spilling the truth, while trying really hard not to leave the audience in a dark place. That's a good challenge for me. I'm used to playing a show that's pretty entertaining, pretty wild, pretty funny, with a few handfuls of the dark thrown in there for balance. This particular show is like a 10-course meal of sorrow and joy. And it's exhausting. These are all skills I didn't [expletive] have 15 years ago, or 10 years ago, or even five years ago. And in the time of Trump and Pence, to be able to get on stage all over this country and talk to tens of thousands of people about what it's like to go get an abortion? Even if a few people feel disconcerted? I absolutely feel like that's our most powerful political weapon right now, just talking about what it's like and how it feels.
Your work is sometimes met with backlash online, due to its content or for personal reasons. How have you dealt with that?
I have learned how to guard against that by making myself as vulnerable as possible. ... I care less and less about impressing people and less and less about concerting people, because the older I get the more I realize that many of the folks feeling disconcerted need to feel disconcerted. And I used to use the truth more as a very blunt hammer, and nowadays I feel like I'm using it more like a surgical knife - I understand so much more than I used to about how to connect using words with my community and especially having gone through what I've gone through in the last seven years - abortions, birth, a miscarriage, suicides of lovers, the death of my best friend, and also having done a TED talk and having written my book. I've gotten such an incredible taste of what it's like to actually be able to help people. And I don't want to separate Amanda Palmer, the person who can give a motivational speech about art and write a self-help book, from Amanda Palmer, the person who can sit down and write songs about pain.
Where did the title for the new album originate?
The title was actually inspired by a girl from the back of the house during my sort-of rough draft shows in the U.K., which were running into three or three-and-a-half hours, with no intermission. And the girl shouted that she had to pee. We took a spontaneous intermission, which of course completely freaked out the theater and was very funny. ... But it struck me as such a perfect poetic metaphor for the nature of the record and the story of the last seven years. You do not get to take an intermission from life. It's relentless. And just when you think you've recovered from the last storm, there's another one not only on the horizon, but besetting you as you speak.
Amanda Palmer Saturday 7:30 p.m. | Beacon Theatre, 2124 Broadway, msg.com, $35-$60.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The Justice Department plans to release a lightly redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s 400-page report today, offering a granular look at the ways in which President Donald Trump was suspected of obstructing justice, people familiar with the matter said.
The report — the general outlines of which the Justice Department has briefed the White House on — will reveal that Mueller decided he could not come to a conclusion on the question of obstruction because it was difficult to determine Trump’s intent and some of his actions could be interpreted innocently, these people said. But it will offer a detailed account of his alleged conduct — analyzing tweets, private threats and other episodes at the center of Mueller’s inquiry, they added.
Attorney General William Barr plans to hold an 8:30 a.m. news conference to address "process questions" and provide an "overview of the report," a senior Justice Department official said. The report will be delivered on discs to Capitol Hill between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. (CDT), the official said, and will be posted on the special counsel’s website thereafter.
Those who spoke to The Washington Post for this report did so on the condition of anonymity, citing the matter’s supreme sensitivity.
Today’s rollout plan — and news of the White House’s advance briefing, which was first reported by ABC News and The New York Times — led to political uproar Wednesday, with Democrats suggesting the attorney general was trying to improperly color Mueller’s findings before the public could read them.
"This is wrong," Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter.
While the report’s light redactions might allay some of their concerns, Democrats are likely to bristle at any material that is withheld. What the Justice Department and Trump’s lawyers might view as modest, lawmakers might see as overly aggressive.
Barr also is likely to face scrutiny over the Justice Department’s talks with the White House — which could help Trump and his attorneys hone their attacks on the report in advance.
Rudolph Giuliani, one of Trump’s lawyers, has said he is preparing a counterreport to Mueller’s findings, and in a recent interview said his document would explain from the president’s viewpoint every episode that could be considered obstructive. Giuliani and others have long feared Mueller’s findings on obstruction, viewing them as potentially more damaging than anything Mueller found on the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russians.
Mueller did not find a conspiracy between Russians and Trump or his campaign, Barr said in a brief letter of the special counsel’s conclusions shared with Congress late last month.
Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s attorneys, told The Washington Post, "We do not discuss conversations that we may or may not have had with the president." A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to address questions about its briefings to the White House, the report’s redactions or Mueller’s findings on obstruction.
Trump had also apparently been briefed in advance of the planned news conference, which he revealed Wednesday during a radio appearance, which was confirmed later by a Justice Department spokeswoman. Barr will appear alongside Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the spokeswoman said, and he planned to take questions.
Barr has faced intense scrutiny from the public and lawmakers on Capitol Hill for his handling of Mueller’s report. Today’s news conference could give him an opportunity to address his critics — and perhaps provide them fresh ammunition. It is sure to be watched closely by Trump, an avid TV viewer whose relationship with his attorney general will almost certainly be colored by Mueller’s findings and what Barr says about them.
Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the White House did not ask the Justice Department to hold the news conference, but she declined to discuss White House and Justice Department interactions about the report.
Trump told the Larry O’Connor show on WMAL that he was pondering having his own news conference.
"You’ll see a lot of very strong things come out tomorrow. Attorney General Barr is going to be giving a news conference. Maybe I’ll do one after that; we’ll see," Trump said.
Already, Democratic lawmakers and pundits have alleged that Barr seems to be taking steps to mitigate the political damage Mueller’s report might do to Trump, and some members of Mueller’s team have told associates they are frustrated by the limited information he has released about their work.
A senior White House official said Trump has praised Barr privately for his handling of the report and compared him favorably with former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who Trump grew to loathe over his recusal from what would become Mueller’s investigation.
Since the special counsel’s office closed its investigation late last month, Barr and his team at the Justice Department have been reviewing the final report to determine how much of it can be made public. The Justice Department has said it plans to release the document with four categories of information shielded from public view: material from the grand jury, material that reveals intelligence sources and methods, material that is relevant to ongoing investigations, and material that could affect the privacy of "peripheral" third parties. Each redaction will be color-coded so readers know the reason material is being shielded, Barr has said.
Any redactions could be controversial, and Democrats have said they won’t be satisfied unless they are given the entire, unfiltered document. It is likely House Democrats will attempt to subpoena it, sparking a legal battle that could last for months or even years.
Barr has so far disclosed only what the Justice Department terms Mueller’s "principal conclusions." In a four-page letter to lawmakers, he declared last month that Mueller did not find that anyone on Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, and that the special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump had sought to obstruct justice. Barr wrote that he and Rosenstein then reviewed the evidence and did not find it sufficient to make an obstruction case.
Barr offered only a few quotes from Mueller’s report, leaving a curious public with many more questions than answers about what his 22-month investigation had found.
White House officials are concerned about damaging testimony from a number of senior aides, particularly former counsel Donald McGahn and former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, according to current and former officials. Their testimony, according to people with knowledge of it, gave a clear, detailed breakdown of some of the most controversial incidents, from the firing of James Comey as FBI director to attempts to oust Sessions. McGahn spoke with the special counsel for dozens of hours, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Texto completo: As the crowd filed out of the Barclays Center in May 2015, there was reason for hope. Though the Nets had just been eliminated by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs, they had overachieved and shown some promise for the future. And Phil Jackson had become the Knicks president the year before, bringing his triangle offense and a coaching résumé that included 11 N.B.A. titles to Manhattan.
Little did New York fans know that it would be four dreadful years before playoff basketball would return to the city. It finally will on Thursday night, when the Nets host the Philadelphia 76ers in a series tied at one all.
While there has been no playoff basketball in the city in the interim, much has happened in those four years. And for Knicks and Nets fans, not much of it has been good.
May 1, 2015 The eighth-seeded Nets fall to the top-seeded Hawks, 111-87. But they take two games in the series, raising optimism. "We were able to secure a playoff spot," Coach Lionel Hollins says. "Some people will say, 'Hey, we didn't deserve it.' That's their problem."
June 25 After putting up a 17-65 record, the worst in franchise history and the league's second worst in 2015, the Knicks have bad luck in the draft lottery, ending up at the No. 4 spot. Nevertheless, their selection, Kristaps Porzingis of Latvia, will pay off, quickly becoming a star and a fan favorite.
Oct. 3 Knicks Coach Derek Fisher gets into a physical altercation after being confronted by Matt Barnes of the Memphis Grizzlies at the home of Barnes's estranged wife. Barnes is suspended for two games.
Dec. 30 Cleanthony Early of the Knicks is shot in the knee by masked men and robbed of gold teeth caps after a visit to a strip club.
Jan. 10, 2016 The Nets fire Coach Hollins and demote General Manager Billy King with the team at 10-27. "Frankly speaking, I deserve a championship now much more than six years ago," owner Mikhail D. Prokhorov says.
Feb. 8 The Knicks, 23-31, fire Fisher. "There's not a whole lot to say," Jackson says in his first remarks to reporters since the start of training camp.
April 13 The Nets finish the season 21-61, the league's third worst record. But there will be little help on draft day: They traded their top pick to the Celtics in 2014 for a 37-year-old Kevin Garnett and a 36-year-old Paul Pierce, both of whom are gone at this point.
The Knicks finish 32-50. That's a 15-game improvement, but Jackson says, "We're disappointed about our season."
April 17 The Nets hire Kenny Atkinson, a Hawks assistant, as head coach. "Together, we can do great things," Prokhorov says.
June 2 The Knicks hire Jeff Hornacek as coach, bypassing the interim coach, Kurt Rambis.
June 22 The Knicks trade for Derrick Rose, who proclaims them a "superteam." After a year he will leave for the Cleveland Cavaliers.
July 7 The Nets sign Jeremy Lin, perhaps hoping to recapture the Linsanity that took over the Knicks in 2012.
July 8 The Knicks sign Joakim Noah for four years and $72 million. This will not work out. Noah will be suspended for 20 games for a drug violation, be sent to the developmental league and get into a shouting match with Hornacek. The Knicks wind up releasing him in 2018 and paying him anyway.
Feb. 8, 2017 The Knicks legend Charles Oakley is ejected from Madison Square Garden during a game. The crowd sides with the former player, chanting "Oakley, Oakley." The Knicks say he behaved abusively, and the owner, James L. Dolan, says that Oakley "may have a problem with alcohol." Oakley sues, claiming defamation and battery.
March 12 Carmelo Anthony gets his 10,000th point as a Knick, becoming the third player to reach that mark with two teams.
April 12 The Nets finish 20-62, the worst record in the league. Once again a potentially high draft pick is gone, as part of the Garnett deal. The Knicks are 31-51.
June 22 The Nets trade their longtime star Brook Lopez to the Los Angeles Lakers for D'Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov. Russell will become a key player in the team's resurgence.
June 28 The Knicks and Phil Jackson agree to part ways after three years. The Knicks never fully embraced his triangle offense, and Jackson remained wary of the 3-point shot as it became increasingly important in the league. He also could never seem to get rid of Anthony, the team's aging star who refused to waive a no-trade clause. Jackson also feuded with the player expected to be the team's future, Porzingis.
Sept. 25 A trade is finally worked out for Anthony, who is sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Enes Kanter. He gave the Knicks seven seasons of 20-points-a-game play. Jackson was willing "to trade me for a bag of chips," Anthony says. He also notes that under new management, "They went from asking for peanuts to asking for steak."
Oct. 18 Lin ruptures a knee tendon in the Nets' opening game and misses the entire season.
Feb. 6, 2018 Porzingis tears the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and is out for the rest of this season and the next one.
April 11 The Nets finish 28-54. Incredibly, for a third straight year they do not have their top pick because of that Garnett deal. (Garnett is by now 41 and has been out of the league two years.) The lost picks turned into Jaylen Brown, a big part of the contending Celtics; Markelle Fultz, a No. 1 overall choice; and Collin Sexton, who averaged 17 points as a rookie with the Cleveland Cavaliers.
The Knicks wind up 29-53 and fire Hornacek the next day. David Fizdale will be the new coach.
Asked how the Knicks can improve, the superfan Spike Lee can only turn to prayer: "On bended knee I pray above to da basketball gods to deliver us back to da glory years of da Orange and Blue. Amen," he writes in The New York Times.
June 20 The Nets make a trade to get Dwight Howard from the Hornets, but Howard buys his way out of his contract and never plays for them.
July 13 The Nets trade Lin to the Hawks, curing the city's second, significantly milder case of Linsanity.
Jan. 31, 2019 The Knicks send their most popular player, Porzingis, who is still recovering from the torn A.C.L., to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster trade. Two months later it will be revealed that he is under investigation by the New York Police Department after being accused of sexual assault.
The Knicks get Dennis Smith Jr. and some expiring contracts, which should open up salary cap space so they can sign some marquee free agents. Assuming that marquee free agents would want to play for the Knicks.
March 12 Knicks fans hoping for a change in ownership are disappointed when Dolan proclaims that he will not sell the team, even for $6 billion. Two days before that, he was filmed threatening a fan with banishment from the Garden after the fan had urged him to sell the team.
April 10 The Knicks have sunk to the bottom of the league again, finishing 17-65 and tying the franchise-worst mark. The Nets start the season 8-18, but then unexpectedly turn things around behind Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie (picked up from the developmental league in 2016) and Jarrett Allen (a No. 22 pick in 2017). They finish 42-40. Playoff basketball returns to New York. For now.

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Thomas Fuller, a national correspondent based in San Francisco, discussed the tech he's using.
As a national reporter, you often find yourself caught in breaking news situations. What tech do you use when covering mass shootings? How about when covering fires?
My previous job was Southeast Asia correspondent, and I would lug around a satellite phone on trips to remote places like northern Myanmar. When I arrived in San Francisco three years ago, I didn't think I would need it. But the California wildfires of the last two years knocked out cell coverage, especially the wine country fires of 2017.
So the satellite phone became indispensable for filing on tight deadlines. I put the phone, which is about the size of a laptop, on the roof of the car, pointed it toward the satellite and ran a cable through the window into the front seat, where I plugged into my laptop.
When I covered mass shootings, some of the people I interviewed were concerned about privacy, so to communicate securely, we used Signal, the encrypted phone app.
You also write about earthquakes. What tech do you want to have on hand when the Big One hits California?
When I arrived in California, I soon learned that everyone here is conditioned to keep an emergency earthquake bag in a car or somewhere near the door. In addition to my packed bag, I keep a satellite phone in the trunk. I'm assuming that cell networks will be badly disrupted by a big earthquake -- that was certainly the case when I covered the 2015 Nepal earthquake. Finding electricity might also be a problem in the days immediately after a big quake, so I'm counting on the cigarette lighters in the car to serve as a generator.
We have a number of satellite phones in the San Francisco bureau, and we've distributed them to staff members who live in San Francisco and across the bay.
What tech tool do you dislike the most for reporting?
I used to rely on Twitter very heavily when I covered Southeast Asia -- it was the best way to follow events in the 10 countries that I was covering. But I find it much less useful in Northern California for news coverage.
Twitter is very clannish and ideological, and it feels like a platform for self-promotion and virtue trumpeting more than anything else. The way people tweet reminds me of how some people talk when they step up to a lectern at City Council meetings -- looking for applause more than conveying information. It's the nature of the platform, of course, and I'm as guilty as the next guy -- if this rant were a tweet and it got no retweets, I would feel a tinge of sorrow.
So Twitter stinks. What tech tools do you think reporters have benefited from?
I find Dataminr useful. That's the company that scrapes the internet for breaking news and then sends it to you in real time. Its algorithm does a pretty good job of alerting you to shootings, crashes, scandals, big political news -- the things we need to know about.
I also use a program that the veteran Times tech reporter John Markoff turned me on to. It's called Audionote, and it's a word processor and voice recorder melded into one. So if you're at a news conference or doing a sit-down interview, you type as you record. Then you can go back to the text, click on the words and listen to the recording from that moment. It's a great tool for deadline writing.
What tech product are your kids currently obsessed with? What do they do with it?
I've been trying to turn all the household electronics into language learning tools, with limited success: TV during the week is fine as long as it's in French or Thai. (The kids were born in Thailand, and we're a Francophone family.) That didn't really work, because as soon as we weren't watching, they opened a screen in English.
I switched our Alexa to French, but we decided that she is much less entertaining as a French robot. We couldn't get her to play 20 Questions in French. I gave up and switched her to English with a British accent.
But all of that is a sideshow to the Daily Battle of the Screens. It never ceases to amaze me that outside there can a blue sky, bright California sunshine and plenty of open space to explore -- but the kids prefer to flip open a laptop and surf YouTube.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Beyoncé's "Homecoming" hits Netflix. And a new PBS series examines the history of several technological innovations.
What's Streaming
HOMECOMING: A FILM BY BEYONCÉ (2019) Stream on Netflix. After Beyoncé's headlining concert at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival last year, Jon Caramanica's review for The New York Times said that "there's not likely to be a more meaningful, absorbing, forceful and radical performance by an American musician this year, or any year soon." This documentary combines video of the concert with behind-the-scenes footage charting its conceptualization and realization. Caramanica noted that her performance, which included songs backed by a marching band in the style of historically black college football halftime shows, framed her music " in a lineage of Southern black musical traditions from New Orleans second line marches to Houston's chopped-and-screwed hip-hop." Caramanica also noted that "her set was punctuated with fireworks that, compared with what was happening onstage, seemed dull."
CADILLAC RECORDS (2008) Stream on Crackle; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Also connecting Beyoncé to the progenitors of American music is this biographical drama, written and directed by Darnell Martin. The film tells a loose tale of the Chicago record executive Leonard Chess and some of the artists who recorded for Chess Records, with Jeffrey Wright as Muddy Waters, Adrien Brody as Chess and Beyoncé as Etta James. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott called the film a "rollicking and insightful celebration of Chicago blues in its hectic golden age."
What's on TV
BREAKTHROUGH: THE IDEAS THAT CHANGED THE WORLD 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). PBS chose an excellent time to run this program about the telescope, just a week after a network of radio telescopes delivered the first image of a black hole straight from another galaxy. And it could hardly have found a more space-related actor/ narrator than Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard), who here walks viewers through the history of telescope technology and recent advancements. The episode begins PBS's series "Breakthrough," which focuses on inventions that altered the modern world. Later episodes, also narrated by Stewart, look at airplanes, robots, cars, rockets and smartphones.
SPY KIDS (2001) 8 p.m. on Nickelodeon. Good inventions can be used for nefarious deeds in the wrong hands. And villainous are the hands of Fegan Floop, the mastermind played by Alan Cumming in this espionage-for-kids movie, which introduced the evil, thumb-shaped Floop-owned robots known as Thumb-Thumbs. In hot pursuit of Floop are the mini-spies Carmen (Alexa PenaVega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara), stars of the show, who help save the world after their spy parents (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino) are captured. For a darker story about a child saddled with saving humanity for the adults, see the 2013 adaptation of Orson Scott Card's ENDER'S GAME, at 11 p.m. on Syfy, with Asa Butterfield as the alien-fighting Ender.

Texto completo: Aunque en redes sociales hay mensajes de júbilo de fanáticos y miembros del Estado Islámico ( ISIS ) sobre el incendio masivo que consumió gran parte de la catedral de Notre Dame en París , las autoridades indican que no están tratando el hecho como un “acto deliberado”, sino como un accidente.
Las investigaciones formales del siniestro comenzaron, reportó el New York Times, que indicó que los primeros reportes indican que el histórico inmueble permanece estructuralmente sano, pero la conflagración que destruyó el techo de madera y plomo y la aguja de encaje también dejó tres agujeros en el amplio techo abovedado. Insistieron en que no se indaga un atentado.
“Nada en esta etapa sugiere un acto voluntario” , dijo el fiscal de París, Rémy Heitz , quien señaló que la indagatoria será “larga y compleja”, e insistió que, por el momento, estaban considerando el desastre como un accidente.
El Times indicó que las autoridades destinaron a casi 50 investigadores, quienes se enfocarán en entrevistar a los trabajadores que habían abandonado el sitio, pero que habían participado en la restauración de la catedral poco antes de que se desatara el incendio .
Son varias la preguntas que han surgido, sobre todo si el siniestro pudo haberse evitado, pero es una respuesta difícil de dar, aunada a la incógnita de la verdadera causa.
“Los investigadores enfrentaron la difícil tarea de determinar una causa en la aparente ausencia de evidencia, destruida por las llamas que estallaron en el ‘bosque’ (como se le conocía), el marco de madera de vigas antiguas debajo del techo de plomo”, indicó el diario.

Texto completo: Youthful curiosity was rewarded Monday night at the Spokane Convention Center - with applause, medals and even some cash prizes.
That was nice, but for Spokane's brightest, curiosity is its own reward.
"I just want to delve into all that I can," said Brenden Archer, a senior at Shadle Park who won the $4,000 top prize for Fine Arts at the 27th annual Spokane Scholars Foundation Awards Banquet.
Archer did more than that. He excels at half a dozen musical instruments, plays a mean game of chess and owns a 4.0 GPA and a 1530 score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
And a few hours before earning the applause of a packed banquet hall, he won his tennis match at No. 1 singles for Shadle Park.
"To be artsy, be academic, be athletic  it's been amazing," Archer said. "I just want to glorify God in everything I do."
Archer was among six seniors who received top awards in academic categories that also included English, world languages, mathematics, science and social studies.
Eighteen other scholars won awards ranging from $1,000 to $3,000. All told, 148 scholars were honored - for their grades, test scores and other achievements, but mostly for their relentless desire to learn more about the world around them.
Eric Matheison of Central Valley was the top award winner in math. He earned perfect 5s on six Advanced Placement tests.
But Matheison also learned enough about computer programming to earn a certification from Microsoft and write his own code in developing an electronic keyboard simulator to help introduce students to music.
"I always find it interesting and curious how people interact," said Matheison, one of three $4,000 winners from Central Valley.
Matheison is active in the community, volunteering at retirement communities with his participation in music, and at Blessings Under the Bridge and Cancer Care Northwest.
Another CV senior, Jasmine Wen, won the top prize in English after being described by a teacher as "an outstanding young woman of uncompromising character and ability" and an "inspired writer" whose ability to analyze both fiction and nonfiction is "unsurpassed."
Wen said she appreciates the ability of fiction to "transport you into a different world," but stays grounded by reading the New York Times and the Economist.
Wen also has a 4.0 GPA, has scored no lower than a 4 on six AP tests, is an AP scholar with distinction, a National Commended Scholar, and scored a 1580 on the SAT test.
Spencer Taylor of Central Valley won the top prize in World Languages with proficiency in Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and French.
He also scored 1540 on the SAT and perfect 5s on four AP tests.
Deanna Dwyer of Lewis and Clark took home the top prize in science, partly with a perfect score in the ACT science test and her standing as this year's valedictorian.
"She consistently demonstrates the skills required to succeed in every level of the sciences pursuing a planned future in medicine," a teacher wrote of Dwyer.
North Central senior Nicholas Heimbigner is the $4,000 winner in social studies.
Described by a teacher as "one of the top 1-3 brightest, hardest-working, most curious students I have ever encountered," Heimbigner maintains a 4.0 GPA, is a National Merit Commended Scholar, an AP scholar with Distinction, and has a 1540 SAT score.

Texto completo: "Don could be a very serious professional, but he was always laughing about something. He always had a joke."
David Ley
Mosinee High School science teacher
MARATHON – Friends, family members and colleagues are remembering science educator Don Lutz as the developer of the Christa McAuliffe Nature Center in Marathon, a teacher's teacher and a lifelong learner himself.
Lutz, a Stevens Point native and 1970 graduate of Pacelli Catholic High School, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Fort Myers, Florida, as a result of a head injury he sustained in a fall a few days earlier. He was 68.
For most of his career, Lutz was a science teacher for the Marathon Middle School, now the Marathon Venture Academy. In the late 1980s, when the building for the middle and elementary school was being planned and built, Lutz saw the potential for an undeveloped area on the southern part of the property as an outdoor classroom and nature center.
"I thought for kids nowadays, with all the problems with the environment, that they need to know how a community works," Lutz told the Wausau Daily Herald in 2015 when the center marked its 25th anniversary. "And this pond is a community of animals and plants and populations of different things. So it makes it real easy to adapt that thought to what's happening in the real world."
Money, as it always is for schools, was tight, and there was no budget for the outside learning center. So Lutz took it upon himself to find grant money to pay for its initial development, and secured funding from a foundation named after Christa McAuliffe, a teacher who was one of seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986.
But no matter where he was, Lutz simply loved teaching. He was known for starting his classes each day with a joke, usually science related and usually corny. He was president of the Wisconsin Society of Science Teachers, and reveled in attending conferences where he could learn how to be a better teacher, but also mentor others who shared his passion.
David Ley, a veteran science teacher for Mosinee High School, met Lutz at such a workshop offered by the Wisconsin Academy Staff Development Initiative. Lutz was the oldest teacher in the group, Ley said, but he brought energy and enthusiasm to the training.
"Don could be a very serious professional, but he was always laughing about something. He always had a joke," Ley said. "He was a lover of the environment and for teaching kids. That was catching, inspiring. ... I think one of the themes of Don's life was that Don didn't just teach a classroom full of kids. He influenced do many educators around the whole state."
In the summers, Lutz led Marathon School District's summer program, teaching courses such as environmental education, rocketry and outdoor skills. Even after he retired as a classroom teacher in 2007, he continued those efforts.
Jenny Baeseman is a 1994 graduate of Marathon High School and a top-level scientist and researcher. Now a consultant, she was the executive director of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, an organization that helps coordinate scientific efforts in Antarctica. She didn't have Lutz as a classroom teacher, but learned from him in summer programs.
"I remember trying to learn how to read a compass from Mr. Lutz, but for the life of me I couldn't figure it out," Baeseman said in a Facebook message. "I still think of him when I try to use a compass."
Baeseman said Lutz helped inspire "so many people to go into science as a career. But more importantly, he made science fun, which made students learn whether they 'liked science' or not."
Lutz also was an athlete. As a youth, he was on the junior Olympic team for ski jumping, and was also a marathoner, a triathlete and cross-country skier. Joint problems forced him to give up running as he got older, but he still loved walking with his two dogs, Buddy and Charlie, said his wife, Alvie Lutz. The couple had no children.
In recent years, the couple spent most of their winters in Florida, Alvie Lutz wrote in an email message about her husband.
Even though he was retired, he never gave up teaching. He was a substitute teacher for several districts in central Wisconsin, and was thinking about becoming one in Florida.
Nor did he ever stop learning.
"When he was in Florida, he would walk every day to the Fort Myers library and read the complete New York Times," said Dennis DeNuccio, who was a friend of Lutz's since they went to high school together. "And he always has some books piled up on his nightstand. ... I think he just liked to learn."
Memorial services for Don Lutz are pending.

MARATHON – Friends, family members and colleagues are remembering science educator Don Lutz as the developer of the Christa McAuliffe Nature Center in Marathon, a teacher's teacher and a lifelong learner himself.
Lutz, a Stevens Point native and 1970 graduate of Pacelli Catholic High School, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Fort Myers, Florida, as a result of a head injury he sustained in a fall a few days earlier. He was 68.
For most of his career, Lutz was a science teacher for the Marathon Middle School, now the Marathon Venture Academy.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Ga. - It was 22 years ago, almost to the day, the world was presented a player who would take the game by storm.
Sunday at the Masters, he struck again.
The predicted electricity in the air at Augusta National Golf Club was no match for what was happening on the ground when Tiger Woods became the second-greatest Masters champion of them all, ending a 14-year drought and winning his fifth green jacket with a performance every bit as pulsating as his other four.
The player who became the youngest Masters champion in history in 1997 became the second oldest at age 43 when he birdied three of the final six holes to leap past a stumbling Francesco Molinari of Italy and back into the consciousness of everybody in the golf world.
"It's overwhelming what has transpired the last year," Woods said after he won his 15th major championship and first in 11 years. "It's unreal for me to experience this. My mom was here. I couldn't be more happy and more excited."
On a day when the final starting time was pushed up five hours to beat forecasted severe weather, it was Woods who provided the thunder through the hills and valleys of Augusta National. He shot a final-round 70 that included six birdies and four bogeys to finish at 13-under 275, a shot better than two of the top four players in the world - Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - and Xander Schauffele.
When he two-putted the final hole for bogey to complete an improbable two-year comeback from back fusion surgery, Woods celebrated like at no other time after any of his 81 PGA Tour victories, including his previous major victories. He threw his arms in the air several times, pumping them to the sky in ecstatic jubilation, smiling broadly to break the icy demeanor he showed throughout the final round.
When he walked off the green and shared long, emotional embraces with his son, Charlie; daughter, Sam; and his mother, Kultida, there weren't many dry eyes around the 18th green as the patrons loudly chanted, "Tiger, Tiger."
"To have my kids there, it's come full circle," Woods said. "My dad was here in [1997] and I'm the dad with two kids here."
It was Woods first major championship since his 2008 U.S. Open playoff victory over Rocco Mediate and his first at the Masters since 2005, when he defeated Chris DeMarco in a one-hole playoff. It also was the first time he won a major when he didn't have the 54-hole lead.
It has been a steady progression back to the top for Woods. He was in the final pairing and finished sixth at the British Open in July and finished second at the PGA Championship in August. In both instances, he lost to the players he held off the Masters - Molinari and Koepka.
"It's just unreal, to be honest with you," Woods said. "The whole tournament has meant so much to me over the years. To come back here and play as well as I did . to have everyone here, it's something I will never, ever forget."
It was a classic Woods performance, filled with sterling iron play and some crooked tee shots. He led the field in greens in regulation, hitting 58 of 72 over four days (80.6 percent), despite hitting 35 of 56 fairways and ranking 47th in driving accuracy (62.5 percent).
In the end, the players beat the storm that was forecast for Sunday afternoon in Augusta. They just couldn't beat the other one.
"The energy out there was brilliant with Tiger being out there," said Molinari, the 54-hole leader who began the day with a two-shot lead. "People were loving it."
Molinari, who had made just one bogey in his first 60 holes, made two double bogeys on the back nine when he watered two shots in a span of four holes - his tee shot at the par-3 12th and his third shot at No. 15 after it clipped a tree limb. The reigning British Open champion shot 74 and finished tied for fifth at 277, two shots behind Woods.
"The mistake Francesco made there at 12 let a lot of people back in the tournament, including myself," Woods said.
Indeed, when Woods two-putted from 50 feet, he had finally caught Molinari to tie for the lead. When he two-putted for birdie at the par-5 15th, Woods broke a five-way tie at the top to emerge as the sole leader with three holes to play - his first time all week at the top of the leader board.
But Woods still had other worries. Ahead of him, Koepka made eagle at the par-5 13th and birdie at the par-5 15th to climb into a share of the lead. So did Schauffele, who made five birdies in a seven-hole stretch beginning at No. 8; and Johnson, who birdied four of the final six holes.
In fact, the only player to momentarily overtake Woods was Patrick Cantlay, who had battled back from an opening-round 73 and got to 12-under after an eagle at No. 15. But Cantlay bogeyed the next two holes to finish at 278, tied with Jon Rahm and Rickie Fowler.
?All that was left was for Woods to bask into the adulation of the throng that gathered around the 18th green and put another indelible imprint on the tournament he has mastered better than everyone - except one.
"It was an amazing buzz out there," Woods said. "There were so many different scenarios that could have transpired on the back nine, so many guys that had a chance to win. You couldn't have had more drama than we all had out there. Now I know why I'm balding."

Texto completo: f not for a cup of coffee, one of the best-selling novels in the United States might never have been written.

Heather Morris said she was meeting an old friend she hadn't seen in several months, when that friend casually mentioned that she had a friend whose mother had just died and his father was looking for someone to tell his story.

"She asked, 'Do you want to meet him?' " said Morris, who lives outside of Melbourne. "She was Jewish, and she knew I wasn't. Lale had been very clear to his son that he wanted to talk to somebody who is not Jewish. So I said yes to a cup of coffee and I said yes to meeting Lale."

The result of that chance meeting is the historical novel, The Tattoist of Auschwitz, which has spent more than 30 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List since its U.S. release in September.

As part of her first U.S. book tour, Morris will stop at Scott High School at 7 p.m. Monday as part of the Toledo Lucas County Public Library's Authors! series. The series is presented by The Blade and Buckeye Broadband.

The Tattooist of Auschwitz follows the true story of Lale Sokolov, a Jewish prisoner from Slovakia who was given the assignment of tattooing identification numbers on prisoners' arms in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp during World War II. It's in this role that Lale meets Gita Fuhrmannova, also a Slovakian prisoner, with whom he falls in love.

As tattooist, Lale is afforded a sense of freedom of which other prisoners could only dream: a private room, extra food, and the ability to wander freely throughout the camp - the latter of which plays an important role in fostering his relationship with Gita.

What exactly about Lale and Gita's story makes Morris' novel fiction?

Memoir and biography can be restrictive, the author said.

To write it as a memoir, as I was initially told to do, would have required me to put into the story only the events that Lale himself witnessed or experienced, she said. I couldn't have had Gita in there. When I referred to the football game that they played in there, Lale couldn't remember the names of the prisoners and I would have had to refer to them as Player 1 and Player 2. And I wouldn't have been able to create conversation and dialogue. -… It's not how I wanted the story to be told.

Still, the work required plenty of research. Morris said the information she has on Gita's time at the camp came from other survivors.

She had vast information with which to work as Australia has the second-largest number of Holocaust survivors after Israel.

I got to meet many, many survivors and people who knew Lale in the camp, Morris said. One particular lady, who is still alive - she's 95 - loves to tell the story of Lale numbering her.

The book also touches on recognizable figures, including camp commandant Rudolf Hoss and notorious Nazi doctor Josef Mengele.

There was a matter of telling [Lale's] story without getting bogged down in the horrors upon horrors that he witnessed, and I decided that no good could come from sharing those in his story, she said.

It's also important, she said, for people to know that it has a happy ending before they ever pick up the book.

The thing I really want to get across is that this is not the story of the Holocaust, she said. This is just a Holocaust story. It's Lale's story.

Morris first met with Lale in 2003 and finished the screenplay within about a year. In that form, his story languished as a script in Australia for six years as a production company tried to get the funding. At that point, Morris took the screen option back.

It was at that time, my very wise sister-in-law, whom I was visiting in San Diego, said one night, 'Write the damn thing as a book and get on with it,' Morris said.

During that initial meeting with Lale, Morris said he grilled her at length about her upbringing and her knowledge of Judaism and the Holocaust. She did, however, harbor her own concerns.

I said, 'There is one thing - my mother's maiden name, Morris said. (It was Schwartfeger.) And I told him, and he went, 'German,' and I went, 'Yeah,' and he said, 'Eh, we can't pick our parents, can we?' And that was the end of it.

From there, Morris said she spent three wonderful years with Lale, who also got to know the author and her family. In the beginning, she said he had a sense of urgency, constantly pressing her to finish his story so that he could join Gita.

I was dealing with a man who wanted to die, Morris said, but he got past that.

She added that he gave her the clinical stuff right away, but it took time for him to open up emotionally.

Lale was unable to read the book as he died on Oct. 31, 2006. He was, however, able to read several drafts of the screenplay and was working with producers initially working on the project. He approved of the screenplay and wanted to add more, but Morris said he understood the limitations. By then Lale had another part of the project on his mind.

He was making me take him to movies, because he wanted to find the perfect person to play Lale Sokolov, Morris recalled. That was a really interesting experience, sitting with him in theaters, asking 'What about him? What about him?'

He initially wanted Brad Pitt, whom Morris told Lale was too old for the role, and then he settled on Ryan Gosling. (Lale was 25 when he was taken to the camp; Gita was 18.)

Natalie Portman was the only female that he considered worthy of playing Gita, Morris said.

Though the screenplay was shelved in favor of the book, the popularity of Lale's story has given new life to a screenplay.

In September, the story was optioned to Synchronicity Films, a company with close ties to BBC, for production of a six-part TV miniseries. At the time of the announcement, Deadline reported that the company's plan was to air the miniseries in January as a tie-in to the 75th anniversary of the Auschwitz camp's liberation.

So who will play Lale and Gita in the upcoming miniseries?

Morris is mum on the details, but said to expect an announcement from Synchronicity soon.

As for her next book, Morris will return in a way to Lale's story, this time focusing on the young girl Cilka, who is a secondary character in The Tattooist of Auschwitz.

Cilka was a prisoner of the camp, who ultimately was charged as a Nazi conspirator.

From the day Lale asked me, 'Did I tell you about Cilka?'' - I said, 'No, who is she?' And, he said, 'She saved my life,' - I became fascinated by her.

Texto completo: What’s in a word? When the word is spying, it could mean defending American democracy, or trying to undermine it.
On Wednesday Attorney General Bill Barr startled Senators when he said during a budget hearing that he believed that “spying did occur” during the 2016 presidential race, and that “spying on a political campaign is a big deal. " He tempered his statement by adding “the question is whether it was adequately predicated” and was not ready to say that “improper surveillance occurred;” but he is “concerned about it and looking into it. ”
Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, took issue with Barr’s word choice, saying “the word ‘spying’ could cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out. ” And of course they did. NBC News’ Chuck Todd said this was a “conspiracy theory” for which there was “zero factual basis. ” Furious Democrats denounced Barr for even raising the issue. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N. Y. , tweeted that Barr should “retract his statement immediately or produce specific evidence to back it up. ”
Luckily the evidence may be on its way. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is near the end of his investigation into possible abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) with respect to targeting former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Since the FISA warrant was the predicate for subsequent surveillance, the impending IG report potentially will reveal whether it was legitimately obtained. Recently revealed text messages between FBI lawyer Lisa Page and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe show that the issue of biased sources was being hotly contested even days before the warrant application. If the warrant was in fact issued on the weight of the notorious “Steele dossier,” which was underwritten by the Clinton campaign, then all that followed could fall under the “improper surveillance” rubric, especially if some FBI employees knew it was bogus all along.
And there will be more information coming. The attorney general said he was looking into the genesis of the Russian collusion story, and that he was “not talking about the FBI, necessarily, but intelligence agencies more broadly. ” Because if you want to find spying, go where the spies are.
Intelligence treated Trump like the enemy
Obama-era officials like former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have cast the effort to investigate Russian influence in the Trump campaign as a standard counterintelligence operation. As such, they were just doing their duty.
But there are some problems with this narrative. One is that if foreign entities were attempting seriously to subvert the Trump campaign, it would have made most sense immediately to warn Donald Trump. Once alerted he could have insulated his campaign from foreign influence, fired members of the campaign who were already compromised, and worked actively with the Intelligence Community and the FBI to expose the malign foreign network.
But rather than warning Trump, the intelligence community treated his campaign like a target. Instead of helping Trump block Russia from penetrating his organization, it seems more like the agencies were hoping to discover that a collusion network was up and running. The CIA’s Counterintelligence Mission Center soon became a “conduit to the FBI” feeding information about alleged contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians. But as House testimony from Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos reveals, many such contacts were setups seeking to entrap people tied to Trump. Papadopoulos recently tweeted to Brennan that the assets the CIA “weaponized … are being outed in London, Canberra and Rome,” and that “foreign governments are now cooperating with the Trump administration to out the rest. ” Does the activity Papadopoulos alleges sound like “spying?” It certainly uses the tools of the trade, and if foreigners were involved what better word is there?
Did partisan agencies spy on Trump?
We’ve been down this rhetorical road before. In May 2018 when reports surfaced about the FBI using an informant to target Papadopoulos and Page, President Trump made repeated references to a “spy” being planted in his campaign. The New York Times countered that this was not so much spying as an “investigation. ” James Clapper referred to it as “observing. ” Former FBI agent Asha Rangappa called it using an “intelligence source. ” And in this context none of those terms are materially different from what most people understand as spying.
Spygate is more than a semantic debate. The issue is whether high ranking officials in various government agencies abused their power to conduct intelligence gathering on a major party presidential campaign for a political purpose. The attorney general calls that spying. President Trump calls it treason. And when all the evidence is laid bare the American people can call it as they see it.

Texto completo: Veteran media blogger Robert Feder posted a few "pro tips" Monday for Chicago's Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot from a group of local TV political reporters.
To sum it up: Remain accessible and transparent in your relations with the media; don't spout canned soundbites; try to get back to reporters well before their deadlines; don't use the Freedom of Information Act as a delaying tactic; and don't fret about winning each news cycle.
Solid advice, to which I'd add this: Hire the best communications team you can find.
Bring into your inner circle experienced, personable, industrious, thick-skinned spokespeople who accept that negative coverage is sometimes fair coverage, and who know that the only proven way to mitigate the damage of bad news is to get out in front of it with complete and truthful answers delivered with as little bitterness as possible.
You're going to get hammered from time to time. It comes with the territory. A good communications staff won't hammer back but will keep you focused on tomorrow's stories, columns and editorials. They will serve as strategists, not just mouthpieces, and will be unafraid to tell you when you deserve the brickbats.
Listen to them. You may get hammered a little less often or at least a little less severely.
Too many pols don't seem to appreciate this. Either they hire inexperienced, chippy, reflexively combative public relations staffers who think "no comment" will help make a tough story go away, or they hire savvy ones and then ignore their counsel.
Consider the Jussie Smollett controversy that's continuing to make news and may seriously hamper Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's re-election chances next year.
It was always going to be a big story -- when a TV star alleges a sensational, hate-inspired attack against him, police investigators subsequently allege he staged the whole thing and prosecutors abruptly drop all charges at an "emergency" court hearing, the headlines write themselves. But the reason it's a lingering, festering story has been Foxx's failure to implement a solid communications strategy.
Her explanations for why her office decided to ignore the grand jury indictment in a case that initially embarrassed and mortified Chicagoans have been various and sketchy. And her decision to embrace the idea that related criticism of her is rooted in racism has been inflammatory and has cast her entire justice-reform initiative in an unflattering light.
I don't know whether Foxx has gotten lousy PR advice, isn't paying heed to good PR advice or is simply staggering through this imbroglio on her own. But however it's happened, this has become an object lesson in how not to roll out a challenging narrative.
Through her press office and occasionally directly she has given unsatisfying answers to specific questions and ignored follow-ups. In so doing she's left the story littered with question marks instead of periods.
Years after Smollett and Foxx have been otherwise forgotten, professors of marketing and communications will be teaching this story to their students in the what-not-to-do unit.
Madame Mayor-elect, you had an effective, responsive campaign press team. That augured well. Here's hoping you recruit the best and brightest political spokeswomen and spokesmen to help guide you through the months and years ahead.
I won't mention any names, but just ask around.
I will add, though, that I plan to remind whomever you hire that on Jan. 30 you were among the seven (of 14) mayoral candidates who pledged that, if elected, you would sit down for regular grillings by panels of journalists. WTTW-Ch. 11 volunteered half an hour of airtime a month for such sessions.
And I will also add that I hope your media advisers break you of the habit of using the word "fulsome" to mean "very full," as in expansive or comprehensive.
Last Sunday you asked for "a transparent and fulsome subject-matter hearing" on the Lincoln Yards and The 78 project tax subsidy proposals. Earlier this month you said Foxx owed Chicago a more "fulsome" explanation of how her office handled the Smollett case. You also cited the need for "a fulsome grand jury report" in a federal reinvestigation of three Chicago police officers acquitted in state court of covering up the actions of another officer in the shooting death of Laquan McDonald.
Word nerds are cringing. As the late lexicographical pundit William Safire wrote in the New York Times in 2009, since the 16th century, the primary dictionary definition for fulsome has been " 'satiating, cloying, excessive.' Shakespeare used it often, meaning 'loathsome' and 'rank with lust.' The Oxford English Dictionary defines its application to language and style as 'offensive to good taste ... from being 'over-done.' Now chiefly used in reference to gross or excessive flattery."
"Fulsome praise," for example, is oleaginous and sycophantic in the formal sense, not enthusiastic and abundant.
Language lovers will take your side, I admit. They will say that usage dictates the evolution of our tongue, and that only fussbudgets will grouse that the same process that is transforming "enormity" from a word meaning "great wickedness" into a fancy synonym for "very large" and has blurred the useful distinction between "uninterested" and "disinterested" is having its way with "fulsome."
But as a member of Team Fussbudget, I hope you come around to joining us.

Terms of endearment
One more language note. I found myself in an extensive and heartfelt wrangle on Facebook recently after I objected to a printed reference to Amy Eshleman as Lightfoot's "spouse."
The news archives suggest that Lightfoot prefers "wife" -- though her responsive press team told me she's OK with either term -- and that writers very seldom refer to the wife of a male public figure as his "spouse."
To me, the gender neutrality of "spouse" suggested a discomfort with gay marriage and implied a certain otherness. But to those who are quite possibly more woke than I, that same gender neutrality suggested a healthy rejection of sex stereotypes and an inclusive, welcoming attitude toward a variety of intimate partnerships.
"Husband" and "wife" have their own particular cultural weight, after all. Not every couple wants to carry it.
I'm interested in what LGBTQ couples have to say about this. Help break the stalemate and write to me!

Texto completo: embraces policy for moving migrants
Once-discounted plan given 'strong considerations' President Trump moved aggressively Friday to take ownership of an internal White House plan to release immigrant detainees into "sanctuary cities" that his aides had sought to minimize a day earlier by saying it was shelved months ago after only informal consideration.
Directly contradicting his staff, Trump declared in a tweet that he was giving the plan "strong considerations," and, at an event later in the day, sarcastically challenged Democrats in liberal jurisdictions to accept the immigrants with "open arms."
The president said that if Congress refuses to change immigration laws to allow his administration to more quickly deport a surge of asylum-seeking Central American families, "we'll bring - I call them the 'illegals' because they enter the country illegally - to sanctuary cities and areas and let those particular areas take care of it."
Specifically referring to California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Trump added: "California is always saying, 'We want more people.' We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply. Let's see if they're so happy."
Since 1989, San Francisco has had policies aimed at limiting municipal cooperation with federal immigration authorities in certain cases, and California in 2017 adopted a "sanctuary state" law that implemented similar restrictions.
Trump's comments capped a frenzied two-week period during which the president threatened to close the U.S. border with Mexico, only to pull back amid warnings that such a move would deeply harm the economy. He then embarked on an overhaul of the leadership of the Department of Homeland Security that included the removal of Kirstjen Nielsen as secretary and a promise to staff the agency with people who would take a "tougher" approach on immigration.
The president's embrace of the sanctuary cities policy is another sign of his mounting frustration over his inability to stem the flow of migrants at the border after making a promise to crack down on illegal immigration the central theme of his 2016 campaign.
The Washington Post reported Thursday that the administration had been eyeing districts of political adversaries, including that of Pelosi, to release detainees. The disclosure of the plan - which was explicitly rejected in November and February by Homeland Security officials who feared it would create additional burdens for agents and potentially run afoul of legal provisions - drew widespread recriminations.
A White House official said Thursday that the proposal "was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion."
But on Friday, White House aides, according to people familiar with the discussions, began a new, preliminary review of whether there could be a way to move detainees to sanctuary cities should Trump decide to actually go through with the plan. A DHS official said the agency had not been instructed to move forward.
One senior aide described Trump's position as an effort to exploit the political "upside" of the controversy and draw a sharp contrast with Democrats on border enforcement. Trump's eagerness to do so reflected his confidence that coaxing his rivals into a deeper fight over immigration will help him in his 2020 reelection campaign.
Several aides said that there was a desire among some West Wing officials to move away from immigration after a week in which the president fired several senior DHS leaders in a sign of growing alarm over the spiking border crossings.
But Trump "wants to talk about it and will always take whatever position he thinks makes him look strongest," said a senior administration official, who like other aides spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
Administration officials said that even Stephen Miller, the president's hawkish immigration aide, was concerned Thursday about the plan getting out and had tried to downplay it in the building. Communications officials, including press secretary Sarah Sanders and her deputy Hogan Gidley, sought to convince reporters that it was not under consideration anymore to keep the story from picking up traction.
But after seeing media coverage of the plan Friday morning, the president decided it was a good idea and tweeted out his support, according to aides.
One person outside the White House who frequently talks with the president said that while Miller is widely viewed as the most forceful advocate for hard-line border policies that have, in numerous instances, been halted by federal courts, it is Trump who is most willing to "push the limits."
During a trip to the border town of Calexico, Calif., last week, Trump reportedly told then-Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan that he should close the border, despite the president having said earlier in the week he would keep it open, according to CNN and the New York Times. He then told McAleenan, who is now the acting Homeland Security secretary, that he would pardon him if he ran into any legal problems resulting from the closure, although it was unclear how serious he was, according to the reports.
"At no time has the President indicated, asked, directed or pressured the Acting Secretary to do anything illegal," a DHS spokesman said in a statement, in response to a question about the conversation between Trump and McAleenan. "Nor would the Acting Secretary take actions that are not in accordance with our responsibility to enforce the law."
A senior administration official said Trump has periodically mused about closing the border, even after saying he wouldn't, but added that they don't think he is seriously considering the move. "He's just frustrated as hell," the official said.
In his remarks at the White House on Friday, Trump vowed to send more military troops to the border, after having dispatched several thousand to support Border Patrol operations last fall ahead of the midterm election. Troops are not allowed under U.S. law to make arrests inside the United States, and they were confined to a support role, including such duties as erecting barbed wire.
"There are a lot of people with criminal records trying to get through," Trump said of the migrants, even though a majority are families with children.
DHS said 103,000 migrants, including nearly 60,000 family members, were taken into custody in March at the southern border with Mexico, a sharp increase from the total of 58,000 migrants detained in January.
House Democrats have begun internal discussions about launching an investigation into Miller's role in the White House's immigration policies, including potentially calling him to testify on Capitol Hill. Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), who chairs the border subcommittee on the House Homeland Security panel, said Miller needs to "make his case for these terrible policies to the American people instead of being this shadow puppeteer."
"If he's going to continue advocating for these policies and personnel change then he needs to come before the American people and explain himself," Rice said.
She added that the committee's leadership might soon request emails and documents from the White House and federal agencies that could shed light on Miller's role. Although his name was not on messages sent from the White House to pressure DHS to release immigrants into sanctuary cities, some agency officials said they believed he was among those who had initiated the request.
"Using human beings - including children - for perceived political gain, is reprehensible," Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who is campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, wrote on Twitter.
The White House proposal had been opposed by federal immigration enforcement officials who viewed it as unworkable, having no legal justification and likely to create strain on an agency already dealing with a crisis.
DHS generally releases immigrants in two ways: directly from one of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's immigration jails or, more recently, from Customs and Border Protection after they are apprehended and pass an initial security check.
ICE is required to release immigrants, including some with serious criminal records, if they cannot deport them. The Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that immigrants cannot be jailed indefinitely after they have a final deportation order and must be released after six months if their native country will not take them back.
Sometimes, ICE officers or immigration judges release immigrants on bond. Under current practice, once detainees are released, they are generally free to settle wherever they choose, and they are required to inform the government of their address.
Most of the roughly 50,000 immigrants in federal custody have been apprehended at the southern border.
On Friday, San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón said the president was engaged in "a politically motivated stunt."
"The fact that such a proposal is being peddled by the leader of the free world is an all-time low for American discourse," he said. "And it's the clearest sign yet that the president fully intends to chart a path to reelection on the back of racist rhetoric and policies intended to divide us."

TRUMP DEBASES THE FED THE TAX CUT FIZZLED; SEND IN THE CLOWNS!

Texto completo: As far as I know, the Federal Reserve - the world's most important economic policy institution - doesn't have an anthem. But if it were to adopt one now, the choice would be obvious: "Send in the Clowns."
You see, the Fed's governing board currently has two vacancies, and President Donald Trump has proposed filling those vacancies with ludicrous hacks. If he succeeds, one of our few remaining havens of serious, nonpartisan policymaking will be on its way toward becoming as corrupt and dysfunctional as the rest of the Trump administration.
Stephen Moore and Herman Cain are, of course, completely unqualified - I say "of course" because their lack of qualifications is, paradoxically, a key qualification not just for Mr. Trump but for the GOP in general.
There are plenty of genuine monetary experts with conservative political leanings, some of them quite partisan. But modern Republicans have shown consistent disdain for such experts, perhaps because of a sense that anyone with real expertise or an independent reputation might occasionally be tempted to take a stand on principle.
There's no risk that either Mr. Moore or Mr. Cain will ever take such a stand. In fact, what seems to have recommended both men to Mr. Trump was their evident willingness to completely reverse their policy views when politically expedient.
Both were hard-money men during the Obama years, demanding higher interest rates despite very high unemployment. Both have now taken to berating the Fed for failing to print more money in the face of low unemployment - because that's what Mr. Trump wants.
That said, there's a difference between the two men.
I wrote about Mr. Moore a couple of weeks ago, noting that he has long been a prominent fixture in the conservative movement; he is, basically, a classic right-wing hack who tries (incompetently) to impersonate an economic expert. Mr. Cain, on the other hand, is a spam king whose business model involves making his email list available to direct marketers.
Put it this way: In recent years, Mr. Moore has been out there predicting magical results from tax cuts, putting out fake economic numbers and giving speeches to FreedomFest. At the same time, Mr. Cain has been offering a platform for peddlers of get-rich schemes and cures for erectile dysfunction. So it says something about what Mr. Trump wants that he apparently sees the two men as equally valuable allies.
What does Mr. Trump want? His attempted beclowning of the Fed follows, I'd argue, from the fact that his one major legislative success, the 2017 tax cut - which he predicted would be "rocket fuel" for the economy - has turned out to be a big fizzle, economically and, especially, politically.
It's true that U.S. economic growth got a bump for two quarters last year, and Trumpists are still pretending to believe that we'll have great growth for a decade. But at this point, last year's growth is looking like a brief and rapidly fading sugar high.
Meanwhile, the tax cut remains unpopular, partly because few people perceived personal benefits, partly because voters appear to be less concerned about paying too much than with the sense that the rich - the prime beneficiaries of the Trump cut - are paying too little.
Some leaders might see such disappointments as reasons to make a course correction. But this is Mr. Trump: When the going gets tough, he blames someone else. Everything would have been great, he insists, if the Fed hadn't thwarted his plans.
There's a good argument to be made that the Fed misjudged the economy's strength, that it raised interest rates too fast and that the economy would be doing somewhat better if it hadn't. In fact, it's an argument I agree with.
But that's not what Mr. Trump is saying. He wants the Fed to act as if we were still in a deep depression; he wants it both to cut rates and to resume the emergency policies it pursued - and he denounced - when we had more than twice as much unemployment as we do today. This would, he insists, turn the economy into the "rocket ship" he originally promised.
You don't have to be a gold bug or even an inflation hawk to see these demands as deeply irresponsible. Indeed, they sound a lot like the "macroeconomic populism" that has repeatedly led to economic disaster in Latin America, with Venezuela the latest example.
Running the printing presses to fight a depression, as the Fed did after the financial crisis, is prudent and sensible; running them because you refuse to accept the reality that your policies aren't delivering an economic miracle is different, and always ends badly.
Now, even putting both Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain on the Fed board probably wouldn't be enough to push America over the monetary edge. And so far, markets don't seem worried about the potential for runaway inflation.
But maybe investors should be worried, at least a bit, by the spectacle of a president who would rather appoint hacks and debase the Fed's integrity than admit that his policies aren't working as promised. U.S. policymaking is looking ever more like that of a corrupt third-world regime. And that is bound, sooner or later, to have consequences.

"Optics." This word seems to be a trendy addition to our vocabulary. Like me, you have probably encountered it most often in political reporting.
By doing a little research, I was surprised to learn that William Safire wrote about this term a decade ago in his last column for On Language, a once regular feature in the New York Times Magazine.
In essence, Safire (and later his successor, Bill Zimmer) noted that the term "optics" is merely a scientific-sounding buzzword for image-making. How the "optics" are understood is critical; but it is not always the same for every person.
Notably, reading images does not begin in adulthood; rather, it is rooted in childhood, specifically picture books. In the world of education, we call this visual literacy, the ability to derive meaning from image.
To interpret a picture in a children's book, a visually literate reader considers the composition of the picture and sees beyond the colors and lines to the social constructs that are revealed. (And, yes, children do this! But they do this better if adults help!)
If you want to enhance your children's visual literacy, start by selecting a few wordless books. Wordless books focus on making meaning from images ALONE! Here are a few strategies that parents, caregivers and teachers might use while reading a wordless book:
Develop vocabulary to help your children talk about the picture. Consider these terms: line, shape, size, color, space and point of view/perspective. For example, specifically ask your child why an illustrator used a particular color or why certain objects are larger or smaller, or why the illustrator drew the image from a specific point of view. Ask about that white space and why the illustrator chose to add that to the page.
When you come upon a particularly interesting picture in a wordless book, pause. Use these three questions as you look at a page: What do you see? What do you think about what you see? What do you wonder about this image?
Afterward, have your children draw pictures to help them express their response to the image.
There are so many superb wordless picture books, but here are three that will help enhance your child's visual literacy:
"Another" by Christian Robinson is a recently published wordless book that has received starred reviews from many sources. Reviewers have called this book a "work or art and a celebration of childhood." Join the main characters, a little girl and her cat, as they explore another world that seems to be both enchanting and puzzling.
"Wave" by South Korean author/illustrator Suzy Lee offers images of a child protagonist who is investigating the beach for the first time. This book provides extraordinary images for discussion.
"Shadow," also by Lee, provides another opportunity to "read" a story told in just three colors: black, white and yellow. The setting is a dark attic, but it is a lightbulb and the child's imagination that offer an ideal venue to expand your child's visual literacy.
Perhaps Henry David Thoreau provided the best summary for thinking about visual literacy when he wrote, "It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see."

Texto completo: Shakespeare once wrote, “First, let’s kill all the lawyers.” And you can insert any of hundreds of lawyer jokes here. (Here’s one: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer? A: His partners.) So why would anybody want to pretend to be a lawyer? It happens, all too frequently, in many guises.
Here are a few to watch out for …
The fake lawyer “suing” you
A common scam these days involves a phone call or an email from someone claiming to be a lawyer representing an opposing party in a lawsuit against you. This fake lawyer may also state they’ve already obtained a judgment against you, and now it’s time to pay up. They may even give you a (fake) case number. Typically they’re demanding personal information and often a settlement amount. Real lawyer (me) wants you to know that’s not how this works.
If there were a lawsuit against you, you would know long before someone started calling to collect money. To start, you would have been served with the complaint. But the easiest way to figure out if the call is from an actual lawyer or even a real lawyer’s office is to ask for the name and bar number of the attorney handling the matter.
If the caller gives you a name and/or number, check with the State Bar of California at calbar.ca.gov/Public to see if the phone number they’re calling from matches the name and bar number you’ve been given. Attorneys (the real ones) in California are required to maintain current contact information with the State Bar.
This faux lawyer wants to represent you
Be wary of scams when you’re searching for a lawyer. Sadly, there are certain areas of law that seem to attract scammers pretending to be lawyers to make a quick buck off your pain. Common areas for this are immigration, disability, troubles with the IRS and personal injury. Signs it’s a scam include demands for large sums of money up front, pressure to retain them immediately, and the insistence that this is an emergency and you’ll soon lose rights if you don’t retain this person immediately.
If you find yourself being approached with offers of representation or even when you’re responding to an ad, be sure to do your due diligence. Again, find out the alleged attorney’s name and check with the State Bar. Check the phone number you’re getting calls from — does it really belong to a law office? Check your gut, too. If you’re feeling pressured, worried, or just queasy, this isn’t the right person to represent you, whether they’re a lawyer or not.
“I’m not a lawyer, I just play one in your documents”
“Document preparation assistance” offices have proliferated in California. You can usually recognize them by their neon signs and big window advertisements stating you can get a divorce, file bankruptcy, do your estate planning … and go home with several Ginsu knives all for $299. (I’m only kidding about the Ginsu knives. Those are extra.)
These offices are staffed with non-attorneys (and, not unheard of, disbarred attorneys) whose role is supposed to be solely to assist you in typing up your paperwork for a divorce, bankruptcy, estate planning or other legal matter. By law, they cannot give you legal advice. What could possibly go wrong?
Well, let me tell you. Here are just a few issues the document preparer cannot advise you on:
* What type of bankruptcy to file
* Is a will sufficient or do you need a trust
* How do your retirement plans or life insurance integrate with your estate plan
* How do federal laws dealing with retirement plans affect your divorce
* How can you tell if the spouse you are divorcing is hiding assets
* Can your soon-to-be ex waive spousal support forever? How about child support?
* Do you need a corporation or a limited liability company? How will that entity be taxed?
And filing incorrect immigration papers can result in permanently destroying a person’s immigration status or losing your place on the years-long INS waiting list.
When you skip the lawyers and head to a “document preparer,” you’re the one who is now “playing lawyer.” You might guess right. You might not. However it turns out, the document preparation assistance guy or gal isn’t responsible — they were just your typist.
Legal matters require legal advice. And yes, we know, it’s not cheap. But it’s cheaper than getting it wrong. If you still go to a non-lawyer, please at least make sure they’re bonded. And remember, they’re not covered by the attorney-client privilege, so anything you discuss with them is not private, and they can be called to testify against you.
The victim lawyer
This is just to make you feel better. Lawyers are becoming the victims of online scams now as well. Usually, it’s someone claiming they need legal assistance and want the lawyer to hold funds for them in the lawyer’s trust account. And guess what they need in order to send that? The lawyer’s banking information. You’re not feeling sorry for us though, are you? It’s OK. We’re used to that.
Q: Why do they bury lawyers under 20 feet of dirt? A: Because deep down, they’re really good people.

Texto completo: La hermana mayor del presidente Donald Trump, Maryanne Trump Barry, se retiró como jueza federal de apelaciones, poniendo fin a una investigación sobre si ella violó las reglas de conducta judicial al participar en planes de impuestos fraudulentos con sus hermanos.
Una investigación realizada por The New York Times descubrió el pasado octubre que los Trump se habían comprometido en dudosos planes fiscales durante la década de 1990, incluyendo casos de fraude, que aumentaron considerablemente la riqueza heredada por Trump y su hermanos.
La juez Barry no solo se habría beneficiado financieramente de la mayoría de esos esquemas de impuestos, según este diario, sino que ella también estaba en posición de influir en las acciones que tomaba su familia.
Según el periódico, Barry presentó sus documentos de retiro diez días después de que los funcionarios judiciales notificaron a los reclamantes que el asunto estaba “recibiendo toda la atención” de un consejo de conducta judicial. Como juez inactiva, Barry ya no enfrentará ahora la acusación de mala conducta judicial, ya que el estatuto solo se aplica a los jueces activos, según el Times.
La información aún no se ha anunciado públicamente, pero los reclamantes, al menos dos de ellos vinculados a la profesión legal, se dieron cuenta la semana pasada de que el caso se había retirado sin conclusiones sobre las denuncias.
Si bien antes se arriesgó a ser reprendida, castigada o incluso acusada por la investigación de la revisión del consejo judicial, ahora tiene derecho a un salario de jubilación que podría oscilar entre los 184.500 y 217.600 dólares anuales. Barry no respondió a las solicitudes de comentarios del Times.
El presidente Ronald Reagan seleccionó a Barry, una exfiscal, para servir en el Tribunal del Distrito Federal en Nueva Jersey en 1983. El presidente Bill Clinton la nominó para el Tribunal de Apelaciones del Tercer Circuito de los Estados Unidos en 1999.

Winning ‘Lottery Day’

Texto completo: "Lottery Day" — ? ? ? 1/2 "Lottery Day" delivers a comic and dramatic win — as well as a victory lap — for prolific Chicago playwright Ike Holter. And audiences can enjoy the payout as well thanks to a raucous world-premiere production at Goodman Theatre.
The play marks a celebratory, elegiac conclusion to Holter’s ambitious seven-play "Rightlynd Saga." He packed each of his savvy works, set in his Rightlynd neighborhood of the fictional 51st Ward, with real-life, ripped-from-the-headlines Chicago issues — from school closures in "Exit Strategy" to self-made superheroes tackling gang violence in "Prowess." Die-hard theater fans, who first discovered Holter’s early works in tiny storefront spaces, could follow recurring characters throughout the cycle.
"Lottery Day" is the same, though you don’t need to have seen previous "Rightlynd" plays to go with the flow.
Director Lili-Anne Brown’s production promises fun from the start.
"Lottery Day" takes place at a backyard barbecue party thrown by the powerful neighborhood matriarch Mallory (J. Nicole Brooks). At first, it looks like Mallory is hosting the gathering to annoy her nosy and easily offended neighbor Vivien (Michele Vazquez). Vivien’s angularly modernistic home shows just how much Rightlynd has gentrified and changed (a major credit to set designer Arnel Sancianco’s realistic scenic work).
But Mallory is really using the party to mask the anniversary of a family tragedy. And the carefully curated guest list of Rightlynd regulars could potentially turn friends into foes — especially when Mallory reveals weird cash prize contests.
Holter pens snappy and overlapping dialogue throughout "Lottery Day." He also mines humor from his characters as they indulge in copious amounts of liquor and frequent puffs of pot.
Pat Whalen as the former vice principal Ricky and Aurora Adachi-Winter as the theater artist Tori are both hilarious as they get overly analytical about their increasingly altered states.
There’s also great character work by Sydney Charles as the former aldermanic employee Zora and Mckenzie Chinn as money manager Cassandra. Their characters’ stewing rivalry entertainingly teeters on the brink of getting either rancorously renewed or warily appeased.
Also adept are Robert Cornelius as car salesman Robinson, Tony Santiago as the store owner Nunley and Tommy Rivera-Vega as homeless wannabe rapper Ezekiel. They reveal a world of hurt as others jab at emotional wounds over broken ambitions and deferred dreams.
But the main dramatic action focuses on Mallory, and Brooks exposes tremendous depth as a woman haunted by painful losses. Though Mallory is a master manipulator, she gets hurt and violently outraged when a secret is exposed involving her close family friend, Avery (a powerfully stoic and commanding James Vincent Meredith).
If there’s one aspect of "Lottery Day" that feels arbitrary, it’s the reason behind Mallory pushing her guests through strange party games. Yes, there’s a stinging revelation about why her cash prize is so contentious. But her malevolent motivation is puzzling.
Otherwise, "Lottery Day" wins out as a fitting conclusion to the "Rightlynd Saga."
With Holter breaking into TV (The New York Times credited him as one of the writers for the new FX series "Fosse/Verdon"), we can only hope that he won’t entirely abandon Chicago’s theater scene. As the Rightlynd Saga has shown, he excels at reflecting the messy complexities of living in the Windy City.

Four Decades of N.B.A. Playoffs

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The N.B.A. playoffs begin this weekend, which for those who report regularly on the world's premier professional basketball league means one thing: the temporary suspension of life as they know it.
If it's April, it's time to tie up loose ends at home, kiss the significant other or beloved cat goodbye and wish the kids well on the soccer pitch. Someone please remember to send Mother's Day flowers. Father's Day will be celebrated pending the length of the finals.
The reporting grind of the 82-game regular season is disruptively hectic enough. But during the postseason, the sport sheds its least watchable teams, as well as a few that are competitively marginal, and gets down to the games that conclusively matter.
Breakout performances will become instant classics. Acknowledged stars could transition into legends with championship rings. Nothing may be missed in the postseason business of media-driven mythmaking.
Will Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors win a fourth ring in June, bringing him within two of Michael Jordan's and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's half-dozen each (though still far behind Bill Russell's 11)? Or will destiny call upon a first-timer like the so-called Greek Freak, Giannis Antetokounmpo of the rising Milwaukee Bucks?
As a sports reporter and columnist for four decades, the last 25 years of which were with The Times, the playoffs habitually meant two months of missing the springtime sun and -- by the early 1990s -- my two young sons, while chasing the extended N.B.A. family of one-name luminaries. (You know who I mean: Magic, Larry, Michael, LeBron.)
Throughout the playoffs, reporters must confront the crush of late-night deadlines while nattily dressed superstars complicate filing by taking their sweet time getting to the interview podium. Hours later, it's on to the next city, the next round, often dealing with the logistical conundrum of never being sure when one series will end and the next will begin.
For a portion of my years on the basketball beat, that meant attaching myself to the Knicks, who children of a certain age might have a hard time believing consistently qualified for the playoffs. That was way back in the 1990s, otherwise known around New York as the Patrick Ewing Era.
When Ewing's Knicks were ousted, it was on to chronicle Michael Jordan and his Chicago Bulls as they accumulated six titles in eight years, disbanding in 1998 and ceding short-term control of the sport to the Los Angeles Lakers of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. And so it went, into a new century that spawned even greater global exposure and scrutiny of a virtual one-man industry, LeBron James Inc.
For those having slept through the last six months, James will not be appearing in the 2019 playoffs after a gargantuan run of reaching the league championship series for eight straight years. His migration to Hollywood from Cleveland produced a critically assailed version of Lakers Showtime that, had he not signed a four-year contract last summer, would have already been canceled. (The Lakers' hope of attracting a worthy co-star is as yet unrealized.)
Hence, the fortunes of the soon-to-be free agents Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and others will be fascinating spring subplots. No reporters worth their credentials will risk blinking through a telltale expression or a body-language betrayal of otherwise guarded intentions.
The playoffs, while typically impassioned and illuminating, are also logistically exhausting, but I confidently speak for my N.B.A. media brethren when I say that covering them is far more privilege than punishment.
The game looks much different now -- so much of it focused on 3-point shooting -- than it did during my earliest years on the N.B.A. beat. Back then, I routinely insisted there was no place in the world I would rather be than the old, ventilation-challenged Boston Garden for a showdown between the Celtics and Lakers. The modern and far more international N.B.A. media no doubt is equally passionate.
But lives do change. Issues arise. We in the ever-more-distant press-row seats do not attend games with traditional partisan interests, but over the long playoff haul, personal circumstances and needs do create some dilemmas.
Consider my plight in the final seconds of Game 6 of the 1993 finals between Jordan's Bulls and Charles Barkley's Phoenix Suns. The Bulls were leading in the series three games to two, but were trailing by 2 points while trying to avoid playing a seventh game in a hostile road arena.
Back home in Brooklyn, my wife was seven months pregnant with our second child while simultaneously preparing to sell our co-op and buy a house in New Jersey. Had the Bulls lost Game 6, I would not have made it home until the night before both closings and the move.
Fortunately for me, if not the Suns, all five Bulls touched the ball on a play that produced a historically clutch 3-point shot by John Paxson. The Bulls' bid for a third straight title survived, along with my marriage.

Texto completo: Kris Kobach appears to be auditioning for a top job in President Donald Trump’s administration, defending hard-line immigration policies in frequent TV and radio appearances and promoting a three-step plan for solving the border crisis.
The former Kansas secretary of state’s flurry of activity began two weeks before Kirstjen Nielsen’s resignation as Homeland Security secretary directed a spotlight toward possible replacements. Kobach’s willingness to carry out legally provocative immigration policies makes him an obvious candidate to take over for Nielsen, but his ability to secure U.S. Senate confirmation remains in doubt.
Nielsen abruptly resigned over the weekend as anti-immigration conservatives intensified scrutiny of her efforts to repel huddled masses on the southern border. Kobach had already outlined actions the administration could take immediately in a plan that revolves around the creation of confined camps, or “processing centers,” for detained families.
Asylum seekers enter the United States through checkpoints along the border with
Mexico and plead for relief from violence, human trafficking or drought. They are tracked with an electronic monitoring device, and their case is assigned to a federal judge.
Kobach’s idea is to deploy judges and a fleet of planes to border towns, along with thousands of mobile home trailers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
As Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs complained that Nielsen was working against the president last week, Kobach explained how such a processing system would work.
“When someone comes in and claims asylum, we don’t release them for six months onto the streets of the United States,” Kobach said. “We process them right there in that camp where they have three square meals, they’re living in a nice mobile home, and then as soon as they’re done, as soon as the claim is rejected, they’re on the next plane back home.
“And then the people back home suddenly realize, hey, he just left two weeks ago and yet he’s back. Maybe going in these caravans isn’t such a great deal anymore.”
Dobbs gushed over Kobach’s “brilliant” ideas.
“You’ve just come up with more answers in five minutes than we’ve heard from the Department of Homeland Security in quite some time,” Dobbs said.
Ethan Corson, executive director of the Kansas Democratic Party, said Kobach’s plan sounds cruel and inhumane.
“It seems like a plan for more costly and time-consuming litigation that would do nothing to actually make us more safe, but it would serve his perpetual goal of staying in the news,” Corson said.
Clearly, Corson said, Kobach is auditioning for a job.
In addition to making the rounds on Fox News programs, Kobach has been featured in several “exclusive” reports at Breitbart, the far-right commentary website for which Kobach is a contributing author.
Before Nielsen’s departure, Kobach told Breitbart he would consider being Trump’s immigration czar, as long as the position wields real power and isn’t just a “fantasy title.”
“If the president feels the need to tap me to serve, I’m certainly going to consider that,” Kobach said.
Kobach, who said last year that he turned down several offers from the White House so he could run for governor, was an early supporter of Trump and led the president’s commission on voter fraud.
Democrat Laura Kelly’s victory in the November governor’s race may have bruised Kobach’s standing with the Trump administration. Kobach was a loser who failed to capitalize on the president’s October rally in Topeka.
Although Trump joked about his desire to bring Kobach into the administration, confirmation for a Cabinet post seemed unlikely because of the relentless pursuit of controversial immigration policies that made Kobach a nationally known figure, along with financial ties to white nationalist sympathizers and a long list of failures in court.
Now, the combination of Kobach’s role as an informal adviser to the president and interest in the seat held by U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts has reshaped the conversation.
Roberts, a Republican from Kansas, announced in January he intends to retire.
On Monday, Breitbart promoted the idea that Republicans could be persuaded to confirm Kobach for DHS secretary in exchange for keeping him out of next year’s Senate race.
Roberts said the makeup of the Senate makes it extremely difficult for any nominee to be confirmed, “and it is only going to get worse.”
“This body has six Democrats currently running for president who wish to obstruct the president’s agenda at all costs,” Roberts said. “Kris and I have discussed this. I have supported Kris Kobach in the past, and I have supported every one of Trump’s nominees, but ultimately this will be the president’s decision.”
Kobach launched a TV tour in support of his immigration ideas in late March, when he also took part in an Intelligence Squared debate in New York City. The debate topic was whether the Republican party should nominate Trump for president next year. Kobach joined Fox News columnist Liz Peek in defending the president against former U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, and New York Times columnist Bret Stephens.
After leaving state office in January, Kobach took a position with We Build the Wall — an organization that raises private money in support of constructing a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Kobach references his work with the organization while presenting his three-part plan for solving the border crisis.
First, Kobach would have DHS publish new regulations that allow U.S. authorities to detain entire families, sidestepping legal restrictions that prevent the former policy of separating children from their parents. The regulation, Kobach said, will stop caravans from using children as get-out-of-jail-free cards. The second phase of the plan involves creation of the detention camps.
The plan also calls for the Treasury to prohibit money transfers to Mexico by people who can’t document a lawful presence in the U.S. Kobach values the transfers at more than $ 20 billion per year.
Kobach reasons that Mexico will be pressured into contributing $ 5 billion to help build the wall.
Additionally, Mexico would have to agree to take responsibility for the citizenship of any asylum seeker who crosses into Mexico on the way to the U.S.
Elsa Goossen, a Topeka native and legal assistant with the American Civil Liberties Union in New Mexico, said the United States can only flourish when human rights and dignity are respected for all people.
She witnessed the suffering of migrant families last year as she worked at an El Paso shelter that provides food and clothing for the families.
“Anyone who makes the wrenching decision to leave their home due to impossible living conditions has the right under U.S. and international law to seek asylum,” Goossen said. “Indefensibly, the U.S. government has expanded its cruel machinery of detention and deportation instead of providing due process and protection to the courageous people arriving at the border.”
NumbersUSA, which works to reduce immigration, endorsed Kobach this week for the role of DHS secretary, saying there is no one more qualified for the job.
In a Fox News interview Monday with Tucker Carlson, Kobach said he has been in the room with DHS leadership when the president delivered orders that were never carried out.
“There has been deliberate foot-dragging,” Kobach said, “and I think that’s why you’re seeing the White House take the necessary steps to clean house at DHS and put people in, hopefully, who will quickly execute what the president orders.”

A world divided. A queendom without an heir. An ancient enemy awakens. The House of Berethnet has ruled Indys for a thousand years. Still unwed, Queen Sabran the Ninth must conceive a daughter to protect her realm from destruction – but assassins are getting closer to her door. Ead Duryan is an outsider at court. Though she has risen to the position of lady-in-waiting, she is loyal to a hidden society of mages. Ead keeps a watchful eye on Sabran, secretly protecting her with forbidden magic. Across the dark sea, Tané has trained all her life to be a dragon rider, but is forced to make a choice that could see her life unravel. Meanwhile, the divided East and West refuse to parley, and forces of chaos are rising from their sleep.
Wally Funk's Race for Space: The Extraordinary Story of a Female Aviation Pioneer by Sue Nelson (non-fiction)
Wally Funk was among the Mercury 13, the first group of American pilots to complete NASA's 1961 Women in Space program. Funk breezed through the rigorous physical and mental tests, her scores beating those of many of the male candidates – even John Glenn. Just one week before Funk was to enter the final phase of training, the entire program was abruptly canceled. Politics and prejudice meant that none of the more-than-qualified women ever went to space. Undeterred, Funk went on to become one of America's first female aviation inspectors and civilian flight instructors, though her dream of being an astronaut never dimmed. In this offbeat odyssey, journalist and fellow space buff Sue Nelson travels with Wally Funk, approaching her 80th birthday, as she races to make her giant leap. Covering their travels across the United States and Europe – taking in NASA's mission control in Houston and Spaceport America in New Mexico, where Funk's ride to space awaits – this is a uniquely intimate and entertaining portrait of a true aviation trailblazer.

Administration silent on whether Trump's business is under hiring probe

Texto completo: President Trump has shown he is willing to take dramatic steps to stop the flow of illegal immigration into the United States, but his administration has been silent about one company that long relied on unauthorized labor: Trump's own business.
Democrats in Congress have been stymied in their efforts to find out whether federal authorities are investigating the Trump Organization over its reliance for years on workers without legal status - to cut grass, clean rooms and cook meals at golf courses in New York and New Jersey.
The Washington Post has interviewed more than 30 people who worked for the Trump Organization without legal status, some for more than a decade. Some also did personal jobs for Trump's sons. In response to these and other reports, the Trump Organization pledged to better vet its workforce.
The latest rebuff to Democratic lawmakers came this week. Immigration and Customs Enforcement missed a Tuesday deadline to respond to a request from House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), asking whether an investigation had been opened into the hiring practices of the president's company. ICE said only that it wouldn't meet the April 9 deadline, a Thompson spokesman said.
It was just the latest effort by congressional Democrats to provoke action against Trump's company. Last month, Congressional Hispanic Caucus members criticized the "apparent failure" of the Department of Homeland Security to investigate the Trump Organization about the issue. Before that, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) wrote in February to the FBI and DHS about the "serious nature of these allegations."
And on Tuesday, Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) complained about the lack of response to his own letter to the FBI.
"I sent a letter to the FBI demanding an investigation into the Trump Organization's dubious employment practices and have yet to receive a response," Grijalva wrote on Twitter. "It's unacceptable to demonize immigrants while exploiting their labor for personal profit."
The silence comes as Trump has turned his attention back to his signature issue - illegal immigration - amid a burgeoning crisis at the border. Frustrated with the record number of families from Central America turning up at the border to seek asylum, Trump ousted his Homeland Security secretary and other leaders in the department this week in an effort to install a more aggressive team.
White House officials declined to answer questions about Trump's use of undocumented labor, and ICE did not respond to requests for comment this week.
Asked in January about what Trump thinks should happen to businesses that hire undocumented workers, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump is "one of the people that's identified the fact that we have a problem and we should fix our immigration system."
Trump Organization also did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Eric Trump, one of the president's sons who helps runs the Trump Organization, has said previously that he and other senior executives did not know the company hired unauthorized workers, noting that the employees used falsified documents.
"We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices," the company said in December. "If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately. We take this issue very seriously."
In recent months, the Trump Organization has fired at least 18 undocumented workers at five golf courses, The Post has reported. The New York Times reported additional firings on Tuesday - seven workers at Trump National Golf Club Jupiter in Florida.
"The allegations set forth in numerous reports are truly troubling," Thompson wrote to ICE deputy director Ronald D. Vitiello in the March 26 letter, obtained by The Post. "Not only do the allegations suggest that these employers were aware of workers' true immigration status, but also that managers physically and emotionally abused undocumented workers."
Trump had previously tapped Vitiello, a 30-year veteran of U.S. Border Patrol, to lead ICE but rescinded the nomination last week.
Companies that hire large numbers of undocumented workers regularly attract law enforcement attention. Last week, ICE arrested nearly 300 workers at a technology company outside of Dallas, in one of the largest immigration raids in years.
"Businesses that knowingly hire illegal aliens create an unfair advantage over their competing businesses," said ICE Special Agent in Charge Katrina Berger, according to the Associated Press. "In addition, they take jobs away from U.S. citizens and legal residents, and they create an atmosphere poised for exploiting their illegal workforce."
With millions of undocumented workers in the United States, ICE officials say they must prioritize their investigations. The more important cases involve companies where they can prove bosses knew the workers couldn't legally work in the United States and hired them anyway, or helped smuggle them into the country or bought them fake documents.
Many former undocumented workers at the Trump golf courses say their supervisors knew they were undocumented and in some cases spoke with them about the fake Social Security numbers and green cards they used to apply.
In an interview, Thompson wouldn't say whether he plans to use the committee's subpoena power if DHS doesn't respond to his questions.
"The fact that the president of the United States is the owner of this property makes it significant. More than anything else, he's taken an oath to uphold the laws of this country," Thompson said.
"You can rest assured that we will get whatever information that's available," he added.
So far, that's been meager.
Menendez has received no response from his letter in February, a spokesman said.
One congressional aide said that the DHS inspector general's office wrote back recently in response to a request to investigate ICE's handling of the Trump case. But it referred the question back to ICE - the same "agency that we have concerns is not doing their job," said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal committee business.
Democrats in Congress have pushed the Trump administration to protect these workers from deportation and to treat them as potential witnesses to crimes.
Dozens of undocumented workers remain in limbo while they wait to hear if they'll receive some type of visa or authorization to stay in the country legally.
"The only thing we have is these letters that the congressmen signed," said Margarita Cruz, a housekeeping employee from Mexico who was fired after eight years of working at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y. "It's just a piece of paper with their signatures."
"That's all we have for protection," she added. "It's frustrating."

Texto completo: Gerry's Firebread in Fort Myers smelled of freshly baked bread.
There was the savory hint of fried onions and garlic, as well as a sweeter background note of cinnamon. At the work counter, husband and wife owners Gerald and Sonja Schimpl rolled out puffy rounds of dough. They cut the dough into strips, wrapping each around a cone-shaped wooden block. They set the dough to bake in a special oven imported from Romania.
The result: a fresh-baked cone of bread perfect for loading with Gerry's sweet and savory fillings.
Gerald calls these creations firebread, a term he said he coined and patented. But his background isn't in baking. Gerald actually came from Europe's shipping and trucking industry.
After eating kurtoskalacs or "chimney cakes" at a Christmas market in Hungary, the couple decided to try their hand at making the traditional Eastern European bread. In their native Austria, they launched a wholesale business making kurtoskalacs for restaurants, gas stations and markets.
Then they got the itch to travel.
The Schimpls journeyed around Europe, South America and the Caribbean before coming to the United States and settling in Key West. Afterward, they moved to Fort Myers and decided to launch their firebread business.
In February 2018 they started going to markets and festivals across South Florida, where they set up a tent and offered their unique firebread sandwiches and treats. The pair worried whether the concept would work here.
Now, Gerald laughs at the thought.
"Was it popular?" he asked. "We had lines over lines."
One bite of the firebread, and it's easy to see why. Gerry's savory sandwich options include the Cubano, the chicken gyro with house-made tzatziki, the pulled pork sandwich and the bratwurst in firebread.
The firebread itself comes in flavors such as garlic, fried onion, black olive and bacon. The dessert versions use a stickier, sweeter dough which is rolled in cinnamon and sugar and filled with ice cream.
In December 2018, the Schimpls opened their first brick-and-mortar shop in the former Happiness Healthy Cafe space on Cleveland Avenue in Fort Myers.
It's become their base of operations to prepare firebread for their festival and market events as well as catering orders. The shop is open throughout the week for people to stop in and buy firebread sandwiches and treats, but the hours vary. An updated list of times and dates is available on their website and social-media feeds. Customers can also find the sweet firebread cones at Ice Sssscreamin in Cape Coral.
Though the roots of the firebread are Hungarian and Romanian, Gerald calls he and his wife's creation "a 100 percent American thing." Germans, Austrians, Hungarians and Romanians might recognize the sweet firebread, but they wouldn't be familiar with the savory sandwiches, he says.
Those are a result of Sonja's expert cooking and Gerald's taste preferences.
"I'm a meat guy, not a sweet guy," he said.
For their made-in-America products, the Schimpls are starting to think about the next phase — franchising. After a successful day at the Cuban Sandwich Festival in Tampa last month, they've already fielded multiple calls about franchise opportunities.
"Our first step was to see if the people were loving this or hating this," Gerald said. "Now we know they're loving it."

Playing ball in college, so you won't have to

Texto completo: A college consultant named William Singer was the ringleader who allegedly helped 800 students buy and cheat their way into elite schools. The revelation has been nothing short of revolting. The story has the public so hungry for details that people are actually reading indictments so as not to miss a thing.

Even die-hard followers of this traumatizing tale, however, may be in need of a laugh. If so, have I got the movie for you!

Released in 1989 and instantly forgotten, the gloriously goofy “How I Got into College,” starring Anthony Edwards, hilariously laid out all manner of back doors and side doors for the underachieving student, including the path of the phony athletic career. The shameless tactics on parade worked for most of the movie’s characters, and until lately, worked well enough for dozens of real-life charlatans now being prosecuted for trying to wheedle their way into coveted colleges they thought their offspring deserved.

This trippy, over-the-top flick pulled in a measly $1.6 million at the domestic box office in its 1989 debut. But what a difference a giant pay- not- to-play scandal makes!

Terrel Seltzer’s screenplay has held up incredibly well. She’s got the athletic coach with his hand out. The unctuous “legacy” who insists that his son cannot be expected to follow the ordinary rules of getting in. Admission officers readily seduced by applicants’ numbers on paper. Slick college consultants, played to the nines by Nora Dunn and Phil Hartman, who never met a “late-bloomer” they could not help for the right sum of money.

When our hero, Marlon Browne, played by Corey Parker, enters their lair seeking help with his applications, Nora Dunn’s character, Francine, quickly ditches her Pro Wrestling magazine to chime into her phone, “Duke, can you hold please, I have Georgetown on the other line.”

“For $1,000, we can make anyone’s life sound interesting,” she assures Marlon, doubtful that his test scores or Saturdays babysitting his stepbrother would impress anyone.

“What you need is a hook,” booms Phil Hartman’s character, Bennedict. “Something for the committee to remember you by.”

Earlier, the pair had quizzed their quarry if he played any sports. “If you’re good, it’s always going to help you,” Bennedict insisted before he and Francine pepper Marlon about all the sports where he could be a contender:

“Football? Baseball? Soccer? Swimming? Lacrosse? Wrestling? Water Polo? Discus? Tennis? Volleyball? Javelin? Something…?” they suggest, getting nowhere. Marlon finally volunteers that he once won a neighborhood ping-pong match.

Most of Marlon’s friends are no better off. Asked by pals if she planned on retaking the SAT, one tearful classmate laments, “I have to. With the scores I have now, I can only get into the schools I’d never go to.”

Even Marlon’s romantic interest, Jessica Kailo, played by Lara Flynn Boyle, thought to be a shoo-in at one alluring college, thinks her life is over after bungling her interview with a chancy move. Marlon reassures her that she will not be branded a “moron for life” once she gets to college, or be ruined. “Trying things out is what happens in college,’’ he counsels her. “You get a great chance to start out all over again just when most people need to. It’s like a federal protection and relocation program for teenagers.”

It’s that sweet heart inside the stinging satire that makes this movie fun. And if you, like me, missed this gem the first-time round, lucky for us, it’s now streaming on Amazon Prime with HBO Go. Somewhere, I hope someone is toasting Terrel Seltzer on her late-bloomer of a story.

Texto completo: Please explain the tagline "Bocca-Book Bocca-Boom" (or however it is spelled) for Choice Hotels TV commercials. No one I know has a clue what it means or the origin.

According to the hotel chain, the phrase is "Badda Book. Badda Boom." The slogan draws on the expression "bada bing, bada boom," which as the Oxford English Dictionary notes, refers to something happening suddenly or easily. The OED has references to the original phrase going back more than 50 years; the most famous uses of the term are likely those in mob chronicles such as "The Sopranos" (where the topless club was called Bada Bing) and "The Godfather." A Choice Hotels press release said its slogan indicates "there's an easy way to plan and book hotel stays, and find the lowest hotel rates guaranteed ... (by) booking direct at ChoiceHotels.com."

Do you know if "Southern Charm" is coming back on Bravo? Being from Savannah and Charleston I sure liked the "Southern Charm" shows set there. There was a little too much bickering sometimes, but no more than on all those "Real Housewives" shows.

Bravo will offer a sixth season of "Southern Charm" and the Charleston, S.C., cast beginning on May 15. According to the network, returning cast members will include Craig Conover, Kathryn Dennis, Cameran Eubanks, Austen Kroll, Chelsea Meissner and Shep Rose. Former star Thomas Ravenel, who is also Kathryn's ex, will not be in this season. He has reportedly said that being on "Southern Charm" was "the worst mistake of my life."

New to the cast are Naomie Olindo and Eliza Limehouse. Storylines include Kathryn hoping to rise in the social hierarchy, Cameran working on a work-life balance, Craig hiring a personal assistant, and Shep getting a new dog.

I am writing about this great show "God Friended Me." I find it very refreshing and it covers many facets of humanity with a diverse cast, all while talking about doing good by helping others. I hope this program goes on for a long time. It is so uplifting.

The drama will have its first season finale on April 14, but don't worry. It has been renewed for a second season. "It's one of the top three new series on television, has improved its time period significantly, and continues a long tradition of prestige dramas for CBS on (Sunday) night," said Kelly Kahl, president, CBS Entertainment, in the renewal announcement.

We were in Morocco from 1970 to 1973 when my husband was in the Navy. At that time, the king of Morocco was King Hassan. His wife was Latifa, which would make her Queen Latifa. I wonder if the American actress/singer chose her name, Queen Latifa, from the former Moroccan queen?

A New York Times profile of the multitalented Queen Latifah (with an h, unlike the common spelling of the Moroccan royal) says the former Dana Owens "named herself Latifah as a child, after learning it was Arabic for ‘delicate, sensitive and kind.'" I have not seen an account connecting her naming to the Moroccans. By the way, when Hassan died in 1999, the Times said his widow was "a commoner who is officially described as the Mother of the Royal Children." Several sources have called her a princess instead of a queen.

Keep Kirstjen Nielsen unemployed and eating Grubhub over her kitchen sink

Texto completo: Editor's note: A version of this column as originally published did not meet Globe standards and has been changed. The Globe regrets the previous tone of the piece.
One of the biggest regrets in my life was serving Bill Kristol salmon and not telling the neoconservative pundit and chief Iraq War cheerleader what I really thought about him. That was 10 years ago, at a restaurant in Cambridge, and I was reminded of that episode this week when Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, the purportedly reluctant triggerman for Donald Trump's inhumane policies of ethnic cleansing, announced she would be stepping down from her post at the president's request.
The news comes a little over a year since she took the job, and about nine months since she was infamously shame-marched out of a restaurant — a Mexican one of all things — in Washington, D.C., by a group of protestors just as the news of our official policy of separating families at the southern border was first being reported on. What a delight it was to see.
Around the same time, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and others in the administration or associated with Trump — such as Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Mitch McConnell, and white nationalist and dirty coward from the zombie movie who gets everyone else killed Stephen Miller — were themselves being shown the door at restaurants and movie theaters around the country.
It was the last time I remember being proud to be an American. It was also one of the only times it seemed like any of the architects of this ruinous xenophobic pre-pogrom might be forced to contend, however briefly, with the consequences of their policy decisions.
And then, well, you remember what happened: The cops arrived, by which I mean the invertebrate lanyard-clutching submissives of the Beltway class, who scolded the protestors for violating the standards of civility.
“Kind of amazed and appalled by the number of folks on Left who applauded the expulsion of @PressSec and her family from a restaurant," David Axelrod tweeted, echoing a common refrain across the media spectrum from CNN to Fox News to the Twitter pages of very concerned legacy media pundits with no-show jobs. “This, in the end, is a triumph for @realDonaldTrump vision of America: Now we're divided by red plates & blue plates! #sad."
“I guess we're heading into an America with Democrat-only restaurants, which will lead to Republican-only restaurants," said Ari Fleischer at the time, who, like his war-hungry peer Kristol, likely prefers his steak bloody.
“Do the fools who threw Sarah out, and the people who cheer them on, really want us to be that kind of country?" he added.
Yes. I do anyway. Then again, I am not a part of the sinecure media class, which is really what that sort of fear about escalating direct action was about. Ideology is one thing, but we can't have the rabble feeling emboldened to confront people like us, they as much as said.
Sadly, the scolding seems to have done its job. It's been a while since we've been treated to a soulless Trumpist going viral for going hungry, and the sacristy of the restaurant seems to have held.
Writing in an otherwise solid piece about what should become of Nielsen in the New York Times this week, Michelle Goldberg called for the barring of the former Secretary from a cushy corporate or academic landing.
“Nielsen did not create Trump's monstrous policy of separating migrant families, but she should be known forever as the person who carried it out. She put babies in cages, traumatized children for life, and then appears to have lied to Congress about what she had done. She did this evil work with either blithe incompetence or malicious sloppiness, failing to create a system to properly track kids who were ripped from their families."
She was not saying, she made clear, that people should “scream at Nielsen in restaurants." Heaven forbid.
Over the past two years, at least 22 immigrants have died in ICE detention centers; rape and sexual assault against vulnerable people in our custody, including crimes perpetrated by ICE and DHS officials, have run rampant; and the numbers we have about them are likely wildly underreported. Numerous suicides have been reported. Thousands of families have been separated at the border, and over a thousand plus more have been lost or misplaced. Uniting them ever again may not even be “within the realm of the possible," the administration itself admitted in February. The Government Accountability Office found in October that the administration took no steps and had no plans for how to reunite families. The cruelty, as has often been said with anything when it comes to Trump, is the point.
Yes, much of our mistreatment of migrants was ongoing long before the Trump gang came along. Throw the Obama-era lot in prison too, for all I care. At the very least, throw them out of a restaurant.
If recent anonymous administration officials quoted in news reports are to be believed, Nielsen wasn't always comfortable with Trump's and Jeff Sessions' draconian tactics — which are sure to get somehow even worse once her replacement takes over. Regardless, Nielsen carried her orders out dutifully. I'm not sure which is more disgraceful: being a true-believer in the white ethnostate like Miller, or merely getting along and going along, like Nielsen is said to have done, all the while lying about it along the way. No matter, the intentions don't really do much to assuage the pain we've caused so many human beings.
A petition has been circulating from a coalition of progressive groups called Restore Republic Trust calling on corporate CEOs around America to refuse to give jobs to former members of the Trump administration going forward. “The cruelty of the [separation] policy was matched only by the incompetence of its execution," they wrote in an open letter.
That's a nice start, and we can certainly add our names to the list, but it shouldn't be all we do. Living in Boston, we're no strangers to visitors from any administration, whether they've been given a lecture role at a school like Harvard — which doesn't seem to have any compunctions about welcoming literal comic book-style villains to campus — or of any of a number of other prestigious tech or academic institutions in the area. Invariably the bad guys, like the rest of us, will have to eat.
And when they show up in our restaurants, you have my permission, as an official member of the mainstream media, to tell them where to go and what they can do with themselves when they arrive there, but, you know, said in a more specific and traditional Boston colloquialism.

Texto completo: Terry Tempest Williams, writer-in-residence this year at Harvard Divinity School, is a daughter of the American West, especially her beloved Utah. For a lifetime of work about that landscape, including "The Hour of Land: A Personal Topography of America's National Parks," Williams is the winner of this year's Los Angeles Book Prizes' Robert Kirsch Award, which she will receive Friday at the kickoff to the Festival of Books.

Uppermost in your mind right now is a very old red oak tree that Harvard took down today.

One of my students gathered hundreds of [its] acorns and boiled them, and she created bottles of ink. She's writing the story of the tree in the ink of the acorns. Another student gathered, I think it was 90 pounds of acorns. She ground the acorns into a flour and made acorn flour wafers as a communion. Gestures matter -- especially in grief, somehow grief is love and love is action and actions shared create community.

What do you think of the description "nature writer," as though nature is a thing apart?
It's not what I would call myself. I would not call [novelist] Richard Powers a nature writer. I would not call Barry Lopez a nature writer; I would not call Louise Erdrich [that]. We're writers who are engaged in the world at this moment in time. But I think we're writing the truth of our time.
--
What do you think of people who look at the desert of Utah, or the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and say, It's empty -- there's nothing there.
A friend from New York [came to Utah for a week with his girlfriend]. We had a beautiful dinner outside on the porch, watched the evening light. The stars came out. The quiet, the silences.
The next morning, her bag was packed and she said, "I can't stay here." And just as they were getting in the car, she turned to me and said, "Aren't you afraid you'll be forgotten?" And I wanted to say, I hope so.
I think we all understand landscape differently. I look out from our porch and it's everything. And she saw nothing. There were no people, there was no place to get coffee. There was no place in her mind to go except for back home.
The desert is often defined by what it isn't. There are no trees. It is not green. There is no water. But for me it's more than an acquired taste. Everything is rendered bare with great intention and adaptability and, again, beauty.
--
People who think as you do are often regarded -- there's a a big list of synonyms like "tree hugger." Why is that an insult, and where do you think that comes from?
If I could count all the names, the synonyms I've been called! I was walking in Salt Lake [City] not so long ago, and this man just came up to me and said, "Give it up." And I said, "Excuse me?" And he said, "It's over. Just give it up." And I said, "Give what up?" And he said. "The wilderness, the wild. Just get over it." And he walked away.
And I just thought, how do we get over the very thing that has given us life? I don't know why it's categorized as "other" or why people discount the protection of landscape as something different than the protection of family. We're all made of the same stuff.
--
People think of writers as observers. But you're an activist as well. You've been arrested for civil disobedience.
I don't see myself as an activist. I'm not even sure I see myself as a writer. I see myself as a citizen engaged. I see myself as a human being trying to do the best that I can. It's what democracy demands. It is not a spectator sport. I think about Emily Dickinson: "Life is a spell so exquisite that everything conspires to break it." How can we not respond? I respond on the page, I respond in the world.
--
Is there any reaction from your readers that gratifies you most, that makes you feel: This is what I hoped to do?
When someone hands me a book that I can barely see is a book because it's been rained on and sat on, written over, traveled. I just love when books are used. I love when books are loved. I love when someone comes up and says, thank you. I know the writers that have saved my life, and those that I was able to thank.
--
Who are they?
I wish that I could have thanked Rachel Carson for her courage. Wallace Stegner was a huge mentor to me. A book I wrote called "Refuge" received a terrible review in the New York Times. I happened to be with the writer Edward Abbey in Arizona. I was crushed, and he said, "Congratulations. You disturbed someone, and that is exactly what we should be doing."

Texto completo: Lawyers for former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst will head to federal court in Boston next week to try to persuade a judge to release funds that authorities seized from Ernst's accounts following his arrest in the nationwide college admissions cheating scandal.
The hearing on Ernst's request to free up the funds is slated for April 17 at 10 a.m. at the Moakley Courthouse in the Seaport, according to a judicial order in the case entered Tuesday.
In court papers filed last week, attorneys for Ernst, a Cranston, R.I., native who owns homes in Falmouth and Chevy Chase, Md., said he needs access to the cash for legal fees, which will probably eclipse $250,000, and living expenses.
Ernst's request came a day after 13 parents, including Hollywood actress Felicity Huffman, and one coach agreed to plead guilty in the investigation that prosecutors dubbed “Operation Varsity Blues." Court documents filed Monday indicated that another parent is also considering a plea deal.
Federal authorities seized more than $1.1 million from four of Ernst's accounts pursuant to warrants, but Ernst's legal team says prosecutors haven't tied the money to alleged criminal activity.
Ernst is charged with racketeering conspiracy for allegedly collecting bribes totaling $2.7 million over several years in exchange for designating “at least 12 applicants as recruits for the Georgetown tennis team, including some who did not play tennis competitively, thereby facilitating their admission to Georgetown," court records show.
He has pleaded not guilty.
Ernst once gave Michelle Obama tennis lessons and told The New York Times in 2014 that the then-first lady had a powerful backhand.
A total of 50 defendants were charged in the college scheme, in which wealthy parents allegedly paid bribes to have their children falsely certified as athletic recruits at elite schools, or to facilitate cheating on their children's SAT and ACT exams.
The parents cut checks to William “Rick" Singer, the admitted ringleader of the scheme whose entities collected roughly $25 million over several years and who funneled money to corrupt coaches and other accomplices, according to prosecutors.
“Even assuming that Mr. Ernst could sell his Maryland home (he cannot sell his Massachusetts condominium in light of the restraining order), its sale will not generate proceeds net of costs and commissions, sufficient for his legal defense," Ernst's lawyers wrote in the motion.
In related news, yet another parent caught up in the probe appears to be pondering a plea deal.
Toby MacFarlane is negotiating with federal prosecutors over a possible guilty plea, according to court documents. MacFarlane, 56, was a top-ranking official at a title insurance company and a resident of Del Mar, Calif., according to records.
Both the prosecution and MacFarlane's defense lawyers notified the court on Monday that “they are engaged in plea discussions and believe that Defendant will most likely plead guilty" before he is indicted, according to court records.
MacFarlane allegedly paid bribes totaling $450,000 to have his daughter and son falsely certified as USC athletic recruits, according to prosecutors. His daughter graduated from USC in 2018, and his son was accepted in 2017 but withdrew in May 2018, records show.
The daughter was presented as a soccer recruit and her brother, who stands 5-foot-5, was certified as a 6-foot-1 basketball recruit, according to legal filings. Neither sibling played sports at USC.

Letters to the editor Tuesday: Act to create better futures for children

Texto completo: Act to create better futures for children
The recent coverage of the Crocker child abuse and death case in Effingham County reinforces that we all share a responsibility for the physical, emotional and mental well-being of children and their families in Chatham County. And since April is National Child Abuse Prevention Month, it's the perfect time to help people understand that it's possible to do the things they love and help families and their community thrive. Small steps can make a big difference in a child's life - and a parent's.
Everyone wants to provide and nurture their child in a positive, healthy environment, but sometimes parents need a little support along the way. That's why we encourage community members to proactively engage parents and offer your support. Here are some suggestions:
* Give a new or single mom a break by bringing over dinner or offering to babysit.
* Volunteer for after-school mentoring programs such as the Frank Callen Boys' and Girls' Club or Loop It Up Savannah.
* Volunteer with organizations that offer support to single parents, such as Shelter from the Rain.
* Coach a youth sports team to teach kids the value of teamwork; they'll learn how to trust teammates and themselves.
* Encourage families you know to call the 800-CHILDREN helpline to talk to trained professionals who will connect them with supportive programs in their area or to go online to use the resource map at PCAGeorgiaHelpline.org, which contains over 3,000 local and statewide programs designed to assist and support families.
Unfortunately, there are already over 400 Chatham County children in foster care due to abuse and those children need someone to be a voice for them. You can help stop the cycle of abuse and ensure that those children achieve permanency as quickly as possible by becoming a Court Appointed Special Advocate. CASA volunteers advocate for the best interests of children in foster care. Call 912-447-8908 for more information.
Collectively, these small steps will help create better, brighter futures for children and families in Savannah.

Racially tinged politics sting letter writer
Having lived in Savannah much of my life, I shouldn't be surprised by racially tinged politics. However, the meeting held March 27 by Rev. Clarence Teddy Williams and his consulting firm for the stated purpose garnering support for just one African-American candidate for mayor actually did surprise me. The overt racism and hypocrisy of holding the meeting and allowing only black press to enter the premises brought me up short.
Imagine that the situation was reversed: White press only and an effort to consolidate the white vote. We would have seen editorials from The New York Times, rallies staged by "Let America Vote," TV special features, calls for government action, and more.
Apparently Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of living in a nation where people are not judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character, has been replaced by former Mayor Otis Johnson's desire to "elect someone who looks like me."
Jules Homans, Savannah
Dismayed by stand against Confederate monument
Just what is it about the Forsyth Park Confederate memorial that profoundly agitates the Savannah Morning News? Yet another anti-memorial editorial was published March 31.
This time the editorial board urged Georgia's governor to veto the recently passed Monument Protection bill. The board laments that this bill will prohibit removing parts of this historic memorial which, in their shameful opinion, would be ". . . an improvement to the beautiful green space."
In this writer's opinion, both the city of Savannah and the Savannah Morning News' editorial board have been complicit in a surreptitious campaign to eliminate not only the city's Southern history, but the entire Savannah Historic District. The monument bill, as you correctly point out, is for all state historical monuments, memorials and markers. This bill would also, by the way, protect the erroneous historical marker in downtown Savannah documenting Gen. Sherman's "march to the sea." The marker states that, "contrary to popular myth, Sherman only destroyed property used for waging war." Contemporary accounts and The Official Records of the War of Rebellion prove otherwise.
In 2017, the city of Savannah opened a poll asking the populace their opinion on the future of the Confederate memorial. An overwhelming percentage of respondents answered that the city should leave it alone. Why does the editorial board advocate something contrary to the will of the people? The city also formed a task force to determine what, if anything, should be done to the memorial. However, no representative of any of Savannah's Confederate Heritage organizations was asked to participate on the task force.
Overall, the irony of your editorial is too rich to ignore. It is well-documented that the entire 1861 Southern succession movement was based on economics, self-determination and sovereignty. President Abraham Lincoln and the North said no and went to war to force the South back into the Union. Today, the city of Savannah and the editorial board are endorsing the same type of self-determination by accusing the state of "butting in" on local issues.
What goes around, comes around.

Five myths about people who become whistleblowers

Texto completo: When a whistleblower revealed the Trump administration's decision to overturn 25 security clearance denials, it was the latest in a long and storied history of insiders exposing significant abuses of public trust. Whistles were blown on U.S. involvement in Vietnam, the Watergate coverup, Enron's financial fraud, the National Security Agency's mass surveillance of domestic electronic communications and, during the Trump administration, the corruption of former Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, Cambridge Analytica's theft of Facebook users' data to develop targeted political ads, and harm to children posed by the "zero tolerance immigration policy. Despite the essential role whistleblowers play in illuminating the truth and protecting the public interest, several myths persist about them, some pernicious.
Myth No. 1: Whistleblowers are employees who report problems externally.
Often a distinction is made between employees who raise concerns inside their organizations and those who turn to outside entities - such as Congress, enforcement agencies or the press - to disclose concerns about wrongdoing. People in the corporate ethics and compliance sector try to steer workers away from whistleblowing by creating "speak up cultures within agencies or companies.
Many employees who report problems internally don't think of themselves as whistleblowers, noting that they are just doing their jobs or helping the company. And the notion that whistleblowers are employees who report externally is implicitly reinforced at times by the press, probably because the whistleblower sources with whom reporters work have, obviously, decided to take their concerns outside the walls of their employers.
But under most whistleblower protection laws, employees have rights to report wrongdoing both internally and externally, free from reprisal; so failing to consider workers who disclose serious misconduct to be whistleblowers because they haven't reported the problems externally could make them liable to retaliation by their employers.
The overwhelming majority of employees who see problems want to blow the whistle internally first. Understanding this can - and should - encourage employers to respond appropriately when workers report problems, protecting them from reprisal and investigating and addressing their disclosures thoroughly. Similarly, employees who understand that they are in fact whistleblowers when they raise concerns inside the workplace will be better prepared to navigate their rights, risks and options.
Myth No. 2: Whistleblowers are either disloyal or heroes.
A Forbes article, "Whistleblower: Warrior, Saboteur Or Snitch? is illustrated with a picture of a street sign with divergent directions for "loyalty and "whistleblowing. This is just one of many articles noting the widely held public perception of whistleblowers as disloyal, with terms such as "disgruntled, "self-serving, "narcissistic or even "traitor. These negative perceptions direct focus onto the whistleblower's motive while calling into doubt the legitimacy and importance of the reports of misconduct.
The image of whistleblowers as disloyal is often held in tension with a belief that they are heroes, as the articles also note. But this perception is not accurate, either.
In reality, most whistleblowers are motivated by a deep sense of loyalty to their employers and are exercising both a high degree of professional ethics and a belief that their employers will address the problem. While many employees who witness wrongdoing in the workplace stay silent, fearing reprisal or futility, those who do raise concerns - and again, most do so internally first - demonstrate faith that their employers are committed to compliance and that they can make a difference. For those whistleblowers who report externally, it is typically because the problem is significant and their employers have failed to address it or engaged in reprisal (or both). At this point, government whistleblowers may decide that their loyalty is to the Constitution they swore to uphold; others may feel impelled by loyalty to professional ethics codes or to their own moral compass.
Myth No. 3: Leaker' is another term for whistleblower.'
"Leaking has been used by both the Obama and Trump administrations to describe, and typically disparage, legitimate national security whistleblowers. A 2013 New York Times article switches between "leaking and "whistleblowing indiscriminately while parsing whether Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning are heroes or traitors.
Leaking, however, is not the same as whistleblowing.
Whistleblowing is defined under the Whistleblower Protection Act, the primary law that covers nonintelligence federal workers, as disclosure of information that an employee "reasonably believes demonstrates "a violation of a law, rule or regulation; gross mismanagement; a gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific threat to public health and safety. This describes misconduct that is of serious concern to the public interest.
Leaks typically don't reveal this level of misconduct, instead sharing information that may be salacious, embarrassing or otherwise interesting, even if sometimes quite important.
Even though protections for intelligence community whistleblowers are weak and dictate how those employees must report concerns, Snowden's revelations about the NSA's unconstitutional mass collection of telephone metadata, and Reality Winner's disclosures about Russian efforts to hack state elections as the Trump campaign was denying Russian involvement, clearly meet this standard of significance.
While reporters may use the term "leak to describe information received from anonymous insiders, the failure to distinguish between leaking and anonymous whistleblowing risks undermining the legitimacy and importance of disclosures that clearly advance the public's interest in accountability and a functional democracy.
Myth No. 4: Remaining anonymous is the best strategy for whistleblowing.
Journalists and public-interest organizations have taken to urging government and private-sector workers to disclose information to them, promising anonymity. News outlets actively promote their mechanisms for secure communication; some nongovernmental organizations have launched anonymous hotlines for reporting corruption or assaults on science. These messages perpetuate a myth that anonymous disclosures are both possible and in the best interests of potential whistleblowers.
Efforts like these are needed, but reporting serious wrongdoing is risky business, and employees who believe this myth may be inadvertently hurt in the course of disclosing what they have witnessed.
Because most workers raise concerns internally first, and because their information is often tied to their responsibilities and expertise, their fingerprints are metaphorically on their disclosures. Under the law, an employee who suffers reprisal for whistleblowing needs to show the employer had knowledge that they raised an issue. A sophisticated employer may be able to suss out the identity of a whistleblower and retaliate, but an employee's attempts to remain anonymous may make it more difficult to prove the employer had that knowledge.
Anonymity can weaken a whistleblower's ability to gain support from public-interest organizations, professional associations, sympathetic members of Congress, enforcement agents and even other co-workers who might want to come forward. And finally, the reporter's privilege for protecting communications is not as strong as the attorney-client privilege, and even employees who reach out to public-interest organizations staffed with lawyers fielding hotlines may not have the benefit of that privilege because they are not seeking or receiving legal advice - they are disclosing information.
Myth No. 5: Julian Assange is a whistleblower.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is widely described as a whistleblower. A 2010 interview in the Guardian titled "Julian Assange: the whistleblower promotes this myth directly, and as recently as last year, ABC News called him "the world's most famous whistleblower. This myth muddies already difficult waters for whistleblowers.
WikiLeaks is a self-described "media organization that "specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war, spying and corruption. Before being implicated in the acquisition and release of the Hillary Clinton campaign's emails in 2016, Assange and WikiLeaks published diplomatic cables and video footage of an Iraqi airstrike that killed two Reuters photographers, provided by whistleblower Chelsea Manning.
But unlike Manning, Assange did not discover or disclose wrongdoing as an insider. Rather, he received information from a whistleblower and published it. His methods differ from those of most journalists, but the publication of documents that reveal wrongdoing does not make Assange a whistleblower, any more than are the New York Times and Washington Post journalists who published the Pentagon Papers - or, for that matter, than I am when I advocate on behalf of my whistleblower clients, which sometimes involves helping expose the misconduct they have discovered and disclosed. They're the true whistleblowers.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump volvió a presionar a México para que detenga inmigrantes que buscan llegar a los Estados Unidos.
El mandatario ha enviado mensajes encontrados sobre la actuación del Gobierno de Andrés Manuel López Obrador en torno a los centroamericanos, ya que primero alabó la detención de inmigrantes, pero luego se quejó de lo opuesto.
El presidente Trump advirtió que el país “está lleno”, además de amenazar nuevamente con cerrar la frontera.
“México debe aprehender a todos los ilegales y no dejarlos que avancen hacia los Estados Unidos, o no tendremos otra opción que Cerrar la Frontera y/o establecer Impuestos” , escribió anoche el mandatario. “¡Nuestro País está LLENO!” .
….Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States, or we will have no other choice than to Close the Border and/or institute Tariffs. Our Country is FULL!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2019
El mensaje del republicano se dio apenas unas horas después de presionar a la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen , de presentar su renuncia, tras una complicada reunión en la Casa Blanca, según reportes del New York Times y el Washington Post.
Previo a su nueva advertencia, el mandatario presumió las acciones de la Patrulla Fronteriza, al señalar que ha detenido a más inmigrantes que “en muchos años” e insistió sobre lo “lleno” que está el país, además de pedir nuevamente el endurecimiento de leyes, exigiendo a los demócratas sumarse a su petición.
“El sistema ha estado roto por muchos años. Los demócratas en el Congreso deben aceptar arreglar estas lagunas legales – No fronteras abiertas (crimen y drogas)” , tuiteó.
More apprehensions (captures)
at the Southern Border than in many years. Border Patrol amazing! Country is FULL! System has been broken for many years. Democrats in Congress must agree to fix loopholes – No Open Borders (Crimes & Drugs). Will Close Southern Border If necessary…
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2019
Desde la semana pasada, el presidente Trump ha enviado mensajes públicos a la Administración de López Obrador, quien no ha respondido directamente al respecto, pero el canciller Marcelo Ebrard afirma que México se mantendrá en su posición de respetar el Acuerdo de Marrakech , el cual aboga por la inmigración libre y ordenada. Este plan aprobado por las Naciones Unidas fue rechazado por Estados Unidos.
A pesar de las críticas del republicano a México, ese Gobierno aceptó recibir a inmigrantes que esperan una decisión en las cortes de EEUU sobre sus casos de asilo, un proyecto que Nielsen proyectó ampliar la semana pasada.

Texto completo: The Criterion Collection unveils its new streaming service. And a documentary on a former drug dealer debuts on Starz.
What's Streaming
COLUMBIA NOIR Stream on Criterion Channel. Fans of art-house films and classic movies lamented the end of Filmstruck in November. Now they can turn to this new streaming service, featuring more than 1,000 movies from the libraries of the Criterion Collection and Janus Films and a rotating selection from major and independent studios. It starts with a spotlight on 11 noir films from Columbia Pictures, including "Nightfall" by Jacques Tourneur, "The Big Heat" by Fritz Lang and "Pushover" by Richard Quine.
QUEENS OF MYSTERY Stream on Acorn TV. This whimsical mini-series stars Olivia Vinall as Matilda Stone, a detective sergeant whose life has always been shrouded in mystery. When Matilda was 3, her mother disappeared, leaving her in the hands of her three crime-writing aunts, Beth (Sarah Woodward), Cat (Julie Graham) and Jane (Siobhan Redmond). She left her quiet hometown at 18 to become a cadet, and now she has returned for a new job. Her aunts are overjoyed to have her back -- mostly because they want in on the action. While Matilda tries but fails to keep them out of her investigations, she uses her sleuthing skills to uncover the truth about her mother.
What's on TV
WHITE BOY (2019) 9 p.m. on Starz. In 1987, Richard Wershe Jr., a 17-year-old Detroit drug dealer known as White Boy Rick, was arrested. He was eventually convicted and handed a life sentence in prison. Many have questioned the severity of his punishment, particularly because Wershe had been drawn into the criminal world as a police informant at 14 and had helped bring down a local criminal organization. (He's currently in a Florida prison on racketeering charges and is scheduled to be released in 2020.) Reporters have followed his story over the years, and a drama was even in theaters last fall. The tale receives fresh scrutiny in this documentary, in which journalists, federal agents and others weigh in on Wershe's sentence and question the role of the police.
AMERICAN DAD! 10 p.m. on TBS. In this Season 13 finale, Stan (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) and Francine (Wendy Schaal) try to save their marriage but wind up trapped on a hot-air balloon. The rest of the family gets caught up in a jingle-writing contest.
THOSE WHO CAN'T 10 p.m. on truTV. This scripted comedy series about a group of very unprofessional high school teachers wraps up its third season. The crew devises a plan to keep the school from shutting down while Quinn (Rory Scovel) and Tammy (Sonya Eddy) set out on a vision quest. Those who haven't seen the show should know that it isn't "for people who like their humor refined, subtle or family-friendly," Neil Genzlinger wrote in his New York Times review. "It goes in big on gross-out humor, crass puns and general raunchiness."

Hickenlooper hopes to gallop past gaffes like Seabiscuit

Texto completo: It could have been the night that derailed John Hickenlooper’s nascent presidential run.
Just weeks after the former Colorado governor added his name to the rapidly expanding pool of Democrats seeking the 2020 nomination, flirting with single digits in the polls, Hickenlooper took center stage for an hour at a CNN town hall, where he had a chance to introduce himself to the nation.
For most of the hour, viewers saw what Colorado observers have come to know — the thoughtful, self-deprecating former barkeep with a predilection for bringing antagonists together and an aversion to making enemies.
And then they were treated to Hickenlooper’s equally familiar fondness for going off script with an off-the-cuff quip and his penchant to digress, turning a sound bite into a sprawling confession fit to come back to bite him.
In the space of a few minutes, Hickenlooper delivered what was considered a tone-deaf response to a question about putting a woman on the presidential ticket, and followed that up with a head-scratching saga about the time he took his mom to a pornographic movie.
“Of course,” Hickenlooper responded when asked whether he would pick a woman as a running mate, and then continued: “How come we’re not asking, more often, the women, ‘Would you be willing to put a man on the ticket?’”
Across the country, the Twitterati slapped its collective forehead, and then slapped it again during the next exchange.
At the prompting of CNN’s Dana Bash, the town hall’s moderator, Hickenlooper went into great detail about accompanying his mom to a screening of the notorious X-rated flick “Deep Throat” when he was home from college in the early 1970s.
After the town hall, Hickenlooper and an aide hastened to clarify his answer about whether a woman belongs on the ticket, saying it was meant to flip the assumption behind the question. “Too often media discounts the chance of a woman winning,” he told a CNN reporter, adding: “People can take it out of context.”
The next day, some national news sites led with that awkwardly phrased remark, while others opted for a more colorful summation.
“John Hickenlooper held a really weird town hall where he talked about watching porn with his mom,” the Vice News headline read.
This came on the heels of a kerfuffle kicked up by Hickenlooper when the one-time restaurant magnate declined to call himself a capitalist — labels can be divisive, he insisted — on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” political talk show, leading to a discussion among pundits that lasted for days.
Back home, Coloradans recalled a well-worn Hickenlooper adage.
“As I say to my wife all the time, there’s always 5 feet between me and disaster. That’s the distance between my foot and my mouth,” Hickenlooper said in 2012, following a slip of the tongue that drew national attention.
Introducing Joe Garcia, his lieutenant governor, to a group of elementary school children, Hickenlooper had fumbled over the phrasing, first calling Garcia a “rising sex star” and then correcting himself: “I mean symbol, not star.”
Later, he explained, he’d intended to call his second-in-command a rock star but got tongue-tied.
That could be why long-time observers of Hickenlooper’s political trajectory in Colorado chuckled at his town hall performance — but barely blinked.
They’ve seen it before.
It’s hard to separate his gaffes — common enough to be dubbed “Hickenbloopers” — from the rest of Hickenlooper’s image as an unpolished, accidental politician who famously wondered whether he would have to break down and buy a suit after winning election as mayor of Denver.
In a 2011 interview with New York Times reporter Frank Bruni, Hickenlooper made a memorable crack about his wealth: “Trust me, I’m small rich, not big rich.”
At the time, a top communications strategist for another Colorado Democrat marveled at Hickenlooper’s ability to say something that could cause endless headaches for any other politician and emerge unscathed, leaving wry grins instead of controversy in his wake.
Still, it’s also a truism in politics that the kind of developments that light up Twitter and set pundits’ tongues a-wagging only rarely cast much of a shadow in the long run — and it’s the politician who can keep from getting distracted or overwhelmed by the day’s ups and downs who goes the distance.
It’s a trait common to the last two Democratic presidential nominees who went on to win the White House.
Barack Obama didn’t earn the nickname “No Drama Obama” for nothing, possessing an almost uncanny serenity and ability to focus amid the chaos of a presidential campaign.
And during his campaigns and presidency, Bill Clinton gained a reputation for maintaining his cool while navigating from one “bimbo eruption” to the next, including facing down impeachment and emerging with his popularity intact.
It’s unlikely that Hickenlooper’s 2020 campaign will be wrecked by a faux pas or even the kind of blunder that could dash another candidate’s trajectory.
Days after the CNN town hall, Hickenlooper spent a couple of days on a campaign swing through New Hampshire, where it doesn’t sound like any of the voters he met wanted to talk about the town hall topics that commanded attention in the media or on social media.
Instead, voters wanted to hear what he had to say about health care, energy policy and his record as governor.
In a stump speech, Hickenlooper described his approach, invoking Seabiscuit, the unimpressive racehorse who surprised everyone by becoming a champion and captivated the nation in the 1930s.
“Seabiscuit wasn’t as big as the other thoroughbreds, Seabiscuit didn’t have the same wealthy stable, didn’t have the famous trainer, but Seabiscuit had heart,” Hickenlooper said.
“My wife will tell this story about how Seabiscuit worked harder and Seabiscuit would never quit. And then she’d pause and say, ‘My husband is Seabiscuit.’”

Texto completo: Kirstjen Nielsen, la secretaria del departamento Seguridad Nacional (DHS) y cara de la actual campaña migratoria del presidente Donald Trump en contra de la inimgración ilegal no aguantó mas la presión y renunció a su cargo tras un reunión este domingo con el presidente en la Casa Blanca.
“La secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen, abandonará su cargo y me gustaría agradecerle por su servicio”, dijo Trump en Twitter.
Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service….
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 7, 2019
A paso seguido Trump anunció su reemplazo en Twitter. “Me complace anunciar que Kevin McAleenan, el actual Comisionado de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza de los Estados Unidos, se convertirá en Secretario Interino de @DHSgov. ¡Confío en que Kevin hará un gran trabajo!”
Kirstjen Nielsen abandona el cargo luego de un dificil paso por la dirección de DHS, gestión que la convirtió en el blanco de repetidas críticas por parte del presidente Trump y de varios miembros de su gabinete.
La medida se produce días después de que Trump, quien ha expresado en repetidas ocasiones su enojo por el aumento de migrantes en la frontera sur, se arrepinitió y retiró a su candidato Ron Vitiello para dirigir ICE porque buscaba a un funcionario mas “agresivo” en contra da inmigración ilegal.
Para muchos en Washington la salida Nielsen no es una sorpresa tras las reiteradas críticas de Trump por su insatisfacción con la funcionaria debido al aumento de inmigrantes que ingresaban ilegalmente a los Estados Unidos por la frontera sur
En mayo pasado, seis meses después de asumir el cargo en el departamento, The New York Times informó que Nielsen había redactado su carta de renuncia después de haber sido reprendida públicamente por lo que el presidente llamó su fracaso para ayudar a detener la inmigración ilegal en la frontera.
Según reporta el diario neoyorquino, Stephen Miller, asesor principal de Trump en temas migratorios, se habría dado a la tarea de aumentar la presión y las quejas sobre Nielsen, acusándola de no encontrar formas creativas para detener la entrada de inmigrantes centroamericanos a suelo de EEUU.
De igual forma Jared Kushner, asesor y cuñado de Trump tampoco veía con buenos ojos la continuidad de Nielsen en la dirección de DHS, aumentando la presión para que la funcionaria diera una paso al costado, dijeron varios funcionarios de la Casa Blanca.
Todos estos factores habrían llevado a que Nielsen, después de una agitada reunión con Trump en la Casa Blanca este domingo, decidira renunciar.

Trade isn't only issue with China

Texto completo: President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping of China will probably soon reach a trade agreement, but that won't solve the biggest problems.
The Chinese regime is interning people based on religion in a more systematic way than any other regime since perhaps the Nazis. Its tolerance of fentanyl trafficking leads to some 20,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States each year. It steals intellectual property and ratchets up persecution at home.
I lived in China, speak Chinese and deeply admire the country. Yet I am increasingly repulsed by Xi's China, for he is dragging the country in the wrong direction by imprisoning lawyers, journalists and people of faith; tightening controls over the internet; creating international security risks in the South China Sea; and fostering a personality cult around himself.
In fairness, it's also true that the Chinese government has helped lift more people out of poverty than any other government in human history. Just since 1990, the mortality rate for children under 5 has fallen in China by 83 percent - suggesting, by my calculations, that an additional 676,000 Chinese children survive each year who previously would have died.
Those of us who condemn China for human rights violations must also acknowledge this uncomfortable truth: A child born in Beijing today has a substantially longer life expectancy (82 years) than a child born in Washington, D.C. (77 years).
In short, the Xi regime is complicated. It cheats, oppresses and brutalizes, but it also educates, enriches and saves lives.
I used to believe that China was best approached with ambivalence, but in the last few years the ambivalence has faded into wariness.
A trade deal is a good thing, but I hope that the United States will work with allies and firmly stand up to China on three issues in particular.
First, to the extent possible, we should try to curb Chinese high-technology firms' access to Western markets. These businesses are a security threat, and the Trump administration is right to be concerned. If a company like Huawei is asked to cooperate with Chinese State Security spies, its executives simply can't say no.
This doesn't mean that China is evil. American companies sold telecommunications equipment to China beginning in the 1980s that let us intercept officials' conversations there, and we have inserted cyber "back doors" into goods and software sold to China so that we can cause damage in the event of a conflict. China inevitably will try to do to us what we already did to it.
Second, we should continue to highlight human rights, especially China's internment of perhaps 1 million Muslims in re-education camps. This is a staggering affront to religious liberty, with Chinese officials reportedly forcing Muslims to violate their faith by eating pork and drinking alcohol.
Third, we need continued pressure on China over its exports of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that is killing Americans in huge numbers through overdoses. Two-thirds or more of the fentanyl in the U.S. originates in China, where the authorities have been promising since 2016 to crack down on it.
A few days ago, China announced that it would soon ban all variants of fentanyl, a welcome step that may make a difference. But China often promises cooperation that does not materialize, and everything will depend on enforcement over the country's 160,000 chemical companies. Too many lives hang in the balance to take China at its word.
So, sure, a good trade deal with China is welcome. But when so many Americans are dying from Chinese fentanyl, when 1 million Muslims are interned, when Emperor Xi is dragging China in the wrong direction, let's not celebrate but, instead, keep up the international pressure.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Have you ever used an online translator to translate a phrase to another language and then back again? And somewhere along the way, deep in the machine and language itself, the meaning is modestly but perceptibly changed?
As an art director for the print edition of The New York Times, I often find myself adapting digital projects for the newspaper, and it feels a bit like that. I end up thinking a lot about how information is consumed and interpreted in different ways when its form is altered. It's not that the medium is the message; it's that the medium is a container and shapes the message to its contours.
With that in mind, I teamed up with Tala Safié, a freelance art director, to bring the feeling of the internet to the newspaper. The project, "Internetting with Amanda Hess," a special section about online culture, is in this Sunday's New York Times.
The section is drawn from a series of psychedelic video essays edited by Shane O'Neill and hosted by Amanda Hess, a critic at The Times who writes about the internet. It covers everything from the rapid ascendance of dog memes to the dark side of parenting YouTube.
"If you're trying to describe memes in a column, it can be very difficult," Ms. Hess said. "The videos gave us the ability to show, not tell."
Video offered a concise, natural way to talk about the internet on the internet, but the trade-off was nuance. While videos allowed for another layer of visual information to accompany the essay, their arguments had to be stripped down to clock in under six minutes or so, and the series never made it to print.
Fred Bierman, a design director for the newspaper, began to explore giving the series a home in print after reading through the video transcripts by chance, and he recruited Ms. Safié and me for the task. Given the subject matter and the on-its-face absurdity of putting internet videos into print, we set out -- tongue planted firmly in cheek -- to reconsider some of the basic assumptions of a newspaper.
The section may strike some readers as unusual and disorienting. The orientation changes several times; the paging is atypical; the text is interrupted by images. Also, a large, disembodied cat head is floating on the cover.
But the design is not a frivolous decoration, nor is it a joke. It's structurally significant to the story form and the way that these essays are understood.
"I hope it'll be delightful, but also challenging," Mr. Bierman said. "It's not a typical newspaper product."
The internet is rife with interruptions and distractions, so Ms. Hess and Mr. O'Neill annotated the essay transcripts with fresh context, digressions, and comments from viewers -- all of which appear only in print, breathing new life into the essays and adding extra layers of nuance to the arguments.
We often experience or consume content on the internet in a fragmented, free-associative way -- an article here, a video there -- and so each essay lives on a discrete sheet, not a page. Full-sheet poster illustrations by Erik Carter and Tracy Ma in the style of found imagery break the text flow; and the posters, too, are peppered with overlays of decontextualized thumbnails.
"When you think about the internet, you think about interruptions that you get online: ads, pop-ups," Ms. Safié said. "We translated that to print by actually having the flow of information be interrupted by illustrations as you're navigating the issue."
Just as the internet is not read linearly, there is also no single, correct order to the section. There are no page numbers, and the pages can (and should) be rearranged in different ways to elicit different connections and meanings between the essays and posters.
By putting Internetting in the paper, we hoped to touch on a truth long heralded by artists like Paul Soulellis and Hito Steyerl: As the internet bleeds into "meatspace" in increasingly distressing and creative ways, internet culture becomes culture, and it's important to understand lest we find the world suddenly unrecognizable.
To bring the online offline is to cut it out and see its edges. When translated to print, the interruptions and distractions that feel seamless online are jarring and challenging. How do you disconnect without unplugging? It's a feature, not a bug.
"Internetting with Amanda Hess" is out in this Sunday's print New York Times.

On the border, Democrats are the deniers

Texto completo: It is the Democrats' conceit that they're members of the reality-based party. They like to tag Republicans and conservatives as “deniers” of plain facts. It's a highly debatable proposition in many policy areas — GMO crops and abortion come to mind — but the Democrats’ starkest evasion of facts is currently at the nation's southern border. The party's only tactic is outright denial of the plain truth that we have a crisis, and their denial is making it worse.

“President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage and stop manufacturing a crisis, and must reopen the government,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in January, as the White House and Congress wrangled over shutting down the government over money for border security.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said of the president’s Oval Office address calling for a border wall, “This president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.”

Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif., who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said after the Oval Office address, “There is a crisis, alright, but it's in [Trump's] poor mind."

This flippancy contrasts glaringly with the facts.

More than 50,000 migrants were arrested each month in October, November, and December 2018 trying to enter the U.S. illegally. This flood was much higher than the previous year’s monthly average, according to Customs and Border Protection officials. The number in December was a record high. The sheer volume of families illegally crossing into America in recent months has overwhelmed officials at the border and created a new kind of “humanitarian crisis,” the New York Times finally realized in January. Meanwhile, immigration courts are badly overwhelmed and reported a backlog of 760,000 cases in January before the government shutdown, according to the Justice Department.

It is only "a matter of time" before tragedy strikes at one of the Customs and Border Protection’s holding facilities, Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in March. There are more than 13,000 migrants in custody in El Paso, Texas, he said, adding that most of the migrants are families or unaccompanied children.

"On Monday and Tuesday, CBP started the day with over 12,000 migrants in our custody," he said. “As of this morning, that number was 13,400. A high number for us is 4,000. A crisis level is 6,000. 13,000 is unprecedented."

As for the journey itself, it is often treacherous; 31% of female migrants say they were sexually abused while traveling through Mexico, according to Doctors Without Borders.

“You’ve got a humanitarian crisis, which has created a border security crisis for us, that we’ve been doing this for an awfully long time, and this is all being driven by policy crisis,” Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz of the U.S. Border Patrol said in an interview with CNN this week. “And until we fix the policy crisis, we’re going to continue to deal with the other two.”

President Trump exaggerates some threats, for instance, leaving the impression that the migrant caravans are criminal drug gangs. And because we believe in the separation of powers, we have opposed Trump’s use of emergency powers to reallocate funds in a way Congress has not authorized.

Democrats could challenge Trump on policy, but instead they ludicrously deny his obviously correct premise. Why? First, and most obviously, they don't want to stanch illegal immigration. Second, they don’t actually want presidential powers curbed. Their meta-agenda is to expand the power of the executive so it can be a superlegislator unhindered by democratic legitimacy. The party fiercely defended President Barack Obama’s repeated usurpations of legislative power. It worried that Justice Brett Kavanaugh would curb executive power.

So, lacking a principled argument against Trump’s unscrupulous use of executive power, they deny the plain facts. This isn’t just stupid, but it's also dangerous, for it exacerbates the crises itself.

What is bringing a flood of families to the gates of our southern border? What is causing the spike in illegal crossings? The most obvious reason is that people in Central America know the U.S. border is open, particularly to people with children, and offers a golden opportunity to migrate immediately rather than legally.

Our border needs many more miles of wall and better wall. It needs more manpower and more technology. We need better facilities to hold asylum-seekers. We also need better immigration laws.

Until we get those things, we need most urgently to send a message that illegal immigrants will not be allowed to sneak into the U.S. and stay here. It needs to be both stated and true that arriving at the border with a child won’t allow you to skip the queue.

Democratic leaders could end the crisis by simply standing with Trump and broadcasting the message clearly, in English and Spanish, that we don’t tolerate illegal immigrants and will catch them and that dragging your children across dangerous deserts to arrive at our border hoping for asylum is not an entry ticket.

But stanching the flood in that simple way would require admitting there is a crisis. It would also involve putting the national interest above politics.

Texto completo: New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman - who has been called the "Trump Whisperer" by media outlets and a "third rate reporter" by President Donald Trump - spoke at Chatham University on Wednesday about what it's like covering his administration.
Haberman addressed everything from Twitter to the 2020 presidential campaign.
"I would not count him out," Haberman said of Trump in 2020. "How things look now is now how things will look in 19 months."
More than 600 turned out for Haberman's public lecture, "The President and the Press: What a long, complicated relationship it's been."
Her roughly 45-minute talk was punctuated with laughs and was followed by audience questions.
Here is a short list of some of the more interesting things she shared:
On Twitter and Trump:
One of her colleagues, she said, purchased an Apple Watch so he could get Trump's tweets in the shower.
"I think people are still figuring it out," Haberman said.
(Read Haberman's essay "Why I Needed to Pull Back From Twitter")
On the scoop she said "no" to:
Someone pitched her the exclusive on Trump's presidential announcement, but Haberman turned it down because of his previous false election starts.
"In hindsight, it was not the best call," Haberman said.
On the Washington Post's 9,451 tally of Trump's false and misleading statements:
"Is that a lot?" Haberman said to laughter.
On Trump's relationship with the media:
"It's complicated," Haberman said. "He craves, thrives off and needs the press in a way few elected officials do."
On Trump's "fake news" rhetoric:
"It seeks to erode faith in institutions, and it's dangerous over the long haul," Haberman said.

Analysis: Why Americans shouldn’t feel grateful for $137 insulin

Texto completo: Last month, Eli Lilly and Co. announced with some fanfare that it was manufacturing a generic version of its own best-selling insulin brand, Humalog, which it would sell for half off -- $137.35 versus about $275.
David Ricks, the chief executive of Lilly, said the company was making this seemingly beneficent gesture because "many patients are struggling to afford their insulin."
But they're struggling, in large part, because since 2001 Lilly has raised the price of a vial of Humalog to about $275, from $35. Other insulin makers have raised prices similarly.
In Germany, the list price of a vial of Humalog is about $55 -- or $45 if you buy five at a time -- and that includes some taxes and markup fees. Why not just reduce the price in the United States to address said suffering?
Instead, Lilly decided to come out with a new offering, a so-called authorized generic. This type of product is made by or under an agreement from the brand manufacturer. The medicines are exactly the same as the brand-name drug -- often made in the same factory with the same equipment to the same formula. Only the name and the packaging are different.
It is, perhaps, a sign of how desperate Americans are for something -- anything -- to counteract the escalating price of drugs that Lilly's move was greeted with praise rather than a collective "Huh?"
Imagine if Apple sold a $500 iPhone for $250 if it was called, say, a yPhone, and simply lacked the elaborate white box and the little Apple logo on the back. That would be patently absurd. An iPhone in a brown paper bag is still an iPhone. And Humalog with a new name isn't a generic -- except according to the bizarre logic of the pharmaceutical industry. Like so many parts of our health care system, its existence has more to do with convoluted business arrangements than health.
Generics, as traditionally understood, are copies of brand-name drugs made by competing manufacturers once the original patent protection has expired. To be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, they must have the same active chemical ingredients as the brand drug and be absorbed equally into the blood, though they could look different and contain different inactive additives.
Historically and in practice they tend also to be far cheaper, because the advent of generics often introduces robust competition into the market. That is why brand manufacturers sometimes produce an authorized generic once they lose patent protection. That way, they can compete at the lower price point, while preserving the original for those with extreme label loyalty.
More recently, authorized generics such as Lilly's stem largely from a different strategy -- based on the perverse ways money flows through our health system and who keeps the cash.
Over the past 20 years, drugmakers have continuously raised the price of some essential medicines in the United States because, well, they can in a country that doesn't set drug prices. And they do -- until the bad publicity catches up with them.
Mylan got hauled before Congress in 2016 for raising the price of an EpiPen. Now it's insulin's turn. The other two major makers of brand-name insulin products -- Novo Nordisk and Sanofi -- have raised prices in lockstep with Lilly. But they are based in Europe, so the Indiana-based Lilly has been the primary focus of angry protests here.
Part of insulin's price rise in the United States is because of the middlemen who buy the drugs on behalf of insurers and hospitals and negotiate discounts off the list price for their clients. So Lilly often doesn't make the full $275 a vial (though, since rebates are secret, we don't know how much less).
By selling an authorized generic, rather than merely lowering the brand's price, Lilly is essentially doing an end run around those middlemen and giving patients who don't purchase through an insurer another option.
It is also making sure that if and when cheaper versions of Humalog emerge, it will have an offering to compete.
In fact, a "biosimilar" version of Humalog already exists. It was introduced to the United States last year. And yet it costs around the same price as the brand-name drug. Why? It is made by Sanofi, which has no interest in starting a price war to lower costs.
Finally, Lilly has generated a few positive headlines. "Eli Lilly Will Sell Half-Price Version of Humalog, Its Best-Selling Insulin," The New York Times reported.
Mylan effectively calmed its EpiPen PR crisis by introducing a cheaper authorized generic. Now Lilly, following a similar playbook, is hoping for a similar result.
Will it work? Politicians and patients will decide.
But they might well keep these two thoughts in mind: If the product being sold were electricity or gas for your car, a price rise of more than 600 percent over 15 years would be regarded as price gouging and wouldn't be tolerated. And in Germany and many other developed countries, there is no need for a $137.35 vial of "authorized generic" for Humalog. At around $50 a vial, Humalog as Humalog costs far less.

Crowd rallies in Boulder for release of Mueller report

Texto completo: Illustration About 150 people turned out at the bandshell in downtown Boulder Thursday to demand the release of the full Mueller report.
Vicki Bynum, of Boulder, front, holds a sign and chants with others Thursday during a protest demanding the release the full Mueller report.

The rallying cry for the release of the full Mueller report came to downtown Boulder on Thursday afternoon.
"We are here today because we believe in the rule of law," Kenneth Nova, an organizer of a protest that drew about 150 people to the Glen Huntington Memorial Bandshell, said reading a statement from moveon.org , which helped organize about 300 demonstrations across the country.
"We have a president who doesn't," Nova said. "We are here today to say enough is enough. We stand with Americans across the country to confront President Trump and Attorney General (William Barr) and their efforts to hide the findings of the Mueller investigation from the public."
In addition to Boulder, protests were organized Thursday in Longmont, Denver, Loveland and outside of Sen. Cory Gardner's Fort Collins field office.
Late last month, Special Counsel Robert Mueller released a nearly 400-page report of his findings from a nearly two-year investigation into whether Donald Trump's presidential campaign illegally conspired with the Russian government during the 2016 election.
Barr, in a four-page summary, wrote that the investigation found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump organization and Russia, but summary stated that the report did not exonerate Trump from possibly obstructing the investigation. Trump has said the report fully exonerates him.
Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty spoke briefly at the bandshell and said the Mueller investigation involved, among other things, 19 attorneys and 40 FBI agents who served about 2,800 subpoenas. Dougherty said the four-page summary is inadequate and the full report needs to be released.
"We need transparency," he said. "We need accountability and we need integrity in our leaders."
Some of Mueller's investigators have told associates that Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry, and the findings are more troubling for Trump than Barr indicated in his summary, according to a story in the New York Times.
The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday authorized a subpoena for the full report. Barr has said he will release a redacted version of the report later this month.
Golden resident Johnny Powderly said he works in Gunbarrel and stopped at the demonstration because he wants the full Mueller report released.
"It would be nice to see it," he said. "No one knows what's in it. We have a lot of information from the beginning of the Trump campaign that they met with Russia."
Powderly, who describes himself as being a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders and to the left of most Democrats politically, added that he and his family have found the Trump administration to be "exhausting."
"I'm very upset about what is going on," he said. "Whether it's grabbing crotches or having a hotel where government officials are staying and they are making money hand over fist — If Obama had done it, his administration would have been over in a minute."
Boulder resident Stephen Parlato said people need to be "relentless in our opposition to the Trump administration."
A former Baltimore, Md., resident and artist, Parlato said he has dedicated his time and money to opposing Trump. He added he paid for some of his artwork of a Donald Trump head made from snakes to be driven around on a 300-mile loop in the Washington, D.C., and Maryland area during the 2018 midterm elections.
"I believe they are a threat to the species," he said. "I couldn't be more adamantly opposed to the current administration."
He added he wants to see the Mueller report.
"I'm very disturbed by Barr's intrusion into the process," he said. "He's overstepped his authority."

Texto completo: President Trump and the Justice Department shot back at reports in which anonymous sources said member of special counsel Robert Mueller's team are frustrated with the way Attorney General William Barr portrayed the funding of their years-long investigation in a four-page summary.

The reports published by New York Times and the Washington Post immediately emboldened Democrats who are seeking access to the full report along with the underlying documents.

In a statement provided to the Washington Examiner , DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec said “every page of the ‘confidential report’ provided to Attorney General Barr on March 22, 2019, was marked ‘May Contain Material Protected Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)’ — a law that protects confidential grand jury information — and therefore could not be publicly released.”

Both the New York Times report, headlined “Some on Mueller’s Team Say Report Was More Damaging Than Barr Revealed"; and the Washington Post, headlined “Limited information Barr has shared about Russia investigation frustrated some on Mueller’s team,” relied solely on anonymous sources questioning Barr’s handling of the Mueller report.

The DOJ emphasized Barr is being helped by Mueller in his effort to ensure private grand jury testimony, classified material, or other sensitive information is not inappropriately revealed. “The Department continues to work with the Special Counsel on appropriate redactions to the report so that it can be released to Congress and the public," Kupec said.

The DOJ also defended Barr’s decision to provide a letter to Congress just a couple days after receiving and reviewing the lenghty report from Mueller. “Given the extraordinary public interest in the matter, the Attorney General decided to release the report’s bottom-line findings and his conclusions immediately — without attempting to summarize the report — with the understanding that the report itself would be released after the redaction process," Kupec said.

“As the Attorney General stated in his March 29th letter to Chairman Graham and Chairman Nadler, he does not believe the report should be released in ‘serial or piecemeal fashion’,” she added.

Trump also raged against the Times, accusing the outlet of not using "legitimate sources."

Barr previously told Congress that he expects to complete his review and to present the redacted version of the Mueller report to Congress “by mid-April, if not sooner," noting that “everyone will soon be able to read it on their own.” He said he would not be giving the White House a sneak peak beforehand, precluding the possibility of executive privilege.

In his initial March 22 letter to Congress, Barr revealed that Mueller would not be charging any Trump associates with criminal collusion with Russia. “The Special Counsel’s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election," he wrote.

Barr also wrote Mueller declined to determine whether Trump obstructed justice, and Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the president committed a crime.

Democrats became immediately frustrated with Barr's four-page summary of Mueller's report that Trump and his allies claim provided him exoneration.

The House Judiciary Committee voted Wednesday to subpoena Mueller’s full report along with the underlying documents and calls have been mounting among top congressional and political leaders to get the report out to the public quickly.

Parenting in the Time of Measles

Texto completo: Last Wednesday at midnight, Rockland County, N.Y., did something no local government had ever done. It barred anyone under age 18 who has not received the measles vaccine from going to libraries, gyms, supermarkets -- any public place where they could expose others to the virus. The state of emergency came as a desperate, final effort to stop the spread of the largest measles outbreak in America.
Other communities might soon be taking similar measures: The number of measles cases across the country this year is at its second highest since the disease was eradicated in 2000 -- and we're only in April.
Many Americans are shocked at the growth of the anti-vaccine movement. Alas, I'm not one of them. As a mother who has traveled in home-schooling circles since the birth of my first child in 2013, I have watched as hostility toward vaccines has blossomed.
The decision to home-school came easily for me and my husband. For the cost of my missed income -- which was less than what we would have paid for private school for all of our children -- we can tailor-make our children's education. Our children have different educational needs, and thanks to our extremely small class size of three, they can be met much more easily.
Unfortunately, this go-against-the-grain attitude within the home-schooling community extends to vaccines. One of the reasons the home-schooling movement is growing exponentially is that it has attracted parents who are pulling their children out of schools that require vaccinations.
Because I want my children to have an active social life with other home-schooled kids, asking another parent whether they or their kids are up-to-date on their shots is something I've avoided. But my attempt to stay willfully ignorant has lately hit a snag: Like people who do cross-fit and eat vegan, mothers who don't vaccinate have a way of telling you within an hour of meeting that they don't "poison their kids with chemicals." While socializing at home-school gatherings, parents increasingly swap recommendations about the elusive pediatrician who won't require them to vaccinate.
I now have a solid idea of how many home-schooled kids I know who aren't vaccinated. It's as many as half.
Right now, my children are old enough to be fully vaccinated and so they largely are safe socializing. But as of this summer, God willing, the choice to hang with other home-schooling families will become much more complicated. We're having our fourth child, and exposing her to unvaccinated people could risk her life.
When we moved several states away last fall, we had a much clearer idea about what we were looking for from a pediatrician than we did when we were expecting our first baby. After a dear friend and her young daughter were exposed to the measles in her pediatrician's waiting room while she was pregnant, we had one nonnegotiable requirement from our doctor: He or she could not accept parents who refuse to vaccinate.
The first place a parent brings a sick child is usually the pediatrician's office, and we did not want to run the risk of exposing a new baby to a virus that can remain airborne for hours. It turned out those conversations I overheard about "flexible" and "understanding" pediatricians in our new community came in handy; we crossed off their names from our list immediately.
But if vaccines are so important to my family, I've come to ask myself how intellectually honest it is for me to turn a blind eye and continue to allow my kids to socialize with families who are putting us all at risk.
That's the problem with vaccine refusal: It is not an individual choice. It is a choice that endangers everyone, especially those too young or sick to be vaccinated.
Right now, the only solution to the anti-vaccine public health crisis on a legislative level is to eliminate nonmedical exemptions for children entering school, and it is a policy that should be instituted and tightened in every state, as it is in California. This is an important step that states need to take, but it is only part of the solution as more and more families opt out of the system.
Thankfully, government intervention isn't the only tool we have to address this crisis. Pediatricians should refuse to treat patients who refuse to vaccinate, leaving parents who would expose a waiting room to the measles with a choice: Do I vaccinate to make sure my child can be also treated for normal childhood ailments like ear infections and strep throat? One should not come without the other, not when other patients are put at unnecessary risk.
Home-schooled kids don't exist in a bubble, and they don't stay exclusively at home during the learning process. Our children, for example, attend classes at nature centers, the local zoo, a children's gym and more. In the case of these programs, especially ones organized by government entities like the county parks department, there should be a requirement to show proof of immunization to register. Departments of Health in many states, including New York, require proof of vaccination for summer camp; any organized program that children participate in should require the same.
Home-school families like mine may be at the front lines of this crisis, but the unvaccinated kids I know go to the same supermarkets, churches, synagogues and movie theaters your kids do. Rockland's decision to "bar" unvaccinated children from public places may be an unenforceable edict, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be using every possible means to pressure members of the herd to act responsibly.

Consumers paying for capitalism

Texto completo: Why didn't Boeing do it right? Why isn't Facebook protecting user passwords? Why is Phillip Morris allowed to promote vaping? Why hasn't Wells Fargo reformed itself? Why hasn't Monsanto (now owned by Bayer) recalled its Roundup weed killer?
Answer: corporate greed coupled with inept and corrupt regulators.
These are just a few of the examples of corporate harms inflicted on innocent people. Some began before the Trump administration, but Trump and his appointees have shown corporations that they can do as they please.
Boeing wanted to get its 737 Max 8 out quickly because airlines want to pack in more passengers at lower fuel costs. But neither Boeing nor the airlines shelled out money to adequately train pilots on the new software made necessary by the new design.
Nonetheless, Trump's Federal Aviation Administration certified the plane in March 2017. And after two subsequent deadly crashes, the U.S. was slower to ground the planes than other countries.
Last month, Facebook admitted to storing hundreds of millions of Facebook users' passwords in plain text that could be searched by more than 20,000 Facebook employees. The admission came just a year after the Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed that Facebook shared the personal data of as many as 87 million users with a political data firm.
Facebook's business model is based on giving personal data to advertisers. The firm will continue to do what it wants with personal information unless the Federal Trade Commission uses its power to force Facebook to better guard users' privacy. But so far Trump's FTC has done nothing - not even to enforce a 2011 agreement in which Facebook promised to do just that.
Altria (Phillip Morris) has recently found a future in vaping. Because inhaling nicotine in any form poses a health hazard, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb wanted to curb advertising of vaping products to teenagers.
Gottlieb thought he had Altria's agreement, but then the firm bought a major stake in the vaping company Juul. Its stock has already gained 14 percent this year. What happened to Gottlieb? After less than two years, he's out at the FDA.
Wells Fargo has publicly apologized for having deceived customers with fake bank accounts, unwarranted fees and unwanted products. Its top executives say they have eliminated the aggressive sales targets that were responsible for the fraud. But employees told the New York Times recently that they're still under heavy pressure to squeeze extra money out of customers. Some have witnessed colleagues bending or breaking internal rules.
Trump's Consumer Financial Protection Agency has done nothing. It's been defanged.
Last week, a federal jury awarded $80 million in damages to a California man who blamed Roundup weed killer for his cancer after finding that it was defectively designed and that Monsanto failed to warn of the herbicide's cancer risk. It was the second jury in eight months to reach the same conclusion.
Roundup contains glyphosate, a suspected carcinogen. Cases from more than 1,000 farmers and other agricultural workers stricken with non-Hodgkin lymphoma are already pending.
What has Trump's Environmental Protection Agency done about glyphosate? In December 2016, its office of pesticide programs concluded that glyphosate wasn't likely to cause cancer - although eight of the 15 experts on whom the agency relied expressed significant concerns about that conclusion, and three more expressed concerns about the data.
These are just tips of a vast iceberg of regulatory neglect, frozen into place by Trump's appointees, of which at least 187 were once lobbyists.
Trump and his Republican enablers in Congress yell "socialism!" at proposals for better balancing private greed with the common good. Yet unless a better balance is achieved, capitalism as we know it won't survive.

CULTURE MONSTER; PHOTOVILLE FESTIVAL; N.Y. pop-up heading west; A photography event of visual storytelling makes its L.A. debut across two weekends.

Texto completo: Sometimes it takes a village. Specifically, one made of aluminum shipping containers.
Photoville, New York's largest photography event, is rolling into Los Angeles for the first time in late April. The free pop-up photography festival will rise in a veritable village of repurposed shipping containers, immersive photo cubes and giant LED boxes at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Century City.
The event, created by the Brooklyn-based public art nonprofit United Photo Industries, has been running for seven years in New York in Brooklyn Bridge Park. Expansion was inevitable, said Photoville co-founder Laura Roumanos, though L.A.'s recent art-fair blitz was not necessarily the impetus.

"Photoville is not an art fair, it's a celebration of visual storytelling," Roumanos said. "It's about bringing the photography and visual storytelling community together, not about commerce and business. It's free. ... It's about making this kind of work accessible to all people."
Annenberg Space for Photography Presents Photoville L.A. will host more than 55 exhibitions and installations over two weekends, April 26-28 and May 2-5. About half of the 200-plus visual artists involved are based in Southern California. Some of the work on view is fine art, but there's an emphasis on documentary photography, Roumanos said, and "storytelling across all different kinds of mediums," including animation and short films.
The L.A. Times is an exhibiting partner at the event. "California Calamities: A State of Emergency" will showcase environment-related visual stories by Times photographers.
In other parts of the show, L.A. photographer and writer Oriana Koren will explore the "Underground Chefs of South Central," and local photographer Estevan Oriol will show "This Is Los Angeles," about the city's lowrider culture. A retrospective of photojournalist Joseph Rodriguez's work will showcase more than two decades of his imagery covering gang life.
"We've admired United Photo Industries' Photoville for many years," Annenberg Foundation President Wallis Annenberg said via email -- "how they create their festive photography 'village,' an immersive atmosphere where visitors can appreciate and learn about the work of world-class photographers who challenge us to see the world in new ways."
Longevity, Roumanos added, is a goal.
"The idea is for the L.A. arts community to start reaching out to each other now, start cross-promoting and working together -- not only once a year but all year long," she said.

Texto completo: Between the time I wrote these words and the time that you are reading them, a team of government censors decided how much of what I wrote you would get to see. Fortunately, it was cleared without redactions. But I haven't always been so fortunate.
There are millions of others like me who face this scrutiny as present and former employees of the armed services and a dozen other government agencies, from the C.I.A. and F.B.I. to the State and Energy Departments. We have faithfully carried out our duties and upheld our oaths of allegiance to the Constitution. Many of us earned the highest trust of our country, serving in roles that brought us in contact with government secrets and classified material. We have honored and repaid that trust, guarding sensitive information and fulfilling the obligations associated with our security clearances.
In return, we have been rewarded with what feels very much like a lifetime of distrust. Whenever we want to write about even the nonsensitive aspects of our service and experience, we have to submit our manuscripts and articles for prepublication review by the government. We have to do this even after we retire.
I spent 31 years in sworn duty to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, and I'm pretty sure this is not how the First Amendment is supposed to work. That's why I have joined in a lawsuit with four other former federal employees seeking to block the government from enforcing this review process in its current form.
I joined the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in 1981. At that time, despite the Cold War obsession with national security, service members and intelligence officers rarely had to submit their writings before publication. Two years later, President Ronald Reagan issued a directive that would have subjected millions of government employees to prepublication review. That directive was so controversial, and so obviously at odds with free speech values, that Congress held hearings, and Mr. Reagan rescinded it.
In the years since, however, 17 military and civilian agencies have instituted their own prepublication review regimes, according to an analysis by the A.C.L.U. and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which are representing us in our lawsuit. The rules about which employees are required to submit to review are confusing and inconsistent among agencies. The criteria for what gets censored are unclear. The time it takes to have a manuscript approved can stretch to years.
Of course, vital intelligence and operational information must be protected. But no review system will guard against those who are determined to divulge government secrets. At its best, then, this review should confirm that employees are not inadvertently disclosing information that would actually harm national security. My own experience shows, however, that this is not always the way the system works.
Three years ago, during a presidential race in which Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, was pledging to "bring back waterboarding and I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding," I felt I needed to share what I knew about the destructiveness of torture, and about the struggle many of us had waged to stop the abuse of prisoners in American custody after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. As deputy commander of the Department of Defense Criminal Investigation Task Force, I had protested prisoner abuse to my superiors, and I had shared what I knew with Senate investigators. With the subject of torture again thrust into the center of the national debate, I wanted to write a book that would make the case why these abuses should never be repeated.
I would never publish classified material. I carefully avoided it, and meticulously cited congressional hearings and official investigations to show that the information I included was already public. In January 2017, I submitted my manuscript to the military. Defense Department regulations provide for a review process of at least 30 working days, but the government held my manuscript for 233 days. I finally got it back, months after the planned publication date, littered with unnecessary redactions of already published material.
I'm now one of the editors of an academic volume on ethical interrogation. A single chapter that I helped write, thoroughly footnoted with published sources, was held up for six months for review. It was finally returned to us with redactions that required additional rewriting, adding to the delays.
This censorship system seriously discourages publishers from taking on books by people who often have the most to contribute to public debates and decision-making. As my first book languished in review, my publisher considered canceling my contract, and told me afterward that it was unlikely to publish similar projects because of the uncertainties and costly delays involved.
Worse, review inhibits others from publicly writing about their service. There are several million veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and other post-Sept. 11 military operations, plus many more from nonmilitary agencies. They are all required to submit their writings to government censors, many for the rest of their lives.
I take seriously my obligation to protect information essential to our national security. I also understand that I face a range of penalties, including criminal prosecution, if I betray this trust. There may be a place for prepublication review, but it should be limited in scope, clear in what it covers, and consistent with constitutional protections for freedom of speech. But the system we have now is not it.
The current system is discouraging some of our most dedicated and trustworthy veterans and public servants from joining public conversations that are crucial to our country's future. That is the very opposite of what the First Amendment intended, and it is not good for any of us.

Texto completo: Burger King is testing a vegetarian Whopper made with the Impossible Burger.
This week, 59 Burger King restaurants near St. Louis started testing the Impossible Whopper. The plant-based patty is flame grilled and topped with tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles and white onions on a sesame seed bun, according to a statement.
Impossible Foods is a California-based startup that makes meat and dairy products from plants. The company also provides meatless patties for many other restaurants including Red Robin and White Castle.
If everything goes as planned, the soy-based burger will expand availability of the Impossible Burger quickly to every branch in the country, according to the New York Times. The fast food chain has 7,200 locations.

White House whistle-blower from Maine tells Congress her story Tricia Newbold, who grew up in Madawaska, has served in the White House for 18 years.

Texto completo: The White House whistle-blower at the center of a controversy over security clearances for Trump administration officials grew up in the Aroostook County town of Madawaska and was remembered by a former teacher there for her courage and independence.
Tricia Newbold, a 1998 Madawaska High School graduate, has worked in the White House Personnel Security Office for more than 18 years, serving under four administrations dating to the Clinton White House in 2000.
Newbold's story came to light Monday after Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, issued a statement that said a whistle-blower - identified in committee documents as Newbold - sat for "a confidential, on-the-record, daylong interview with Democratic and Republican Committee staff to relay grave concerns about the dysfunction she has witnessed over the past two years, highlight the dangers these actions present to national security, and implore the committee to immediately conduct independent oversight of these matters."
Newbold, 39, told lawmakers that more than two dozen denials for security clearances have been overturned by Trump administration officials.
"I would not be doing a service to myself, my country, or my children if I sat back knowing that the issues that we have could impact national security," Newbold told the committee, according to a summary of her allegations.
Newbold met with committee staffers on March 23.
"I'm glad that my colleagues on the Oversight and Reform Committee have heard from Ms. Newbold directly about her experiences processing security clearances from the White House and I thank her for coming forward. I share their concerns and will keep pushing for answers from the administration," Maine Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, said in a statement Monday night.
"It's outrageous that after she reported these very serious issues she was retaliated against by her supervisor," Pingree said.
Newbold's Washington, D.C.-based attorney, Edward Passman, said Monday night that she did not want to be interviewed. Newbold, who was suspended for 14 days, worked as the adjudications manager for the Personnel Security Office before being moved to a position of senior adviser, Passman said.
"She just went back to work today," he said in a telephone interview. "She really cares about protecting our national security. To her, this is not a political position."
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Mark Warner, D-Virginia, introduced bipartisan legislation last month designed to "protect the integrity of the security clearance process and ensure that it cannot be abused for political purposes."
In a release issued March 18, the senators, who serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said their bill would "ban agencies from using security clearances to punish whistle-blowers or discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, religion, age, handicap or national origin."
The bill does not mention Newbold or anyone else by name, and a member of Collins' staff said Monday night that the bill wasn't designed with a specific person in mind and was crafted to depoliticize the clearance process by ensuring that established guidelines are followed in every application for a security clearance.
"The security clearance system is critical to protecting our country from harm and safeguarding access to our secrets. Americans should have the utmost confidence in the integrity of our security clearance process," Collins said in the release.
The New York Times reported that Newbold, who has a rare form of congenital dwarfism, filed a complaint against her supervisor with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission accusing him of discriminating against her over her short stature.
Gisele Dionne, Newbold's former teacher and now superintendent of the Madawaska School Department, said her former student had always shown grit in the face of adversity.
"Tricia was a very motivated and can-do person," Dionne said in an email Monday night. "Sometime after high school graduation I ran into her at a local store and was surprised by her new height and physique" after she underwent bone-lengthening surgery at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore.
"However, I was not surprised she had endured what must have been very painful procedures, so that she could gain more independence," Dionne said.

Burger King apuesta por ‘Impossible Burger’, la hamburguesa vegetariana que sangra

Texto completo: La cadena de comida rápida Burger King está ofreciendo en pruebas una hamburguesa vegetariana, llamada “Impossible Whopper”, en 59 restaurantes de la ciudad de St. Louis, con miras a expandir esta opción en sus menús de todo el país, informa este lunes The New York Times.
Se trata de una curiosa colaboración entre Burger King y la empresa Impossible Foods , conocida por haber creado una hamburguesa hecha con vegetales y con la proteína “heme”, que imita incluso el “sangrado” que luce el producto de carne de ternera habitual.
Según dijo al diario el jefe de marketing de la cadena, Fernando Machado, ni clientes ni empleados logran diferenciar la hamburguesa de carne de la vegetariana y esta opción podría pasar de ser un “nicho” de mercado a un negocio en sí para la firma.
Machado indicó que Burger King ha visto incrementarse el número de consumidores que quieren comer menos carne, especialmente procedente de ternera, y la “Impossible Whopper” permitiría satisfacer esa demanda sin “comprometer el sabor”.
La versión vegetariana de la hamburguesa tiene aproximadamente el mismo valor proteínico que la tradicional Whopper , pero un 15 % menos de grasa y un 90 % menos de colesterol respecto a la estrella de la cadena, de acuerdo al NYT.
El presidente de Burger King Norteamérica, Chris Finazzo, dijo a CNN que la firma espera “dar a quien quiera comer una hamburguesa todos los días, pero no necesariamente quiera comer ternera, permiso para venir a los restaurantes más frecuentemente”.
Yes, the Impossible #Whopper does taste this good. Thank you @DAVID_Miami_ for such a great Ad campaign! #marketing #advertising pic.twitter.com/unxtIAJHua

Por su parte, David Lee, el jefe financiero y de operaciones de Impossible Foods, una “startup” de Silicon Valley, indicó que pese a tener sus productos ya introducidos en unos 6,000 restaurantes del país, la alianza con Burger King supone un “hito” porque está “a una escala diferente”.
En un vídeo promocional del “test” publicado en su canal de YouTube corporativo, Burger King dice reunir a algunos de sus clientes más leales y les ofrece la hamburguesa vegetariana sin que sepan que no es de carne, ante lo que reaccionan con incredulidad asegurando que sabe como la “Whopper” original .

Coincidiendo con el día de “April Fool’s” en EE.UU., en el que abundan las bromas en los medios nacionales, muchos no se han tomado en serio la noticia, pese a que se están sumando a la tendencia de ofrecer opciones sin carne en los menús otras cadenas de comida rápida como Taco Bell o Chipotle.

Texto completo: Headnote AIRFARE HACKS
Between bargain-shopping travelers and airlines flashing ephemeral prices, searching for the lowest airfares can feel like a game of cat and mouse.
Sometimes, the game carries real-world risks, including the recent news that Lufthansa is suing a passenger whom the airline contends intentionally skipped a flight leg using a largely prohibited budget-booking practice known as hidden city.
Bargain hunting has led to a rise in cheap travel websites and rules of thumb for booking, such as flying at off-peak times and on slower days.
"People would like a simple rule, but in practice, there isn't a single day or time to buy," said Patrick Surry, chief data scientist for Hopper, an airfare prediction app. Factors most impacting airfares, he said, are "the day you travel, how long you stay and the airport you're flying." How far in advance you book can also determine the price you pay.
Airfares reflect the adage that time is money; for bargain-hunters, the less money you spend, the more time you're likely to spend in the airport.
Hopper found that fliers can save 5 percent on airfares by changing from direct to one-stop fares, and 2 percent above that for moving from a one- to a two-stop ticket. Of course, those non-direct fares will mean spending more time stuck in airports. Long layovers will also save you money: A layover of more than 12 hours means an average of a 6-percent savings on your airfare.
Having flexibility in travel is one sure way to get the best fare. Many search engines, including Kayak and Hopper, allow users to register for price-alert tracking that recommends whether to buy now or wait for future price drops. The app HitList allows users to track a route with unspecified dates or lengths of travel.
Other booking ploys, surveyed below, may or may not get you into trouble with the airlines.
Hidden city fares
Hidden city fares are one-way tickets through a connecting city where passengers intentionally stay in the layover city. For example, a flier from New York City to San Francisco may find it cheaper to book a one-stop flight to Seattle connecting through San Francisco, disembark there and not take the last leg to Seattle. The practice is known as skiplagging.
Finding these fares required a lot of scattershot searching and knowledge of airline competition until the website Skiplagged. com automated it in 2013. Its founder, Aktarer Zaman, was sued for deception by United Airlines and the online travel agency Orbitz in 2015, but that lawsuit was dismissed based on jurisdiction, and the website is still going strong.
Clearly, airlines don't like skiplagging, which prevents them from selling the empty seat. Delta, United and American now explicitly ban exploiting fare rules in their contracts of carriage. For example, American Airlines states that "reservations made to exploit or circumvent fare and ticket rules are strictly prohibited." This includes purchasing a ticket "without intending to fly all flights to gain lower fares (hidden city)."
Some also argue the practice is unethical. "For every dollar someone scams, and I do think it's a scam, that dollar is going to be placed back into the airfare structure of the airlines that everyone else pays," said George Hobica, the founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, a site that monitors airfare deals.
Zaman looks at the practice differently. "When you go to the store and buy a bag of chips, is it unethical to finish only half of it?" Zaman said. He notes that Skiplagged.com is for the average American flyer - who flies two times a year, according to the trade association Airlines for America - not for someone who intends to book hidden city routes often.
"Our mission is to make it easier to experience the world," Zaman added. "We make flying more accessible, so we're fighting against price discrimination and the way airlines try to take advantage of everybody."
Some airlines would beg to disagree. In the recent Lufthansa litigation, the airline sued a passenger, claiming a contract violation when he skipped the last leg of his flight on a one-stop ticket from Seattle to Oslo via Frankfurt. The airline's conditions of carriage stipulate that a fare is only valid if flown in the booked order (the order of flights listed in the itinerary), according to a spokeswoman for Lufthansa.
Hacker fares
Many flight hacks are termed hacker fares, but Kayak popularized the term used in its search results on round-trip queries to show two one-way tickets, often on competing airlines, at rock-bottom prices.
For example, a recent search for fares from Chicago to Los Angeles turned up nonstop round trips on United from $321, versus $275 with an outbound on Delta and a return on American. Round-trip prices for the same itinerary turned up fares of $372 on Delta and $312 on American, both more expensive than that $275 combination of two one-way fares.
"Hacker fares are what Kayak does to discover cheapness, but also more diversity in results in terms of flight schedules," Giorgos Zacharia, the chief technology officer at Kayak, said. "Domestically, if you fly out with one airline and return with a different one, you can create a lot of savings."
Other search engines will also show one-way ticketing results for savings. Skyscanner, for example, calls them mash-ups. In most cases, fliers must click out of the search engines and into booking ones - either an online travel agency or the airline itself - and make the two bookings in quick succession to ensure the deal doesn't disappear.
Resident fares
Sometimes a ticket purchased from within a foreign country costs less than the same airfare in the United States. That's because airlines price their flights based on competitive factors in local markets, including the wealth of consumers and their willingness to fly.
Airline search engines can tell where you reside based on your computer's internet Protocol or IP address. Users can mask that address by subscribing to a VPN or Virtual Private Network, which allows you to search anonymously (plans at NordVPN, one provider, start at $2.99 a month). Some travel strategists believe this works.
From my own experiment comparing search results for international flights using a VPN and an internet address in Chicago, I got mixed results.
Using the VPN, Air China asked me to identify my country and language, and then gave me the same $739 search result for a flight between San Francisco and Beijing that I found when using my office computer.
However, when I searched for internal flights in a foreign country - flights between Buenos Aires, for example, and Bariloche in Argentina - I found the same itinerary for $302 on my office computer in Chicago versus $249 (after converting from pesos) using the VPN (in this instance, one would want to buy any foreign ticket using a credit card without exchange fees).
VPNs are legal in the United States. Though often associated with dark uses of the web, they can also protect you when using free public Wi-Fi.
An easier approach may be to use a foreign travel agent. Tierra Hotels, which operates lodges in Chile's Atacama Desert, Patagonia and Lakes regions, often refers North American guests to the Santiago-based travel agency Cocha for flights from the capital to its properties.
Cocha recently found round-trip tickets between Santiago and Punta Arenas in Patagonia for $262 versus results I received searching Latam Airlines from my office in Chicago at $324.
Open-jaw tickets
Open-jaw tickets, often called multi-stop bookings on airline sites, are for round-trip flights that arrive at one destination and leave from another. For example, you may wish to fly from New York to London,then take the Eurostar train to continental Europe and later fly back home from Paris.
Open jaws can save you money, especially on international itineraries as one-way flights outside the United States are often costly. Most airlines and search engines offer multi-stop search options, making the practice easy.
Better yet, use open-jaw fares to expand your airport searches to get more results. While both are London airports, flying into Heathrow and back from Gatwick, for example, is technically an open-jaw booking.
To ensure you get results from all possible combinations, search using a generic destination like London or an option for any airport in the area rather than a specific airport, bearing in mind that budget airlines often use secondary airports.
A recent search for flights between London and Paris, cities with multiple airports, turned up a round-trip fare of $182 on British Airways, flying from London City Airport to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and returning to Heathrow, versus $197 on an Air France flight between Heathrow and Charles de Gaulle.
One of the cheapest fares was on the low-cost carrier easyjet: $170 round trip, from Charles de Gaulle to Heathrow, and back to Paris from London Southend Airport.

Can the U.S. Afford Democrats' Bold Promises? Why One Economist Says Yes; Stephanie Kelton is among the most vocal proponents of 'modern monetary theory,' which argues U.S. has room to run up deficits

Texto completo: As Democrats on Capitol Hill and the campaign trail present an array of ambitious and expensive policy proposals, from a Green New Deal to Medicare for All , the question they face most often is, "How will the government pay for it?"
The answer, increasingly, comes from a professor at Stony Brook University on Long Island, Stephanie Kelton, who has become the public face of an unorthodox strain of economics called modern monetary theory. It is pitting mainstream economists and deficit hawks against left-wing progressives.
Ms. Kelton argues the government doesn't need to worry so much about how much it borrows to pay for spending programs. Unlike a household or business, it can never run out of money. The government can always print money to pay for debts. The constraint, according to MMT, isn't the deficit, but whether the borrowing and spending spurs inflation and disrupts economic activity.
With inflation and interest rates now very low, the government has plenty of room to borrow and spend more, MMT advocates say. The notion has gained traction among Democratic presidential hopefuls, helping to fuel ambitious policy proposals.
"If you were being responsible, you'd want to approve new spending not because you can demonstrate that it won't add to the deficit, but because you can demonstrate that it won't create dislocation, inflationary pressure—real problems in the economy," Ms. Kelton said in an interview.
The theory, which Ms. Kelton helped establish in the late 1990s, has gotten approving nods from Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the Democratic presidential contender whom she advised in 2016, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.).
The rise of MMT comes as mainstream economists are reconsidering the danger of deficits . Former International Monetary Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard, former Council of Economic Advisers chairman Jason Furman and Harvard University economics professor Kenneth Rogoff have all said recently the U.S. appears to have more room to borrow than they once thought.
Republicans, too, have backed away from past opposition to large deficits. With Republicans in control of the White House and Congress in 2017 and 2018, deficits marched toward $1 trillion, in part because of tax cuts and increased military spending.
The deficit totaled 4.5% of economic output last year, compared with an average of 2.9% over the previous 50 years. Debt-to-GDP has more than doubled, from 35% at the end of 2007 to 78% by the end of 2018, and is on track to hit 93% by 2029.
"MMT has been standing with its feet in the same spot for decades," Ms. Kelton said. "The mainstream economists keep inching, inching, a little bit closer. It's something we've been watching for a very long time."
Ms. Kelton is everywhere these days—on cable television and public radio, penning opinion columns and keynoting financial industry conferences. She has a book on MMT being released in April 2020.
More Coverage
* For Over 20 Years, Kelton Has Advocated for Theory
* U.S. Budget Deficit Grew 39% in First Five Months of Fiscal 2019
* Capital Journal: Worrying About Deficits Falls Out of Style
* Senate Democrats Evade GOP Attempt to Expose Rifts Over 'Green New Deal'
* Medicare for All Loses Momentum Among Democrats
Still, many mainstream economists on the left and right say MMT takes the idea of deficit spending too far.
In a survey by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business of 38 mainstream academic economists, 88% disagreed or strongly disagreed that countries that borrow in their own currency don't need to worry about deficits.
The critics say MMT will lead to the very outcome Ms. Kelton and other proponents says it is designed to avoid: surging inflation and interest rates. They also say rising government spending will crowd out more productive private investment.
"How much more debt can you have on the U.S. balance sheet and not have global financial markets react? I don't know the answer to that," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a right-leaning think tank, and former Congressional Budget Office director. "I see no reason to run the experiment, 'When do we have a crisis?' Let's just not."
Mainstream economists say the government must tax businesses and households to pay for spending. Whatever it doesn't raise through taxes it borrows by issuing bonds.
MMT rejects this as backward. Spending isn't constrained by the government's ability to raise taxes or borrow, because the government can always create more money to fund itself. The real constraint on spending is the ability of the economy to absorb new spending without creating shortages and inflation.
In this worldview, fiscal and monetary policy are more tightly intertwined than in conventional economics. The central bank could accept IOUs from the Treasury to fund new spending—a step it can't necessarily take under current law—and inflation can be tamed by fiscal policy makers by raising taxes, cutting spending or imposing new regulations. Critics say it is politically impractical and the central bank is best left to manage inflation independently, as it is called on to do in all advanced economies today.
Some of Ms. Kelton's toughest criticism has come from the left. Some say more government spending is justified now because interest rates are low and would help facilitate it, but they see MMT as the wrong framework for justifying such action.
Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a Democrat, in a Foreign Affairs article panned MMT as a "poor guide to policy in normal economic times." When Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner in economics and a liberal columnist for the New York Times, tweeted last month, "Still don't see what we get out of it," referring to MMT, Ms. Kelton shot back , "How about a superior analytic framework and better predictive record (20+ years running) than any other macro approach."
She continues to advise the senator on a plan for a federal jobs guarantee, though she hasn't formally joined any 2020 presidential campaign.
"I don't feel like just because we're staring down trillion-dollar deficits we're out of room and Congress can't be considering ambitious spending," she said, predicting the debt-to-GDP ratio could easily reach 150% without causing problems for the economy.

Think you'll make millions on Lyft's IPO? Sorry, but 'It’s Probably Overpriced'

Texto completo: Ride-sharing giant Lyft had its initial public offering (IPO) last week. Archrival Uber and other big-name, billion-dollar techies should follow soon. Investors see big bucks: They'll buy an IPO and ride the next Amazon to unfathomed heights.
In the 1980s, that dream meant getting in on the ground floor of the next Apple. Now it’s the next Google or Facebook.
My advice: Don’t waste your time – or money.
In my 1987 book, "The Wall Street Waltz," I detailed why IPO really means "It’s Probably Overpriced. "
Thirty-two years and one huge dot-com crash later, many missed the memo. Folks only remember the super winners like Apple and Intel. They forget the flame-outs like Pets. com, Webvan and, well, the majority. Average all IPOs, and returns are sad. Early booms usually bust.
Few winners
University of Florida professor Jay Ritter studied IPOs launching from 1980 through 2017. The facts? After the initial pop, IPOs trailed similarly sized peers by an average 3. 3 percent a year over their first five years. As with most speculative investments, a few winners mask legions of laggards.
IPOs often rise out of the gate, sometimes hugely. Thank investment bankers for that. Those handling the IPO get big bucks for hyping the sale and attracting buyers. So they whip up a mindless frenzy. The excitement and lure of magic returns suck in otherwise rational folks. The party can last days, even weeks, as stories of quick gains attract suckers who hate missing out. But when it stops, the stocks often get clobbered. Even long-term winners like Apple and Facebook spent time in the wilderness after debuting.
Looking for a home? Where the most affordable housing market, least expensive homes are in each state
The downside of Social Security: Social Security is a lifesaver but far from perfect. Here are 3 rules we hate
One problem: The companies’ and buyers’ incentives aren’t aligned. An IPO has two main purposes: raising money and giving early backers a big payday. That requires a high price – too high, usually, to be priced well for buyers. Even when the price does pop, by the time retail investors can buy, the new stock has typically changed hands several times, eating up much of your potential gain. The early birds got the worm.
No stock bubble
That IPOs over-price is actually good news for investors now. It is abnormal, relative to history, to have so many huge companies that haven’t "IPOed" yet. How long have we heard Lyft, Uber and Airbnb IPO chatter? Years! That’s bullish for stocks overall. That the entire group of them in recent years didn't find fancy pricing on public markets tells you stocks weren’t overvalued. No bubble here.
The presumed 2019 IPO rush isn’t reason to sell, though. Yes, IPOs often frenzy near market peaks. But when quality firms with strong sales and business plans first start going public in numbers, it signals a healthy latter-stage bull market. The dangerous time is when investment bankers are pushing slop with scant sales or hopes of ready profits. The 1990s demonstrated this.
A new way to avoid robocalls: Verizon adds free 'Call Filter' feature in bid to fight robocalls
How to save $360 bucks: How to cut the cord and save around $360 a year
According to Ritter, IPO issuance peaked in 1996, with 677 new offerings. By 2000, when stocks peaked, there were only 380 IPOs. The difference? Those mid-1990s IPOs were higher-quality firms, overall and on average. The few big successes among them drove a mania for more IPOs, leading to the late-decade slop crop, when new issues blew their cash more often than Austin Powers said, “Groovy baby. ”
Today’s impending IPOs aren’t so scary, with positive cash flows and long-term business plans. Moreover, investors aren’t blinded by euphoria. There is more than abundant skepticism now – about everything.
But instead of gambling on IPOs, just own stocks. Benefit from the bull market that inspires IPOs. Be an investor, not a speculator.

Texto completo: ORYOL, Russia
After 19 months in a Russian jail awaiting trial for "extremism," Dennis O. Christensen, a Jehovah's Witness from Denmark detained for his faith, received an unexpected lift from President Vladimir V. Putin at the end of last year.
The president in December declared that prosecuting people for their religious affiliations was "total nonsense" and had to stop.But instead of curbing a campaign across Russia against Jehovah's Witnesses, Mr. Putin's remark has been followed by more arrests; a conviction and six-year prison sentence for Mr. Christensen; and, in a new low, reports late last month of the torture of believers detained in Siberia.
The gulf between what Mr. Putin says and what happens in Russia raises a fundamental question about the nature of his rule after more than 18 years at the pinnacle of an authoritarian system: Is Mr. Putin really the omnipotent leader whom his critics attack and his own propagandists promote? Or does he sit atop a state that is, in fact, shockingly ramshackle, a system driven more by the capricious and often venal calculations of competing bureaucracies and interest groups than by Kremlin diktats?
The belief, widespread among critics of President Donald Trump, that Russia propelled him to the White House by colluding with his campaign, is premised in part on the first view of Mr. Putin's capacities and reach. The Mueller report, when a more complete version is released to the public, may help Americans better understand how Russia does or doesn't work in reality.
But to some of Mr. Putin's fellow citizens, the Russian president's grip already looks less firm than often imagined.
Ekaterina Schulmann is a political scientist in Moscow and a member of Mr. Putin's Council for Civil Society and Human Rights who challenged the president over the persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses at the December meeting in the Kremlin. She said Mr. Putin's grip on the country had been vastly exaggerated by both supporters and opponents.
"This is not a personally run empire but a huge and difficult-to-manage bureaucratic machine with its own internal rules and principles," she said. "It happens time and again that the president says something, and then nothing or the opposite happens."
A plethora of bureaucratic and political forces both reinforce and sap the president's power: the security services, the Russian Orthodox Church, billionaire oligarchs, local officials and others, each with its own sometimes competing and sometimes overlapping interests. Mr. Putin has to manage them as best he can, but he doesn't control everything they each do.
One analyst is even more blunt about Mr. Putin and the state he presides over. "The system is dysfunctional," said Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow and now an associate fellow at Chatham House, a research organization in London. "No one man could possibly control everything."
To most Westerners, accustomed to seeing Mr. Putin strut in front of TV cameras and project an aura of command, such statements can sound incredible. It is true that in high-prestige matters of state, like hosting the Olympic Games or the World Cup or building a bridge to Crimea, Mr. Putin has made the system obey. The same is true for matters that ensure his grip on power, like cracking down on disobedient oligarchs and political opponents.And after he came to power at the end of 1999, he effectively curbed the disorder and infighting that under his often-drunk predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, left Russia barely functioning.
But many projects he has backed, such as a critical bridge over the Amur River between Russia and China and an undertaking to build a highway between Moscow and St. Petersburg, have stalled.
There are limits to just how much time and political capital Mr. Putin can invest in prodding corrupt or incompetent officials and contractors to do as they are told.

Texto completo: Damon Young, writer, urban raconteur and blogger extraordinaire is having a moment.
The author of the recently released "What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Blacker: A Memoir in Essays," has garnered the kind of excitement in recent months that usually is reserved for celebrated writers with a well-established track record - not newbies touring their first book.
In the past week, Mr. Young has been feted with two glowing NPR profiles, flattering pieces in Mother Jones and The New York Times, gushing reviews in The Washington Post and the Minneapolis Star-Tribune and and an excerpt from his book in GQ.
In the past month, cover stories and reviews of the book have appeared in every Pittsburgh publication of note. If you're on Facebook, then chances are good that multiple stories about the 40-year-old North Sider already have landed in your news feed in recent months.
Mr. Young has begun a 14-city book tour that will make a stop Wednesday in Pittsburgh at Carnegie Lecture Hall in Oakland. This already has created a sense of cognitive dissonance for a black Pittsburgher who has experienced the rumbling stomach of chronic underemployment for too long to take his newfound success for granted.
If there has ever been a comparable rollout for a local writer with ambitions to barnstorm the national consciousness, it isn't coming to mind.
From John Edgar Wideman and Annie Dillard to Michael Chabon and Jan Beatty, Pittsburgh has produced many acclaimed writers over the decades who have generated large followings of their own along with national good will. Mr. Young has traveled a different path than his literary progenitors. Long before he inked a two-book deal with Harper/Ecco, Mr. Young already had generated a massive following as the co-founder of the much-read blog Very Smart Brothas.
For a decade at V.S.B, Mr. Young has cultivated a voice that is equal parts acerbic, hilarious, irreverent, emotionally introspective, morally indignant and very much of the moment.
Mr. Young's posts on the cultural and political issues of the day routinely prompted thousands of earnest and sometimes equally hilarious responses from black millennials and Gen Xers delighted to find such clever echoes of their own anxieties, hopes and dreams refracted through a voice that is both sophisticated and streetwise.
Mr. Young and the blog's co-founder, the Washington, D.C.-based essayist Panama Jackson, had "discovered" a deeply passionate readership that had either never been seriously courted, or had never bothered to engage with a cultural opinion blog in such numbers before.
The daily and weekly traffic to VSB soon attracted the attention of Univision, which gave Mr. Young and Mr. Jackson an offer they couldn't refuse. The company, which was seeking to make inroads among young African-American readers and cultural influencers, bought V.S.B in 2017 and bundled it with The Root, another recent acquisition, where it continues to attract readers by the hundreds of thousands every week.
Mr. Young finally had the financial freedom he craved to be a full-time writer without having to worry about hustling freelance gigs with local publications or national magazines to keep the lights on. It also gave the surprisingly introverted writer enough emotional space to work on the book that, if early reviews are any indication, will only enhance his reputation as the voice of a new kind of black literati that is comfortable critiquing both white supremacy and the fading traces of toxic masculinity in his own life.
During an interview at the Ace Hotel in East Liberty, it was clear that Mr. Young's recent acclaim hasn't erased his memory of growing up poor in Penn Hills, or his struggle to carve out a literary life in a city that has often treated blackness as inherently suspicious and undesirable.
The 6-foot-1 author, husband and father of two laughs easily, yet comes across as reserved to folks meeting him for the first time. That's because he's always assessing and weighing situations presented to him. His low voice resonates with the authority of someone who has seen and experienced more than most, but isn't necessarily inclined to whine about it. His excruciating thoughtfulness can come across as shyness to the uninitiated.
Although he dresses casually, as though expecting to play an impromptu pickup game at the nearest basketball court, the former Wilkinsburg school teacher still looks vaguely professorial with a face framed by stylish glasses and a full, slightly graying beard. Damon Young's trademark scowl has become iconic, but the man himself remains exceptionally approachable.
The following is an excerpt from a longer interview.
People have been gushing over your work for years, so that's not new. What's new about this moment you find yourself in, Damon?
There's definitely a newness to it because, whatever acclaim or praise that came my way before was based on my blogging. It was very quick, very voicy, very aggressive, very snarky, irreverent takes on culture and politics. It was sometimes satirical, sometimes more sober. They were short bursts and people expressed an appreciation for [that]. This book is a slow burn. It's almost the difference between a fast, casual meal and a Thanksgiving turkey you cook for eight hours, but instead of eight hours it took two years [to marinate].
This is a very self-aware book with deeply personal insights. How much wrestling with yourself did you have to do to write so intimately about your own state of mind?
Writing a memoir requires you to re-remember and interrogate, examine and deconstruct thoughts and feelings that have been settled for years. So I'm thinking about things that happened decades ago with a 40-year-old's perspective. I'm looking at things that a younger me looked at and might've thought he was a victim, but maybe he was a villain.
If I'm going to write a memoir, it has to be naked. It has to be bare. This isn't "Black Panther." This isn't a superhero origin story. I'm a very human person who went through some very human things
Those things that come when you're naked, those vulnerabilities, those anxieties - those are universal. So even if my references are very specific and esoteric, if I wanted to create a book that people are able to feel, then I had to cut myself open for it.
Is this memoir the way you envisioned it when the idea first came to you?
[Hesitates] Hmmm, yeah, more or less, but it definitely had a different title.
What was the original title?
"[N-word] Neurosis"
[We both laugh]
As you can imagine, that posed a bit of a problem. My editor loved it, the publisher loved it, my agent loved it, but once they started reaching out to people at Barnes & Noble, Amazon, it was a problem - a placement problem. They all said, "We can carry the book, but we don't know if we can put it on the front table at the entrance to the store."
Was that disappointing?
It was initially, but I think we finally settled on a much better title.
Damon Young and this critic continue the conversation on April 3 on stage at the Carnegie Lecture Hall. Tickets are sold-out.

How many subscriptions is too many?

From Netflix, Spotify and Amazon Prime to Blue Apron, Birchbox and beer of the month, your debit or credit card statements are likely littered with subscriptions that are costing you dearly.
Not that all subscriptions are bad.
You might be happy to pay a monthly fee to work out at the gym or type in Microsoft Office 365. But maybe the benefits of subscribing to credit monitoring or razors by mail were, uh, more fleeting.
Recurring charges can be insidious, some eating away at your wealth when you don't value the subscription anymore. Three $30-per-month subscriptions don't sound like much until you realize they total nearly $1,100 per year.
Inertia leads to a dozen free trials morphing into mainstays on your Mastercard. (Maybe not much longer, though. Mastercard has said it will require merchants to get your approval to proceed with charges after a free trial ends, although it applies only to physical-product subscriptions, like home-delivered sampler boxes .)
“The situation with subscriptions could end up being death by a thousand cuts when it comes to your budget,” says Bruce McClary, spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.
Adding to the problem are so-called gray charges, deceptive and unwanted credit and debit card charges that stem from misleading sales and billing practices. They total more than $14 billion a year among U.S. cardholders, or $215 each, per a 2013 study by industry research firm Aite Group.
Here's how to spring-clean recurring charges so you can spend on things that matter to you more.
Subscription audit. Job No. 1 is to identify recurring charges. Scan recent payment statements, including credit cards, debit cards or online accounts, like PayPal. Go back 12 months to catch auto-renew annual subscriptions.
Don't ignore the analog world: lawn mowing, home security monitoring, pest-control service and memberships in social and professional organizations. Some credit card issuers, like Citi, identify recurring charges in your online account.
Multiply by 12. A frog in a stovetop pot of water will complacently boil to death if you raise the temperature slowly, the saying goes. Accumulating monthly subscriptions is similar.
To feel the full impact, multiply monthly charges by 12 to get an annualized idea of what you're spending. If you see yourself keeping the subscription five years, do that math too. Then, a seemingly insignificant $30-per-month expense becomes $1,800.
“On the surface, subscription costs may seem minimal, but when you add them up it can really pinch your monthly budget,” says Paul Golden, spokesman for the National Endowment for Financial Education. “If you're putting subscriptions on your credit card, is that hindering your ability to pay off your balance each month? If so, this is a red flag.”
Reassess value. Do you use and value the subscription? A gym membership is perhaps the best example of a noble subscription gone wrong – when you quit going but continue paying.
Ask yourself if a subscription saves you money or time. Has it lived up to its promise? Does a delivered subscription box bring you joy or guilt?
“It's a good idea to do a subscription evaluation on a regular basis – perhaps a couple of times a year,” Golden says.
Is it redundant? If you have cable or satellite TV, plus Netflix, YouTube TV and Amazon Prime Video, you have overlap. “There are so many redundancies across those platforms that you're more or less paying for the same service over and over again,” McClary says.
The same assessment goes for streaming music services, cloud storage and phone services. Are you hanging on to a landline for no reason?
Opt to share. Can you legitimately share a subscription? “Some of these subscriptions offer a buddy pass,” McClary notes. YouTube TV allows family groups to share subscriptions, and certain New York Times subscriptions come with a bonus subscription to share.
Some families choose to group their wireless phones on a single plan to lower costs.
Don't forget about freebies at your local public library, which can substitute for subscriptions: digital access to books, audiobooks, movies, music and magazines.
Downgrade. Downgrading or subscribing seasonally can work, too. Can you downgrade from the premium to free version of software or website access? Are you getting value from your credit card's annual fee?
You can probably downgrade to a fee-free card with the same issuer and keep your long credit history.
Cancel. Liberally pause or cancel services. You can always restart and re-subscribe later. You might even receive a discount offer to return.

Texto completo: Before dawn on April 4, 1994, Abigail Alling and Mark Van Thillo slipped across the foothills of Arizona's Santa Catalina Mountains. They made their way to a looming monument of geodesic domes and pyramids known as Biosphere 2. The three-acre complex contained a miniature rain forest, a mangrove, a desert and a coral reef -- along with seven people who had been sealed inside for a month.
Ms. Alling and Mr. Van Thillo had recently emerged from a two-year stay in Biosphere 2. Later, after they were arrested, they told reporters that they feared for the safety of the people inside. They were determined to bring the mission to an end.
They pulled open five of Biosphere 2's doors and broke their seals. As outdoor air rushed in, they made their way to the ventilation system, where they smashed some glass panels.
That break-in effectively marked the end of one of the strangest experiments in the history of science. No one had ever built a sealed ecological world as big as Biosphere 2, and no one had ever survived so long inside one. The project would later be dismissed as a folly and a waste of effort. And yet, 25 years on, it's an experiment worth rediscovering. Biosphere 2 might have some lessons to offer about managing Biosphere 1 -- our planet.
The idea for Biosphere 2 emerged on a New Mexico ranch in the early 1970s. The residents of Synergia Ranch -- who split their time between experimental theater, farming and furniture-making -- saw themselves as picking up the pieces from the wreckage of civilization. "Western civilization isn't simply dying," the co-founder, John Allen, once said. "It's dead. We are probing into its ruins to take whatever is useful for the building of the new civilization to replace it."
They began dreaming of merging ecology and technology into a new form. They gained the support of Ed Bass, the scion of a wealthy Texas family who became chairman of a company called Space Biospheres Ventures. In 1984, the company announced it was going to build an airtight structure inside of which ecosystems would thrive, supplying a group of people with air to breathe, water to drink and food to eat.
As Biosphere 2 took shape in the desert, it racked up headlines ("Desert Dreamers Build a Man-Made World" reported this newspaper). In an interview with Discover magazine, Carl Hodges, a University of Arizona scientist, predicted it might turn out to be "the most significant scientific project of all time." The ABC News program "Prime Time Live" suggested that it might "save the world."
The project, as fanciful as it sounded, had deep roots. Scientists coined the word "biosphere" in the 1800s, and in 1926, the Russian scientist Vladimir Vernadsky published a book dedicated to the concept. To Vernadsky, the biosphere was the self-sustaining ecological web of life that formed a skin on the planet.

It was a powerful image, one that inspired later ecologists to create small glass globes full of water, algae and little invertebrates. Soviet scientists, investigating ways to keep cosmonauts alive in space, lived for up to six months in experimental chambers where they breathed oxygen from algae and ate hydroponic crops.
Biosphere 2 would be a gigantic leap beyond those creations. Its plans called for 3,800 species of plants and animals, including hummingbirds and lemur-like primates called bush babies. Wastewater would get purified as it was pumped through soil, where microbes would remove contaminants.
The idea of building a world -- one free of pollution and other woes of the late-20th-century Earth -- proved irresistible. The night before the mission began, Space Biospheres Ventures hosted a dance party for 2,000 people, including Woody Harrelson and Timothy Leary. On the morning of Sept. 26, 1991, eight Biospherians, Ms. Alling and Mr. Van Thillo among them, paraded in front of the press wearing blue jumpsuits that looked like surplus costumes from "Star Trek VI." After the airlock was shut, they waved to the cameras from behind the glass.
It was a smart media strategy for a company planning on making money on their science. Tourists were coming by the thousands to walk the perimeter of Biosphere 2. The inventions that went into its creations could lead to lucrative patents for water purifiers and data management systems. Mr. Allen and his team envisioned biospheres built to order. By 1995, they hoped to put one in orbit, and perhaps eventually build biospheres on the moon and Mars.
Back on Earth, however, the news coming out of Biosphere 2 was decidedly less cosmic. Two weeks into the mission, a Biospherian named Jane Poynter sliced off the tip of her finger in a rice-threshing machine. The mission's doctor, Roy Walford, reattached it, but he later decided she needed to go to a hospital for more surgery.
A few hours later, Ms. Poynter went back inside. She brought with her a duffel bag supplied by Biosphere 2's management, packed with supplies such as computer parts and color film. Reporters would learn of that surreptitious delivery only months later.
Eventually they'd learn that staff members made many more deliveries to Biosphere 2, provisioning it with seeds, vitamins, mouse traps and other supplies twice a month. An ex-employee revealed that engineers had installed a carbon dioxide scrubber so that Biosphere 2's atmosphere could be artificially managed.
It soon became clear that raising food in Biosphere 2 was a major challenge. The weather was cloudy for the first few months of the mission, stunting the growth of crops. The Biospherians had to break into a three-month supply of food that had been secretly stored away before the doors had closed.
Then Biosphere 2 began to lose oxygen because the soil had spawned an explosion of oxygen-gulping bacteria. The crew felt as if they were living at 14,000 feet. A truckload of liquid oxygen finally saved them; as soon as the gas began spraying into Biosphere 2, they began racing around in joy.
Meanwhile, the ecosystem was in flux. The hummingbirds and honeybees died, leaving the crops unpollinated. Nematode worms and broad mites attacked the crops. Cockroaches reigned.
Ten months into the mission, the project's advisory board of experts delivered a blistering report criticizing its ill-defined goals and the crew's lack of scientific expertise. Things got so fractious that the board quit en masse.
And then Steve Bannon showed up.
In 1993, Mr. Bannon was a long way from becoming a nationalist celebrity or presidential adviser. At the time he was a Beverly Hills-based investment banker specializing in takeovers. Mr. Bass tapped Mr. Bannon to overhaul Space Biosphere Ventures, which was hemorrhaging money. According to Mr. Bannon, Biosphere 2 would run a deficit of $ 16 million to $ 20 million in 1993 alone.
By the time the first Biosphere 2 crew emerged, Mr. Bannon had decided Mr. Allen and the rest of the leadership would have to go. They were fired in April 1994, shortly after the second mission had begun. That purge is what spurred Ms. Alling and Mr. Van Thillo to break into Biosphere 2.
After they were arrested, Ms. Alling tearfully told the press that they had been worried for the safety of the new crew. If Biosphere 2's atmosphere wasn't properly tended, she implied, they might die. Ms. Alling cited the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, caused by negligent management. "I take this extremely serious," she said.
There was an outbreak of lawsuits, followed by many quiet settlements. The second team of Biospherians tried to continue the mission, but it was cut short five months later. Mr. Bannon brokered a deal with Columbia University to take over the running of Biosphere 2.
The dreams of biospheres on Mars vanished. Humans would no longer be bottled up to see if they could survive. Instead, scientists set up experiments to address narrower, more focused questions, such as how coral reefs are affected by high levels of carbon dioxide. Columbia ran Biosphere 2 until 2003, and eventually the University of Arizona took over. In 2011, Mr. Bass officially donated Biosphere 2 to the university, along with $ 20 million to support its research. Biosphere 2 still stands today, and science is still going on inside its walls. But there are no more bush babies or people in jumpsuits.
Many scientists looked back at the original Biosphere 2 as a colossal failure. "In short, the Biosphere 2 experiment failed to generate sufficient breathable air, drinkable water and adequate food for just eight humans, despite an expenditure of $ 200 million," the ecologist Rebecca Stewart and her colleagues declared.
The scientists Joel Cohen and David Tilman wrote, "No one yet knows how to engineer systems that provide humans with the life-supporting services that natural ecosystems produce for free."
But it would be a mistake to dismiss Biosphere 2 out of hand. For two years, eight people grew papayas, beets, bananas, rice and a host of other crops in there. Except for a sliced finger, their health remained good. The water they drank didn't poison them. Some species went extinct, but the ecosystems endured. Biosphere 2 did not turn to slime.
As a piece of scientific research, Biosphere 2 had its problems. Countless things were happening all at once inside its walls, making it hard to pinpoint causes and effects. And without any other biospheres to compare it to, there was no way to distinguish random flukes from significant patterns. The University of Arizona scientist Bob Fry summed it up well in a newspaper interview: "It's an experiment, but only in the sense that life is an experiment."
It's true that there was only one Biosphere 2, but, then again, there is also only one Earth. And yet scientists have managed to learn a lot by carefully observing our single planet. "Descriptive work underlies nearly everything we know about global change ecology," the ecologist William Schlesinger recently wrote in the journal Bioscience. The history of what happened in Biosphere 2, he concluded, "is too valuable to lose."
And yet much of that history seems to be lost already. Thousands of sensors were installed throughout Biosphere 2 to harvest data, but in his recent book, "Pushing Our Limits," the Biospherian Mark Nelson says that only a small fraction of that data have been analyzed and published. When Dr. Nelson asked the University of Arizona about the rest, he was told the university didn't have it. "It's shameful to simply accept that these important data are gone," he wrote.
When asked about Dr. Nelson's assertion, John Adams, the current deputy director of Biosphere 2, replied that "the University of Arizona was not transferred any historical data archives." Have they vanished, like one of Aristotle's lost books?
In the 25 years since Ms. Alling and Mr. Van Thillo broke into Biosphere 2, our species has profoundly altered Biosphere 1. In 1994, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 358 parts per million. Now it's over 410 -- a level not seen for at least the last three million years.
Scientists understand some of the effects of such a jolt. The planet is getting hotter, for one thing. But carbon dioxide can have many other effects, such as making the ocean more acidic, and there could be more changes coming that we can't begin to comprehend. Perhaps, in the records of an extravagant experiment in Arizona, there are clues waiting for us to find.

REPUBLICANS VS. HEALTH CARE THEY'VE GONE BEYOND CYNICISM TO PATHOLOGY

Texto completo: Of all the political issues that divide us, health care is the one with the greatest impact on ordinary Americans' lives. If Democrats hadn't managed to pass the Affordable Care Act, around 20 million fewer Americans would have health insurance than currently do. If Republican-controlled states hadn't refused to expand Medicaid and generally done as little as possible to support the act, another 7 million or 8 million people might have coverage.
You obviously know where I stand on this political divide. But I'm starting to believe that I misjudged Republican motives.
You see, I thought their behavior was cynical and strategic: They opposed Obamacare because they thought there was political mileage in scaring people about change, and also in denying President Barack Obama any successes. Oh, and their donors really hated the taxes on the rich that pay for the ACA's subsidies. And right up through 2016 they could hope to convince voters that they had a secret plan for something much better than Obamacare.
Indeed, all of these things surely played a role in GOP health care strategy. But at this point they've clearly lost the political argument. In 2017, Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare made it clear to everyone that their party didn't have any better ideas, and never did; everything they proposed would have devastated the lives of millions.
Then health care became the top issue in the 2018 midterms, and voters who considered it the most important issue went Democratic by a three to one margin.
So you might have expected Republicans to cut their losses. Maybe Mr. Trump could have done what he did with NAFTA: keep Obamacare basically intact, but make a few minor changes, give it a new name - the Yuge Maga Care Awesomeness, or something - and claim that it was totally different and better.
But no. Most Republican-controlled states are still refusing to expand Medicaid, even though Washington would bear the vast majority of the costs. Utah held a direct referendum on Medicaid expansion, which passed easily - so the will of the voters was clear, even in a very conservative state. Yet GOP legislators are blocking the expansion anyway.
And now the Trump administration, having failed to repeal the ACA when Republicans controlled Congress, is suing to have the whole thing declared unconstitutional in court - because what could be a better way to kick off the 2020 campaign than taking insurance away from 20 million Americans?
As an aside, this latest Trump move completes his utter betrayal of the people who put him in office. Consider a place like West Virginia, where a lot of people gained health insurance thanks to Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. The state went overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump anyway, because he promised not to cut health care and also promised to bring back those good jobs in coal.
What's happened in West Virginia? Coal jobs added: 1,991, according to Charleston TV station WSAZ, which has been tracking them. People who will lose their health insurance if the Trump lawsuit prevails: $140,000, according to Kaiser Family Foundations.
The point is that it's no longer possible to see any of this as part of a clever political strategy, even a nefariously cynical one. It has entered the realm of pathology. It's now clear that Republicans just have a deep, unreasoning hatred of the idea that government policy may help some people get health care coverage.
I don't fully get it. Maybe it's anger at the thought of anyone getting something they didn't earn themselves, most of them having come from families with means. Maybe it's a sense that a lot of gratuitous suffering is or should be part of the human condition, or God's plan, or something. I try to understand how others think, but in this case I really do find it hard.
Whatever the reason, the fact is that whatever they may claim, today's Republicans hate the idea of poor and working-class Americans getting the health care coverage they need.

Poll says parents hinder children's life skills

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become an adults. We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of children ages 18 to 28.
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not rich — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor's appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn't sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child's grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid," Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's a difficult habit for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you're doing it in high school, you can't stop at college," she said. "If you're doing it in college, you can't stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life."
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own life lives. "You can't just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.
The poll looked at 1,508 people ages 18 to 28 and 1,136 parents of people that age. The survey was conducted between Jan. 29 to Feb. 3.

Texto completo: 7. Simone Rocha
First spring show: 2012
Notable for: A schoolgirl sensibility; clever use of lace; Perspex brogues
Critical reaction: "This was as polished a performance as we could expect from the very best of London Fashion Week."
-- Alexander Fury, SHOWstudio.com
What the designer says now: "The collection was shown in an old townhouse, which we later found out was actually a brothel with a large Jacuzzi in the crypt below the house. I feel proud of the fabrications which are still very signature to me today -- lace, tulle, tailoring, transparency. I also like how lots of the looks were very short. I still love the plastic pieces with real lace trapped inside I found in markets. I would change very little. It was right for me at the time and place."
Joseph Altuzarra
First spring show: 2010
Notable for: '70s suede; Swiss dots; slouchy sex appeal
Critical reaction: "Jolt or not, it was a fascinating show."
-- Cathy Horyn, The New York Times
What the designer says now: "It's still one of my favorite collections I've done. It really set the tone for what the Altuzarra woman wears in the spring: she's feminine, undone, floaty and sexy. I don't think I would change a thing! It was the first time I had worked with leather and it was a very steep learning curve, but it did start my love affair with the material. The zipper on the finale gown on Natasha Poly broke a minute before she was supposed to go out on the runway -- we had to very quickly take the dress off and sew her into [it]!"
Thom Browne
First spring show: 2012
Notable for: Lobster claws; extreme proportions; a bird-woman in a cage
Critical reaction: "Totally weird, amusing, and irritating in equal measure."
-- WWD
What the designer says now: "I call it 'The Flapper Show' because it was somewhat '20s-feeling but not literally referencing the era. You saw in the shapes how confident and secure these girls were. It's horrible for me to say, but I think [this collection] was so underrated. There are so many interesting ideas that I still go back and pull from. I have grown and I have evolved, but one thing that hasn't changed is how I want people to see [my shows]. I always knew that I wanted people to have a true experience."
Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler
First spring show: 2004
Notable for: Youthful shorts; nautical flair; splitting the critics
Critical reaction: "There were some great pieces . . . But in the main, it was separates in search of a collection."
-- Cathy Horyn, The New York Times
What the designers say: now "We'd just graduated from college and started our collection and we were still experimenting. Vogue called it one of the top 10 collections [of the season]. But Cathy Horyn, who has since become a friend, tore it apart. It was like a dagger through the heart, but she was totally right and we definitely kept [her feedback] in our heads for a couple of seasons," recalled Jack McCollough, who designs Proenza Schouler with Lazaro Hernandez, adding that their design process has evolved significantly.
Victoria Beckham
First spring show: 2009
Notable for: Sleek silhouettes; proving that a celebrity can tailor
Critical reaction: "The woman formerly known as Posh Spice has launched a dress collection, and, believe it or not, it's one of the hottest things going in New York this week."
-- Nicole Phelps, Style.com
What the designer says now: "I still love that first spring collection . . . I was creating pieces that I wanted in my own wardrobe, hoping that others would also want them in theirs. It was made up of dresses that I had worked really hard to make perfect, with amazing corsetry and careful boning. We didn't have a fit model, so I did what I needed to do and stripped down to my underwear to try on these amazing pieces."

8. Wave the White Flag
Maison Margiela continues its obsession with white with this pallid, padded cotton scarf -- part of MM6, its lower-priced line. Non-color figures prominently in the Margiela back story from the white of its first runway surface to the staff's blousons blanches. White, explains the house (which speaks as an anonymous "we"), "is a 'blanket' of sorts, a cover that allows details to exist yet harmonizes them, providing a strong and uncluttered environment within which to breathe." As long as you don't tie your giant puffy scarf on too tightly. MM6 Maison Margiela Scarf, $780, ssense.com
-- Nancy MacDonell

9. Strap On A Piece of Luck
If you've ever wondered why the historic Parisian jewelry house Van Cleef & Arpels is so devoted to the cloverish shape known as the Alhambra -- here's the sparkling scoop. In 1968, it decided it needed a more accessible, everyday range of baubles. Well, as "accessible" as a luxury brand adored by rabid gem-lovers Elizabeth Taylor and the Empress of Iran could be. For this line, Van Cleef developed a quatrefoil motif, whose curves recall the design of the arches in a Moorish palace in Granada, Spain. In the 50-plus years since the Alhambra line was launched, the clover shape has appeared as stud earrings, on rings, looped onto long necklaces -- as worn insouciantly by Francoise Hardy. For this watch, an old-fashioned gold-smithing technique gives the dial light-catching ridges. Watch, $7,800, vancleefarpels.com

ORIGIN OF AN ICON
The L.L. Bean Boat and Tote
What Madonna is to every wannabe singer with a YouTube video -- the one who was there first and set the standard -- the L.L. Bean Boat and Tote is to all those canvas bags littering your life. Initially made in 1944, it's crafted from near-indestructible canvas: "I've seen one go through a snowblower and come out with just a few dings," says Curt Nichols, Bean's merchant manager. Sturdy? It can haul up to 500 pounds. Both Junior Leaguers and style icons like Chloe Sevigny have carried the tote, embroidered with a saucy monogram, equally well. Bag, $30, llbean.com

Texto completo: [Video: Sandra Oh Takes the SNL Marshmallow Test Watch on YouTube.]
Sandra Oh hosts "Saturday Night Live." And the "Mamma Mia!" sequel makes its television debut on HBO.
What's on TV
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. Sandra Oh hosts "S.N.L." for the first time, a week before "Killing Eve" returns for a second season. Oh nabbed a Golden Globe this year (How can we forget that acceptance speech?) for her role as a tenacious and unpredictable MI5 agent who becomes morbidly obsessed with an international assassin (Jodie Comer). The Australian psychedelic band Tame Impala, who made a triumphant return this week after four years without an album, brings its dreamy jams to the stage.
MAMMA MIA! HERE WE GO AGAIN (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; Stream on HBO platforms. This sequel to the 2008 musical comedy couldn't have possibly offered anything original. (It even recycles some songs used in the first movie, such as "Dancing Queen" and "Waterloo.") And critics have mostly been O.K. with that. "Here We Go Again" picks up a year after Donna (Meryl Streep) passes. Her daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is about to reopen Donna's hotel and the occasion calls for a reunion -- and plenty of flashbacks. We learn how young Donna (Lily James) fell for Harry (Colin Firth), Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) and Sam (Pierce Brosnan) years ago, and hear some more Abba hits, including "My Love, My Life" and "I've Been Waiting for You."
THE 50TH N.A.A.C.P. IMAGE AWARDS 9 p.m. on TV One. Anthony Anderson returns to host this live annual awards show administered by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Netflix leads the television categories with 22 nominations, "Black Panther" has nominations in seven categories and Beyoncé and Chadwick Boseman are up for the entertainer of the year award.
What's Streaming
CHEF FLYNN (2018) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Vudu or YouTube. By the time he was 10 years old, Flynn McGarry had a kitchen built in his bedroom. By 13, he was running a restaurant out of his mother's home. Now, at 20, he runs one in New York City that has been named a Critic's Pick by The New York Times critic Pete Wells. This documentary by Cameron Yates charts McGarry's rise as a self-made high-end chef, seen through the eyes of his mother.
SILENT LIGHT (2008) Stream on Mubi or Vudu. This slow-burn drama won the Jury Prize after debuting at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007. A decade later, The Times named it one of the best films of the 21st century so far. Directed by Carlos Reygadas, the movie follows Johan (Cornelio Wall), a husband and father in a Mennonite community in northern Mexico who is tormented by his affair with a neighbor (Maria Pankratz). He keeps little from his wife (Miriam Toews), and that honesty drives a wedge between them, no matter how intimate their shared life seems to be. Manohla Dargis wrote in her Times review, Reygadas "invites you into a world of grace and wonder so beautiful that it turns his film into a kind of prayer."

Texto completo: Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation has finally ended after two years. It did not find the evidence necessary to support theories of collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice.

And so it’s a riot to watch President Trump’s critics now accuse him of politicizing the affair. What was this investigation, if not a political exercise?

Contrary to the solemn act put on by Democrats and cable news pundits, the special counsel investigation was always a political pursuit meant to drag down Trump’s presidency for as long as humanly possible. Consider that not a single indictment had anything to do with Trump's supposed collusion or obstruction of justice.

Liberal New York Times columnist Charles Blow admitted that even the timing of Mueller’s conclusion last week is politically advantageous for Democrats and the now-neutered #Resistance. “Imagine if these results were released later on, after [2020 Democratic] candidates had locked in speculative statements about what the report would say and mean,” he wrote Wednesday. "Imagine it coming later, when it could truly give a campaign boost to Trump.”

After floundering under the investigation’s smog for years, Trump had every reason to come barreling out of the gates claiming victory at a campaign rally Thursday in Michigan. “After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is dead,” he said, predicting that Democrats and former Justice Department officials who promoted the conspiracy theory might soon face a reckoning.

An indignant Associated Press report on the rally said that Trump had “turned the findings of the Russia investigation into a political weapon.” The investigation itself, demanded by Democrats and the media, was political. Why would the findings not also be political? Because they came out in Trump’s favor?

That’s precisely it. Even though Trump was vindicated by the Mueller report, Washington still expects him to bow down.

The insufferable Max Boot of the Washington Post complained Wednesday that Trump was “was venomous and vengeful” after the summary of Muller’s report was released, apparently heedless of the persecution under which Trump had to labor for the last 24-plus months, only to have Mueller come up empty.

“Trump is reminding us that he lacks even an iota of the dignity or decorum that we used to take for granted in the Oval Office,” said Boot. Right, Trump should have instead taken the high road and let every Democrat and liberal journalist who pushed the Russia hoax get off without a word of criticism directed their way.

It would certainly be easier for Trump’s critics if we all just suddenly forgot that whatever political capital Trump might have had coming into office went up in smoke the second Mueller was appointed. If the president didn’t acknowledge that his first term has so far been hell for him, largely because of Mueller’s limitless probe that ultimately found nothing, then yes, the Democratic Party and the news media would likely feel more at ease.

Sorry, Boot et al. Jeb Bush isn’t president. You have to deal with a loud-mouthed New Yorker who was just cleared of all charges.

Brennan, Comey, and Clapper, the three stooges of collusion

Texto completo: "John Brennan has a lot to answer for,” tweeted Terry Moran, ABC News senior national correspondent, after the revelation that Robert Mueller’s investigation burst the collusion bubble. We couldn’t agree more.

Moran called out the former CIA director for “going before the American public for months, cloaked with CIA authority and openly suggesting he’s got secret info.”

Right again.

To call his behavior irresponsible would be an understatement. The truth is, Brennan, former FBI Director James Comey and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper used their influence and newfound liberal sympathy to paint a picture of an intelligence community sounding the alarm about a Manchurian president. The trio had a setback when the president revoked Brennan’s security clearance. Brennan was promptly given space on the New York Times op-ed page to declare: “Mr. Trump’s claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash.” His security clearance was pulled precisely “to scare into silence others who might dare to challenge” the president. We now know, as we long guessed, that it was Brennan talking hogwash, and tendentious hogwash at that.

Trump was “certainly close” to being an unindicted co-conspirator to charges filed by Mueller and other federal prosecutors, Comey said a few months ago.

Perhaps even worse than the troika throwing their reputations and assumed insider knowledge behind Collusionpalooza was that they also chose to reinforce the sensational claim that the president was being blackmailed by Vladimir Putin. In March 2018, Brennan told MSNBC that Russia “may have something on him personally,” and added, "The Russians, I think, have had long experience with Mr. Trump, and may have things that they could expose.”

The following month, Comey told ABC News “it’s possible” the Russians had compromising material on Trump. Then in June, he tweeted, “Thought experiment: Make a list of all the public figures in this country and around the world the current president has criticized. Ask yourself: ‘Why is Putin missing from the list?’ No responsible American should ever stop asking, ‘Why?’”

In July, after a bizarre and indeed disgraceful press conference Trump held with Putin in Finland, Clapper told CNN: “More and more I come to a conclusion after the Helsinki performance and since, that I really do wonder if the Russians have something on him.”

The ultimate irony here is that Brennan, Comey, Clapper, and those who followed their lead are the ones doing exactly what Moscow wants. Russia’s interference in the 2016 election was done to help Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton, but the larger goal was, as Attorney General William Barr wrote last Sunday, to sow division, incite chaos, and undermine faith in America’s electoral integrity and in our politics more broadly.

It’s not as though Brennan, Clapper, and Comey don’t know that. “We must get better at disagreeing without hating,” Comey tweeted last August. “The Russians know ‘a house divided against itself cannot stand.’ So they push us on social media from all sides.”

In his New York Times piece, Brennan wrote: “We knew that Russian intelligence services would do all they could to achieve their objectives, which the United States intelligence community publicly assessed a few short months later were to undermine public faith in the American democratic process, harm the electability of the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, and show preference for Mr. Trump.”

These comments now read like mea culpas. They were not intended to be admissions of incompetence and guilt, but that is what they are. The three stooges, Brennan, Comey, and Clapper, knew very well they were giving Putin what he wanted but pretended it was others doing his dirty work. They may still be lauded as heroes of the #Resistance, but their reputations and those of the intelligence and law enforcement communities over which they presided are stained. It will take much cleansing to restore them. They helped Putin succeed beyond his wildest dreams and turned the past two years into a political nightmare.

Texto completo: La Cruz Roja anunció este viernes que distribuirá la ayuda humanitaria destinada para Venezuela, luego de que el mandatario Nicolás Maduro aceptara la intervención de este organismo internacional para aliviar la crisis humanitaria, que hasta ahora se ha negado a reconocer oficialmente.
Según reportó el diario The New York Times, Maduro autorizó a la Cruz Roja para que reparta toneladas de ayuda humanitaria que se destinarán a unos 650,000 venezolanos durante los próximos meses.
“Estimamos que en un plazo de aproximadamente 15 días estaremos preparados para brindar la ayuda”, dijo Francesco Rocca, presidente de la Federación Internacional de la Cruz Roja.
La Cruz Roja destacó que se trataba de “una labor técnica”, que no debía ser utilizada como munición política en la disputa por el poder entre el presidente interino Juan Guaidó y el mandatario Nicolás Maduro.
El enviado especial de Estados Unidos a Venezuela, Elliot Abrams, dijo a la agencia de noticias EFE que estaba contento de ceder a un “instrumento fiable” las toneladas de ayuda estadounidense que actualmente se encuentran almacenadas en Cúcuta, Colombia.
“Estaríamos felices de hacerlo, si hubiera un instrumento fiable para distribuir la ayuda, puede ser la Cruz Roja, la Iglesia, Cáritas, que le den la ayuda a la gente que la necesita sin ninguna base política, entonces estaríamos felices de hacerlo por ese canal”, dijo Abrams.
Anteriormente, Guaidó había intentado sin éxito introducir la ayuda a Venezuela, pero la oposición de los militares leales a Maduro y de grupos armados afines a su Gobierno imposibilitó su traslado.
“Estamos abiertos a todas las donaciones”, dijo Rocca. “Estamos dispuestos a negociar con cualquiera”, añadió.
Guaidó aplaudió de inmediato el anuncio de la Cruz Roja, en lo que pareció una inevitable politización de la medida.
“Esto es resultado de nuestra presión e insistencia. La lucha por el bien de todos da frutos”, dijo el presidente interino.
Guaidó y Maduro se disputan la presidencia del país desde que Guaidó se autoproclamó como el mandatario legítimo, según las disposiciones constitucionales, y más de 50 países lo reconocieron.
Luego Guaidó intentó llevar alimentos y medicinas para aliviar las necesidades de la población, sin embargo, el gobierno de Maduro negó que hubiera una crisis humanitaria en Venezuela.
Desde entonces Maduro ha recibido cargamentos con suministros provenientes de China y Rusia, mientras que Guaidó hizo lo mismo con ayuda enviada por Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea.

LYFT COULD FACE BUMPY ROAD TO PROFITS WITH IPO

Texto completo: Since those funny pink mustaches began showing up on the front of cars five years ago, the Pittsburgh market has slowly become accustomed to ride-hailing company Lyft and its competitor, Uber.
Riders have no problem jumping into the car with strangers - sometimes talking Steelers news or complaining about the weather, other times looking out the window in silence.
Beginning Friday, the next phase starts for these ride-hailing startups that have gone from fringe apps to a whole new lifestyle. San Francisco-based Lyft, with an initial public offering, will be listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange for the first time, under the symbol "LYFT."
Lyft set the price for its stock at $72 per share late Thursday, for a valuation of $24 billion, and Uber is expected to go public later this year.
Whether the two companies can turn their popularity into profits is a question investors are sweating over. Both are in the fast lane when it comes to losing money. Last quarter, Uber lost $865 million while Lyft lost $249 million.
Still, the move to the stock exchange marks a new legitimacy for the firms as real companies, a long way from their early reputations as punky startups that couldn't play by the rules.
"You have companies that started as apps that are now building self-driving cars," said Alex Pazuchanics, assistant director for policy, planning and permitting at the city's Department of Mobility and Infrastructure. "There's a certain degree of maturation that happens. The market may view an IPO as a demonstration of that."
But moving to the public markets also means Lyft and Uber will have to disclose data to the Securities and Exchange Commission that they never shared in the past. The renegade Silicon Valley ethos will no longer fly - the SEC charged another disrupter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, with securities fraud after he tweeted some misleading information about taking the electric car company private.
When Lyft and Uber first came to Pittsburgh, they certainly didn't play by whatever rules that regulators thought might apply to this new concept.
Lyft was fined $250,000 in 2015 as part of a settlement with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to resolve a complaint that it was operating illegally in the Pittsburgh area. Uber was fined $3.5 million in 2017. Both companies were accused of operating without a license.
Since hitting that early speed bump, Lyft has been received mostly positively in the city, while rival Uber has had a rougher ride with politicians such as Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto.
In January 2017, Mr. Peduto expressed frustration with Uber, jabbing then-CEO Travis Kalanick via text message.
"We've held up our end [of] the bargain," Mr. Peduto told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, referring to the city's cooperation with the company, "but we haven't seen much from Uber. This is a two-way street, not a one-way. I need to see more interest from them in our communities, both locally and internationally."
Mr. Peduto was similarly irked by the company's withdrawal from Pittsburgh's effort to win the Department of Transportation Smart City Challenge and the millions of dollars that went with it. The city ultimately lost.
Both companies are investing in autonomous vehicle technology in Pittsburgh, a money-losing effort at the moment.
Lyft has been working with O'Hara-based Aptiv to deploy a fleet of autonomous vehicles in Las Vegas and has notched 35,000 rides in autonomous vehicles with a safety driver since January 2018.
Uber employs about 1,000 at its Strip District-based research and development center, where engineers are building autonomous vehicles.
Notably, Uber's self-driving operation was suspended for nine months after one of its self-driving vehicles killed a pedestrian in Arizona while a backup driver was in the car watching the television show "The Voice." Uber resumed testing here in December.
At the same time, the companies face stiff competition from General Motors and Google spinoff Waymo, which have been working in the autonomous vehicle space longer than Uber and Lyft.
"It may be difficult for these guys to catch up," said Ali Mogharabi, senior equity analyst at Morningstar Research.
In addition, both have dealt with fights over how much pay should be earned by the masses of drivers who provide their own cars to offer transportation services.
None of that means Lyft and Uber are doomed for failure. Other unprofitable companies, particularly in the technology industry, have pulled off high-profile IPOs in the past and seen their stocks perform well - as long as other key measures of success such as revenue and customer growth are rising.
Amazon needed more than four years from its IPO to turn a quarterly profit as CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized low prices and free shipping to get shoppers hooked on the e-commerce service. The Seattle company now has a market value of nearly $900 billion.
Short-messaging service Twitter went public in 2013, even though it had an uninterrupted history of losses and remained mired in red ink for several more years. The company has since become profitable through cost cutting and realizing other revenue streams, but its stock price is far below its peak levels.
"Wall Street eventually is going to want to see some profitability," said Daniel Morgan, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co. "That's what drives stocks, is growth and earnings. Not just growth and all these statistics that they've come up with."

Texto completo: The two most recent times I saw my friend Makoto Fujimura, he put a Kintsugi bowl in my hands. These ceramic bowls were 300 to 400 years old. But what made them special was that somewhere along the way they had broken into shards and were glued back together with a 15th-century technique using Japanese lacquer and gold.
They look like they have golden veins running through them, making them more beautiful and more valuable than they were in their original condition.
There's a dimension of depth to them. You sense the original life they had, the rupture and then the way they were so beautifully healed. And of course they stand as a metaphor for the people, families and societies we all know who have endured their own ruptures and come back beautiful, vulnerable and whole in their broken places.
I don't know about you, but I feel a great hunger right now for timeless pieces like these. The internet has accelerated our experience of time, and Donald Trump has upped the pace of events to permanent frenetic.
There is a rapid, dirty river of information coursing through us all day. If you're in the news business, or a consumer of the news business, your reaction to events has to be instant or it is outdated. If you're on social media, there are these swarming mobs who rise out of nowhere, leave people broken and do not stick around to perform the patient Kintsugi act of gluing them back together.
Probably like you, I've felt a great need to take a break from this pace every once in a while and step into a slower dimension of time. Mako's paintings are very good for these moments.
He was born in Boston to a Japanese family and studied art back in Japan. His paintings are gorgeous works of abstract expressionism, using a Japanese style called Nihonga. He grinds colored minerals like malachite and azurite into fine particles and then layers them on paper. Each layer takes time to dry, and Mako may use 60 layers in a single work.
Nihonga is slow to make and slow to see. Mako once advised me to stare at one of his paintings for 10 to 12 minutes. I thought it would be boring, but it was astonishing. As I stood still in front of it, my eyes adjusted to the work. What had seemed like a plain blue field now looked like a galaxy of color.
"A beautiful thing, though simple in its immediate presence," the critic Frederick Turner once wrote, "always gives us a sense of depth below depth, almost an innocent wild vertigo as one falls through its levels."
The Greeks had a concept of Kairos time, which is not quantitative like our normal conception of time but qualitative -- rich or empty, the meaningful hour or the hurried moment. When you're with beauty, in art or in nature, you tend to move at Kairos time -- slowly, serenely but thickly.
The great philosopher of time is Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel. In his great book "The Sabbath," he points out that the first sacred thing in the Bible is not a thing, it is a time period, the seventh day. Judaism, he argues, is primarily a religion of time, not space.
"The seventh day," he writes, "is a palace in time which we build. It is made of soul, of joy and reticence. In its atmosphere, a discipline is a reminder of adjacency to eternity. Indeed, the splendor of the day is expressed in terms of abstentions."
The Sabbath, he continues, is not a rest from the other six days. It is the peak experience the other six days point toward. On this day the Orthodox do less and in slowness can glimpse the seeds of eternity.
Sabbath, Heschel concludes, "is endowed with a felicity which enraptures the soul, which glides into our thoughts with a healing sympathy. It is a day on which hours do not oust one another. It is a day that can soothe all sadness away. No one, even the unlearned, crude man, can remain insensitive to its beauty."
Mako has the sorts of thoughts one has when you live at a different pace. He is, he says, a border stalker.
He is Japanese but also American, a Christian and also a prominent figure in the art world. He is one of those people who live on the edges of groups and travel between groups, bringing news from outside.
There's an ambiguity, complexity and sometimes a hiddenness to his writing and speech that can't be expressed as a hot take.
He once wrote a book called "Culture Care." It is an argument against the whole idea of a culture war. It advocates an environmental movement for the culture -- replacing the harsh works that flow from fear with works that are generous, generative and generational.
That last word is a breath from another age. What would it mean to live generationally once in a while, in a world that now finds the daily newspaper too slow?

Federal judge rules DOJ must hand over Comey memos

Texto completo: A federal judge ordered the FBI Thursday to turn over former Director James Comey’s memos, including the notes that he took during his infamous one-on-one meetings with President Trump.

Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of CNN, USA Today, Judicial Watch, and other outlets, telling the DOJ that it must hand over the Comey memos to the court for review and possible public release.

The memos include the notes that Comey said he leaked to the media to spark the appointment of a special counsel.

Media and watchdog groups have fought to obtain documents relating to Comey's notes through the Freedom of Information Act since May 2017, when the existence of the Comey memos was first made public. The memos recount conversations between Comey and Trump that are hotly disputed, and the outlets argue that the public has a right to their contents.

But the DOJ has opposed their release. A significant amount of information from the Comey memos has already been made public, but other information has been redacted or otherwise concealed from public view. CNN is also fighting for access to the Justice Department’s sealed arguments explaining to the court why the DOJ is opposing the release of the memos.

Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017. One of the memos leaked by Comey was detailed in the New York Times on May 16, 2017, and Comey later explained to Congress that he leaked it to a friend to help prompt the special counsel investigation. Special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed the day after the New York Times report to investigate possible coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 election.

Earlier in March of this year, the DOJ argued that disclosing information related to the Comey Memos could impede the Mueller probe, saying it “would reveal information about the focus and scope of the Special Counsel Office’s investigation that have not been officially publicly disclosed, and which if disclosed now could reasonably be expected to cause … potential harms.”

The DOJ has also argued that the information being requested by CNN is sensitive and would have harmed the investigation.

While the special counsel investigation was ongoing, the court seemed inclined to agree with this argument.

Mueller has now concluded his investigation, however, turning over his final report to Attorney General William Barr on Friday.

CNN responded to the DOJ’s arguments a week ago, telling the court that they had “shown that the FBI’s justifications for redacting the Comey Memos are illogical and implausible."

CNN's attorneys argued that the redacted information wouldn’t hurt U.S. national security or foreign policy if it is revealed to the public. The redactions likely include: Which foreign leader was the first to congratulate Trump on his inauguration, who in the White House received a defensive briefing in February 2017, information on the investigation of Mike Flynn including whether he was being surveilled under FISA, details related to the so-called Trump Dossier, information on Trump’s comments about Vladimir Putin, and more.

The Comey memos must now be turned over to the court by April 1.

Adam Schiff has no business on the Intelligence Committee

Texto completo: After two years of intense anticipation and speculation, the findings of the Mueller Report are finally in: President Trump did not collude with the Russians.
The headline in the New York Times on Monday, March 25 read, “Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy,” the Washington Post declared, “Mueller finds no conspiracy,” and the Wall Street Journal printed, “Mueller finds no Trump collusion.”
In spite of all of that, on Tuesday, March 26, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, was quoted in the Washington Post as saying, “Undoubtedly, there is collusion…We will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues.”
In another interview with “ABC This Week,” Schiff said that there is “still significant evidence of collusion” and that “there’s a difference between compelling evidence of collusion and whether the special counsel concludes that he can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the criminal charge of conspiracy.”
Okay, then.
Either they don’t deliver the papers to Burbank, or Schiff is prepared to accept the Mueller Report the same way he accepted the results of the 2016 presidential election.
Not at all.
Schiff is like one of those Japanese soldier hold-outs they found on a Pacific island 30 years after World War II ended, still carrying on the fight. Long after Trump and Melania and Ivanka are dead and buried, Schiff will be demanding that President Barron Trump answer a few more questions about the Steele dossier.
At first glance it’s easy to assume that Schiff is pretty dense, and think “how did in the world did he even get on the Intelligence Committee in the first place? Did his parents pay someone a half-million dollar bribe?”
But don’t make the mistake of thinking that he’s stupid.
On the contrary, Schiff is a malicious grifter who has recklessly peddled this provably false conspiracy theory for years, and can’t muster up the courage to admit that he’s wrong.
Schiff’s incessant collusion theories have gotten him so much coverage on cable news he’s been on MSNBC more often than the inmates on “Lockup.”
Here’s just a sampling of some of his greatest hits…
In March of 2017, Schiff said on Meet the Press that there was “circumstantial evidence of collusion” and “direct evidence… of deception.”
Also in March, Schiff told MSNBC there was “more than circumstantial evidence” — and claimed that had seen it.
On December 14, 2017, Schiff told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, “Well, look, there’s clear evidence of an attempt to collude.”
On March 1, 2018, Megan McCain of ABC’s “The View” asked Schiff, “Last March you said you have more than circumstantial evidence of treasonous collusion with Russia. What specifically were you referring to? And please be specific because if it’s true I do believe Americans have the right to know a year later what that is.”
In response, Schiff gave a rambling answer that referenced George Papadapolous, Donald Trump Jr., and a meeting at Trump Tower.
When he was finished, McCain said, “I just think if Mueller doesn’t end up charging him, it just looks like a lot of smoke and mirrors.”
On May 27, 2018 he told “ABC This Week,” that of the Russia investigation, “I think, of a size and scope possibly beyond Watergate.”
On August 5, 2018 he told “CBS This Morning,” “I think there’s plenty of evidence of collusion.”
For two years, Schiff would tell anyone who would listen that President Trump colluded with the Russians, and now we know for a fact, that he was full of it the whole time.
A charlatan like this doesn’t belong anywhere near the Intelligence Committee, let alone as its chairman.
For heaven’s sake, Megan McCain made him look like a fool on The View. That alone should get him kicked off the Intelligence Committee.
At this point, I think it’s obvious that a con artist like Congressman Schiff doesn’t have the character to apologize to President Trump or to the American people; so it’s up to his colleagues to remove him as chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays at 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Poll says parents hinder children's life skills

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become an adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of children ages 18 to 28.
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not rich — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor's appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn't sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child's grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid," Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's a difficult habit for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you're doing it in high school, you can't stop at college," she said. "If you're doing it in college, you can't stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life."
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own life lives. "You can't just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.

Texto completo: Michael Jackson, as you know, died 10 years ago in 2009 and was deep in debt to the tune of over $400 million! Well, that was then. Today, his estate is flowing with cash, but the good times might not last too much longer because of that controversial HBO documentary.
Yes, we're referring to "Leaving Neverland," which boldly accuses the King of Pop of sexually abusing Wade Robson and James Safechuck as boys. The allegations have already harmed Jackson's reputation with fashion brand Louis Vuitton as they've dumped a Jackson-inspired collection. Also, radio stations in Canada, Australia and New
Zealand have stopped playing his songs.
But as we alluded to, the estate itself could be affected.
"In our world today, there is going to be an effect where there is a direct relation between the stream of income and people's emotional connection," says Donald N. David, a lawyer who worked on Tupac Shakur's estate. "It will absolutely have a negative impact; I just can't tell you how much. Anything having to do with the Jackson estate inherently involves millions of dollars because of the value of the underlying assets."
Over the past decade, Forbes reports, Jackson's relatives have raked in more than $2 billion - as much money as he earned while he was alive.
Here's everything you need to know about how they did it (and what could come next for mem).
How Much Money Did Michael Jackson Make?
Jackson sold a reported 750 million albums, purchased a $19.5 million ranch and once starred in a movie that cost over $1.7 million per minute to make. He had a clothing line and an autobiography. He even bought the Beatles catalog.
All of that translated to profit: Forbes reports that Jackson earned about $2 billion before his death (when adjusted for inflation). A 13-time Grammy Award winner, he was named the highest-paid entertainer in the world twice.
But his lifestyle led him to take out several loans, and from there he slid into financial ruin. When he died, Michael Jackson's net worth was $236 million, according to the Associated Press. A banker would later testify he was in "financial, crisis."
"Millions of dollars annually were spent on plane charters, purchases of antiques and paintings," Alvin Malnik, once a financial adviser to Jackson, told the New York Times in 2006. "I think that Michael never had any concept of fiscal responsibility, or logical fiscal responsibility. He was an individual that had been overindulged by those that represented him or worked for him for all of his life."
What Is Michael Jackson's Estate Worth?
Nobody agrees on this. In fact, the topic is at the heart of a complicated dispute over estate taxes.

Texto completo: Today is Wednesday, March 27, the 86th day of 2019. There are 279 days left in the year.
Today's Highlight in History:
On March 27, 1977, in aviation's worst disaster, 583 people were killed when a KLM Boeing 747, attempting to take off in heavy fog, crashed into a Pan Am 747 on an airport runway on the Canary Island of Tenerife.
On this date:
In 1513, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon sighted present-day Florida.
In 1625, Charles I acceded to the English throne upon the death of James I.
In 1933, Japan officially withdrew from the League of Nations.
In 1942, during World War II, Congress granted American servicemen free first-class mailing privileges.
In 1958, Nikita Khrushchev became Soviet premier in addition to First Secretary of the Communist Party.
In 1964, Alaska was hit by a magnitude 9.2 earthquake (the strongest on record in North America) and tsunamis that together claimed about 130 lives.
In 1968, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man to orbit the Earth in 1961, died when his MiG-15 jet crashed during a routine training flight near Moscow; he was 34.
In 1975, construction began on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which was completed two years later.
In 1980, 123 workers died when a North Sea floating oil field platform, the Alexander Kielland, capsized during a storm.
In 1995, "Forrest Gump won six Academy Awards, including best picture and a second consecutive best actor Oscar for Tom Hanks; Jessica Lange won best actress for "Blue Sky.
In 2006, Al-Qaida conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui testified at his federal trial that he was supposed to hijack a fifth airplane on Sept. 11, 2001, and fly it into the White House.
Ten years ago: President Barack Obama launched a fresh effort to defeat al-Qaida terrorists in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, ordering in 4,000 more troops. A suicide bomber set off an explosion at a packed mosque in Pakistan near the Afghan border, killing at least 48 people. The rising Red River broke a 112-year record and threatened the dikes fortifying Fargo, N.D. The main suspect in the Phoenix serial shooter attacks, Dale Hausner, was sentenced to death for six murders that had put the city on edge for nearly two years. (Hausner committed suicide in an isolation cell in June 2013.)
Five years ago: Face to face at the Vatican for the first time, President Barack Obama and Pope Francis focused on their mutual respect and shared concern for the poor. The U.S. Air Force took the extraordinary step of firing nine midlevel nuclear commanders and announcing it would discipline dozens of junior officers at a nuclear missile base, responding firmly to an exam-cheating scandal. A judge in Missoula, Montana, sentenced Jordan Graham to more than 30 years in prison for killing Cody Johnson, her husband of eight days, by pushing him from a cliff in Glacier National Park. James Schlesinger, 85, who'd held a long string of Cabinet and other high-level positions in three U.S. administrations, died in Baltimore.
One year ago: Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, in an essay on The New York Times website, called for the repeal of the Second Amendment to allow for significant gun control legislation. The co-owner of a Kansas water park and a ride designer were charged with reckless second-degree murder in the decapitation of a 10-year-old boy on the ride in 2016. (A judge dismissed the charges last month, finding that state prosecutors had shown inadmissible evidence to grand jurors.)
Today's Birthdays: Actor Julian Glover is 84. Actor Jerry Lacy is 83. Hall of Fame racer Cale Yarborough is 80. Actor-director Austin Pendleton is 79. Actor Michael York is 77. Rock musician Tony Banks (Genesis) is 69. Rock musician Andrew Farriss (INXS) is 60. Actor Brian Tarantina is 60. Jazz musician Dave Koz (kahz) is 56. Movie director Quentin Tarantino is 56.

Texto completo: COMBINED LOCKS - A reopened paper mill in Combined Locks is receiving national attention after an article was posted on the New York Times website March 22, chronicling its comeback switching from white paper production to cardboard production.
The New York Times article, which also ran on the front page of last Sunday's business section, talks in depth about the the former Appleton Coated mill, shut down in 2017.
About 600 people were originally laid off. The mill is now owned by Midwest Paper Group, which has re-hired about 300 employees.
In the article, New York Times reporter Michael Corkery talks about how Midwest Paper has revitalized the paper industry not only in Combined Locks, but across the country as well, as Amazon and other retailers continue to use plenty of cardboard for shipments.
In Combined Locks, Corkery writes about what the paper industry means to the community as a whole. He even mentions the Papermaker mascot, old fashioneds garnished with brussels sprouts and the Lox Club.
One local resident quoted in the article couldn't leave out the Green Bay Packers, either.
"Around here, we've got the Packers and paper," Steve Gilsdorf said in the article.
Beyond Combined Locks, Corkery also writes about the history of paper in the Fox Valley and titles the section "The Silicon Valley of its time".
In Appleton, the popular Paper Discovery Center museum and the Paper International Hall of Fame, Corkery writes, show off those whose accomplishments revolutionized the industry.
Corkery also notes remaining mills such as Kimberly-Clark and smaller conglomerates like Georgia Pacific in the Fox Valley area before mentioning the decline of jobs in the industry. He writes that in 2000, there were about 49,600 paper manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin, compared to about 30,000 in 2017.
According to the article, across the country mills that focused on white paper continue to be converted to keep up with the cardboard boom.
A 2018 article by USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter Maureen Wallenfang also details the recovery of the Combined Locks mill.

Puerto Rico's needs

Texto completo: After a stretch of disastrous years that included a recession, a debt crisis, bankruptcy, a hurricane and the exodus of thousands of residents from the island, 2019 is shaping up to be a good year for Puerto Rico -- or at least for Puerto Rican morale.
Several things came together, mostly by chance, to lift the island's spirits and give Puerto Ricans a sense of hope. That is due, in important measure, to two New York Puerto Ricans, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who have brought the world's attention to the island.
Miranda's rise to fame in the United States was meteoric, and earlier this year, he reflected some of that glory back onto his family's homeland with a three-week staging of "Hamilton" in San Juan. The production lured thousands of American and international visitors to the island in January and raised $14 million for Puerto Rican artists and arts institutions. It ended with an epic final performance, after which Miranda tearfully wrapped himself in the Puerto Rican flag and brought down the house.

And then there's Ocasio-Cortez, who also has Puerto Rican parents and has had her own phenomenal rise to celebrity, culminating with her swearing in as a U.S. congresswoman in January. She has not visited the island since 2016, but has called for the end to the territory's colonial status and was photographed holding up the Puerto Rican flag.
Her upset victory over a high-ranking incumbent Anglo congressman made her an instant hit in her ancestral home. "Love her or hate her, the way she has carried herself reflects well on Puerto Rico," said San Juan attorney and Democratic Party insider Andres W. Lopez. Now, he said, he is waiting to see if Ocasio-Cortez highlights issues that involve Puerto Rico directly.
The limelight associated with Puerto Rico's famous progeny, a group that also includes Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, has arguably already brought some benefit to the island. The New York Times, for example, recently named Puerto Rico the world's No. 1 travel destination for 2019, something hotel consultant Simon Baeyertz says represents a real achievement, and not simply a "pity party for the hurricane."
But leveraging the recent feel-good moments for long-term benefit will take far more.
The bankrupt island is operating under the strict oversight of a federal fiscal panel, which has brought punishing austerity measures. Unemployment is at 8.3%, more than double the U.S. rate overall, and 44% live below the poverty line.
The island has to reckon too with an inept and corrupt system of patronage and an over-dependence on government jobs and welfare.
On the plus side are attractive tax incentives for investors, affordable property values, a spate of economic activity related to hurricane rebuilding (with $1.5 billion in federal block grants for recovery on the way), and a general sense that the bottom has been hit.
Tourism is the most visible sign of better times. Old San Juan is again busy with visitors. Quaint hill towns and beaches in Isabela, Rincon, and Vieques also report increased tourism. And new, high-end boutique hotels are opening in the hotspot Condado district, known as one of the Caribbean's "capitals of cool."
"In a way, it's as if the hurricane has connected the island with the mainland in a way I have never felt," said Baeyertz.
The trick now will be strengthening that connection. For more than a century, Puerto Rico has had a complicated relationship with the United States. Though Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, those living in the island territory cannot vote in federal elections. They also do not pay federal taxes. The island receives less federal aid per capita for programs such as like Medicare, Medicaid and hurricane recovery than states do.
Many Puerto Ricans consider statehood the only answer to their island's woes. Last year, Puerto Rico's governor, Ricardo Rossello, sent a letter to President Trump urging him to support the island becoming a state and to abandon "territorial-colonialism." But advocates haven't successfully carried the fight to the U.S. Congress, which has the final say, and where statehood for Puerto Rico is neither urgent nor favored.
Some Puerto Ricans hope that high-profile Puerto Ricans on the mainland will help -- as will the 5.1 million Puerto Ricans who live on the mainland and can help swing elections in some areas
"After spending decades as outsiders, in the margins of American society, the fact that everywhere you look in 2019, Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans are in the thick of it -- that is welcome indeed,'' Lopez told me. "All of these developments have something in common: They place Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans squarely in the middle of the national conversation."

Texto completo: Tanitoluwa Adewumi, age 8, skidded around the empty apartment, laughing excitedly, then leapt onto his dad's back. "I have a home!" he said in wonderment. "I have a home!"
A week ago, the boy was homeless, studying chess moves while lying on the floor of a shelter in Manhattan. Now Tani, as he is known, has a home, a six-figure bank account, scholarship offers from three elite private schools and an invitation to meet President Bill Clinton.
"I think I am still dreaming," said Tani's dad, Kayode Adewumi. "I hope I don't wake up."
I wrote in my column last weekend about Tani as a reminder of the principle that talent is universal, even if opportunity is not. A Nigerian refugee who had learned chess only a bit more than a year earlier, he had just defeated kids from elite private schools to win the New York state chess championship for his age group. He lugged a trophy nearly as big as he is back to the homeless shelter.
Now the story gets even better.
After my column about this hardworking family, a GoFundMe drive raised more than $200,000 for Tani, his parents and his brother. A half-dozen readers offered housing - in a couple of cases, palatial quarters. Immigration lawyers offered pro bono assistance to the Adewumis, who are in the country legally and seeking asylum. Three film companies are vying to make movies about Tani.
The family settled on one of the more modest and practical housing offers: An anonymous donor paid a year's rent on a two-bedroom apartment near Tani's current school. The apartment is clean, comfortable and freshly painted, without being luxurious, and the Adewumis gaze adoringly at their new kitchen.
"I want my mom's cooking again!" Tani mused as he explored the apartment. It was bare, but another donor had offered furniture, sheets and towels. Someone else was sending 100 chess books.
Heartfelt thanks to all my readers for this generosity: I truly have the best readers.
And now the story gets even better.
The Adewumis have decided that they will not spend a cent of the $200,000 GoFundMe money on themselves. They will take out a 10 percent tithe and donate it to their church, which helped them while they were homeless, and the rest will be channeled through a new Tanitoluwa Adewumi Foundation to help African immigrants who are struggling in the United States the way they were a week ago.
"Anybody who is coming from Africa who is in the position we were in, we will help them," Adewumi said, acknowledging that details need to be worked out.
I asked them how they could turn down every penny of such a huge sum. Didn't they want a celebration dinner? New iPhones? A vacation?
"I'm a hardworking guy," Adewumi explained. He has two jobs: He drives for Uber with a rented car and sells real estate through Brick & Mortar. Someone has now offered him a free car so that he can keep more of the money he makes driving, and Tani's mom was just offered a job as a health care aide at a hospital.
I asked Tani if he was OK with seeing the $200,000 disappear. He shrugged. "I want to help other kids," he said. "I don't mind."
Surely, I pressed him, there was some material object he coveted. There was a long silence. "Maybe a computer," he acknowledged.
The family was tempted by the offers of full scholarships at top private schools. But Tani and his parents decided that while he might accept such a scholarship for middle school, he would be loyal and stick with the public elementary school, PS 116, that taught him chess and waived his fees for the chess club.
"This school showed confidence in Tanitoluwa," his mom, Oluwatoyin Adewumi, told PS 116 principal Jane Hsu. "So we return the confidence." And then, overcome with emotion, the mom and the principal hugged.
There's a risk that a triumph like this leaves the impression that charity is the solution rather than a way to fill gaps: Fundamentally we need comprehensive systems in place to support needy kids. We would never build a bridge or subway with volunteers and donations, so why entrust an even more urgent cause - homeless children - to charity?
Tani thrived because everything fell into place: a good school, a dedicated chess teacher and devoted parents committed to taking their son to every chess practice. The challenge is to replicate that supportive environment for all the other Tanis out there with public services and private philanthropy alike.
One challenge I face is that readers often want to donate just to a particular individual I write about, without addressing the larger social problem. So it's thrilling to see Tani and his parents use their good fortune to help other anonymous kids in need. In that, there's a lesson for all of us.
"God has already blessed me," Adewumi told me. "I want to release my blessing to others."

Texto completo: President Trump widened his scope of attack on the media by declaring Tuesday the mainstream media was the enemy of the people.

When launching such attacks, Trump has generally referred to what he considers “fake news” to be the enemy of the people.” But days after Attorney General William Barr said special counsel Robert Mueller found the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russians to win the 2016 election, Trump directed his ire to the mainstream media for its coverage of the nearly two-year inquiry.

“The Mainstream Media is under fire and being scorned all over the World as being corrupt and FAKE. For two years they pushed the Russian Collusion Delusion when they always knew there was No Collusion. They truly are the Enemy of the People and the Real Opposition Party!” he wrote.


It’s not unique for the president to vent his frustrations over the coverage of his presidency, especially of the Russia investigation. He has on occasion referred to specific news outlets, including the New York Times and CNN, as “fake news,” but has on occasion pushed back on reports that said he was casting a net over all media.

Resumen: The crash of Boeing 737 Max jetliners in Indonesia and Ethiopia have prompted reviews not just of the airplane but of regulators’ approval process.

Texto completo: For Boeing engineers, the crash of two new 737 Max jets within five months of each other is a software puzzle. How did a sensor apparently go awry and make the airliners unmanageable within minutes of takeoff, resulting in the deaths of all aboard?
For Congress and the public, the twin accidents raise larger issues. Did Boeing unreasonably rush the plane’s design in the face of mounting competition? Did federal regulators have the necessary independence and resources to oversee the plane’s certification? In an era when automation is transforming the man-machine interface, can today’s regulatory system keep up with change?
On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee’s aviation panel will give Congress its first crack at seeking answers to some of these questions.
These issues affect not just the flying public. For example, car drivers and other consumers face many of the same challenges of adequate oversight and spreading artificial intelligence.
“Increasingly, regulating these products is regulating software,” says Daniel Carpenter, a professor of government at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “That’s not only true with respect to planes, [it’s true] with respect to drugs, with respect to financial products, with respect to medical devices…. I think we’re going to need to look carefully at the way that these software programs are created and managed and how we simulate them.”
Faulty sensors and a loss of control Officially, investigators have yet to determine what caused the crash of Indonesia’s Lion Air Flight 610 in October and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in the morning hours of March 10 shortly after takeoff. Both planes were versions of the Boeing 737 Max, the manufacturer’s bestselling update of its workhorse plane. After the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the planes were grounded worldwide, pending investigation. The Federal Aviation Administration has said there are similarities between the two crashes.
In the earlier Lion Air accident, reports suggest a faulty sensor caused the automated flight-control system to nose down repeatedly shortly after takeoff. The day before the crash, the plane’s crew, with the help of an off-duty pilot, managed to wrest control of the aircraft from the automated system. The crew the following day failed to gain control. The crash prompted Boeing engineers to begin work on a software fix.
It also caused federal prosecutors in the United States to launch a highly unusual criminal investigation into the safety procedures and certification of the 737 Max. After the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the inspector general of the Transportation Department also began looking into the Max certification.
On the face of things, the certification process looks problematic, earning the ire of everyone from consumer advocate Ralph Nader to Capt. Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, a safety expert and retired pilot who famously landed a plane in the Hudson River after a bird strike disabled its engines. “There is too cozy a relationship between the industry and the regulators,” he wrote in a recent op-ed. “And in too many cases, FAA employees who rightly called for stricter compliance with safety standards and more rigorous design choices have been overruled by FAA management, often under corporate or political pressure.”
Rising safety, but new risks? Increasingly, the FAA has relied on Boeing employees to act as FAA inspectors to certify their own planes. A 2013 Government Accountability Office report found that more than 90 percent of the certification tasks were carried out by these FAA-approved private employees.
Under that deregulatory regime, starting in 2010, domestic airlines recorded eight straight years without a single fatal accident in the United States – a remarkable record. But some critics say that both Boeing and regulators grew complacent about the mounting challenges of the deregulated certification process.
“The regulator went to sleep,” says James Hall, a safety consultant and former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. “What we have now is a system that essentially provides Boeing with a system of self-certification.”
Another potential compounding factor: Boeing’s rush to build the 737 Max to compete with the Airbus A320neo. “It was go, go, go,” one engineer told The New York Times about the expedited process to design, build, and certify the plane. None of the Boeing staff interviewed by the Times said the speedup compromised safety.
Outside the company, however, there’s skepticism.
“No one wants to build a bad plane,” says Mike Perrone, union president of Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, based in Washington, D.C. “But when there are other pressures, like to get the plane approved, to get it out so you could get competing with your competitors, certain things can take a back seat. And maybe some things don’t get tested as much as they should.”
That’s especially true as manufacturers pack in more and more automation.
A compromised design? To accommodate larger and more fuel-efficient engines on the older 737 airframe, Boeing implemented modifications that made the plane less stable during a steep takeoff. To compensate, it created the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, software that would automatically nose the plane down if it was in danger of stalling. But if a sensor designed to detect stalling was picking up erroneous data, as apparently happened in the earlier Lion Air crash, then MCAS could push the plane into a nosedive unless the crew disabled it.
The company’s initial safety analysis didn’t account for the fact that MCAS could repeatedly reset itself after the pilot pulled the nose upward, according to an investigation by The Seattle Times. Also, it underestimated by a factor of four the distance MCAS could move the tail. Meanwhile, pilots complained that the plane’s documentation was inadequate to explain what was going on.
In addition to a software fix, Boeing has announced it will make a safety feature standard rather than extra – a “disagree light” that warns pilots if two sensors are misaligned.
More-complex products, less money for oversight  Some experts say the company’s scramble also signals the need for a new approach to regulation. That’s the case even though software and artificial intelligence systems are designed to make planes and other vehicles safer.
“In many instances, AI can fly an airplane safer or drive a car safer than you or I,” says Sid Shapiro, an expert on regulatory policy at Wake Forest University’s law school. “So there’s certainly a promise there of increased safety. On the other hand, you’ve got to get it right for that to happen. And it’s not clear that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or, for that matter, the FAA is really up to this job and it has the sophistication to do it.”
Funding for many regulatory agencies, including NHTSA, has been declining for the past quarter century when adjusted for inflation, he says. “Making those kinds of technological transitions can be very resource intensive and they don’t appear to have the resources.”
Compared with the FAA, NHTSA is even more underfunded, says Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog in Washington, D.C. The agency has issued only voluntary guidelines for the various automated safety systems now going into cars.
“It’s impossible for consumers, or even safety professionals, to know which of these work, which of these work well, which of these work well in different circumstances, because there’s no required standards,” he says. “When used correctly and when operating as designed, yeah, [the technology] is amazing. But there’s a lot of ifs.”

Mailhot caps 'nonstop' year with $50K Whiting Award

Texto completo: It's been quite a run in the past few weeks for Purdue professor Terese Mailhot and her debut New York Times best-seller, "Heart Berries."
On Wednesday, she was in New York City to pick up a Whiting Award, a big deal in literary circles, given to 10 emerging writers in fiction, nonfiction, poetry and drama that the Whiting Foundation picked for "early-career achievement and the promise of superior literary work to come." The Whiting Award comes with a $50,000 prize.
A week earlier, Spalding University in Louisville, Kentucky, selected "Heart Berries" for its inaugural Spalding Prize for the Promotion of Peace and Justice in Literature, an honor that carries its own $7,500 award.
Mailhot's searing memoir was released in early 2018, a semester after arriving at Purdue as a Tecumseh Fellow -- one of two post-doctoral fellows in a Purdue initiative meant to increase the number of Native American tenure-track faculty – and quickly made an impact. "Heart Berries" covers her experience as a Native America and her upbringing on a British Columbia reservation, covering issues with abuse, mental illness and post-traumatic stress disorder.
"'Heart Berries' is one of the most important memoirs of the last five years," the Whiting selection committee wrote about Mailhot's work. "There is a purity to this nimble, jarring work."
"Heart Berries" was one of two best-sellers from Purdue faculty in 2018, along with the collection of essays, "Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture," curated and edited by Roxane Gay, who was Mailhot's mentor during her time as a Tecumseh Scholar. Early this year, after a year as a visiting professor, Mailhot landed a spot as a member of Purdue's English faculty.
Question: How did you find out about the Whiting?
Mailhot: I recently got a new phone. I gave my son my old phone, and he has my phone number. So, the foundation had been trying to reach me for several days. My son doesn't answer his phone, teenagers. My agent, Maria Massie, got ahold of me and said they were trying to reach me. The Whiting Foundation called early the next morning and said, "Congratulations!" I have been following the award and the past winners for years now. It's an amazing honor.
Q: "Heart Berries" has been out for more than a year. Are you surprised by accolades, like the Whiting Award and the Spalding Literary Prize, still coming its way?
Mailhot: It came out Feb. 6, 2018, and since then it's been nonstop for me. It's surprising. Whenever a person's work is seen and appreciated, it's a big deal. I think a lot of people spend their lives doing what they believe in, knowing our work might go unseen, but we know it's the right thing to do. So, being seen is a big deal. I am always surprised.
Q: Has the book taken on a new life, in any way, for you in the past year?
Mailhot: It has. At first it was simply named as a book about trauma, or a contribution to a new movement within Native literature. But it's founded a wider audience who appreciates the craft of the book. Non-native people see my work, and it resonates with them. Native students have been supportive and protective of my work, so they come out to my readings, and it's been just a wonderful experience for me. I feel some momentum to keep working, and I see how a book is something that can't be dismantled. The text has a life of its own, and after the buzz is gone, the work lives on.
Q: Any New York Times best-seller buys a lot of great moments, I'm sure. What have been the top two or three?
Mailhot: Being able to stand on stage with Roxane Gay has been a very triumphant and powerful moment for me. She is a wonderful and talented creative genius, so being able to work with someone like that is a milestone.
I was also recently able to bring my family out to New York. They celebrated with me when I received the 2019 Whiting Award. My brothers saw New York for the first time. My in-laws were there, and my sons. So, it was just amazing to be able to take everyone to a city like that. They got to see me work, which usually I'm on the road, reading without my family there. It was beautiful.
Q: Next year will be your third position at Purdue in as many years, after coming to West Lafayette as a Tecumseh Fellow, then spending this year as a visiting professor. Next year, you'll be in a tenure-track position, as Roxane Gay departs the program. Does feel like you can finally settle in at Purdue?
Mailhot: Yes! I am looking at houses and feeling relieved. Teaching isn't easy. This academic life isn't easy for a woman of color, or an Indigenous person. It's usually a lot of moving around, two-year contracts, if that, and understanding that the market is competitive. There's an anxiety a lot of us face. This is a dream job for me. I can finally relax a little, knowing I will be here long-term.
Q: What projects are you working on next? When can readers expect those?
Mailhot: I'm working on nonfiction. I recently lost my best friend, who was such a very strong woman. She made me part of her family when she realized I didn't have a lot of support, so for many years, she was a rock for me. Losing her shifted my goals as a writer. I would like to take some time to isolate a few ideas about my life, and sisterhood, and then cultivate something strong to honor her and friendship itself. Women have saved me, always. Whether it was aunties giving me a house to sleep over in or women writers helping me find my voice. I have the desire to put those relationships at the forefront of a narrative.

Texto completo: Robert Mueller's investigation is over, but questions still abound. Not about collusion, Russian interference or obstruction of justice, but about the leading lights of journalism who managed to get the story so wrong, and for so long.
It wasn't merely an error here or there. America's blue-chip journalists botched the entire story, from its birth during the presidential campaign to its final breath Sunday -- and they never stopped congratulating themselves for it. Last year the New York Times and Washington Post shared a Pulitzer Prize "for deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation's understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect's transition team and his eventual administration." A 2017 Time magazine cover depicted the White House getting a "makeover" to transform it into the Kremlin.
All based on a theory -- that the president of the United States was a Russian asset -- produced by a retired foreign spy whose work was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. An unbiased observer would have taken the theory's partisan provenance as a red flag, but most political journalists saw nothing but green lights. No unverified rumor was too salacious and no anonymous tip was too outlandish to print. From CNN to the Times and the Post, from esteemed and experienced reporters to opinion writers and bloggers, everyone wanted a share of the Trump-treason beat. What good is the 21st-century Watergate if you don't at least make an effort to cast yourself as the fearless journalist risking it all who got that one big tip that brought down a president?
Not only did the press fail to destroy Donald Trump's presidency; it provided voluminous evidence for his repeated charge of "fake news."
Take CNN. The network reported in December 2017 that Donald Trump Jr. received special email access to stolen documents before their public release by WikiLeaks -- an accusation that, if true, could have proved the president's inner circle was colluding with Russian hackers intent on taking down Mrs. Clinton. But it turned out "the most trusted name in news" misreported the dates on the unsolicited emails to the president's son. They had been sent to him days after WikiLeaks had published the pilfered documents. CNN still hasn't explained why it failed to do basic due diligence on such an important story.
Another CNN foul-up came in June 2017, the month after President Trump fired James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Trump said Mr. Comey had assured him three times that he wasn't under FBI investigation. The network reported Mr. Comey would directly refute the president's claim under oath. In reality, Mr. Comey's own memos explicitly confirmed Mr. Trump's statement.
A December 2016 Washington Post story "incorrectly said that Russian hackers had penetrated the U.S. electric grid," as a later editor's note acknowledged. "Authorities say there is no indication of that so far." Slate falsely claimed in October 2016 that Mr. Trump's computers were secretly sharing information with a Russian bank as part of a scheme to avoid detection.
Each new claim, true or not, became fodder for political pundits. Sure, there may be no actual smoking gun or verified information or anything even approximating evidence, but if you take all the disparate pieces and put them on the same corkboard, stand back at just the right distance, and squint really hard, you can almost make out a barrel and a plume of smoke.
Enter Jonathan Chait of New York magazine, author of the classic 2003 article "Why I Hate George W. Bush." ("I hate the way he walks. . . . I hate the way he talks. . . . I even hate the things that everybody seems to like about him.") Last July, before Mr. Trump met Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Mr. Chait penned a nearly 8,000-word piece titled "Will Trump Be Meeting With His Counterpart -- or His Handler?" Mr. Chait's speculation -- that "Trump has been a Russian asset since 1987" -- was worthy of the late Lyndon LaRouche.
In a January 2019 Twitter thread, meanwhile, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman asserted that "the failure to connect the dots on Trump-Russia" was one of the "big failures of 2016 campaign coverage." He added: "There is no sin quite as offensive as challenging conventional wisdom early, and then being proved right."
Many in Washington and around the country believed Mr. Mueller's investigation would put the entire issue to rest. If there was collusion, he'd find it. If there was obstruction of justice, he'd prosecute it. Whatever he found, the nation would accept it and move on. "The best thing for our country is that Trump is innocent and that Mueller tells us he's found nothing," Garrett Graff of Wired tweeted Thursday, the day before Mr. Mueller submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr. "Mueller got everything he wanted," Mr. Graff wrote Friday. "Never blocked by DOJ in pursuing something he requested. That's big."
But the next day, Mr. Graff excoriated Nikki Haley for agreeing: "No, everyone does not have to acknowledge that Trump didn't interfere with Mueller," Mr. Graff tweeted Saturday at the former United Nations ambassador. By Monday Mr. Graff was insisting that "a million questions" about Trump-Russia collusion remain.
Likewise, on Monday the irrepressible Mr. Chait insisted the president could still be guilty: "People who want to demonstrate their innocence make displays of cooperation with investigators," he wrote. "His flamboyant refusal to cooperate deprives Trump of any claim to having been cleared."
So much for accepting Robert Mueller's conclusions and recommendations. If your objective is to bring down Mr. Trump, nothing Mr. Mueller or anyone else finds -- or fails to find -- makes a difference. Mr. Trump didn't collude with Russia, but he did defeat Mrs. Clinton. From their behavior it is evident that many in the media view that as sufficient to establish his guilt. For them, the Trump-Russia investigation was never about protecting democracy or securing elections -- never mind telling the truth, which is supposed to be their job.

Texto completo: It wasn't exactly an auspicious start.
Within hours of publishing The Times's first Mini crossword, I'd set off a round of social media hand-wringing for including an abbreviated internet profanity, leading to some nervous moments when I wondered whether my first day on the job would also be my last. (I quickly edited the clue to reference a musical group -- "Pop duo with the 2011 #1 hit 'Party Rock Anthem"' -- instead of the slang.)
This was back in the summer of 2014 -- Aug. 21, to be exact. In the preceding months, The Times had designed and launched a new crossword app, and the Mini was part of the new package. The idea was simple: We wanted a way to encourage more people to try the main New York Times crossword puzzle, which is considered one of the toughest -- and which many beginner solvers find overly intimidating.
Enter the Mini. In consultation with The Times's crosswords editor Will Shortz, the product director Matt Hural alighted on the concept of adding a 5x5 crossword to the app, essentially a bite-size version of the regular puzzle. It would be offered every day, for free, right next to the main puzzle. The hope was that it would bring beginner solvers back each day until they were prepared to scale up.
As luck would have it, I was graduating college that same year. After several summers spent as an intern, I had recently been hired full-time as Will Shortz's editorial assistant. I was asked if I wanted to take on this Mini crossword gig and, of course, eagerly accepted.
I had made 25 full-size puzzles for The Times at that point, but this was a puzzle size and format that I had never tried before. And unlike other new products for The Times that might undergo rigorous user testing and market research, the actual content of the puzzles was left entirely up to me.
So the early days of the Mini were experimental, to put it kindly. Many of the initial Minis, for example, contained squares that were only crossed by one answer rather than two, a normally verboten feature in Times crosswords. And while I generally steered clear of text slang after that early fiasco, the rest of that first year was spent fiddling on an almost daily basis with the difficulty, tone and references, not sure what was going to set this little puzzle apart.
Over time, however, I grew to realize that the Mini had a few inherent advantages over its bigger counterpart. First, its diminutive size was actually a huge plus for a new generation of solvers. Because it took only a minute or two to complete, it was perfect for this mobile age of scattered attention spans and fractured free time.
Second, its relative ease of completion made it the perfect steppingstone for solvers who'd long been intimidated by the difficulty of the main puzzle. A large, untapped audience of beginners were now experiencing the joy of filling in that last square.
And finally, because every puzzle was made a few days before its publication date, the puzzle naturally felt more topical, with tie-ins to modern news or politics appearing days after they happened.
In late 2015, the Mini was incorporated into the main news app, and the audience for the puzzle took off. Today it's solved by hundreds of thousands of people across several platforms: in the newspaper, on nytimes.com, in our app. For a while it even appeared in The Times's daily Snapchat story.
As the person responsible for making each puzzle, it's been both thrilling and stress-inducing. After all, there are only so many vowel-heavy five-letter words. (Thanks, OBAMA!)
Sometimes I do genuinely worry that I'll run out of ideas. My solution has been to draw inspiration for puzzle seed words from all parts of life -- a conversation with a friend, the book I'm reading, what's going on in the news.
That way, the puzzle stays just as fresh for me as it does for the solver.

Trump was right to recognize Israel’s claim to the Golan Heights

Texto completo: Amid all of the breathless commentary on a report from special counsel Robert Mueller that has yet to see the light of day, the real news today came at the joint press conference between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

When the two leaders confirmed reports that the United States will recognize Israel’s right to the Golan Heights, they also struck a blow for real-world facts on the ground being superior to decades of diplomatic fiction.

When Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., early this year urged Trump to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over parts of the Golan Heights, I argued: “Control of the heights is tremendously important for the safety of people living in the northern part of Israel. If hostile powers control the heights, they can use the advantages of the elevation to rain attacks on the Israelis below. That’s exactly what Syrian artillery did to Israeli farmers in the 1950s and 1960s. Israel particularly fears Iranian presence on the heights through its proxy, the terrorist organization Hezbollah.”

Israel has controlled key portions of the Golan Heights since capturing them during the Six-Day War in 1967. That war began after repeated attacks on Israel, including from the Golan Heights, by Palestinian terrorists, followed by Egypt’s blockade of an Israeli port and by a joint mobilization of most of Israel’s Arab or Islamic neighbors. Acting in defense, Israel crushed the joint militaries of those nations and kept captured territories so as to make new aggression against Israel far less likely to meet success.

Israel went from control to full annexation of the Golan Heights in 1981, with no effective pushback from Syria since. In effect, therefore, all Trump did on Monday was recognize a territorial reality in effect for nearly 52 years and a political reality in effect for 38. Those are among the reasons why, as Ben Hubbard reported in the New York Times, the official recognition of Israeli sovereignty there “was met across much of the Arab world with a shrug.”

Some Islamic countries now are tacitly partnering with Israel against Iran. “As for Syria," the Times reports, "its own war has left the country so weak and ostracized that few care what it wants. ‘The Golan was always seen as the carrot that Israel would cede for peace with Syria, and now peace doesn’t matter, Syria doesn’t matter and maybe Syria doesn’t exist at the table as the legitimate owner of the land,’ said Kareem Sakka, editor in chief of Raseef22, an Arabic news site.”

To his credit, President Trump has spent two years shoring up the crucial U.S. friendship with Israel after eight years of Barack Obama’s thinly veiled hostility toward the Jewish nation. By recognizing not just the reality but the ethical nature of Israel’s claim to the Golan Heights, the president struck a blow not for destabilizing the Middle East, but for eliminating diplomatic detritus that gums up the works of peace talks.

Middle East peace should be based on the way things really are, not on the half-century-old fantasies of Islamists still angry that control of the Golan Heights back then did not enable them to push all Israeli Jews into the sea.

Beto O'Rourke picks 2020 campaign manager who helped Obama win re-election

Texto completo: Beto O’Rourke has chosen President Barack Obama’s 2012 deputy campaign manager to lead his bid for the White House in 2020.

“We’re excited that Jen O’Malley Dillon has joined our team,” O’Rourke said in a statement Monday. “Her leadership, experience and creativity will be a great addition to a campaign that is already doing so much to bring people together to overcome the greatest set of challenges this country has ever faced.”

Dillon, 43, told the New York Times that she joined the O’Rourke campaign because he signifies “a new generation of leadership I think we need.” The veteran strategist has worked for five presidential campaigns and is a former executive director of the Democratic National Committee.

“His leadership, his energy, his belief that you don’t have to segment voters and that you can be a president for all voters,” she said. “People are searching for that.”

Becky Bond, another senior O'Rourke aide, is an avowed socialist who blasted the leftist father of community organizing Saul Alinsky as a "paternalistic" moderate who "disparaged the idea of revolutionary change."

Dillon said she’s aiming to enhance O’Rourke’s campaign to accommodate a presidential primary race. At the same time, she said she is attempting to launch an operation “authentic to Beto and also efficient and allows us the most direct engagement with voters.”

“We have to build something that really is special and unique to him,” she said.

O’Rourke, 46, served as a congressman from El Paso from 2013 to 2019. He ran a surprisingly competitive campaign to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in the 2018 midterm elections in November, but lost by more than 2 percentage points.

Earlier this month O'Rourke announced his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination and currently places fourth in a crowded field of candidates in the RealClearPolitics average of polls.

Recycling crisis

Texto completo: Residents in all three localities will not be able to recycle plastic or glass beginning April 1.
Recently each locality announced they could not collect those recyclable materials because the company they utilize for that service, Sonoco, would no longer accept it. The business decision trickled down from a decision made by China. In 2017, the country announced that it no longer wanted to import U.S. recyclables, according to The New York Times.
The global market shift has impacted community recycling programs across the U.S., according to The Washington Post.
Here's exactly what you need to know about the change in the Valley.
Well, what can I recycle? The city of Staunton will still offer curbside recycling pickup. Residents can put out mixed paper, aluminum and glass.
The glass won't be recycled. It will be crushed up and used as refuse cover at the landfill.
The drop-off site in Waynesboro at North Delphine Avenue and 6th Street will still accept mixed paper, aluminum and glass.
Where will plastic go? The trash.
If residents bring plastic to the regional landfill it will go into the trash with everything else, said Greg Thomasson, Director of Solid Waste Management with the Augusta County Service Authority.
Edna Hunter, Owner of Augusta County Disposal, said there's not another recycling center nearby to take it.
"We didn't want to stop taking, but if they can't accept it we can't take it to Sonoco," said Hunter in a previous report from The News Leader.
"Unfortunately it will be taken as trash. It will have to go to the landfill. There is no other facility that was accepting plastic."
Important dates March 28 - The Augusta County Regional Landfill's last day to accept plastic recyclables.
March 30 - Waynesboro will suspend collection of drop-off recyclable plastics at its recycling center. It is also Augusta County Disposal's cutoff date to accept recyclables.
April 1 - The curbside pickup change is effective.
Wait, how did this happen? All three localities utilize the company Sonoco to take residents' recycling. Since July, the company has been shifting its business model that impacted how localities use it.
In July 2018, the company told Staunton it would increase the price for its services. It said it would bill the city $52,000 annually for the same services it once offered for just $3,100.
In February, the city of Staunton nixed the recycling bins at Gypsy Hill Park to try and save money as the Sonoco costs climbed.
It's happening everywhere. Cities nationwide are halting recycling programs as the cost continue to climb, according to The New York Times.

Texto completo: You got a new Instant Pot or air fryer over the holidays, and you’re learning to cook meals in new ways.
Or cooking shows on the Food Network or Netflix have inspired you to return to the oven and stovetop — chopping and sauteing, or roasting full meat-and-vegetable meals on one cookie sheet.
Has your microwave oven, once ubiquitous as a cooking tool, become the appliance you use only when you want to heat water for tea, reheat leftovers, prepare a packaged meal or pop your popcorn?
It doesn’t have to be.
Penn State Extension suggests taking another look at your microwave as a healthy cooking option.
“For example, microwaving sweet potatoes cuts down cook time by 50-55 minutes, and helps conserve their nutritional value,” says a 2018 Extension article. “All cooking methods cause foods to lose some of their nutrients, but the faster the potato cooks, the more nutrients it will retain. Baking a sweet potato in the microwave preserves far more nutrients (folate, vitamins A and C) than boiling it.”
We know our readers are still cooking dishes in their microwaves, and some shared their recipes with us.
Nancy Wenrich of Elizabethtown emailed us this one, which she says is her favorite microwave recipe.
MICROWAVE ENGLISH MUFFIN LOAF
Makes 16 slices.
Ingredients:
• 1 package dry yeast
• 2 1/2 cups unsifted flour
• 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
• 1/2 teaspoon salt
• 1/8 teaspoon baking soda
• 1 cup milk
• 1/4 cup water
• Cornmeal
Directions:
Combine yeast, 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, salt and baking soda.
Heat liquids until very warm. Add to dry mixture and beat well.
Stir in remaining 1 cup of flour to make a stiff batter. Spoon into a glass pan (8.5-by-4.5 inch) that has been well greased and sprinkled with cornmeal.
Sprinkle top with cornmeal. Cover. Let rise in a warm place for 45 minutes.
Microwave on high power for 6 minutes, 30 seconds. (Time may vary with your microwave.)
Surface of loaf will be flat and pale in color. Allow to rest 5 minutes before removing from the pan. Slice and toast to serve.
Note: If you are using skim milk, use 1 1/4 cups of it, and don’t use the water.
Reader Dean Putt submitted the following two recipes for vegetable dishes.
Here’s his recipe for scalloped potatoes. The conventional oven version of this recipe, he says, takes 45 minutes to cook at 375 degrees, while the microwave version takes half that.
SCALLOPED POTATOES
Ingredients:
• 2 1/2 cups sliced potatoes
• 2 tablespoons butter
• 2 tablespoons flour
• 1 cup milk
• 1/2 teaspoon salt
Directions:
Melt butter, add flour, milk and salt.
Microwave 4 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds until thickened.
Pour over potatoes and microwave for 20 minutes.
Putt says he got the following recipe from an Amish and Mennonite cookbook, converting it to a microwave version.
The original cooking time was 30 minutes in a 350-degree oven.
APPLES AND CARROTS
Ingredients:
• 1 cup carrots, cut in 1/2-inch pieces
• 3/4 cup apple slices
• 1 tablespoon honey
• 1/2 tablespoon butter
Directions:
Microwave carrots, covered with plastic wrap, for 2 minutes. Add apples, honey and butter.
Cover and microwave for 2 minutes.
Note: White corn syrup can be substituted for the honey if you’re making this for young children.
Want to use the microwave as a shortcut for making your Rice Krispie treats?
Here’s a recipe from Holly Mele of Mountville.
RICE KRISPIE TREATS
Ingredients:
• Cooking spray
• 1 stick butter

Gillum launches drive to register 1 million voters

Texto completo: THE BUZZ ON FLORIDA POLITICS

Andrew Gillum is launching a campaign that could change the dynamics of the 2020 election  even if he didnt announce a plan to run for president.

At a Wednesday rally at Florida Memorial Universitys Miami Gardens campus, Gillum rolled out an ambitious initiative to register one million new voters ahead of the presidential election. The Florida Democratic Party that its also spending $2 million to register 200,000 new voters.

Im tapping into that network  what we built from the campaign, the enthusiasm, the volunteers, the infrastructure, the assets there  and trying to turn all of that energy and effort into registering and engaging one million voters in advance of the 2020 election, the 39-year-old former Tallahassee mayor and past gubernatorial candidate told the Miami Herald.

Florida Democrats hope to reinforce a slipping voter advantage in a crucial swing state that voted for Donald Trump two years ago after twice casting its vote for Barack Obama.

Over the 10 years from the time Obama was first elected in 2008 to the November midterms, Florida Democrats saw a 700,000-voter lead over Republicans dwindle to roughly 260,000.

And that lead didnt hold up when it came to voter participation in the fall when, despite Democratic gains around the country, Republican voters turned out in greater numbers than Democrats and propelled Ron DeSantis to a win of less than half a percentage point over Gillum.

So, after receiving plenty of help courting new voters during his campaign from registration-minded political organizations like Tom Steyers NextGen America, Gillum said he hopes to build on the enthusiasm that resulted in a roughly 33 percent statewide turnout increase over the 2014 midterms.

At the same time, he also wants to do more to reach out to unlikely and unregistered voters around the state, but particularly in places like South Florida, where some party activists felt that the Democratic Party did too little to court Hispanic and black voters in the past election.

To me, its absolutely critical, not just to this election cycle but to the future of politics in the state of Florida, to get back into the business of engaging people where they live, talking to them outside the election and being in contact with them, Gillum said. So when we do reach out to them for their vote theyre not saying, Its been a long time and I havent talked to you. Why should we believe in you? 

Miami-Dade County was among the regions where turnout among Democratic voters was low compared to the rest of the state, one of the key reasons Gillum lost the race. He said South Florida remains one of the most important areas for connecting with unregistered and disenfranchised voters.

From a numbers perspective, South Florida is where a heavy percentage of these new voters are going to come from. The population there is one that I think is critical for us when we consider communities largely left out or left behind, he said.

Gillum says the effort wont be entirely partisan, but he plans to work in conjunction with the Florida Democratic Party and left-leaning organizations like New Florida Majority and Florida Immigration Coalition. In announcing their own effort Wednesday, Florida Democrats said there are more than 4 million eligible but unregistered voters in the state, and the party will be partnering with data science firms and building out infrastructure to grow the ranks of registered Democrats.

Gillum declined in an interview to explicitly say that he isnt going to run for the partys nomination in 2020, although he indicated in a New York Times interview that hes closed that door.

Hurricane a disaster for Florida prisons

After Hurricane Michael hit the Panhandle, a key portion of the states corrections system was crippled, leaving nearly 300 prison employees displaced and more than 5,000 relocated inmates packing facilities across Florida.

New figures obtained by the News Service of Florida show a significant problem in a region where a sizable part of the workforce is employed by the corrections system and a good chunk of the states inmate population is housed.

It has taken months to know exactly how bad the Oct. 10 storm has impacted the regions 23 prisons. But officials with the Florida Department of Corrections said last week that in addition to tens of millions of dollars in damage to facilities, the storm also displaced 284 prison employees, increased job vacancies and forced shifting 5,000 inmates to facilities across the state.

Nearly 800 prison employees who lost or sustained severe damage to their homes in the storm have received a total of $450,000 in assistance from the Corrections Foundation, a nonprofit organization established to aid the Department of Corrections.

The department is also struggling to fill vacancies in the hurricane-impacted areas. Before the hurricane hit, the regions 23 prisons had a vacancy rate of 12 percent. As of Feb. 22, that vacancy rate had ticked up to 14 percent, with vacancies for prison guards and probation officers.

Michael Van Sickler and Amy Hollyfield contributed to this report, which also uses information from the News Service of Florida.

AFGHAN VILLAGERS HAVE LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO FIGHT THE TALIBAN AND THEY ARE KILLED IN HORRIFIC NUMBERS, YET MUST JOIN THE SECURITY FORCES TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES, WRITE DAVID ZUCCHINO AND FAHIM ABED OF THE NEW YORK TIMES

Texto completo: SHEMAL, Afghanistan
Janat Bebe sent a son and two grandsons to the Afghan National Police force to fight the Taliban. All three returned home last year in coffins, borne up to a cemetery high above their mountainside village of mud and stone.
The village, Shemal, has only about 3,000 residents, but it has lost nearly 60 police officers and soldiers in combat, at once devastating and impoverishing the hamlet. "They had no choice except to join, because we have no other way to earn a living here," Ms Bebe said of her son and grandsons. They left behind 17 children whom she must now feed, clothe and educate.
Afghanistan's war is killing at a staggering rate. President Ashraf Ghani said in January that 45,000 soldiers and police officers had died in combat since late 2014. In recent months, the pace has been 30 to 40 deaths a day, a toll that one senior U.S. commander described to Congress as "not sustainable."
In a country that has endured 40 years of war, each death is a fresh blow to families and communities that have already borne too much.
That is one reason for heightened interest in peace talks between the United States and the Taliban that for some have raised hopes for an end to war - or at least for an interlude of peace.
But parents like Ms. Bebe and Shen Gul, 70, who lost two policemen sons to Taliban ambushes in northern Afghanistan, are uneasy about what peace might bring.
Mostly, they fear that a deal might bring the Taliban into government, putting a hated enemy of their families into power.
But there is also the worry that a truce might lead to reprisals against their family members in the security forces - or end their jobs and the salaries that have become so important to their families.
"If they dissolve the army, the Taliban may kill them," Mr. Gul said of his five sons who still serve in the security forces.
Many soldiers and police officers say they join out of patriotism and a sense of national duty. But their salaries also sustain extended families and, in villages like Shemal, an entire local economy.
"We depend so much on their salaries - without them, we have nothing," said Malik Ajmer Khan, 53, a village elder whose own son is among some 300 village men he said have joined the security forces in the 18-year war.
Mr. Khan said the village cannot survive solely on its wheat and corn crops, or on the goats that roam steep mountain paths leading to the village.
Accessible by car and then by foot via a muddy track beneath the snow-dusted peaks of eastern Afghanistan, Shemal is so remote that Mr. Khan said some villagers have never visited nearby Jalalabad - or any city.
Ms. Bebe said she had to sell her home after her son and grandsons were killed in a Taliban ambush at their outpost in Zabul province a year ago. Her husband died fighting the Soviets in the 1980s, she said. By Afghan custom, she now heads an extended family that includes the dead policemen's three widows.
Surrounded by her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, Ms. Bebe wore pink sneakers and a robe fastened with a plastic hair clip. She held the youngest, Gulab, an infant whose name means "roses." She was born after her father died.
Police officers, who are frequently in combat but are not usually as heavily armed as members of the army, suffer higher casualty rates than soldiers do.
They are often the last line of defense at small, rural defensive positions that are vulnerable to being overrun by the Taliban in the face of 1,700 insurgent attacks a month, as recorded nationwide late last year.
Despite the escalating body count, military and police jobs are still prized.
Police recruiters in the home provinces of Ms. Bebe and Mr. Gul said they had more volunteers than they could accommodate.
Farid Khan, a police spokesman in Nangarhar province, which includes Shemal, said hundreds of recruits are waiting their turns to join units. Most formations stay at or near full strength because of the backlog of volunteers, he said.
Army recruiting totals in Kunduz province have doubled since last year, to 300 to 400 a month, said Col. Abdul Qadier, head of army recruiting there. He said an economic crisis in neighboring Iran has prompted Afghans to stop looking for work there and apply to the army instead.
"There are no other job opportunities," Col. Qadier said.
There also are problems with inflated personnel counts in both the army and the police. Officials say they are trying to crack down on misreporting by commanders who sometimes create "ghost soldiers" in their units to skim the salaries. And the horribly high casualty rate, coupled with a continuing but hushed problem with desertion, creates a constant struggle to train wave after wave of new recruits.
A report last month by the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction said reported security force strength dropped by nearly 4,000 troops last year - to the lowest level since January, 2015.
Starting police officers earn about $155 a month, according to the Afghan Ministry of Interior. Ms. Bebe's son, Mahmood Jan, and one grandson, Gulab, had served 10 years, and the other grandson, Sekander, served three.
Ms. Bebe said she was overwhelmed by funeral expenses for the three men.
Nearly the entire village turned out for each multi-day service, costing her thousands of dollars to feed mourners.
Families receive a dead police officer's annual salary for funeral expenses.
They are also supposed to be paid long-term cash benefits, which are typically received months later after a slog through government bureaucracy.
In Shemal, villagers have opened their homes to the policemen's widows and children, Ms. Bebe said. Her family moves from home to home while she earns cash cleaning houses.
Asked about the lasting effects of her son's and grandsons' deaths, Ms. Bebe replied, "Of course I feel sorrow, but I'm proud because they died defending their country. They died in a very good way."

A 'glide path' makes a swift ascent into vernacular

Texto completo: On "The PBS NewsHour" last month, South Bend, Ind., mayor and likely presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg (pronounced "BOOT-ih-jidge") said that making a version of Medicare available for all Americans would provide "a very natural glide path to a single-payer environment."
A few days later, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said of the state's financial woes, "We're on a glide path to fixing this." And shortly after that, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow described President Trump's budget as "a steady glide path" toward lower federal borrowing as a percent of the nation's GDP.
What's a "glide path," and why do so many people suddenly seem to be on it?
An aeronautical term that first appeared during the 1930s, "glide path" refers to the proper slope of descent for an aircraft preparing to land. Just to reassure any non-pilots out there, a "glide path" is a safe, by-the-book track; it has nothing to do with being forced to "glide" to a landing without power because the engine has died.
People started using "glide path" metaphorically during the 1970s. The earliest example I could find came in a New York Times piece by the economist Leonard Silk on August 15, 1973: "Keeping the economy on the right glide path for a soft landing will require strong nerves and quick reflexes."
Today most people use "glide path," as Buttigieg, Lamont and Kudlow did, to denote a gradual, comfortable transition to a desired outcome. When the Boston Red Sox clinched the home-field post-season advantage last September, for instance, the FenwayNation website gloated with a gleeful glissando: "It's glide-path time!"
But, as Silk's usage suggests, "glide path" can also denote a descent to an ambiguous or even negative outcome. In a recent issue of The Atlantic, John Temple accused the owners of the Denver Post of "carefully managing the newspaper's glide path to oblivion," while last January, the New York Times reported that German Prime Minister Angela Merkel was on a "glide path out of power."
Likewise, financial planners use "glide path" to describe the gradual decline in the value of retirees' assets as they head toward - gulp - death.
As these citations suggest, the connotation of a "glide path" depends on the ultimate destination. For the Red Sox, it's the next World Championship; for retirees, it's the next world. When you encounter "glide path," it's probably best to fasten your seat belt, raise your seat to the upright position, and hope for a happy landing.

Texto completo: I used the free photo sharing site Flickr for a long time. It's where I uploaded most of my photos over the past 14 years. But then I got an e-mail from Flickr threatening to delete my pics unless I was willing to pony up $50 a year.
So I looked to see how many pictures I had on Flickr. I logged in and scrolled through more than a decade of memories: snapshots of my road trip to Van Buren, Maine; my visit to the “Goonies" house in Astoria, Ore.; vacation adventures in Hawaii, Miami, New Orleans . . . so many memories. All told, there were nearly 7,000 images and videos chronicling my travels, and Flickr was holding them for ransom.
A red box appeared on my computer screen. It was a message from Flickr, reminding me that from now on their free accounts would be limited to 1,000 photos or videos, and unless I paid up, my account would be purged on Feb. 5. It was a not-so-gentle reminder that online cloud services can change their pricing at any time — or go out of business entirely, and take all your precious photos with them.
SAVE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA
Just because you've uploaded your latest pics to Facebook, Flickr, or any other website doesn't mean they're safe, according to Sara Day Thomson, a spokeswoman for the Digital Preservation Coalition, a UK-based nonprofit that's dedicated to safeguarding digital content.
Social media sites, she explained, “are designed for sharing, not archiving."
“Holding all this data is expensive for platforms — keeping those massive servers up and running is a huge expense," she said. The bottom line: They don't have an incentive to hold onto your photos if they're not making money.
“These conditions make your social media content very vulnerable to loss," she said.
So what can you do to make sure your travel photos and other digital keepsakes survive for the next generation?
There's really only one solution: Download everything from your social media accounts.
That's what I ended up doing with my Flickr account. Instead of forking over 50 bucks, I chose to download all of my photos and videos.
Thomson says you should do this with all of your social media accounts. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Google all offer the option of downloading your data (just log in and go to “settings," and you'll be on your way to preserving your digital legacy).
After you download your stuff from each account, make a backup copy. And then make this a regular habit.
“Social media marketing professionals or other highly active users should download their data every three to six months," said Thomson.
For more casual users, downloading every six to12 months should do, she said.
“Just set a reminder so you don't forget," she said.
DON'T GET STUCK WITH LOW-RES IMAGES
When it comes to social media, another thing to keep in mind is photo quality (or lack thereof). Every time you share a photo on social media, the chances are good that your image is getting compressed. Facebook automatically resizes and reformats every photo, which reduces the quality of the image.
But there is a way to upload higher resolution images and videos to Facebook. If you're using Facebook's mobile app on your phone, go to the account settings and choose to upload photos and videos in HD.
To do this on an iPhone, tap the menu button at the bottom right of the screen, scroll down and tap “settings and privacy," then choose “settings." Scroll down to “media and contacts" and then open “videos and photos," and make sure the “upload HD" button is switched to green.
If you're using an Android phone, open the Facebook app and go to “settings and privacy," then select “settings," and tap “media and contacts." Then choose “upload photos in HD" and “upload videos in HD."
DRIVES DON'T LAST FOREVER
You should always keep multiple copies of your important photos in different locations. That means if you have a photo on your phone and a copy living in the cloud, you should back it up on an external hard drive or thumb drive, too.
But as time goes on, you'll need to update those back-ups. Don't wait to move your files off of an old thumb drive — take the time to transfer them to a new device while you still can.
“Digital storage devices go out of date fairly quickly," Thomson said. “Some go out of date more quickly than others — flash drives have a very short life span and are extremely vulnerable to damage — though some are better than others."
She added, “Even external drives, which are sturdier, will fail after a while."
If you're using an external hard drive that's three to five years old, it's probably time to upgrade, according to Thomson.
And don't forget to label your storage devices. Take it from me: you don't want to end up with a drawer full of unidentifiable USB drives. Write up a cheat sheet that describes what each drive looks like and what it contains. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later.
CLOUD STORAGE
Brian X. Chen is a consumer technology reporter and author of the Tech Fix column for The New York Times, and he's tried out several different ways of managing smartphone photos. When it comes to cloud storage, he recommends using Google Photos to back up pictures. He says it's also an easy way to organize your pics.
Google Photos “takes advantage of artificial intelligence to help you organize and dig up photos," said Chen. “You could search for photos by typing in the word 'dog' and bring up all your photos of dogs, for instance."
There are plenty of other cloud storage options out there, too (such as iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, Amazon Drive, Box, or MediaFire). Just make sure you read the fine print, because pricing and restrictions on storage can vary, depending on which service you choose.
For example, Snapfish allows unlimited storage for your photos, as long as you purchase at least one Snapfish product each year (it could be a single 4x6 print — which is not a bad deal, as long as you remember to do it). Shutterfly, on the other hand, also promises free unlimited storage, which sounds great, until you read their fine print, and realize they don't offer full-resolution downloading.
Even if you find the perfect cloud storage solution for your needs, just remember that the services offered by these companies can change at any time, according to Thomson.
“Companies merge or go out of business — make sure you're aware of changes to the services offered by the cloud storage provider you use," she said. “If services change for the worse or go out of business, get your data to safety and move it to a more reliable cloud storage provider."
PRINT 'EM
Another way to preserve your favorite photos is to go old-school, and make hard copies that you can actually hold in your hand.
“There are plenty of printing services that do this if you don't have your own printer," said Chen. “I'm a big fan of framing my favorite photos via an app called Keepsake. You just upload your photo through the Keepsake smartphone app and pick a frame, and the photo ships to you framed. It's not very expensive, the frames look attractive, and framed photos always make a great gift for people."
And you don't have to spend much to print your photos the old-fashioned way, either. Snapfish, York Photo, and Walmart have prices that start as low as 9 cents per print. Slip the prints into an album, pop a couple in frames, or make a collage.
Another creative way to preserve your vacation remembrances is to put them in a photo book. Snapfish, Shutterfly, and Google are among the many companies that offer easy templates that you can use to design your own custom photo books. Be sure to take advantage of sales, too — Snapfish and Shutterfly regularly offer discount codes that can save you a bundle.
Put all your favorite photos from 2018 into one book, and you'll have a year of your travels nicely organized. Then make it an annual tradition. It's a fun way to make sure your vacation memories are preserved for many years to come.

Texto completo: Anne Welsh McNulty, a former managing director at Goldman Sachs and now the chief executive of the McNulty Foundation, is focused on locating and nurturing the next generation of formidable leaders. In the last three years alone, she has given more than $18 million to organizations with that goal in mind, including creating the annual $100,000 McNulty Prize for individuals willing to address seemingly intractable problems. She's also developing leadership programs for women at Villanova University and for men and women at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Her imprint also can be found at schools like St. Joseph's University and Hunter College, where she is cultivating female movers and shakers in math and science. Ms. McNulty lives in an apartment in Downtown Manhattan and spends as much time as she can with her three grown children.

OLD SCHOOL MEDIA I generally get up at 7:30 or 8 a.m., which is a little later than the rest of the week. For me, as long as I can remember, Sunday morning has always meant "CBS News Sunday Morning." It's also the day I read the print version of The New York Times instead of the digital version.
JOE AND JOHNNY I'm not a big brunch person, so around 10:30, I go to Joe Coffee Company on East 13th Street, because it's around the corner and because it has good coffee and muffins. Plus, it's on The New School campus and right next to N.Y.U., so I get a good dose of feeling like a college student. My son Johnny lives in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, which means I don't get to see him as often as when he lived a few blocks away, but he is often in Manhattan on the weekends to coach improv comedy, so sometimes he'll come with me.
KISS THE RING My first grandchild, whom I call Baby K, was born in September. She led a successful coup to replace me as the head of the family. My daughter, Brynne, and my son-in-law Julio work in Bogotá, Colombia, and when Baby K brings them to town, I'm the first one to kiss the ring, or the pacifier, as it were. If Baby K agrees, I take my daughter out to lunch at Fig & Olive on Lexington.
I WANT TO RIDE MY (TEMPORARY) BICYCLE This is followed by a trip to SoulCycle, where I get my dose of endorphins and check in with myself and ask important questions such as, "Why the hell did I let Brynne talk me into this?" When Baby K is not in town, I'm still on a bike, but in a much more relaxed manner and setting with my boyfriend, Bruce McEver. He's an investment banker and a published poet. We like to rent Citi Bikes and pedal around Central Park. They're big and slow and easy to see coming -- perfect for Sunday in the park with 60-somethings.
FUR BABY Finn, my other grandchild, is a big White Swiss Shepherd. When I say big, I mean about 70 pounds. He belongs to my son Kevin, who works in Connecticut but lives in the West Village on the weekends. Whenever possible, I like to walk with them in Washington Square Park. Kevin always gets leash duty -- Finn is a sweetheart but full of so much energy that he needs to be out for at least an hour. Probably a third of that time is taken up by young women stopping Kevin to ask to pet Finn. I understand now why Kevin chose him.
TAKING IN THE SIGHTS I always make time to call or FaceTime my mother, who is 94 and lives outside of Philadelphia. I lived in Short Hills, New Jersey for 20 years before moving to Manhattan eight years ago, so I'm happy to say that I do far more New York things than I expected or than I did when I was a tourist. One of the best things about my apartment is that I live near the Strand bookstore, which I consider a cathedral of culture. If I'm not at the Strand, I'm at Washington Square, Central Park, the Met Opera, the Metropolitan Museum, MoMA or the High Line.
DINNER WITH FRIENDS I'm out of town a lot during the week, so I catch up with friends on the weekends, either at the Regency Bar & Grill on Park Avenue if I'm on the Upper East Side with Bruce -- we have a long-distance uptown-downtown relationship -- or the Gotham Bar and Grill on 12th Street if I'm home.
VIEWS FROM THE COUCH By 9:30 p.m., I'm usually at home being a couch potato. Bruce never watched much TV, but I'm converting him to my bad habits. We got hooked on "Stranger Things" on Netflix and now we're watching "Outlander," a historical time-travel show on Starz. I try to make it to bed by 11.

Texto completo: Shortly after the creation of Israel in May 1948, a small band of Jewish spies set up shop in Beirut - literally a kiosk - as part of the country's first intelligence station in an Arab nation. To Lebanese citizens, the men inside the refreshment stand by the Three Moons elementary school couldn't have looked suspicious. Every morning, they hawked pencils, candy and sandwiches. Equally as crucial, if not more so, the Jewish shopkeepers/spies looked and sounded just like their customers, many of whom were connected to the government or the army. These Jews hailed from the Arab world - Syria or Yemen - and, as Israeli agents, had studied the Islamic and Christian worlds so they could blend in, obtain intelligence and relay it back to headquarters.
"The spies were not . . . navigating candlesticks and crystal at dinner parties, or insinuating themselves into the corridors of power," writes Matti Friedman in his new book, "Spies of No Country: Secret Lives at the Birth of Israel." "Their position was like that of Russian agents tasked with gleaning intelligence not from Capitol Hill or Wall Street but from the sidewalk outside a public school in Queens."
But the spies hated labeling themselves with such a sinister term. They preferred the Hebrew word "mista'arvim," which, translated into English, means: "ones who become like Arabs."
Like most anything written about Israel and Palestine, "Spies of No Country" will either repel or attract you, depending on your political perspective. If you're pro-Israel, Friedman's book offers a cast of humble, hardworking and brave characters who overcame prejudices in their old and new homelands for the greater cause of Judaism. But if you think of Israel less as a victim and more of a victimizer, then Friedman's book might feel like hagiography, yet another work that idealizes the history of the Israeli military and intelligence apparatus.
It's also impossible to read "Spies of No Country" without taking into account the background of its author. Friedman, a former Associated Press journalist who lives in Jerusalem, caused a dustup five years ago when he publicly blamed the "global mania about Israeli actions" on the media, including his former employer, needling the press for its aggressive coverage of the Israeli military and for portraying Palestinians as "passive victims." (Friedman's articles caused such an uproar that the AP issued a lengthy statement blasting his arguments for their "distortions, half-truths and inaccuracies.")
But in his newest book, Friedman, a contributing opinion writer for the New York Times, focuses just as much on Israel's earliest conflicts with Muslims as on Israel's problems with itself. "Spies of No Country" is the story of four men who fled their Arab homelands to join a new country whose Jews initially hailed mostly from Europe and, more often than not, looked down on Jews from the Islamic world. Friedman's four spies are Gamliel Cohen and Isaac Shoshan, both born in Syria; Havakuk Cohen, from Yemen; and Yakuba Cohen, a native of British Palestine. (The Cohens aren't related.)
Yes, we learn about the quartet's daring exploits, such as the time Shoshan and others in the Jewish military tried assassinating a popular sheikh in the port city of Haifa, or another time when some of them helped a fifth comrade, Eliyahu Rika , blow up a 443-foot yacht that once belonged to Adolf Hitler off Beirut in late 1948. But, admirably, Friedman seems to be telling this story for larger purposes. He wants to shine a light on a band of Arab-born operatives often overlooked in the stories of Israel's founding as a Holocaust refuge led by Europeans in the Zionist movement.
More broadly, though, Friedman also wants to help Westerners understand that Israel's demographics have massively shifted over time. He writes that about half of the Jewish population has "roots in the Islamic world." In his telling, Israel's early leaders didn't see or appreciate the rising tide of men like the spies featured in this tale.
Jews had lived for centuries, and quite peacefully, in the Islamic world, from North Africa to Iraq. But when Israel was established, Jews in those countries were threatened, their bank assets frozen or, worse, they were killed. So they fled en masse to Israel, often, as Friedman notes, with the help of "covert immigration agents" shepherding them onto ships or planes. In the Israeli immigration camps, the sounds of Arabic drowned out the Yiddish of other Jews. The Arab Jews helped build the country and now significantly influence Israeli culture. Mainstream musicians in Israel, Friedman points out, "are now singing in Arabic, Persian and Ladino."
The Jews who founded Israel tend to be mythologized as those who hailed from Europe and worked as pioneers on kibbutzes. As Friedman tells it, the country's earliest founders largely ignored or dismissed contributions from Jews of the Arab world. "People trying to forge a Jewish state in the Middle East should have seen that Jews from the Middle East could be helpful," he writes. "The newcomers might have been invited to serve as equal partners in the creation of this new society, but they weren't. Instead, they were condescended to, and pushed to the fringes. It was one of the state's worst errors, one for which we're still paying."
One of the more odious examples Friedman found was an April 1949 article in the Daily Haaretz newspaper, which dispatched a reporter to a camp housing Arabic-speaking Jews from North Africa. The journalist, Aryeh Gelblum, wrote that the newcomers had "savage primitive instincts" and an "inability to comprehend anything intellectual . . . an even lower level than that of the former Palestinian Arabs."
The book is most engaging when Friedman sticks with one character, in one timeline and in one scene. But often, "Spies of No Country" veers from one timeline to the next and from one spy to the next, and it's hard to keep track of who's doing what and when, especially because each of the four spies has aliases that Friedman also uses. Halfway through the book, I tore out an early page listing their real and fake names and mug shots and tacked it to a wall as a much-needed reference. (In this way, I felt a bit like a spy myself.) Friedman relies mostly on interviews he conducted with one of the spies, Shoshan, who is still alive; for the other three, who died, Friedman has to resort to oral histories they supplied or military archives.
Despite those obstacles, Friedman's book was still illuminating. When I was done, I couldn't stop thinking about the men inside the Beirut kiosk, selling candy and pencils to schoolchildren while secretly listening to a transistor radio tucked in the back, trying to pick up news from home.
Friedman's main character, Shoshan, described the set-up in a way that feels like a metaphor for the double lives of spies and of Arab Jews: "The inside of the store is strategic for us because from the outside you can't see what's going on inside, and in the middle is a partition of cupboards behind which it is possible to organize and hide many things without being seen."
Ian Shapira is a Washington Post reporter who often writes about the intelligence and military communities.

Texto completo: Please, let's stop pretending that the college cheating scandal is just an indictment of overindulgent, wealthy helicopter parents.
The Justice Department has accused dozens of super-rich parents of making $25 million in illegal payments - and, in some cases, taking a tax break to boot - to get their children into selective colleges.
If true, these parents broke the law. They could face some prison time. But in the coming weeks, a lot of parents and their children, who've been legitimately accepted to pricey colleges, will make a move to put themselves in another type of prison.
Certain madness takes over this time of year - between late March and early April - when the college acceptance letters are sent out.
Hearts are elated if children are accepted to prestigious public and private universities. Then comes the financial reality: Going to these dream colleges often means taking on substantial student loans.
Outstanding student-loan debt at the end of last year was $1.5 trillion. Education debt ranks second in consumer debt nationwide behind mortgages.
Parents will sentence themselves and their children to decades of debt because they believe attending a select school is a must for their children to succeed. They will trade financial stability for the status symbol of a brand-name college education.
The recent admissions scam has been used to underscore the pressure parents and students are under to get into "better" schools, as if the thousands of other colleges and universities in the country just aren't good enough. Heaven forbid you suggest a student attend a community college first, if money is woefully lacking.
The pushback is typically substantial - and illogical.
Dripping with disdain, parents and students say that if the acceptance to an elite college doesn't happen, there is always the "safety school."
What's financially sound and safe about struggling under the weight of enough debt to equal the price of a home?
And the financial imprisonment is even harder for low-income families, particularly minorities. Many students from these homes run out of money before they can graduate. They end up with debt and no degree.
Last fall, I met a mother at a financial-literacy program in Delaware who was very concerned about how to pay her parent PLUS loans. She had taken out more than $100,000 to help send her child to the top-rated University of Michigan to study to be a teacher.
I asked her why she didn't send her daughter to a school in her home state or somewhere close by so she could commute and reduce the cost of attendance.
"It's where she really wanted to go, and she worked hard to get into Michigan," the mom said with pride.
But studies have shown that the determination and hard work the child demonstrated would have helped her succeed wherever she ended up going to college.
"A sort of mania has taken hold, and its grip seems to grow tighter and tighter," wrote New York Times op-ed columnist Frank Bruni in his 2015 book "Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be."
It's the "elite edge" that drives many parents and students to put themselves in financial jeopardy, Bruni pointed out.
What about the connections a child will make at a premier institution, you might ask?
Gallup asked 5,100 graduates about the career helpfulness of their undergraduate alumni networks.
Just 9 percent of graduates said the school network has been very helpful or helpful to them in the job market, according to Gallup, which released the findings earlier this year.
Just one in six alumni from schools ranked in the top 50 by U.S. News and World Report reported that their alumni network has been useful to them in the job market.
"While these alumni are slightly more likely than alumni from lower-ranked schools to perceive their alumni network as helpful, the differences are relatively minor and unlikely to offset the significant differences in tuition costs," Gallup said.
What can markedly make a difference in job success for a student?
What helps tremendously is an internship during college in which a graduate can apply what he or she is learning, Gallup said.
Long before the current admissions scandal, Bruni wrote, "The admissions game is too flawed and too rigged to be given so much credit. For another, the nature of a student's college experience - the work that he or she puts into it, the skills that he or she picks up, the self-examination that's undertaken, the resourcefulness that's honed - matters more than the name of the institution attended."
Stop the madness. Don't succumb to admissions mania that can condemn you and your kid to a life of crushing debt.

New Zealand quick with gun action

Texto completo: When a terrorist massacred 50 people at two New Zealand mosques, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern immediately grasped the nettle. "I can tell you one thing right now," she told a news conference. "Our gun laws will change."
That's what effective leadership looks like. New Zealand's Cabinet has now agreed in principle to overhaul those laws, experts are reviewing ways to make the country safer from firearms and, Ardern promised, "within 10 days of this horrific act of terrorism, we will have announced reforms."
More Americans die from guns every 10 weeks than died in the entire Afghanistan and Iraq wars combined, yet we still don't have gun safety rules as rigorous as New Zealand's even before the mosques were attacked.
The National Rifle Association (not to be confused with the vast majority of gun owners) will turn to its old smoke-and-mirrors standby, arguing that the killer's hate, not his guns and bullets, were the real problem.
But while it's true that white supremacy is deadly and needs to be confronted, without the weapons of mass murder, 50 New Zealand worshippers would still be alive; 17 Parkland, Fla., schoolchildren and staff members would still be alive; nine Charleston, S.C., churchgoers would still be alive; 11 Pittsburgh congregants would still be alive; 58 Las Vegas concertgoers would still be alive; 26 Newtown, Conn., first-graders and adults would. ...
Why can't leaders in America learn from experience, the way leaders in other countries do? After a massacre in Australia in 1996, the government there took far-reaching action to tighten gun policy. In contrast, every day in America, another hundred people die from gun violence and 300 more are injured.
In fairness, liberals have often been unhelpful, broadcasting their own ignorance about the firearms they propose to regulate, or speaking blithely of banning guns or of "gun control" in ways that drive responsible gun owners into the arms of the NRA. I suggest dropping references to "gun control" and instead speaking of "gun safety."
It's also true that there are no simple solutions. But gun laws do make a difference. When Connecticut tightened licensing laws in 1995, firearm homicide rates dropped by 40 percent. And when Missouri eased gun laws in 2007, gun homicide rates surged by 25 percent.
Astonishingly, about 22 percent of guns in the U.S. are still acquired without a background check. In parts of the U.S., you need a more thorough background check to adopt a dog than to acquire a semi-automatic AR-15 weapon.
The House passed a bill last month to require universal background checks, but it has little chance in the Senate this year.
Another basic step: Keep guns out of the hands of people shown to present a danger to themselves or others, such as when they are suicidal or threatening a domestic partner. Fourteen states have such "red flag" laws, and similar legislation is before Congress.
We should likewise invest more in "smart guns" that can be fired only by an authorized person; it's outrageous that my phone requires a PIN or fingerprint but that an AR-15 doesn't. That would help with the estimated 200,000 guns stolen each year.
The regulatory model to follow is automobiles. We haven't outlawed cars, but we have required safety modifications (seat belts, air bags) and limited access to them (licenses, bans after drunken driving) in ways that have sharply reduced the fatality rate per miles driven.
If we took this approach to guns, many Americans would still die. But experts have suggested to me that we could plausibly reduce gun deaths by about one-third, saving 13,000 lives a year.
Nicholas Kristof writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

How to stem 'subscription creep'

Texto completo: From Netflix, Spotify and Amazon Prime to Blue Apron, Birchbox and beer of the month, your debit or credit card statements are likely littered with subscriptions that are costing you dearly.
Not that all subscriptions are bad.
You might be happy to pay a monthly fee to work out at the gym or type in Microsoft Office 365. But maybe the benefits of subscribing to credit monitoring or razors by mail were, uh, more fleeting.
Recurring charges can be insidious, some eating away at your wealth when you don't value the subscription anymore. Three $30-per-month subscriptions don't sound like much until you realize they total nearly $1,100 per year.
Inertia leads to a dozen free trials morphing into mainstays on your Mastercard. (Maybe not much longer, though. Mastercard has said it will require merchants to get your approval to proceed with charges after a free trial ends, although it applies only to physical-product subscriptions, like home-delivered sampler boxes .)
"The situation with subscriptions could end up being death by a thousand cuts when it comes to your budget," says Bruce McClary, spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.
Adding to the problem are so-called gray charges, deceptive and unwanted credit and debit card charges that stem from misleading sales and billing practices. They total more than $14 billion a year among U.S. cardholders, or $215 each, per a 2013 study by industry research firm Aite Group.
Here's how to spring-clean recurring charges so you can spend on things that matter to you more.
SUBSCRIPTION AUDIT: Job No. 1 is to identify recurring charges. Scan recent payment statements, including credit cards, debit cards or online accounts, like PayPal. Go back 12 months to catch auto-renew annual subscriptions. Don't ignore the analog world: lawn mowing, home security monitoring, pest-control service and memberships in social and professional organizations. Some credit card issuers, like Citi, identify recurring charges in your online account.
MULTIPLY BY 12: A frog in a stovetop pot of water will complacently boil to death if you raise the temperature slowly, the saying goes. Accumulating monthly subscriptions is similar. To feel the full impact, multiply monthly charges by 12 to get an annualized idea of what you're spending. If you see yourself keeping the subscription five years, do that math too. Then, a seemingly insignificant $30-per-month expense becomes $1,800.
"On the surface, subscription costs may seem minimal, but when you add them up it can really pinch your monthly budget," says Paul Golden, spokesman for the National Endowment for Financial Education. "If you're putting subscriptions on your credit card, is that hindering your ability to pay off your balance each month? If so, this is a red flag."
REASSESS VALUE: Do you use and value the subscription? A gym membership is perhaps the best example of a noble subscription gone wrong - when you quit going but continue paying.
Ask yourself if a subscription saves you money or
time. Has it lived up to its promise? Does a delivered subscription box bring you joy or guilt?
"It's a good idea to do a subscription evaluation on a regular basis - perhaps a couple of times a year," Golden says.
IS IT REDUNDANT? If you have cable or satellite TV, plus Netflix, YouTube TV and Amazon Prime Video, you have overlap. "There are so many redundancies across those platforms that you're more or less paying for the same service over and over again," McClary says.
The same assessment goes for streaming music services, cloud storage and phone services. Are you hanging on to a landline for no reason?
OPT TO SHARE: Can you legitimately share a subscription? "Some of these subscriptions offer a buddy pass," McClary notes. YouTube TV allows family groups to share subscriptions, and certain New York Times subscriptions come with a bonus subscription to share. Some families choose to group their wireless phones on a single plan to lower costs.
Don't forget about freebies at your local public library, which can substitute for subscriptions: digital access to books, audiobooks, movies, music and magazines.
DOWNGRADE: Downgrading or subscribing seasonally can work, too. Can you downgrade from the premium to free version of software or website access? Are you getting value from your credit card's annual fee? You can probably downgrade to a fee-free card with the same issuer and keep your long credit history.
CANCEL: Liberally pause or cancel services . You can always restart and re-subscribe later. You might even receive a discount offer to return.

Desperate to empower, ‘Shrill’ is a feminist mess

Texto completo: If you want to understand the new feminist show “Shrill,” based on the memoir of #ShoutYourAbortion co-founder Lindy West, don’t bother watching it. Just listen to the final scene.

(Of course, this is a spoiler, but let’s be real: It’s not as if you would expect the show to end differently.)

The protagonist, Annie, marches up to the home of a man who’s been trolling her online. She’s written a couple of feminist pieces for the alternative publication where she works, one called “Hello, I’m Fat,” and the troll has been making fun of her weight.

After tracking down his IP address, she confronts him at his doorstep. The well-coiffed white guy apologizes, and then he delivers a monologue like that bully in a high school movie who realizes it was really just his relationship with his dad that made him so mean all along.

When Annie asks what she ever did to him, the troll responds, “Pissed me off. The stuff that you write, the feminist shit, I don’t agree with a lot of it. So I thought I’d push you a little. Or, a lot. I was big when I was a kid. You’re … fat, but your writing is so confident. And I hate myself. You don’t. You’re out there yelling, ‘This is me …’ It made me mad. I’m sorry.”

Yep, those are words that a screenwriter wrote and many other people allowed to appear in a TV show that the New York Times called “lovely.”

The troll then invites Annie in for a drink, she refuses, and he cusses her out just like old times. She throws a pot at his car. Curtain.

Like its final scene, the show is clipped, hackneyed, and desperate to be empowering. Its simple message is good, and much-needed: Women who don’t fit into factory-size clothing should be unashamed. In episode four, the only one worth watching, a bunch of curvy women gather for a pool party filled with pastels and margaritas and self-love. I am here for it.

But where the rest of the show tries so hard to be meaningful, it descends to caricature, identity politics, and untruth.

Take the abortion storyline, for example. West’s abortion enthusiasm is evident in the fact that Annie has a quick abortion in the pilot episode, nothing sentimental or groundbreaking, as the Washington Post put it. In fact, the ending of her pregnancy marks the beginning of her journey toward empowerment.

“I got myself into this huge fucking mess, but I made a decision, only for me, for myself, and I got myself out of it,” Annie says. “I feel very fucking powerful right now.”

Ask the thousands of women who regret their abortions if they feel powerful, and Annie’s hopes of enlightenment start to feel hollow.

Even the Internet troll storyline could’ve played better. I thought the troll might turn out to be the skinny gym trainer Annie met earlier in the season, which would’ve been a great way to tie in the show’s feminist message, the importance of women supporting women.

But no, of course, it was a young, affluent white guy.

Except for Annie’s dad, who has cancer, all of the white guys in this show suck. Her boyfriend Ryan, whose mom washes his clothes, sucks. Her boss Gabe sucks. Gabe is gay, but it’s OK that he sucks because he’s also fatphobic.

“You’re a gay man,” Annie says in the final episode. “How can you not be sympathetic towards this?”

“I was born gay,” Gabe says. “I had no choice. You do!”

West claims that Gabe is not based on Dan Savage, her former editor. But when they were both at the Stranger, an alternative Seattle newspaper, West called out Savage for his descriptions of fat people. The two once exchanged words through a pair of articles, almost exactly those in “Shrill”: “Hello, I Am Fat,” and “Hello, I'm Not the Enemy.”

West says she and Savage have resolved their quarrel, but no such resolution comes for Annie in “Shrill.” At the end of the season, she’s louder and more assertive than before. But she’s hurt her friends and family, and we’re left with little evidence that she’s changed.

Like the memoir it’s based on, Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman , “Shrill” isn’t powerful. It’s just full of noise.

'Sondheim on Sondheim' takes the stage at Titusville

Texto completo: Mandy Kerridge is a professional singer, a self-described "big belter" who is "always gone," whether to theaters, other stages or cruise ships.
Friday through Sunday, however, she will stick around Brevard. She and that alto voice will be featured in "Sondheim on Sondheim" at the Titusville Playhouse.
It is, as artistic director Steven J. Heron called it, "a tribute to Sondheim in his own words." Moreover, on his birthday. Sondheim will turn 89 years old March 22, and Kerridge, who spoke while rehearsals were underway, said, "We're in the heart of it," not unhappily.
"Sondheim is Sondheim," she said. "He is unlike any other (composer of stage musicals) because of the way he puts together the music. He makes you feel things you don't normally feel; the way he pieces things together really touches your heart."
A resident of Rockledge and native of Kansas, Kerridge aimed for a career as a singer and is a product of Kansas State University. The school had a drama, but no vocal music program, and so she "threw myself into the theatrical side of it" and did "Sweeney Todd" when she was 18 years old.
Since that time, she has starred as Lucy in the Atlanta production of "Jekyll and Hyde" and has played Velma Kelly in "Chicago," among other shows, relished playing "those baddies" when she was young and still enjoys those less cheery roles.
"I love the witch in 'Into the Woods' and someday I'd love to be Mama Rose (in "Gypsy")" she said, the irony apparent. The former is Sondheim's take on familiar fairy tales; the latter sings his words (to Jule Styne's music).
"Sweeney," she added, "was like the opening of a door."
The door was to the works of the American master, who has received eight Tony Awards, more than any other composer; along with an Oscar, eight Grammy Awards, a Pulitzer Prize and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2010, Broadway's historic Henry Miller's Theatre was renamed the Stephen Sondheim Theatre.
"Sondheim . . . is an institution and a cottage industry," New York Times theater critic Frank Rich wrote in 2013, in the New Yorker.
He added, "While Sondheim's songs express the characters invented by his collaborators, the fact remains that many of us have a consistent emotional reaction to his canon as a whole. That's not just due to the formal brilliance of the music and lyrics. There's an underlying humanity."
Kerridge agreed.
"Everything he does is so intelligent, so sophisticated. He has a way with music like no other composer. I love to sing Sondheim," she said, readily admitting that her favorite song of his, "Not While I'm Around," "gets me every time."
"Sondheim on Sondheim," a review that played a limited run on Broadway in 2018, features a long list of songs that date to "By George," first performed in 1946 at the George School, the private boarding school in Pennsylvania attended by Sondheim. Songs from "West Side Story," "Gypsy," "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," "Company," "Follies," "A Little Night Music" and the rest – 19 shows in all – are in there too.
"What can you say about Sondheim?" Heron asked. "You can't. It's all been said, and so you let the music do the talking."
Again Kerridge, who will spend her summer singing the music of the big bands aboard the Queen Mary II this summer, agreed.
"This was my first foray into Titusville, and 'Sondheim on Sondheim' happened," she said.

Texto completo: When it comes to Facebook and security, it seems there is one potentially damaging lapse after another.
The latest was uncovered by the KrebsOnSecurity security news site, flagging hundreds of millions of Facebook users who had their account passwords stored in plain text that could be searched by more than 20,000 Facebook employees – in some cases dating to 2012.
The author of the report, Brian Krebs, says Facebook told him that none of the employees, to the company's knowledge, abused the data.
Facebook later admitted as much publicly, in a newsroom blog posted by vice president of engineering for security and privacy Pedro Canahuati.
"We have fixed these issues, and as a precaution we will be notifying everyone whose passwords we have found were stored in this way," he wrote. The issue first came to light in January.
"To be clear, these passwords were never visible to anyone outside of Facebook, and we have found no evidence to date that anyone internally abused or improperly accessed them," Canahuati continued. "We estimate that we will notify hundreds of millions of Facebook Lite users, tens of millions of other Facebook users, and tens of thousands of Instagram users."
Citing an unnamed senior Facebook employee as the source, Krebs says the social network is probing the causes of a series of security failures in which employees built applications that logged the unencrypted password data, which apparently numbers between 200 million and 600 million.
Facebook has been a magnet for disturbing news the past couple of years, leaving some people to break up with the service for good and placing CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the hot seat.
Last week, The New York Times reported Facebook's data practices were under criminal investigation. And Facebook has been riddled by scandals ranging from Cambridge Analytica and fake news to the court documents that revealed youngsters and their parents were duped into spending money on online games earlier this decade.
Krebs told USA TODAY that "Facebook's motto has long been 'move fast, break things,' and this situation seems to be one unfortunate manifestation of that mantra. It's easy to see how a Facebook engineer or developer might enable password logging for a short period of time – to troubleshoot a specific problem, for example. But it's also easy for that developer to forget to undo that logging."
Were consumers harmed here? "The more people at Facebook who have access to this data, the greater the likelihood that someone will abuse that access," Krebs says. "When you start getting into the realm of tens of thousands of employees with that opportunity over as much as seven years, the chances for harm or abuse would seem to go up considerably."
Engin Kirda, co-founder and chief architect at the Lastline network security firm, has a similar take: "This is not only a bad situation, but it is actually terrible. It is a major relapse of operational security practices."
"Storing passwords in clear text is a terrible idea because it would allow employees and potential attackers who steal this data to easily use these passwords and potentially log on to other, non-Facebook-related services as well because users often reuse passwords," Kirda added. "If this data leaks out, or a Facebook employee who has access to this data ends up becoming malicious, having this data lying around might lead to other, easy account compromises that are not directly hosted on Facebook."
While Facebook claims none of the password were exposed externally, it points users to settings where you can change your passwords on Facebook and Instagram.
It also recommends such common sense security practices as choosing strong complex passwords that you don't repeat elsewhere, and enabling additional protections like two-factor authentication.

Texto completo: The third pilot reportedly saved the Boeing aircraft day before its fatal crash
JAKARTA, Indonesia - Indonesian investigators on Thursday confirmed the presence in the cockpit of an off-duty pilot reported to have saved a troubled Lion Air flight the day before the same plane crashed on Oct. 29.
Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that this third pilot, who happened to have hitched a ride on the flight, figured out what was going wrong on the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft as the other pilots struggled to control the diving plane.
The third pilot, according to Bloomberg News, disabled the aircraft's flight-control system and landed the plane safely in Jakarta. The same plane then crashed the next day, killing all 189 aboard.
"The third pilot, who has not been identified, was qualified to fly Max 8s and was deadheading aboard the Oct. 28 flight from Bali's Denpasar airport to Jakarta," said Soerjanto Tjahjono, the head of Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee, referring to the practice of company employees traveling free of charge. "The aircraft encountered the same problems that appear to have caused it to crash a day later."
Soerjanto and other Indonesian authorities have not confirmed that the third pilot prevented a crash on Oct. 28.
Soerjanto, however, pushed back on reports that detailed the contents of the doomed flight's cockpit voice recorder, one of the two "black boxes" recovered after the crash. He said the reports "were not in line with the actual content," which belongs "solely to the KNKT," referring to the National Transportation Safety Committee by its local-language abbreviation.
It was a day of pushback against media reports, with Ethiopian Airlines - which also lost a Max 8 aircraft on March 10 - disputing reports that the pilot hadn't received the right training.
The Indonesian news conference was called Thursday afternoon local time after Reuters reported that the Lion Air 610's pilots were scrambling to diagnose why the jet's nose kept lurching forward, flipping through the manual as the aircraft's altitude and airspeed varied dramatically. Reuters and later the New York Times, citing investigators who had heard the audio and transcript, said that in the final seconds of the audio, the co-pilot said "Allahu akbar," meaning "God is great," and a prayer.
"The KNKT believes that the reports in the media are based on someone's opinions, or several parties' opinion," Soerjanto said.
Nurcahyo Utomo, another investigator with the KNKT, said Indonesian laws bar investigators from publicizing the contents of the cockpit voice recorder. "Our [cockpit voice recorder content] has not leaked," he said.
After the Ethiopian Airlines crash, which killed all 157 on board, investigators began noticing similarities between the two cases. The March disaster has led to the grounding of all Boeing 737 Max 8 planes worldwide and ratcheted up pressure on Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration to provide answers as to what went wrong.
Authorities investigating the Indonesia crash say erroneous sensor data triggered an automated anti-stall feature, known as the MCAS, in the new Max planes that pushed its nose down, ultimately causing the plane to crash into the Java Sea. In the case of the day-earlier Lion Air flight, the guest pilot was able to disable the system in time.
In addition to the Oct. 28 incident, the plane had multiple failures starting Oct. 26, including the four flights before the one that crashed into the Java Sea, according to the preliminary report on the Lion Air crash. The plane's maintenance log showed that pilots reported defects with incorrect display of speeds and altitude and that airline mechanics worked to resolve the problems.
Before the near-disaster on Oct. 28, the "angle of attack" sensor, which detects whether the wings have enough lift to keep flying, was replaced, the report said. It had been tested and the captain was reassured that the previously logged maintenance problem had been resolved.
Boeing then issued a November bulletin about the problem that was to be distributed to pilots along with additional training in turning off the system.
The Ethiopian Airlines crash appeared to share similarities with the Lion Air case, including an erratic up-and-down flight path and the pilot reporting "flight control" problems shortly before crashing, authorities had said.
Investigators in France - who are involved because they downloaded the data from the black boxes for the Ethiopians, who didn't have the expertise - and Ethiopia then said information from the Ethiopian flight data recorder showed "clear similarities" with the Lion Air flight.
On Thursday, Ethiopia's Transport Ministry issued a statement saying the analysis of the data was underway with a team that included the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, as well as the French and European aviation safety agencies.
Reuters and the New York Times also reported that the pilot in the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight, Yared Getachew, had not received training in the Max 8 flight simulator.
Ethiopian Airlines responded by expressing "its disappointment on the following wrong reporting of the @nytimes" in a tweet, noting that all pilots were trained in the use of the new Max 8 planes before they were introduced and were later updated about the Boeing warning in November about possible stabilizer issues.
"We urge all concerned to refrain from making such uninformed, incorrect, irresponsible and misleading statements during the period of the accident investigation," it said, adding that the flight simulator "is not designed to simulate the MCAS system problems."

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - Life hasn't been easy for singer Jenny Lewis since the sunnier days when she performed in support of a 2014 album while wearing a rainbow-hued pantsuit and carrying a guitar with similar bright colors.
Her mother died, and a 12-year relationship ended, sending Lewis on a cross-country journey in search of herself. Finally, with a new album finished and awaiting a Friday release, she's had to deal with the uncomfortable story of occasional collaborator Ryan Adams' alleged mistreatment of women.
Spending much of the upcoming year on tour may seem like a relief.
The up-tempo songs "Red Bull & Hennessy and "Heads Gonna Roll from her "On the Line album, with Lewis' unerring sense of tunefulness, will get the initial attention. But the work's emotional core emerges in quieter, more introspective material like "Dogwood, "Rabbit Hole and "Taffy. Those are the songs that will stick.
Much of the material was written in stolen moments on borrowed pianos, in friends' apartments and hotel lobbies, where she had to keep quiet to avoid making a disturbance.
"I don't think of this record as being a breakup record, she said. "It's more of a rebound record. It's kind of the space in between.
The southern California native relied on a network of friends during her post-breakup travels, staying in musician St. Vincent's New York apartment, for example. She and two friends formed a band and wrote songs in a Manhattan storefront, where pedestrians mistook them for an art installation. She spent time in Nashville and Minnesota.
Even when she returned to California, Lewis used Airbnb to explore different parts of Los Angeles.
"I ran away, the 43-year-old said. "I really just got back here a couple of months ago. It was a three-year adventure.
How much of an adventure? It's hard not to notice all the references to alcohol and other substances sprinkled throughout the album's lyrics. There's Hennessy, of course. Grenadine. Bourbon. Beaujolais. Red wine (unspecific). Amphetamines. Paxil. A bong. Part of it is a good writer's attention to detail, but still...
"It's relevant, she said.
She brings a bottle to a restaurant in the heart of Hollywood where she talked about her music. Not to drink: it's a gift for a friend, singer Nikki Lane, who's performing later that night nearby. A former child actress who turned to music and was a member of the group Rilo Kiley before going solo, Lewis has a wide circle of friends and admirers in the business.
None of that could have prepared her for the surreal experience she had at Los Angeles' Capitol studio while making "On the Line, however.
Lewis played on the piano that Carole King used to make "Tapestry, which is intimidating enough. Her band included former Tom Petty keyboard player Benmont Tench, record executive and bassist Don Was and the drum duo of Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner.
"That's one of my favorite moments in my whole life, she said. "Standing in the control room and watching Ringo and Jim play together, I was mesmerized. Of course I am thrilled, honored. Shocked, really. I kept thinking, Is someone doing somebody a favor here?'
She believes it was Was who called in Starr. "I don't know exactly, she said. "He was just there with his drums.
Beck and Adams were two other big names who helped out. Adams, who produced Lewis' 2014 album "Voyager, produced some of the new music, too.
The association with Adams became noteworthy when the New York Times reported that he allegedly pursued younger female artists for sex and sometimes became verbally and emotionally abusive when turned down. Adams has denied the accusations.
Lewis was not included in the Times' story, and her interview with The Associated Press took place before the story was published. She declined a follow-up request to talk about it, and tweeted a statement: "I am deeply troubled by Ryan Adams' alleged behavior. Although he and I had a working professional relationship, I stand in solidarity with the women who have come forward.
Lewis subsequently held an online album-release party that doubled as a benefit for the Los Angeles Women's Center, and it raised more than $10,000.
For Adams, the fallout has been swift: a canceled concert tour, an album release put on hold. Could the controversy hurt Lewis by association?
Jason Lipshutz, senior director of music for Billboard magazine, said it might have been an issue if Lewis had publicly defended him or been part of the Times' story. The women's center benefit was a smart strategic move, he said.
"I do think that it is something that people are going to be able to separate from her music, Lipshutz said.

Stock buybacks need solid rationale

Texto completo: When looking to confirm news of a stock buyback plan, a first scroll through recent news releases of Medtronic PLC turned up nothing. There was just an item about a routine quarterly dividend.
And that was the right announcement, with the second paragraph explaining that the board had approved buying back $6 billion more worth of stock.
That bit of news seems more important than how it was played, but apparently buying back stock is so business-as-usual that it's only really news if companies stop doing it. That might be one reason why the practice has become such a political issue.
Sens. Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders -- clearly frustrated by lackluster wage growth for average workers and fat pay packages for corporate leaders -- last month proposed limits on this kind of stock buyback in an essay in the New York Times. Buybacks shouldn't be allowed, they wrote, unless companies first use their money to provide adequate wages, paid sick leave for employees and other measures that benefit workers.
Corporate leaders who might agree on those employment practices likely still will not want Congress making new rules, so if they want to head off something like this, they could start by being a little smarter about the practice of buying back stock and how they talk about it.
It's often the case that share buybacks are one answer to the question of what to do with excess capital. After all, if corporate executives really don't know how to productively invest all their employers' money, the last thing we should want is for them to hang onto it.
The Medtronic news caught my eye because it is one of the latest big stock buyback announcements. The only regional blue-chip that easily comes to mind that might not be buying back stock right now is General Mills, which is instead paying back money it borrowed to buy pet food maker Blue Buffalo.
The other household names have buyback plans in place -- Best Buy Co., Target
Corp., U.S. Bancorp and so on. UnitedHealth Group has a share repurchase authorization that goes all the way back to 1997, according to its latest annual securities filing. As of the end of the year, UnitedHealth's management had the authority from the board to buy back up to 94 million additional shares.
To their credit, none of these companies seems to be trying to use buyback announcements as some sort of signal of confidence to the capital markets.
This kind of thing can sometimes be baffling, including how the Wall Street Journal characterized Lowe's Cos. $10 billion buyback news in December. The home improvement products retailer, it said, "looks to turn investor sentiment and prove to Wall Street its business and growth plans are on solid footing."
Wouldn't the footing appear even more solid if $10 billion of additional cash and shareholders' equity didn't get drained away?
It's also true that buying back stock reduces the number of shares outstanding, which can lead to earnings per share growing faster than net income. The pay practices for CEOs long ago crossed into indefensible territory for me, but it's really aggravating if CEOs get paid for earnings-per-share growth that was only achieved by whittling away at the share count.
Lots of companies also seem far too eager to please the shareholders with buybacks. The way Target put it in its last earnings release is typical. The company said it "returned $951 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases, bringing the total to $3.4 billion for full year 2018."
By linking stock buybacks directly with dividends, a form of distributing a slice of the profits, there's no other conclusion other than the shareholders are getting a big payday.
That might not be the case, though. The Target shareholder who sold out last year, unaware that the buyer was Target, may be a bad-luck trader who bought the stock a few years ago at $82 a share and was willing to sell it to anybody at a loss.
What corporate executives should be explaining when announcing a corporate buyback is that it's their job to allocate capital to only the best ideas. New warehouses, new stores, new lines of business and acquisitions of other businesses could all be savvy investments, but only if the expected returns beat the cost of the capital.
Profitable companies can generate more cash than they can wisely use. Through the first nine months of its current fiscal year, Medtronic, based in Ireland but with operating headquarters here, has had cash flow from operations of about $5 billion. So in addition to acquisitions and capital expenditures, it could easily afford to buy back stock.
The company also has a lot of debt, about $25 billion as of the end of the most recent quarter. Another reason why Medtronic chooses to carry a lot of debt and still buy back stock is that the money it borrows is cheap compared to the cost of shareholders' equity, the most expensive form of capital. It's not a good idea to let equity pile up.
By buying back stock with its cash flow, Medtronic is acting a little like a homeowner who has decided the family has too much capital tied up in his or her house. Rather than pay off the mortgage, the thing to do is refinance and use the extra money for other things.
"Spending" $500 million to buy back stock means the money is leaving Medtronic's corporate checking account, but it's not exactly being spent. It's going into the accounts of investors who sold their shares.
The investors hopefully have a good idea of what to do with the cash. Maybe they fund an upstart business or invest in a growth company that's starved for capital.
The one thing we know investors won't do with the money is just sit on it.

Texto completo: Last week in New Zealand, a self-avowed white supremacist targeted two mosques and streamed his bloody killing spree on social media.
There are at least three condemnations that should result from the massacre.
The first condemnation is for the act itself. The callous slaughter of people at prayer is part of an age that has devalued life, from unrestricted abortions, to street shootings and other terrorist attacks. That some of these assaults are motivated by twisted views of religion, or in this case, a white supremacist opposed to immigration, is all part of the same piece. Murder and hate should not be categorized.
The second condemnation goes to politicians and special interest groups who blame President Donald Trump and the NRA, seeking to make political hay out of an action that had nothing to do with either. That the shooter mentioned the president as "a symbol of white supremacy" does not make him one. Critics will use anything in an attempt to discredit and weaken Mr. Trump's appeal before next year's election. Shame on them.
The gunman, whose name shall not be mentioned here, posted online a 74-page "manifesto" and details of his evil intent. Reports say he sent it to the prime minister's office and media outlets just nine minutes before launching the attack. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's office said the message came too late for police to respond. Since the shooter had made his racist beliefs known in previous social media postings, why did no one take him seriously and monitor him as a walking time bomb? If police failed to take his threats seriously are authorities also in danger of condemnation?
Did no one see it? If someone did, why didn't they call police? If they did call, why did the police not pay him a visit? Social media is often quick to take down "inappropriate" postings. How did the gunman manage to escape censors for a heinous act far worse than offensive speech? Press reports say the shooter had also planned a terror attack on Muslims last December. Did no one hear about that? If they did, why weren't police contacted? Again, if they were, why didn't they visit the man's home?
Ms. Ardern promised to strengthen her country's gun laws. Would stronger laws have deterred a man intent on mass murder? The police mainly determine who is qualified to own a gun. The New York Times reported: "While New Zealand's laws governing the purchase of semiautomatic rifles are more restrictive than those in the United States, the country is much freer with firearms than Australia is, allowing most guns to be purchased without requiring them to be tracked." The prime minister can start there.
Investigators will find out how the shooter, who is a gun-club member, obtained his weapons and whether he was licensed to possess them.
Meanwhile, houses of worship are finding it necessary to employ armed guards, which is a judgment on our increasingly anti-life culture. More guards will likely be hired in the aftermath of the mosque shootings.
New Zealand is a popular location for film companies. Perhaps the most famous film series produced there is "Lord of the Rings," based on the books by J.R.R. Tolkien. In "The Fellowship of the Ring," there is this quote: "Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment."
The shooter dealt death in his judgment. New Zealand no longer imposes capital punishment. If ever there was a person who deserves the death penalty, it is this shooter, and not just because it might deter others. More important, capital punishment imposed on this monster would exact justice for those innocent people who were killed or wounded and for their families.

Amy Schumer says husband has kept her going during pregnancy

Texto completo: On Monday night, the eve of the premiere of her new Netflix stand-up special “Growing," comedian Amy Schumer wrote a heartfelt Instagram post thanking everyone involved, with a loving shout-out to her husband, Martha's Vineyard chef Chris Fischer . 
“But thank you to my husband, Chris, who has kept me going during this pregnancy," Schumer wrote. “His willingness and desire to be open with the world about himself and our marriage is courageous and beautiful.
“He makes me laugh more than anyone and he laughs at me more than anyone. I am more than grateful to have found such an amazing partner and best friend. I'm shocked. I didn't think this love was out there for me. But it was and it is and I can't wait to spend my life with you and our growing family."
In “Growing," which is now streaming, Schumer focuses on the major updates in her life since her 2017 special: her marriage and pregnancy. But the comedian also touched on some of the more serious parts of her life, namely a diagnostic revelation about her husband.
“I knew from the beginning that my husband's brain was a little different than mine," Schumer said. “My husband was diagnosed with what used to be called Asperger's. He has autism spectrum disorder. He's on the spectrum."
“And once he was diagnosed, it dawned on me how funny it was, because all of the characteristics that make it clear that he's on the spectrum are all of the reasons that I fell madly in love with him," she said. “That's the truth. He says whatever is on his mind. He keeps it so real. He doesn't care about social norms or what you expect him to say or do."
Schumer, who has battled severe nausea throughout her pregnancy, has been open with her fans about preparing for baby — vomiting on video, posting photos that showed her hooked up to an IV, even canceling her comedy tour because of health issues. It's all in keeping with who she is as a person and a performer. As Schumer told The New York Times this month, “Being cool is powerful in this industry, but there's nothing more powerful than not giving a [expletive]."

Scrutiny Started in 2017 For Trump's Former Fixer

Texto completo: Federal authorities investigating Russian interference in the presidential election obtained search warrants for emails of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer and fixer, beginning in July 2017, according to documents released Tuesday that provided a glimpse into the earliest stages of the inquiry into the president.
The documents show that by the time F.B.I. agents conducted a highly public raid on Mr. Cohen's home and office in April of last year, his business dealings had already been the subject of an extensive investigation.
The records, including search warrants and other materials related to the April raid, were among nearly 900 pages of documents that a federal judge unsealed in response to a request by The New York Times and other news organizations.
The records were heavily redacted. More than 150 pages were fully blacked out, and many had names or portions of the material obscured, mostly because they were related to the continuing investigation of the Trump Organization.
Lanny J. Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, said in a statement on Monday night that the disclosures would only further Mr. Cohen's "interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump organization to law enforcement and Congress."

One newly released search warrant said the F.B.I. and Manhattan federal prosecutors were investigating Mr. Cohen for a range of crimes, including defrauding several banks dating back to 2016 and a scheme "to make an illegal campaign contribution in October 2016 to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump." The warrant also indicated they were investigating him for wire fraud and conspiracy.
Another search warrant showed that prosecutors for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, were investigating Mr. Cohen for other crimes growing out of the Russia inquiry, including failure to register as a foreign agent and money laundering.
The documents give a rough timeline of how the Cohen investigation unfolded. Starting in July 2017, two months after Mr. Mueller's appointment, and stretching through November, his office obtained three search warrants for Mr. Cohen's emails and another for his iCloud account from a federal judge in Washington.
The timing of the warrants, which can take weeks if not longer to obtain, indicates that the investigation started even earlier.
By February 2018, Mr. Mueller's office had referred aspects of that investigation to federal prosecutors in Manhattan. F.B.I. agents raided Mr. Cohen's office and home in New York two months later.
Later in the year, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in two separate cases. In the first, he admitted to committing campaign finance violations by arranging hush money payments to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump, as well as financial crimes, in a case brought by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. In the second, he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in a case brought by Mr. Mueller's office.
Mr. Cohen, 52, apologized at his sentencing in December, blaming himself for "my own weakness and a blind loyalty" to Mr. Trump that he said had led him "to choose a path of darkness over light."
Judge William H. Pauley III sentenced Mr. Cohen to three years in prison; he is scheduled to begin serving his sentence on May 6 after Judge Pauley granted him a two-month delay because of pending shoulder surgery and his need to prepare for testimony before three congressional committees.
Mr. Cohen testified on Feb. 27 in a daylong public hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee about what he described as Mr. Trump's lies about his business interests in Russia and his role in the payment of hush money to one of the women, Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress. In his testimony, Mr. Cohen called the president a racist, a con man and a cheat.
The newly public documents also show how little the public knew about the Russian investigation in real time as prosecutors zeroed in on Mr. Cohen.
Prosecutors, for instance, unearthed bank payments from a New York investment firm tied to Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire Russian businessman with ties to the Kremlin who met with Mr. Cohen in his Trump Tower office just days before the inauguration, the documents show.
The public did not learn of those payments, or that Mr. Mueller's prosecutors later interviewed Mr. Vekselberg, until almost a year later.
The search materials were made public at the order of Judge Pauley. Last fall, when The New York Times and other news organizations asked the judge to unseal the materials, the government opposed such action.
Prosecutors cited the "need to protect an ongoing law enforcement investigation" and the privacy of "numerous uncharged third parties."
Judge Pauley ultimately ordered the government to provide him with a copy of the sealed materials and its proposed redactions. On Monday, after saying he had reviewed and approved the redactions, he ordered the government to file the redacted copy on the public court docket.
The judge also said he would revisit the documents' secrecy in the near future, directing prosecutors to provide him with a confidential update by May 15.

Where 'Super Heroes' Intern: White House Economic Team

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The 2019 Economic Report of the President runs 705 pages and features chapters on "expanding labor force opportunities" and "ensuring a balanced financial regulatory landscape." It also claims to be written by Batman.
For the second straight year, the group of economists that do regression analyses and forecast annual growth rates for President Trump has slipped a straight-out-of-Comic-Con Easter egg into its annual report.
[Not nerdy enough to know what an Easter egg is? Read here.]
The list of Council of Economic Advisers interns on Page 624 of the report includes Steve Rogers (a.k.a. Captain America), Peter Parker (Spider-Man) and Bruce Wayne (Batman). There's also Aunt May (Peter Parker's guardian; apparently there are no anti-nepotism rules at the council), J. T. Hutt (a superfan abbreviation for Jabba the Hutt, the "Star Wars" gangster who hangs a frozen Han Solo on his wall), the actor John Cleese, Kathryn Janeway (a "Star Trek" captain) and someone called John Snow (more on him later).
The names stuck out because most Council of Economic Advisers interns are university students -- depending on which movie or comic you prefer, Peter Parker is the only one on the list who fits that bill -- and also, real human beings.
A former council economist, Martha Gimbel, who is now research director at Indeed, noticed the names and tweeted about them on Tuesday afternoon.
Last year's list was pretty impressive, too, it turns out. The 2018 report included abbreviated references to a pair of famed "Star Trek" captains, James T. Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard.
The White House says it's all in good fun. The Council of Economic Advisers' official Twitter account said late Tuesday that the list was an effort to call attention to its intern "super heroes," who made "significant contributions" to the economic report.
It's worth noting that Jabba the Hutt is not, in fact, a superhero -- he enslaved Princess Leia and tried to feed Han Solo and Luke Skywalker to a slow-digesting pit monster in the desert. Also, who is this "John Snow" they speak of? Is he the former Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush? An actual intern? Or did the council, in a blow to its nerd cred, misspell the name of the "Game of Thrones" hero Jon Snow?
The New York Times asked a council spokeswoman to clarify. "Have a sense of humor!" she replied.
Funny, that's what people usually say to economists.

Make College Accessible, Affordable

Texto completo: For most people trying to figure out how to send their children to college, the bribery-laced admissions scandal recently revealed by the Department of Justice is sickening. But even more so, it is tragic.
The DOJ has secured indictments against an array of 1-percenters including CEOs and actors, along with some college coaches and administrators. The wealthy suspects are charged with paying up to $1.2 million to guarantee their kids’ acceptance into elite colleges.
Beyond the absurdity of it - the student beneficiaries already have advantages far beyond almost all other applicants - is that the slots secured through bribes are thus denied to students who might have gained them by merit.
A 2014 study by economists Alan Kreuger and Stacy Dale, cited in The New York Times analysis feature, the Upshot, found that admission to an elite college did nothing to alter the prospects for students already in position to succeed because of other factors.
Admission made a huge difference, however, to good students from poor families because the elite schools provided them with social capital to which they otherwise would not have access.
For a kid in the top 1 percent, social mobility isn’t dependent on being admitted to Yale. But for a smart kid from the bottom 20 percent, admission to an elite school could accelerate him up the ladder.
Yet, as a policy matter, the gravest concern about college admissions usually involves affirmative action programs that attempt to open opportunities to students for whom it would make the greatest difference.
Policymakers should use the scandal as a lens on the need to make college accessible and affordable.

Texto completo: The lines stretch down the block in Harvard Square. Everyone wants a taste of Milk Bar, the Cambridge outpost of the New York bakery, which opened here in February. Celebrity chef Christina Tosi is known for cheeky creations like Cereal Milk soft-serve ice cream and Compost Cookies, made with chocolate chips, pretzels, potato chips, and much more. But perhaps the most famous item on Milk Bar's menu is the super-sweet, oat-crusted Crack Pie.
Crack Pie? That's not cute.
Milk Bar debuted in 2008, a spinoff of David Chang's Momofuku restaurants. If it seemed funny a decade ago to name a dessert after an addictive drug, the joke was one of privilege. The crack epidemic of the 1980s hurt largely poor, largely black communities, not the people who were heading to the East Village to spend $5 on a slice of pie (the price has since gone up to $6). Now the country is in the grips of an opioid crisis, and a double standard. This addiction affects white communities as well — 78 percent of those who died from an opioid overdose in 2017 were white, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation — and our cultural response to it has been very different, with dialogue often centered on treatment rather than incarceration.
Regardless, here we are. Americans are now more likely to die of an opioid overdose than in a motor vehicle crash, according to a report from the National Safety Council. A bakery would never try to market something called Fentanyl Cake, and the name Crack Pie feels offensively off-key.
This is not to pile on Milk Bar. Fenway restaurant Hojoko offers a dish called “brains on crack." At Met Back Bay, you can order crispy calamari with crack sauce. There are recipes out there for crack cauliflower, salted crack caramel ice cream, crispy crack kale, Christmas crack. How often have you heard someone describe a delicious food as “addictive"? (There are reasons for that. Junk food and drugs both trigger the dopamine reward center in the brain, and food addiction is a very real thing.)
The language of addiction is frequently deployed when it comes to food, and it's time to stop. (While we are at it, let's also quit using shame-inducing phrases like “guilty pleasure." Eating disorders are no joke, either.)
With its high pressure and ever-present alcohol, the restaurant and hospitality industry is particularly vulnerable to substance-abuse issues. A 2015 study from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration finds it has the highest rate of substance use and third-highest rate of heavy alcohol use (after mining and construction) among industries.
People are now working from within to help shift the culture. High-profile chefs such as Sean Brock of Husk and David McMillan of Joe Beef are speaking out about their experiences with alcoholism, addiction, rehab, and sobriety. Kat Kinsman, an editor at Food & Wine, started Chefs With Issues, a mental-health resource for the industry. Organizations such as Restaurant Recovery and Ben's Friends aim squarely at the issues of substance abuse and addiction. The country's best bars are increasingly including low-alcohol and alcohol-free cocktails on their menus. Food festivals, events known for debauchery, are beginning to incorporate substance-free spaces.
“As I started taking care of myself, the staff started mimicking me," McMillan wrote in a recent Bon Appetit piece headlined “My Restaurant Was the Greatest Show of Excess You'd Ever Seen, and It Almost Killed Me." “All of these young cooks who came to cook at Joe Beef, who look up to me . . . saw, well, David's not drinking anymore, and he's going to bed early, and he's talking about what's cool on Netflix. Then my staff was going to bed early and watching Netflix. My comptroller said staff drinking is down like crazy."
It's possible to lead by example, in ways big and small. It is a moment to pay attention to the way we talk about food, to stop speaking lightly about addiction and equating it with deliciousness. Because no matter how sweet it is, Crack Pie is just in bad taste.

Texto completo: Operation Varsity Blues has unleashed a veritable orgy of stereotypes. "Entitled white kids" has been trending, along with told-you-so's about how the system is "rigged." Several commentators have suggested that this scandal should quiet concerns about affirmative action because the criminality of Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin and Co. proves that whites are willing to do anything to get ahead. A writer at The Week declared meritocracy a fraud, while The New York Times perceived a "lesson in harsh racial disparities."
"This scandal exposed the fact that there is a misplaced emphasis on so-called affirmative action inequities, rather than privilege," one education consultant told The New York Times. The paper quoted a black parent: "You often hear talk about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and that college admission is based on merit. What this story tells me is that the playing field is not level based on race and wealth."
A Washington Post columnist hit the same theme, asking: "Now that the FBI has shown what stealing a college slot really looks like, can we stop making students of color feel like frauds?" Theresa Vargas, noting that she spoke from personal experience, complained that:
"For so long, people of color who have attended elite schools in this country have felt the need to prove that they deserved to be there. They have accepted that no matter their grades or SAT scores, people will look at them as affirmative action recipients and talk about them, sometimes to their faces, as tokens.
"... all those people who have blamed poor brown and black kids for taking the spots of 'more deserving' white kids through affirmative action should have been looking closer at who really didn't earn their seats."
Whoa. This is stealing a base. The FBI has not shown that every white kid who gets into college has bought and/or lied his or her way in. As for the stigma that attaches to affirmative action, that's an unfortunate and inevitable byproduct of racial preferences. It's one of the reasons to oppose them. It's great to be at Stanford, but much less satisfying if you are saddled with the suspicion of being an affirmative action baby.
Many of the lamentations last week about "white privilege" and "poor minorities" have seemed frozen in a time warp. Black and poor are no longer synonymous. As the Institute for Family Studies reports, the share of black men in the upper third of the income tier rose from 13 percent in 1960 to 23 percent in 2016.
A bunch of cheats lied and bribed their way into some top schools. They deserve the scorn and criminal prosecutions they're facing. But the rush to say, "See, this proves the system is rigged for rich, white kids," is not proved. Yes, wealth confers benefits (even without cheating). And some wealthy people are also black, brown and other tones. But college admission standards also explicitly "privilege" some minorities at the expense of other minorities and the majority. As the suit by a group of Asian-Americans against Harvard has shown, Asian-Americans have the lowest admit percentage of any group -- along with the strongest credentials. Black students admitted to Harvard over the last 17 years had average SAT scores of 703.7 compared with 766.6 for Asian admittees, and 744.7 among whites. It's not a huge difference, but it's not a conspiracy in favor of whites either. If anything, the unfairness to highly qualified Asian students, and not the Operation Varsity Blues, is what throws the meritocracy into doubt.
Isn't it extraordinary that the students who got into top schools by fraud seemed to have little trouble performing there? This should cause more raised eyebrows than the finger wagging about privilege. What does this say about grade inflation and academic rigor?
What this scandal and the intense interest it has sparked demonstrates, among other things, is that we've come to invest way too much importance in brand names. You'd think parents wanted prestige for themselves more than the right fit for their child. The opaque nature of admissions decisions, together with schools' dishonest claims of "holistic" evaluations of each candidate, invite cynicism. When my brother was a student representative on his college's admissions committee, he noted that a few applications got a special FI stamp in red. That stood for family influence. The family in one case was named Ferrari.
Perhaps a better system would be to eliminate all preferences -- racial, ethnic, geographic, legacy, donor, sports -- all of it. Take students of proven ability who want to learn, and provide scholarships based on need. It might just improve everyone's morale.
Mona Charen's syndicated column appears in the Tribune on Tuesdays.

Kushner Cos. left its suburban roots behind years ago to pursue big property investments in New York City. Now, under fire from New York politicians and tenant activists, it is increasingly turning back to the 'burbs.
The firm has sold 10 properties for more than $1.5 billion in New York and was the buyer of one since January 2017, according to Real Capital Analytics. That is when then-Chief Executive Jared Kushner left to join the White House as President Trump's senior adviser.
Over this same period, the firm has spent more than $1.4 billion in a series of transactions for properties primarily in suburban Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and other states, RCA data shows.
This month, Kushner Cos. hired a broker to market five apartment buildings with a total of around 100 units in Manhattan's East Village, according to people familiar with the agreement.
Mr. Kushner sold his stake in many of his family holdings to a trust controlled by family members to avoid potential conflicts. But that has done little to ease the public and media scrutiny the firm has received while President Trump has been in the White House. Mr. Kushner is married to Ivanka Trump, one of the president's daughters, who also works as a senior administration official.
The company sold a development site in Brooklyn last April after local City Council member Brad Lander indicated he would oppose the area's proposed rezoning if Kushner Cos. could benefit. Mr. Kushner could exert influence over federal funds to clean up the Gowanus Canal and financially benefit himself once a rezoning made large-scale development possible, Mr. Lander argued in a 2017 radio interview.
An uproar came early in the Trump administration after media reports that Jared's father, Charles Kushner, was negotiating with China's Anbang Insurance Co. to step in as a partner on a $7.5 billion plan to redevelop 666 Fifth Ave. Anbang, which has had close political and family ties to top Chinese officials and is now controlled by the government, backed out of those talks after they became publicized.
New York city council member Ritchie Torres introduced a bill to close what he called the "Kushner loophole," which he claimed allows landlords to file inaccurate city disclosures without repercussions. The pro-tenant group Housing Rights Initiative had accused the company of falsely claiming to not have any rent-stabilized tenants at 34 properties, which Mr. Torres and other critics say allowed it to avoid stricter oversight. The company at the time said that clerical mistakes were made by a third party and corrected once identified.
Kushner President Laurent Morali said in an email that, while the company has been a "net seller" of New York City property since 2017, "we remain bullish on the city's future" and remain active as a lender. "Our company's investment and disposition philosophy is mainly driven by our objective to maximize returns," he said.

Some Democrats and other critics of the administration say this stepped up attention to Kushner Cos. is likely to persist—even intensify—as the progressive wing of the party exerts more power.
"Kushner, because of his proximity to Trump, is a target," said George Arzt, a Democratic strategist.
Kushner Cos. isn't the only one selling New York properties, where prices ran up in the years after the downturn. Many investors have been cooling on rental apartments amid growing anti-landlord sentiment. Elected officials, including some moderates, have been voicing support for increasing taxes on owners and even imposing new restrictions on rent increases, pushing down values.
Even with the recent sales and its plan to sell another 100 apartment units in the East Village, Kushner Cos. still owns a sizable portfolio in New York City. That includes apartment buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn, a downtown office building, a lending business and the lower floors of the former New York Times building.
But Kushner is unique among New York developers in the scrutiny the family has come under in a city that is fiercely anti-Trump. "There's no separation here between Jared Kushner and the company in the eyes of progressive politicians, who are increasingly powerful in this city," Mr. Arzt said.
Kushner Cos. started off as a builder of suburban apartments in New Jersey. In 2007, the company sold off more than half of its holdings and bought 666 Fifth Avenue for $1.8 billion, a record price in Manhattan at the time.
Over the following years it added more properties in New York City. By early 2017, the company was planning a $7.5 billion redevelopment of 666 Fifth Avenue, and working on a 1.1-million-square-foot luxury apartment project in Brooklyn's Dumbo neighborhood, and an office redevelopment around the corner.
It has since leased 666 Fifth Ave. to Brookfield Asset Management for 99 years and sold its stakes in the two big Brooklyn projects. Kushner is no longer involved in any large-scale development projects in New York City.
In November, it agreed to buy the Hotel on Rivington in Manhattan's Lower East Side for an undisclosed amount.
But for the most part, the company has been buying property elsewhere. In February, it bought around 6,000 rental apartments in Maryland and Virginia for $1.1 billion, its biggest deal in more than a decade.

Charge of Favoritism Shakes Up Warner Bros.

Texto completo: Kevin Tsujihara, the chief executive of AT&T's recently acquired Warner Bros. studios division, has stepped down after accusations surfaced that he had pushed for a woman with whom he had a sexual relationship to be considered for roles in the company's films and television shows.
Mr. Tsujihara, who has worked at the studio for more than two decades, said he made the decision to leave the company after discussing the matter with John Stankey, WarnerMedia's chief executive.
"Over the past week and a half, I have been reflecting on how the attention on my past actions might impact the company's future," Mr. Tsujihara wrote in a memo to employees. "After lengthy introspection, and discussions with John Stankey over the past week, we have decided that it is in Warner Bros.' best interest that I step down as chairman and C.E.O."
The allegations against Mr. Tsujihara emerged in a March 6 article in The Hollywood Reporter, which outlined a sexual relationship between Mr. Tsujihara, 54, and Charlotte Kirk, an actress in her 20s. The Reporter, quoting from private text messages it obtained, portrayed a situation in which Mr. Tsujihara -- prompted by Ms. Kirk's statements that he had promised to help her career during a meeting at a motel -- contacted his lieutenants on her behalf.
"I just need to be careful," Mr. Tsujihara, who is married, said in a 2014 text message, according to the trade publication. "Let's look for a movie role."
WarnerMedia said in a statement that the investigation into Mr. Tsujihara's behavior would continue despite his departure. When the allegations first came to light, a lawyer for Mr. Tsujihara said his client "did not have a direct role in the actress being cast in any movie."
In a separate memo to employees, Mr. Stankey said that "Kevin has acknowledged that his mistakes are inconsistent with the company's leadership expectations and could impact the company's ability to execute going forward."
Mr. Tsujihara was promoted two weeks ago in a significant management shake-up that gave him additional duties. He was put in charge of WarnerMedia's effort to develop children's content, which will play a significant role in AT&T's streaming business. The telecom giant acquired the studio last June as part of its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner.
Mr. Tsujihara was appointed even though whispers about his alleged conduct had circulated in Hollywood for more than a year. Mr. Stankey became aware of the allegations in September when he received an email from an anonymous account asking whether an actress had been offered speaking roles in films in exchange for silence about sex with a senior executive. Reporters from 11 publications, including The New York Times, were copied on the anonymous email. At the time, Mr. Stankey enlisted the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson to look into the claims.
That investigation concluded without any hit to Mr. Tsujihara, and he was promoted in early March. But The Hollywood Reporter article spurred the latest investigation and the renewed scrutiny of the studio head's actions.
Powerful men in Hollywood have been put in the spotlight ever since the #MeToo movement gained momentum, ensnaring men like Brett Ratner, a producer and financier with whom Mr. Tsujihara was once close. The Reporter article, written by Tatiana Siegel and Kim Masters, also detailed text messages between Ms. Kirk and Mr. Ratner involving Mr. Tsujihara and acting roles. Mr. Ratner has denied accusations of sexual misconduct made by multiple women.
The whiplash of Mr. Tsujihara's departure has unnerved the rank and file at Warner Bros., which AT&T has enlisted to help jump-start its streaming business. Warner's television studios have been a significant supplier to Hollywood and have sold shows to the broadcast networks, the cable channels and streaming services like Netflix. AT&T is banking on Warner's operations to help create new shows for its online video operation, which is set to debut by the end of the year.
The transformation started in June when AT&T, based in Dallas, ventured beyond its core business to acquire Time Warner, the home of HBO, the Warner Bros. movie studio, CNN, and cable channels like TBS and TNT. The phone giant started to overhaul the media business in earnest last month after the Justice Department lost a second court challenge to the merger and said it would no longer try to block it.
After the green light, AT&T altered its leadership team and named Robert Greenblatt, the former head of entertainment at NBC and Showtime, as the new chairman at WarnerMedia. His hiring followed the resignations of Richard Plepler, the longtime chief executive of HBO, and David Levy, the president of Turner Broadcasting, the division that includes TBS and TNT.
WarnerMedia said it was starting a search for a successor to Mr. Tsujihara, but there are few in Hollywood who have the stature and experience to run a major company like Warner.
Some, however, have been looking for a new job. Stacey Snider will be leaving as head of 20th Century Fox studios after the Walt Disney Company closes its acquisition for the majority of Rupert Murdoch's media empire this week. Thomas Staggs, the former chief operating officer of Disney, has been on the shortlist for other top media positions.
Peter Chernin, who was once second in command to Mr. Murdoch when he ran the mogul's film business, has been advising Mr. Stankey and could play a role in finding a replacement. Mr. Chernin worked with him and AT&T's chief executive, Randall Stephenson, on a joint venture called Otter Media, a company AT&T bought last year.

Texto completo: New think tank aims to bring ethics to the rapidly growing field
PALO ALTO, Calif. - A Stanford University scientist coined the term artificial intelligence. Others at the university created some of the most significant applications of it, such as the first autonomous vehicle.
But as Silicon Valley faces a reckoning over how technology is changing society, Stanford wants to be at the forefront of a different type of innovation, one that puts humans and ethics at the center of the booming field of AI.
The university is launching the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), a sprawling think tank that aims to become an interdisciplinary hub for policymakers, researchers and students who will build the technologies of the future. They hope they can inculcate in that next generation a more worldly and humane set of values than those that have characterized it - and guide politicians to make more sophisticated decisions about the challenging social questions wrought by technology.
"I could not have envisioned that the discipline I was so interested in would, a decade and a half later, become one of the driving forces of the changes that humanity will undergo," said Fei-Fei Li, an AI pioneer and former Google vice president who is one of two directors of the institute. "That realization became a tremendous sense of responsibility."
The institute - backed by the field's biggest leaders and industry players - is not the first such academic effort, but it is by far the most ambitious: It aims to raise more than $1 billion. And its advisory council is a who's who of Silicon Valley titans, including former Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, former Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer and co-founder Jerry Yang, and the prominent investor Jim Breyer. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates was scheduled to keynote its inaugural symposium Monday.
The money raised will not only go to research grants and academic gatherings but also to buying data processing power and luring back some of the talent that has fled academia for lucrative industry jobs in recent years. It will be housed in a new 200,000-square-foot building at the heart of Stanford's campus.
"We recognize that decisions that are made early on in the development of a technology have huge ramifications," said John Etchemendy, a philosopher and former Stanford provost, the co-director of the AI institute. "We need to be thoughtful about what those might be, and to do that, we can't rely simply on technologists."
The idea for the institute began with a conversation in 2016 between Li and Etchemendy that took place in Li's driveway, about a five-minute drive from campus.
Etchemendy had recently purchased the house next door. But the casual neighborly chat quickly morphed into a weightier dialogue about the future of society and what had gone wrong in the exploding field of AI. Billions of dollars were being invested in start-ups dedicated to commercializing what had been niche academic technologies. Companies such as Facebook, Apple and Google were hiring the world's top artificial intelligence researchers - along with many of their recently minted graduates - to work in new divisions dedicated to robotics, self-driving cars and voice recognition for home devices.
"The correct answer to pretty much everything in AI is more of it," said Schmidt, the former Google chairman. "This generation is much more socially conscious than we were, and more broadly concerned about the impact of everything they do, so you'll see a combination of both optimism and realism."
In the years following that conversation in the driveway, the dangers and ills of AI have become more apparent. Seemingly every day, new statistics emerge about the tide of job loss wrought by the technology, from long-haul truckers to farmworkers to dermatologists. Elon Musk called AI "humanity's existential threat" and compared it to "summoning the demon."
Researchers and journalists have shown how AI technologies, largely designed by white and Asian men, tend to reproduce and amplify social biases in dangerous ways. Computer vision technologies built into cameras have trouble recognizing the faces of people of color. Voice recognition struggles to pick up English accents that aren't mainstream. Algorithms built to predict the likelihood of parole violations are rife with racial bias.
And there are political ramifications: Recommendation software designed to target ads to interested consumers was abused by bad actors, including Russian operatives, to amplify disinformation and false narratives in public debate.
"The question comes down to whether this revolution of AI - and of today's machine learning techniques - will contribute to the progression of humanity," said Hoffman, who chairs the institute's advisory council. He called Stanford's institute a potential "key lever" that would act as a "catalyst," trusted adviser and source of intelligence for industry, the government and the public. Hoffman ran into trouble last year after reports showed that he had funded a disinformation campaign on Facebook during the Alabama election. He said he did not know his money was used that way.
While universities in recent years have drawn criticism for raising large amounts of money - Stanford is among the biggest fundraisers - the cash is particularly necessary if universities are to remain competitive in the field of AI, said James Manyika, an advisory council member and director of the McKinsey Global Institute. Not only will the money be used to retain talent, but also to fund costly data processing machines that can run artificial intelligence applications at scale.
"The goal is to have resources that will enable Stanford to be competitive," Manyika said. "If you gave researchers at Stanford access to compute, that will slow down the brain drain quite a bit toward these corporate labs."
Schmidt said he had observed a "tipping point" in the past year or so, where computer science programs across the country are adding courses in AI ethics and big companies such as Google are announcing AI principles and creating internal programs to attempt to take the bias out of the software they are building. Schmidt said that Stanford's program would elevate and centralize these ad hoc efforts, but also contribute to the development of the field.
One of the bigger questions HAI has yet to answer is the extent to which it will take policy positions on some of the toughest issues, in which Li and others involved with HAI have been directly involved. Last year, when Li was running artificial intelligence for Google Cloud, Google became embroiled in controversy for obtaining a Pentagon contract to improve artificial intelligence that can scan video footage coming in from drones. Many Google employees protested the contract, and some even quit.
Li cautioned her colleagues against using the term AI when discussing the contract because of the sensitivity of the topic, according to a New York Times report and confirmed by Li. Etchemendy said HAI would not take sides or dictate decisions to other organizations.
Etchemendy said that 200 faculty members, from departments such as law and anthropology, have applied for funding from the think tank. Fifty-five have received seed grants to research AI's implications for topics including medical decision-making, gender bias and refugee resettlement.
One of the institute's biggest strengths would be its commitment to diversity within the profession, Etchemendy said, and its recruitment of experts from fields not traditionally associated with AI.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke has vowed to keep his language on the campaign trail PG-rated after coming under fire for letting the profanity fly, despite a rich tradition of presidential profanity.

O’Rourke was called out by a voter during a stop in Madison, Wis., over the weekend for his use of a certain four-letter word, which he's done in front of his children and even during his concession speech after losing his Senate race to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.

“I am so fucking proud of you guys,” O’Rourke said of his supporters at the time in televised remarks that had networks reaching for the bleep button.

While the comment may have elicited applause and hollers from the crowd in Texas, the voter urged O’Rourke to “clean up your language."

“Great point,” O’Rourke said in response to the protest about his profanity. “And I don’t intend to use the F-word going forward. Point taken, and very strongly made. … We’re going to keep it clean.”

While the Texas Democrat is promising to lay off the profanity, he is hardly the first presidential hopeful to let a few foul words fly on the campaign trail, and it’s unlikely he will be the last. In fact, even the men who have occupied the very office O’Rourke is yearning to hold have spewed their fair share of obscenities.

In the 1996 book Presidential Anecdotes , President Lyndon B. Johnson is described as the “earthiest man” to occupy the White House. On one occasion, for example, Johnson was asked why, during his tenure as Senate majority leader, he didn’t take a speech by then-Vice President Richard Nixon more seriously.

“Boys, I may not know much, but I know the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad,” he replied.

Nixon, too, saw a swearing scandal swirl when the transcripts of the tapes from his White House conversations included the phrase “expletive deleted" numerous times.

In 2000, then-candidate George W. Bush was caught on a hot mic during a campaign event offering a colorful description of New York Times reporter Adam Clymer, calling him a “major-league asshole.”

Four years later, Vice President Dick Cheney told Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., on the Senate floor to “fuck yourself.”

Former President Barack Obama famously referred to rapper Kanye West as a “jackass” — albeit a talented one — in an interview with the Atlantic, and in 2010, his vice president, Joe Biden, excitedly told Obama that passage of the Affordable Care Act was "a big fucking deal.”

And President Trump has hardly shied away from a swear word or two.

During a rally in Alabama in September 2017, the president urged NFL owners to “get that son of a bitch off the field right now,” referencing players who kneel for the national anthem. His alleged use of the word "shithole" to describe Haiti and African countries also set off a diplomatic firestorm, and most recently, during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference this month, he accused Democrats and federal investigators of “trying to take you out with bullshit.”

In our opinion: Love needed in the wake of New Zealand's tragedy

Texto completo: In the wake of a tragedy as awful as the mass murders at mosques in New Zealand, it’s natural for people and institutions to wonder what could have been done to identify and prevent problems ahead of time.
Politicians mull tougher laws. Regular people feel helpless in the face of a worldwide culture that seems saturated with hate.
Police, meanwhile, brace for copycat crimes. Indeed, the suspect in this case claimed in his manifesto that one his main sources of inspiration was a Norwegian who killed 77 people in a similar shooting spree in 2011.
Hate and violence seem to breed more of the same, just as, on a smaller scale, insults beget retaliatory insults that seem to breed and grow like rats.
It’s a cycle that has become all too familiar as such tragedies seem to proliferate.
But if that is true, it also follows that love and forgiveness breed and spread as well. The only truly positive response to senseless violence, then, may be a resolve to begin spreading this countermeasure with greater energy.
In an essay for The Guardian last year, Eva Wiseman wrote, “We perform kindnesses in response to darkness and, in turn, our lives are improved. Which means that rather than old-fashioned or altruistic, kindness is as modern as it gets.”
In a recent interview with the Deseret News, American Enterprise Institute President Arthur C. Brooks spoke of actions that demonstrate love, and he urged people to develop relationships with people with whom they disagree. The opposite of love is fear, and humans tend to fear and denigrate those they don’t know.
One way to avoiding bad behavior, then, is to resolve not to be anonymous, especially online. “Anonymity is, in my view, inconsistent with fully human behavior,” Brooks said. “We have basically chosen to dehumanize ourselves, to say I am not an individual.”
And when people dehumanize, they tend to do bad things they otherwise wouldn’t.
We would place this prominently on any list of things average people can do to make the world better. Resolve not to be anonymous. Stand behind your opinions.
That list also would include airing differences with respect and an open mind. A good exercise is to habitually ponder how you might argue your opponent’s case. Doing so may not convince you of your own error, but it would help you see the opposition in a more human light.
But while civil arguments are important for peaceful human interaction, the real key to a better society is service. If everyone resolved to spend part of each week in voluntary service of some kind, many fears and animosities would melt away.
Utah consistently leads the nation in surveys that measure volunteer work. That kind of service tends to replace expectations of entitlement with a sense of one’s own responsibility to the well-being of a community.
We’re not suggesting a resolve to do these things would rid the world of hate and violence. Experts point to mental health issues that may have driven the suspect to do what he did last week. Racists and other hate-filled people feed off each other in dark corners of the internet.
In this case, the suspect seemed to live a normal life on the surface. The New York Times quoted the vice president of a local gun club describing him as polite and eager to help set up and put things away during competitions.
No, getting to the heart of such an unspeakably evil deed can be complicated and confusing. But countering hate should not be.
Laws can help limit access to weapons. Institutions can help people with mental disorders.
But love, which undeniably would make the world better, must be spread on an individual basis. That is the one appropriate and meaningful thing everyone can do in response to such a tragedy.

Diabetes Care Can Be Costly Yet Wasteful

Texto completo: More than 30 million people in the United States have diabetes. The vast majority of them have Type 2 diabetes. Some of those are testing their blood sugar at home, but the best research is telling us that they don't need to -- that in fact it's a waste of money.
It's not a small problem. The waste is running into the billions of dollars, and it's costing all of us money through the health care system.
For people with Type 1 diabetes, blood glucose monitoring and insulin administration is the standard of care. Patients need to check their blood sugar a number of times a day, then give themselves insulin to replace what would have been made in the pancreas. Treatment for Type 2 diabetes, however, doesn't involve these critical calculations of insulin. It's usually maintained with a pretty regular administration of the same drugs on a set schedule.
Self-monitoring for blood glucose, therefore, may be unnecessary for those not on insulin. This has been tested in well-designed studies.
The Monitor trial, published two years ago in JAMA Internal Medicine, was a pragmatic trial that took place in 15 primary care practices in North Carolina. Patients with Type 2 non-insulin-treated diabetes were randomly assigned to one of three groups.
People in the first group were told to check their blood glucose once a day. People in the second were told to check their blood glucose once a day, and then were given tailored advice depending on the results from the meter. The third group was told not to check blood sugar at all.
After one year (a pretty impressive length for a study like this), there were no differences in the hemoglobin A1C levels (the best way to monitor long-term blood glucose control) between the three groups. There were also no differences in the health-related quality of life measures for the patients. There were no differences in the number of times they experienced hypoglycemia, how much care they needed, and how many progressed to the need for insulin.
In other words, there were no measurable differences in how patients fared, whether they checked blood sugar or not.
This evidence, while the best to date, confirmed what previous work had shown. A 2012 Cochrane review assessed all the randomized controlled trials through 2011 that had investigated how testing for blood glucose at home improved outcomes. It included 12 trials involving more than 3,200 patients. By 12 months, the overall benefit to testing, with respect to lab values, was statistically insignificant. There were never any benefits with respect to patient satisfaction.
Still, not everyone is on board. Critics of this most recent trial said it didn't prove that blood glucose monitoring couldn't help: It's possible that with better training, or more attention to detail, there might be ways to make this work.
The point of pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials like this, though, is to test how practices work in the real world. In these high-quality primary care practices, even with customized help in interpreting the measurements (which is more than most patients get), testing blood sugar didn't make a difference.
Choosing Wisely, an educational campaign aiming to reduce unnecessary medical tests and procedures, advises against routine home glucose monitoring for patients with Type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin. It says there is no benefit, and that there are potential harms (a study has shown an association with increased anxiety and depression). This argument is supported by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the Society of General Internal Medicine and the Endocrine Society.
Of course, there are exceptions. When patients are acutely ill, or changing regimens, or finding that their blood sugar is not well controlled, testing may be appropriate. Such decisions should be made in consultation with a physician.
But for most people with Type 2 diabetes not on insulin, testing is inappropriate most of the time. That message is not getting through. At the end of last year, another study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine that quantified the prevalence of glucose testing in adults. Researchers examined a database that contained data on more than 370,000 commercial health insurance and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries who had Type 2 diabetes.
Of the more than 23 percent of patients who were using testing strips, more than half were probably doing so in spite of widespread recommendations that they shouldn't. They were using a median of two testing strips a day at a cost of more than $325 per year per patient.
On another front, The New York Times has reported that "a surprisingly large number of people" who use insulin are using less because they can't afford it, putting themselves in danger.
With a health care system as complicated as ours, it's hard to take money from one pot and shift it easily to another. Efficiency in each system is crucial. The fact that a necessary facet of diabetes care is increasingly out of reach -- while unnecessary and potentially harmful care is easily overused -- illustrates how much work still needs to be done.

Texto completo: Netflix was already home to a dizzying amount of content before it committed to churning out 1,000 original series, films and specials in 2018. And there's much more on the horizon: The streaming site has production deals with not only Barack and Michelle Obama, but also with some of TV's most powerful creators, including Ryan Murphy, Marti Noxon and Kenya Barris. Then there's the steady flow of (often foreign) Netflix originals that are bought by the streaming service postproduction -- "Bodyguard," for example, was created by the BBC.
It's a lot to keep up with. If you've fallen behind, here are some recent Netflix originals that are worth checking out. Whether you're looking for a new reality dating show, an irreverent comedy or a broody British thriller, there's a little something for everyone on this list.

'Russian Doll'
It's rare for a new show to garner as much universal adoration as this dark comedy did when it had its premiere in early February. Created by Leslye Headland ("Bachelorette), Natasha Lyonne and Amy Poehler, "Russian Doll" stars Lyonne as a New Yorker stuck in a loop of dying and coming back to life at the same time and place -- in the bathroom at her 36th birthday party. Funny, cleverly structured and a little melancholy, the series turns out to be a surprisingly poignant meditation on repressed trauma and self-actualization. And even if all that weren't true, it would still be worth the watch for Lyonne's tough-as-nails Nadia, a true original, just like the woman who plays her.

'Sex Education'
Teen sex comedies typically rely on gross-out humor: sticky substances turning up in inopportune places, badly timed cases of mistaken identity, drunk kids doing things with people they don't really like. But this British series, starring Asa Butterfield as a 16-year-old transfer student and the indomitable Gillian Anderson as his sex-therapist mom, is different. It's certainly not prudish -- the opening scene alone is testament to that. But despite the nudity and explicit sex scenes, "Sex Education" is an earnest, sweet coming-of-age (no pun intended) story, featuring excellent performances from Butterfield and Anderson, as well as the supporting players Ncuti Gatwa and Emma Mackey.

'Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj'
Following his excellent stand-up special, "Homecoming King," the comedian Hasan Minhaj returns to Netflix with this political variety show. (You could call it a "late night show" but, well, that designation makes less and less sense in the age of streaming.) "Patriot Act," now in its second season, is like a cross between "Full Frontal With Samantha Bee" and "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver." Like the latter series, "Patriot Act" structures its episodes by subject, allowing Minhaj to dive deep into a topic -- like immigration enforcement in the United States, predatory drug pricing or the rise of Amazon -- for 20 minutes at a time. The episodes aren't numbered, so you can pick and choose which issues appeal to you. And the wide-eyed, hyper-aware Minhaj is an energetic and charismatic host. Enjoy.
-- Stream it on Netflix.
'Bodyguard'
A taut, six-episode thriller (bless the British), "Bodyguard" features the former "Game of Thrones" star Richard Madden as the title character, a veteran named David Budd who is assigned to protect a Conservative member of Parliament, Julia Montague (Keeley Hawes). Budd is a tough-guy hero who looks good in a leather jacket, but he's not made of steel, and Madden makes sure the strain of his job shows plainly on his face. When it had its premiere in Britain last year, "Bodyguard" became the BBC's most-watched drama since 2008, and Madden won a Golden Globe earlier this year for his performance as the tense, trauma-addled Budd.

'Salt Fat Acid Heat'
Based on the 2017 book by Samin Nosrat (who has a column in The New York Times Magazine), this charming, four-part docu-series explores the four essential elements in cooking. "Salt Fat Acid Heat" is part travelogue, part instructional guide. Viewers tag along as Nosrat jets from Italy to Japan to Mexico, and back to her home in California, learning from the locals about how to achieve culinary perfection. On this show, good cooking doesn't require following a recipe to the letter. Instead, it requires knowledge of how certain ingredients and processes can produce mouth-wateringly good food. Nosrat's enthusiasm is infectious, making the show a must-watch for foodies and anyone who longs to be a competent, intuitive home chef.

'Derry Girls'
Another British show, "Derry Girls" is set in Northern Ireland in the '90s, during the Troubles. This sprightly comedy follows a high schooler, Erin (Saoirse-Monica Jackson), her daffy cousin Orla (Louisa Harland), and her friends Michelle, Clare and James (Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell and Dylan Llewellyn). The threat of violence permeates the series: James, Michelle's newly arrived English cousin, is forced to attend their all-girls' Catholic school out of concerns for his safety were he to go to the boys' school. And yet the show's creator, Lisa McGee, keeps it in the background, focusing instead on the characters' more typical day-to-day teenage concerns. Siobhan McSweeney is a standout as the Catholic school's deadpan head nun.

'Dating Around'
Anyone else miss "Blind Date," the early-'00s dating show that let viewers squirm watching first dates? Netflix has just the show for you. Each episode of "Dating Around" centers on one hopeful New Yorker as he or she goes on a series of first dates, and don't let the sleek production fool you: The show may look more polished than earlier iterations of dating reality TV, but the dates range from sweetly awkward to I-want-to-tear-my-eyeballs-out-but-I-can't-stop-watching excruciating. There are no on-camera testimonials here -- you have to judge for yourself (with the help of some cheeky editing) what each participant thinks of his or her date. As glam as the establishing shots may look, the show is as awkward as New York dating really is.
-- Stream it on Netflix.
'The Haunting of Hill House'
This loose adaptation of Shirley Jackson's famous 1959 horror novel was one of several spooky Netflix offerings to debut around Halloween last year. Its creator, Mike Flanagan, takes some liberties with the source material, setting his version in the present day. He also centers the 10 episodes on the Crain siblings, who have been haunted for years by their brief childhood stay at the creepy Hill House. The show goes back and forth between past and present, with varying results. It's hard to make those jump-out-of-your-seat scares stretch for the series' 10 hours, and there are times when you might wish that a ghost is just a ghost, not a metaphor for lingering childhood trauma. But for horror fans, or Jackson acolytes, "Hill House" is good for some spine-chilling thrills.
-- Stream it on Netflix.
'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina'
Another of Netflix's 'Ween '18 originals, "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina" is the long-awaited star vehicle for Kiernan Shipka, who played Sally Draper in "Mad Men." If you grew up watching the series "Sabrina the Teenage Witch," starring Melissa Joan Hart, be warned: On "Chilling Adventures," the Archie Comics character gets the dark-teen-supernatural-drama treatment. It has more in common with the CW's "Riverdale," both of which were developed by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. The series opens on the eve of Sabrina's "dark baptism" (which, let's be honest, is basically a werewolf bar mitzvah), and treats its lead character's unusual circumstances as a way to explore the tricky balancing act of growing up female.
-- Stream it on Netflix.
'You'
"You" first debuted on Lifetime, back in September 2018. The psychological thriller, based on the novel by Caroline Kepnes, struggled to find an audience, and the network canceled it after one season. But when it landed on Netflix in December, "You" became a bona fide hit, and its second season will be produced by Netflix. Following a bookstore owner named Joe (Penn Badgley) who stalks and, eventually, woos an aspiring young writer and grad student named Beck (Elizabeth Lail), "You" is both frothy and sharp. Cleverly, the show makes Beck just as absorbing -- and in some ways, as slippery -- as Joe. It'll tie your stomach in knots, in a good way.

Texto completo: Like most liberal candidates, he's appealing to young voters. O'Rourke, 46, won 71 percent of the millennial vote in his unsuccessful Texas Senate campaign last year.
Robert "Beto" O'Rourke should worry Republicans. With less baggage than Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren; more name recognition than Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg; greater likability than Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker; and better media support than former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro, O'Rourke might just be a force to be reckoned with. Plus, he has gotten a few other unique things going for him.
Like most liberal candidates, he's appealing to young voters. O'Rourke, 46, won 71 percent of the millennial vote in his unsuccessful Texas Senate campaign last year. But his age and his apparent "relatability" might be able to mobilize even more young people than older, experienced candidates like Biden. Seeing as millennials are soon to be the largest voting bloc, securing their widespread support is key.
O'Rourke might also be able to gain support from a more unlikely group: white evangelicals, many of whom seem to be increasingly sympathetic toward the leftist position on border policy and refugees. He was a guest on the podcast of Jen Hatmaker, a popular Christian influencer whose audience is largely made up this demographic. The New York Times ran a piece in October on the appeal he has to previously conservative evangelical women. This group, though typically Republican, could help lead Democrats to a 2020 victory.
Lastly, O'Rourke is from Texas. Democrats want Texas. If Democrats are able to flip the state the way they flipped California and Colorado, they can count on dominance for years to come. O'Rourke might have lost the senatorial election to Sen. Ted Cruz, but only narrowly. He could pick up more traction in a presidential race, which could be enough to win the state.
Of course, without these things, O'Rourke is a terrible candidate. He's inexperienced, professionally and politically unaccomplished, and is unable to accurately articulate his policy positions. He embodies everything the left says it hates: white, male, rich privilege.
Even so, for Democrats, the question isn't whether he or any of their candidates embody their values, or even whether or not any of them would make a good president. The only question is: Can the candidate beat President Donald Trump? For O'Rourke, the answer is, probably, yes.

Texto completo: In search of something to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
"House on Fire" by Bonnie Kistler (Atria Books, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: A blended family is plunged into crisis when the son of one parent kills the daughter of the other in a drunk-driving accident. Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.
"An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System" by Matt Richtel (William Morrow, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Matt Richtel provides a deeply reported and entertainingly written exploration of the human immune system and how it works, told through the intimate stories of four lives grappling with mortality.
The buzz: "Richtel creates a hard-to-put-down account of the body's first line of defense," says Publishers Weekly.
"The Dragonfly Sea" by Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor (Knopf, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: On Pate Island, off the coast of Kenya, a young girl yearning for the father she never knew bonds with a sailor and soon finds herself called to the sea. With a rich and enormous cast of global characters, Owuor depicts the cultural complexities of East Africa in a stirring story of loss and discovery.
The buzz: A starred review in Publishers Weekly calls it a "sprawling, beautiful novel," an epic that "establishes Owuor as a considerable talent."
"Soldier, Sailor, Frogman, Spy, Airman, Gangster, Kill or Die: How the Allies Won on D-Day" by Giles Milton (Henry Holt, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: In time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day comes this anecdotal history of that fateful day when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy. The day is narrated in a symphony of surviving voices – a teenage Allied conscript, a French resistance fighter, a butcher's daughter – placing the reader in the heat of the action.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls the book a "worthy commemoration of a key historical moment."
"Too Much Is Not Enough," by Andrew Rannells (Crown, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Actor and star of Broadway's "The Book of Mormon" and HBO's "Girls" Andrew Rannells tells the story of his life so far in a charming memoir that charts his journey from a hopeful and sexually confused Nebraska kid with big ambitions to the bright lights of New York City.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls it an "inspiring and consistently witty entertainment memoir."

See America through eyes of immigrants; Essay collection leaves mind abuzz; REVIEW

Texto completo: Two years before the election of President Trump and the bitter politics of border walls, Muslim bans and s---hole countries, the American publishing industry was facing an identity crisis. A viral social media movement led by writers of color called #WeNeedDiverseBooks began pushing the industry to acknowledge and address its resounding whiteness. The failure to cultivate the voices of American writers of minority and immigrant backgrounds was the failure to tell a full national story, writer Junot Diaz explained in a New Yorker essay.
Soon after the 2016 election, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Viet Thanh Nguyen published a piece in The New York Times arguing that the outcome was partly the failure of writers. "The struggle over the direction of our country," he wrote, "is also a fight over whose words will win and whose images will ignite the collective imagination." Immigrants needed to tell their story - and tell it better.
"The Good Immigrant" is a culmination of the current political moment and a natural extension of the ongoing work to integrate American publishing. The 26 essays in this anthology are deeply personal reflections on adolescence, family, love and identity as experienced and felt by the American immigrant artist. From published heavyweights like Teju Cole and Alexander Chee to newer voices like Muslim American punk-rocker Basim Usmani and Pakistani Kashmiri-American poet Fatimah Asghar, this banquet of writing is a triumphant celebration of American multiplicity.
The book was inspired by an original British edition, which was published at the height of the Brexit debate with a largely different roster of writers. In the introduction to the American edition, the editors, Nikesh Shukla and Chimene Suleyman, explain that what both collections share is their desire to amplify the voices of immigrants through a kind of collective literary activism. In a cultural climate defined by xenophobia and anti-immigrant policies, this book seeks to showcase the gifts and humanity of immigrant artists.
It's a noble mission. And yet, as a reader, I worried that a collection defined by politics could crumble under the weight of good intentions. Essays lifted from social media outrage or powered by reactionary rage can satisfy in the instant but fade as the moment passes. Thankfully, this collection is a resounding success on multiple fronts. Its righteous rage is perfectly matched by its literary rewards.
The American edition of the "The Good Immigrant" is best heard as a surround-sound chorus that bristles with an unpredictable, electric energy. Language, style and rhythm shift with each piece, keeping our attention. In "Luck of the Irish," Maeve Higgins explores how white privilege helped her, an Irish immigrant living in the country illegally, as brown families in similar conditions are prosecuted. In a love letter to her mother, Indian-American writer Krutika Mallikarjuna finds humor in the ridiculous conundrum of dating in the multiracial mayhem of Brooklyn. "Of the many pitfalls of being a queer desi woman swimming through Tinder," she writes, "I never expected to find myself getting trashed in a bar trying to forget that I was on a date with a white girl named India."
Several of the essays are by first-time authors who work in other artistic mediums. My favorite essay is by Nigerian-American fashion designer Wale Oyejide. The African-inspired textiles and silhouettes of his celebrated fashion line Ikire Jones are regularly shown on global runways and featured prominently in the Oscar-winning blockbuster "Black Panther." In an essay about his artistic coming of age, Oyejide explores the struggles of stay-at-home fatherhood with biting humor and then widens his lens to a crisis of masculinity that fails to allow men to be more than conventional breadwinners and pursue the arts. He writes about his designs as a political instrument to restore dignity and beauty to black bodies draped in shades of violence and suffering in popular culture.
"Our uprisings don't always come in the guise of smashed windows, overturned cars or respectable slave owners forcibly torn from their stone housings in front of Capitol buildings. Sometimes they come in the form of building-sized brown faces broadcast on cinema screens, portraying characters who are miles away from the token mistress we have to come to accept for want of more inspiring alternatives," he writes. Immigrant creativity is about imagining new possibility, he explains: "There will be endless stories to write. And, increasingly, there will be audiences filled with us waiting to hear them being told."
The best work here offers reflections on the creative process, alongside the fear of family, society and failure that keeps many immigrant artists from expressing themselves. The collection concludes with a call to arms by novelist Jade Chang, with a practical step-by-step guide to embracing one's voice titled "How to Center Your Own Story."
As I finished "The Good Immigrant," my mind was buzzing with the multitude of voices, stories, heartbreaks and dreams featured in its 300-plus pages. The book is a welcome corrective to the nationalist calls for walls, borders and exclusion that seek to narrow the boundaries of what it means to be American. Each essay is a tantalizing introduction - and invitation - to the larger body of work these artists have already created and will continue to make long after this moment passes.
Bilal Qureshi is a culture writer and radio journalist whose work has appeared in The Washington Post, The New York Times and Newsweek, and on NPR.

Texto completo: AP National Writer
NEW YORK — W.S. Merwin, a prolific and versatile master of modern poetry who evolved through a wide range of styles as he celebrated nature, condemned war and industrialism and reached for the elusive past, died on Friday. He was 91.
A Pulitzer Prize winner and former U.S. poet laureate, Merwin completed more than 20 books, from early works inspired by myths and legends to angry protests against environmental destruction and the conflict in Vietnam to late meditations on age and time.
He wrote rhymes and blank verse, a brief report on the month of January and a book-length story in verse about colonialism and the birth of modern Hawaii. Like his hero, Henry David Thoreau, he was inspired equally by reverence for the planet and anger against injustice.
He died in his sleep at his home on the Hawaiian island of Maui, according to publisher Copper Canyon Press and the Merwin Conservancy, which the poet founded.
“He is an artist with a very clear spiritual profile, and intellectual and moral consistency, which encompasses both his work and his life,” fellow poet Edward Hirsch once said of him.
Merwin received virtually every honor a poet could ask for — more, it turned out, than he desired. In protest of the Vietnam War, he declined a Pulitzer in 1971 for “The Carrier of Ladders,” saying he was “too conscious of being an American to accept public congratulation with good grace, or to welcome it except as an occasion for expressing openly a shame which many Americans feel.”
William Stanley Merwin was born in New York City in 1927. He soon moved to Union City, New Jersey, living for years on a street now called “W.S. Merwin Way,” then to Scranton, Pennsylvania.
In a long, autobiographical poem, “Testimony,” he remembered his father as a weary, disappointed man, subsisting on “pinched salaries” and “traveling sick with some nameless illuminating ill.” His mother was orphaned early in life and grieved again when her baby, a boy she meant to name after her father, died “when he had scarcely wakened.”
In a household as grim as an abandoned parking lot, the way out was pointed by words, which seemed to float around Merwin like magic bubbles. He would try to memorize scripture he heard his father recite and fairy tales his mother told him. By age 13, he was already composing hymns.
He received a scholarship from Princeton University, becoming the first family member to attend college, and began meeting some of the great poets of the present and future. Galway Kinnell was a classmate at Princeton and John Berryman a teacher.
After graduating, he lived in Spain and tutored the son of Robert Graves. In London, he became friends with Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes and remained close through the collapse of their marriage and Plath’s suicide, in 1963. Merwin’s then-wife, Dido Merwin, would allege that Plath had a crush on him.
Merwin’s promise was obvious. His first collection, “A Mask for Janus,” was selected by W.H. Auden for the coveted Yale Series of Younger Poets competition and was published in 1952. Throughout the 1950s, he wrote poems and plays, including a verse production of “Rumpelstiltskin.”
Times spent in Boston with Robert Lowell convinced him to concentrate on poetry, and by the end of the decade, he was regarded as a highly talented artist immersed in Old English literature, his verse likened by The New York Times to “a broad river flowing through peaceful land.”
By the early 1960s, he was marching against nuclear weapons and throwing off the rules of grammar, inspired by his “growing sense that punctuation alluded to an assumed allegiance to the rational protocol of written language.”
Meanwhile, Vietnam and urbanization darkened his vision. “I/can hear the blood crawling over the plains,” he wrote in “The Child.” In “The Crust,” the downfall of a tree is a metaphor for the severing of civilization:
and with the tree
went all the lives in it
that slept in it ate in it
met in it believed in it
In the 1970s, he settled permanently in Hawaii and studied under the Zen Buddhist master Robert Aitken. Divorced years earlier from Dorothy Jeanne Ferry and from Dido Milroy, he married his third wife, Paula Schwartz, in a Buddhist ceremony in 1983. She died in 2017.

Texto completo: College basketball, everywhere. For one wild day, fans can leap bettween tourney championship games. At 6 p.m. ET, they can choose between Mountain West on CBS, Big 12 on ESPN and SWAC on ESPNU. Then it's Big East at 6:30 on Fox, MAC at 7:30 on ESPN2 and more: Big Sky (8 p.m., ESPNU), ACC (8:30, ESPNU). Southland (9:30, ESPN2). WAC (10 p.m., ESPNU) and Pac 12 (10:30 p.m., ESPN). Six more are in their semi-finals, including the Big Ten at 1 and 3:30 p.m. on CBS.
"One Night for One Drop," 8 p.m., CBS. Spectacle and charity entwine in this special. It's the seventh annual performance by Cirque du Soleil, as a fundraiser to address the global water crisis; it's also the first time it's been televised. Kevin Frazier and Olympic champion Tara Lipinski are the hosts.
"Ransom," 9 p.m., CBS. As a negotiator, Eric's job is to free the hostage, not capture the perpetrator. Now that comes back to haunt him, when a perp from the past returns, threatening to hurt a child.
"Ghostbusters" (2016), 8-11 p.m., FX; then "Saturday Night Live," 11:29 p.m., NBC. "SNL" has a rerun from December, with Matt Damon hosting and Mark Ronson and Miley Cyrus combining as music guest. And you can make it a night full of the show's past and present stars and hosts, by also catching the "Ghostbusters" reboot; it's a fun ride, with Kate McKinnon, Kristin Wiig, Leslie Jones, Melissa McCarthy and (briefly) Dan Aykroyd.
"The Crossword Mysteries: A Puzzle to Die For," 9 p.m., Hallmark Movies and Mysteries. Here's a second chance to see the film concocted by Will Shortz, the New York Times' crossword whiz. Naturally, it has a crossword creator (Lacey Chabert) finding that the puzzles are linked to a murder.

Texto completo: Portsmouth Herald
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen questioned Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan earlier this week about a published report that states the Pentagon is lobbying the Trump administration to adopt a weaker standard for PFAS chemicals.
The New York Times reported the Pentagon is lobbying the administration to weaken the PFAS standard for groundwater as the Environmental Protection Agency is working to set tougher standards.
Shaheen, D-N.H., told Shanahan she was “quite concerned” about the New York Times report.
“You and I first had a chance to talk about PFAS chemicals and how they're affecting the former Pease Air Force Base in 2017,” Shaheen told Shanahan during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Thursday morning in Washington, D.C. “I told you about the hundreds of people, children, who had been drinking water, and those chemicals have now showed up (in their blood tests.)”
“No one knows what the long-term health impacts of drinking that water is,” she added.
She also pointed to the 401 military facilities nationwide dealing with PFAS contamination and said she is “very concerned about the fact that the Department of Defense would be trying to reduce the standard that the EPA is setting to try to ensure that drinking water is safe.”
Shaheen added the PFAS standards will not just impact civilians, “but ... our members of the military,”
“I don't understand how you and the Department of Defense can be trying to reduce the standards that affect drinking water for literally millions of people across the country,” Shaheen said.
Shanahan said he wasn't familiar with the article, but pledged to “look at what the actual situation is in terms of the standards.”
“What I am is accountable and responsible for the safety and security of our men and women,” he said during Thursday's hearing. “You have my assurance that we will continue to do that. I will look into this matter. I take these matters personally, very, very seriously, just as we have talked before.”
Thousands of people working at Pease International Tradeport, along with children and infants who attended two day-care centers there, were exposed to multiple PFAS chemicals from contaminated water in the city-owned Haven well up until its closure in 2014. The city closed the polluted well in May 2014 after the Air Force found high levels of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS, in the well.
The EPA in May 2016 set permanent health advisories for PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA at 70 parts per trillion.
PFAS are man-made chemicals used in products worldwide since the 1950s, including firefighting foam, which is believed to have contaminated the Haven Well.
The Agency For Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has stated PFAS chemicals are a suspected carcinogen, can harm childhood development, increase cholesterol levels, hurt the immune system and interfere with the human body's hormones.
Shaheen also asked Shanahan if he “could confirm or deny whether DOD has urged a lowering of the standard that the EPA is trying to put in place.”
Shanahan said he couldn't “speak to that specific.”
“I will very quickly get an answer back to you,” he added.
Shaheen thanked him and added “that's something that's important for the entire committee to know because as you know installations across the country are affected And we don't really know what the long-term health impacts are. So getting those answers are very important.”
Shaheen helped pass legislation that created the first national health study on the effects of drinking water contaminated with PFAS, which will include a pilot study for the Pease community.

Texto completo: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - A new piece of evidence found by investigators on the ground here suggests the Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed Sunday may have had a problem with a new flight-control system also suspected in the crash of a Lion Air flight in October.
It is the second piece of information suggesting similarities between the two crashes involving Boeing 737 Max 8 jets.
Investigators found a device known as a jackscrew in the wreckage. The jackscrew, used to set the trim that raises and lowers the plane's nose, indicates the jet was configured to dive, according to John Cox, a former pilot and an airline-safety consultant with the Washington-based aviation-safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems.
Cox, formerly the top safety official for the Air Line Pilots Association, said he was privately briefed on the evidence Thursday by people familiar with the investigation.
"All we can say definitely is that the trim was in a position similar to the position found on the Lion Air airplane and it would cause the nose to go down," he said. "This will be consistent with a nose-down flight path, which they think is likely with the Ethiopian airplane.
"It points to one central link," Cox said. "We need the data from the flight data recorders. We need it as quickly as possible. . . . The faster that we get that information, it will let everyone know what needs to be done. We don't know in fact if these accidents are related. There are some similarities."
Daniel K. Elwell, acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, cited newly refined satellite tracking data and evidence recovered from the wreckage site as factors in his decision to ground the jets Wednesday. That data also showed similarities to the Lion Air flight. Cox said he believes the jackscrew is the new evidence Elwell was citing.
Meanwhile, French aviation experts began work Friday on the plane's heavily damaged data and voice recorders.
Officials with France's Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses, which has extensive experience analyzing crashes in Europe, said that work to retrieve information from the flight data recorder of the Boeing 737 Max 8 has begun in coordination with the Ethiopian investigation team.
President Trump spoke by telephone with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Friday to again express his condolences and underscore the United States' commitment to work with Ethiopian and international civil aviation authorities on the investigation. Eight Americans were among the 157 killed in the crash.
The focus now, however, is on the two "black boxes" that arrived in France on Thursday. Germany had earlier turned down the opportunity to examine the recorders.
The data extracted from the recorders will be used to reconstruct the six-minute flight before the plane crashed in a farm field about 40 miles from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 passengers and crew members. That data includes the voice communication of the pilots and the readings of the various sensors.
Officials from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which sent three investigators, the FAA, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and Boeing also are assisting in the probe.
Experts say it typically takes almost a month to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data in the recorders, but at least some early information could be available within 24 to 48 hours.
Former NTSB chairman Christopher Hart, who also is a pilot, said the jackscrew, combined with data gathered from the plane's black box, could give investigators a sense of the plane's flying position before the crash.
"By knowing the stabilizer and elevator position they know what kind of forces the plane was experiencing in the moment," he said.
In a preliminary investigation, the crash of a Lion Air Max 8 plane into the Java Sea on Oct. 29 was attributed to a faulty sensor causing an automated system to push the nose of the plane down. The possibility that the same scenario occurred in Ethiopia has prompted precautionary groundings of the plane all over the world. In all, more than 300 people have died in the two crashes involving the Max 8 jet.
Preliminary flight data showed the Ethiopian Airlines plane in trouble almost immediately and struggling to gain altitude in the high thin air above the Addis Ababa airport. The plane descended and then sharply ascended, while moving at speeds far in excess of normal.
Within minutes the pilot radioed the control tower reporting "flight control" problems and was given clearance to return.
In a description of the exchange reported by the New York Times, Capt. Yared Getachew sounded panicked as he requested permission to return to the airport, shortly before losing contact.
Even amid the worldwide grounding of more than 370 of its 737 Max jets, officials at Boeing continued to maintain the planes are safe to fly. The Chicago-based aviation giant has stopped delivery of the planes, a spokesman said Thursday, but their production continues.
In the case of the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, faulty information from the angle-of-attack sensor convinced the automated system that the plane was going to stall and pushed its nose down while the pilots wrestled to pull the aircraft up. The result was an erratic flight path in which the plane descended and ascended repeatedly before plunging into the Java Sea, killing all 189 passengers and crew aboard.
The data from the recorders in Ethiopia could help determine whether the potential links between the two crashes are real and related to this automated feature on the craft - hundreds of which were flown around the world until China decided to ground them Monday and other countries followed suit.
The recorders are required on all flights - all over the world - and are built to withstand fire, heavy impact and intense water pressure.
The Ethiopian Airlines devices were discovered soon after the crash, leading some U.S. officials to hope the insights they contain will quickly help determine more about what caused the jet to crash shortly after it left Addis Ababa bound for Nairobi.
While Ethiopian investigators have the ability to download information from black boxes, they lacked the tools to do so in this case, given the extensive damage, according to the FAA.
Experts were not surprised the Ethiopians opted to send the flight recorders to France rather than the United States, saying such a move was not unprecedented.
"Many times foreign countries just have a good relation with a certain other country," said Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB investigator and FAA safety manager. "It is closer to fly the recorders to Europe than it is to the United States."

Texto completo: AUSTIN, Texas - When Jordan Peele took the stage to present the world premiere of his new horror film, "Us," at South by Southwest, he had jokes.
"What if I showed four episodes of This Is Us' in a row, with no explanation?" he asked. And he gave a shout-out to another film that brought him to the festival three years ago. "If you haven't seen 'Keanu,' go see it. It's a must-see."
But back to "Us," the follow-up to Peele's Oscar-winning, culture-galvanizing "Get Out." Expectations have been high for "Us" since the trailer dropped on Christmas Day and raised questions around the web. What's up with the family that seems to be terrorized by their creepy doppelgangers? Why the scissors? How much does the 1995 Luniz track "I Got 5 on It" really factor in?
Now, the biggest question to arise after its first public screening is: Does "Us" live up to the hype? I won't give away the plot, but based on the electrified reaction Friday night in the packed Paramount Theater, signs are pointing to yes.
SXSW moviegoers can be more enthusiastic than many; they're eager for a great night out. And Peele seems to be particularly good at generating audience response. "Get Out" mixed humor and chills, and in "Us," Peele's comedy roots are even more apparent. At Friday's screening, the crowd was laughing heartily one moment, screaming the next and cheering soon after.
But Peele wants to leave audiences wondering as well. During a Q&A after the screening, he said, "My favorite thing is the idea that people will leave ready to have a conversation with whoever they're with." He continued, "I also wanted to design a film that's very personal for every individual."
Early critical responses have been positive, while grappling with the movie's meaning.
The Hollywood Reporter wrote, "Maybe every happy ending is somebody else's catastrophe, and therefore, no horror film is ever really over."
In its review, Variety said the movie trades "on some uncanny combination of Peele's imagination and our own to suggest a horror infinitely larger and more insidious than the film is capable of representing."
And Indiewire praised Peele's "ability to explore how past cultural events can take ominous new dimensions in the present."
The rest of America can weigh in when the movie opens in theaters March 22. - (The New York Times)

Play about race, family wins Blackburn Prize

Texto completo: Brooklyn, New York-based playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury won the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize on Monday for "Fairview," her much-lauded play that deals with issues of race and family - and one particular family preparing for an important dinner.
The Blackburn Prize - which comes with $25,000, as well as a signed print by Willem de Kooning - is awarded every year to a woman who writes for the English-language theater.
Drury's "Fairview" was co-commissioned by Berkeley Repertory Theatre in California and Soho Rep in Manhattan, and debuted to sold-out theaters at both places in 2018. Sarah Benson was the director. After its run at the Soho Rep was extended three times, "Fairview" will go to Theater for a New Audience in Brooklyn this June. It will also have its London premiere in November.
"It's exciting, and it's surprising," Drury, 37, said in an interview Monday. "When we were working on the play, I think no one really had a sense of whether or not it would be received well. I was just excited to experiment, so to have it win a prize, and going to London is sort of surreal."
"Fairview" was critically acclaimed and popular, but it is by no means a simple play. It starts as a family comedy, about an extended black family preparing for the grandmother's birthday dinner. But, New York Times co-chief theater critic Ben Brantley wrote, it moves into unexpected and uncomfortable territory: "And then abruptly you're free-falling down a rabbit hole, and there's no safe landing in sight." (He also called the play "dazzling" and "extraordinary").
Along with Drury, nine finalists for the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize were honored and received $5,000 each. Among the finalists for this year's prize was Lily Padilla, for her play "How to Defend Yourself." Last week, Padilla won the Yale Drama Series Prize for that play.
Past winners of the Blackburn Prize have included Sarah Ruhl, Annie Baker and Wendy Wasserstein. Last year, Alice Birch won for her play "Anatomy of a Suicide."
Drury's latest play, "Marys Seacole," opened last week at Claire Tow Theater in a Lincoln Center production. "It has been a really exciting and slightly intense year," she said. "I've never worked on two things so close together, so it will be exciting to take a moment and spend some time reading and thinking." - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: The Soap Factory hopes to reopen on Labor Day. Not in the 52,000-square-foot, four-level historic warehouse it once called home, which was to have undergone a $6.2 million renovation, according to plans revealed with some fanfare in October 2017. Instead, the Soap will reopen in 6,500 square feet of that building, on the lower level. Where the Haunted Basement used to be.
But it will reopen.
A deal was announced Wednesday that will resolve the Soap’s debt issues and provide it with $100,000 to eliminate most if not all of its accumulated operating debt. The Soap will sell to its largest creditor, RJM Construction in Golden Valley, for a sum equal to what the Soap owes RJM, subcontractors, and others. RJM will forgive the Soap’s project-related debts ($3.8 million) and pay subcontractors and other creditors, including the holder of a $1.2 million lien purchased at a sheriff’s sale auction in December. RJM will then sell the building to an investor, not yet publicly identified, who plans to repurpose it as an office building.
The Soap can stay on as a rent-free tenant for two years.
In a statement, board chair Roy Close called this “a bittersweet moment for the Soap Factory.” He said, “RJM’s offer keeps us alive and gives us an opportunity to reinvent ourselves, which is very much in the tradition of the Soap Factory. … We know that some of our constituents were disappointed that we were not able to find a way to continue in an ownership role. From our perspective, however, this is not an end but a new beginning.”
The board has established a program committee to start planning exhibitions and other programs for fall and winter.
The picks
Now at the Science Museum: “Game Changers.” Do “Pac-Man,” “Space Invaders,” “Sonic the Hedgehog” and “SimCity” mean anything to you? What about “Heart of Darkness,” “Flight Control,” “Minecraft” or “Angry Birds”? From now through May 5, the Science Museum’s exhibit gallery is a 10,000-square-foot video arcade with 100 playable games from yesterday and today, plus concept artwork and interviews with more than 30 game designers including pioneers, contemporary designers and independent artists. Spanning nearly 40 years of video game history, the exhibition was created and curated by Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) in Melbourne, the world’s most visited moving image or film museum. Admission is included in regular Science Museum exhibit gallery admission: $19.95 adults, $14.95 kids 4-12 and seniors. FMI.
Starts tonight (Friday, March 15) at MacPhail’s Antonello Hall: Cantus: “When I Grow Up.” Don’t tell Cantus there’s still snow on the ground, because this is its spring program. And it’s all new, with songs about the cycle of life from childhood through adulthood, and themes of adolescence, companionship, parenthood, masculinity, mortality, and becoming who we are. They’ll sing Malcolm Dalglish’s “My Little Potato,” and Lennon and McCartney’s ‘When I’m Sixty-Four,” and songs by Grieg, Schubert, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Kelly Clarkson and Alberto Cortez. Because it’s never too late to figure out what kind of person we want to be. 7:30 p.m., with performances in five more venues between now and Sunday, March 24. FMI and tickets (prices vary by venue).
Opens tonight at the Jungle Theater: “School Girls, Or: The African Mean Girls Play.” Shá Cage directs the Jungle’s first all-women-of-color cast in Jocelyn Bioh’s comedy about beauty and colorism. Set in the 1980s in Ghana’s most exclusive boarding school (Bioh’s parents grew up in Ghana), “School Girls” had its world premiere in 2017, was an Off-Broadway hit and a New York Times Critic’s Pick and won a 2018 Drama Desk Award. Seitu Jones designed the Jungle’s set; Ghanaian-born Jacqueline Addison designed the costumes. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($35-50). Closes April 14.
Opens tonight at the Off-Leash Art Box: Combustible Company: “The Gun Show.” Ian Bivins stars in EM Lewis’ one-man play about firearms, with which Lewis has a complicated relationship. The show leans neither right nor left but asks, “Can we have a conversation about this?” It premiered in Chicago and has since been produced in more than 25 theaters across the country and at the Edinburgh Fringe. Kym Longhi directs. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($15-30 sliding scale). Ends March 24.
Sunday at the Jungle Theater: The Best of Jazz at the Jungle. For 10 years, vocalist Connie Evingson has brought a series of smart programs to the stage of the Jungle Theater on Sunday afternoons. She’s done shows about the Beatles, Peggy Lee, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Dave Frishberg, Hot Club swing, Bossa Nova and more. Even if she chooses just one song from each, that will be enough for her audience to leave happy. She’ll be joined by Jon Weber on piano, Dave Karr on saxophone and Gordy Johnson on bass. 4 p.m. FMI and tickets ($30).
Tuesday at Westminster Town Hall Forum: David Hogg: “Putting the USA over the NRA.” A survivor of the 2018 mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, and a founding member of March for Our Lives, one of the largest youth-led movements in the world, Hogg has been praised and excoriated. At the forum, he’ll answer questions submitted by the in-house, radio and online audiences. At Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis. Doors at 10:30 a.m., music at 11:30 a.m. by the Southside Aces, program at noon. FMI. Free.

Texto completo: On Thursday, former Democratic Congressman Beto O’Rourke announced he was running for president. O’Rourke made a big enough splash for President Trump to find a way to insult him, which suggests that it’s not wildly inappropriate for him to run.
It would have seemed a bit inappropriate just a few years ago, however. O'Rourke has some local government experience, three terms as a U.S. representative, and a splashy but ultimately unsuccessful Senate campaign against one of the most unpopular politicians in America. To put this in another, more cruel way: Beto O'Rourke has less executive experience than Sarah Palin and less government experience than Dan Quayle when they ran for vice president.
Furthermore, some prominent Democrats wanted O'Rourke to run for a different office and challenge Republican John Cornyn for his U.S. Senate seat. Indeed, O'Rourke is merely the latest potential recruit of Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to decide to run for president rather than a Senate seat in 2020. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper also spurned Schumer and chose to run for president rather than challenge Sen. Cory Gardner. Indeed, Hickenlooper went out of his way to say, "I'm not cut out to be a senator," last month.
And then there is Stacey Abrams, who pulled off unprecedented double feat of writing an interesting Foreign Affairs essay and delivering a dynamic State of the Union response. After losing narrowly in the Georgia governor's race last November, Schumer has tried to persuade her to run against Georgia Sen. David Perdue, R. At South by Southwest, however, Abrams talked about running for president. She later tweeted, "Now 2020 is definitely on the table." Former Montana Gov. Steve Bullock is also aiming at the presidency rather than Steve Daines's Senate seat.
Both Politico and the New York Times have noted the phenomenon of presidential campaigns crowding out possible Senate campaigns. The NYT's Glenn Thrush writes, "The Democratic Party's bench is shallow in states that have been dominated by Republicans, like Georgia, Montana, North Carolina and Texas. It is rare for the party to have first-class candidates in such states, let alone talents like Ms. Abrams, Mr. Bullock and Mr. O'Rourke. And getting them to stay at home has proved nearly impossible." It is possible that some of these candidates might try to pull a Rubio if they don't secure the nomination, but one wonders if that option is available only to incumbents.
This seems like an odd trend. Sure, Trump is unpopular, but the fundamentals of 2020 would still seem to favor the incumbent for now. The economy looks pretty good, and Howard Schultz seems bound and determined to complicate life for the 2020 Democratic Party nominee as a potential independent candidate. On the other hand, an awful lot of suburbanites in Texas, Georgia, and Colorado who gave the House to the Democrats might be inclined to vote for a Democrat in the Senate. So what can we make of this phenomenon?
One possible explanation is that the fundamentals are trending in the wrong direction for Trump. Even with a strong economy, he is a very vulnerable candidate. Simply put, there is little chance of Trump winning any of the states that Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and 2018 delivered results in Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin that should scare the crap out of his reelection campaign.
Another factor to consider is that Trump himself has seriously lowered the barriers to entry to running for president. In getting elected, Trump demonstrated the existence of a pathway to the highest office in the land that does not require years in the Senate to build out a resume. Furthermore, the very surfeit of candidates increases the likelihood of an outlier winning the race. As 538′s Nate Silver pointed out last month, "The three past elections when the field was as large as its shaping up to be in 2020 all resulted in party elites failing to get their way."
My hunch, however, is that the biggest explanation is the simplest: It's better to be the president than a senator. Sure, senators have longer terms of office, but they also don't have much individual power. That is particularly true in a polarized chamber in which partisanship matters more than anything. In January, Hickenlooper told Colorado Public Radio, "As a senator, most senators don't - you don't become even the vice chair of a reasonably important committee until your third term... But by the time I got to my third term, I'd be eighty." This is an exaggeration, but not an outrageous one. One reason Barack Obama ran for president after serving only two years as a Senator was that he was frustrated by his lack of influence and the "glacial pace" of the chamber.
Meanwhile, even a fundamentally weak man like Trump can still get a few things done as president of the United States. Imagine what someone with actual political experience, like Hickenlooper, Abrams or O'Rourke, could do if they won the presidency. Even without a pliant Congress, the president can do an awful lot.
This suggests that there's a really good reason to empower Congress a bit more; it might attract a better crop of candidates.

Bono's partner in ethical investing falls from grace in admissions scandal

Texto completo: Impact investing. That's the buzzword for targeting money at investments that can drive social and environmental change, as well as make a profit. While the broader socially responsible investing movement seeks to avoid doing harm — no tobacco, fossil fuel, or gun stocks, for example — impact investors want to initiate and accelerate change.
Think Bono, the lead singer of Irish rockers U2, who told CNBC in January that capitalism is “a wild beast, and if not tamed, can and has chewed up a lot of lives." Bono gave that interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, along with Bill McGlashan, with whom he cofounded the TPG Rise Fund. They opened the fund in 2017 with $2 billion, which made it the biggest impact investing fund by assets. 
Yes, that's the same Bill McGlashan who was charged this week in the nationwide college admission bribery scandal.
While impact investing has been around since about 2007, McGlashan took it to the next level with the Rise Fund, attracting big institutions as investors and creating a board that includes luminaries like John Kerry and Laurene Powell Jobs.
In other words, the master of the ethical investing universe is one of the alleged perps in the mother of all admissions scams.
“I was a bit taken aback that the founder of the Rise Fund was one of the parents named (and recorded) in the admissions scandal," said one investor in the private fund, who asked not to be identified. “He is the king of socially responsible, ethical investing, but like most of these folks . . . it's 'Do as I say, not as I do.' " 
Here's a feel for the kind of investments made by the Rise Fund, which has performed well, according to the investor. Brava is the maker of a “smart" oven that dramatically reduces energy use. Lead School is an Indian company that provides a “school in a box" designed for underserved communities. And Cellulant is a Kenyan company that provides digital payment services.
McGlashan joined TPG, a big private equity firm, in 2004, and he made his name and a ton of money by investing in fast-growing companies like Uber and Airbnb. His TPG Growth Fund became a powerful force in Silicon Valley.
But McGlashan has spent the past few years focused on the Rise Fund. He was in the process of raising $3 billion for a sequel fund — until the admissions scandal broke. McGlashan is accused of paying $300,000 to have his son's ACT admission test score doctored by a crooked proctor, and to have a fake athletic profile created for submission to the University of Southern California.
TPG, which oversees $103 billion in assets, told me that it fired McGlashan Thursday, after earlier putting him on indefinite leave. McGlashan, according to The New York Times, says he resigned before he was terminated.
Bloomberg reports that McGlashan, in a note to board members Thursday, said he's “deeply sorry this very difficult situation may interfere with the work to which I have devoted my life." He added that “there are aspects of the story that have yet to emerge that I wish I could share." 
McGlashan is a “key man" for the Rise Fund, but his firing/resignation doesn't trigger provisions that would allow investors to ask for their money back. However, TPG will allow investors who committed to the Rise Fund II to withdraw if they want to.
In January, McGlashan and Bono unveiled Y Analytics, a firm that will use metrics for assessing the impact of impact investing.
“Impact historically was more of a good intention," McGlashan told CNBC. But Y Analytics aims to hold the Rise Fund and other investors accountable “every day with every deal, in a way that allows us to, with substance, actually measure the output," he added.
Accountability. Yeah. 
McGlashan was all about positive returns on ethical investments. It's too bad he set ethics aside when it came to investing in his son's education.

Texto completo: Facebook said it quickly removed videos of a gunman opening fire inside a New Zealand mosque on Friday who appeared to live-streamed his attack in a 17-minute video that looked to be recorded on a helmet camera.
The Facebook video began with the man driving up to Masjid Al Noor mosque in the city of Christchurch. After parking his car, the man armed himself with at least one weapon and walked into the mosque, immediately shooting a person in the doorway.
In a statement posted to Twitter, Facebook said police alerted them to the video shortly after the livestream commenced and removed both the video and the gunman's Facebook and Instagram accounts.
"We're also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we’re aware," said Facebook.
The social network said they will continue working with police in New Zealand as their investigation continues.
In a statement to Bloomberg,
In a 73-page manifesto posted to various sites including Twitter and Scribd that appeared to belong to the gunman, he identified himself as a 28-year-old white man born in Australia and listed white nationalist heroes.
In Sydney, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Friday that an Australian citizen had been arrested in the mosque shootings.

The names of mass killers were written in white on his weapons, multiple outlets reported.
The New Zealand Herald, which watched the live-stream video, reported that the gunman "began shooting indiscriminately" upon entering the mosque.
He shot a second victim who was crawling in the main hallway, then blocked the hallway and began shooting at people who were cowering in corners of a room. He stopped to reload several times, the Herald reported, and then resumed firing repeatedly.
After three minutes inside, the gunman exited through the mosque's front door. Video showed him shooting randomly at cars. He got more ammunition out of his car trunk, the Herald reported, then shot at no apparent target on the street.
"Looks like we won't get the bird today, boys," he said in the video.
At another point, he said, “There wasn’t even time to aim, there was so many targets,” he says at one point," the New York Times reported.
He then re-entered the mosque, firing at people lying motionless on the ground. The video ended with him driving away from the scene, the Herald reported.

Texto completo: The public ice skating rink at the farmers market parking lot on Quay Street across from Manitowoc Public Library is now closed for the season, the city said Wednesday.
The closure is the result of warmer weather.
Bestselling author Beverly Lewis coming to Two Rivers library New York Times bestselling author Beverly Lewis will visit Lester Public Library, 1001 Adams St., Two Rivers, at 1:30 p.m. April 6 for a book-signing and discussion.
Lewis is the author of more than 90 books and her stories have been published in 11 languages worldwide. Many of her novels are Amish related; the first of which, "The Shunning," has sold more than 1 million copies and was made into an original Hallmark Channel movie.
For more details, contact Lester Public Library at 920-793-8888.
St. Clare Society plans May 23 bus trip to Fireside Dinner Theatre musical The St. Clare Society of St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Parish is planning a bus trip to the Fireside Dinner Theatre in Fort Atkinson on May 23 to see "Menopause the Musical." Cost is $105 per person.
The bus will depart from Perkin's Park & Ride at 7:45 a.m. May 23 and return to the same location around 5 or 5:30 p.m. Menu is Chicken Monterey, although vegetarian and gluten-free meals or other substitutions are available.
Reservations are due by April 24 with payment due at time of reservation. Call Helen at 920-682-4727 to reserve a spot.
Silver Lake College of the Holy Family hosts exhibit by Sheboygan Visual Artists The Silver Lake College of the Holy Family Art Department is hosting an exhibit by Sheboygan Visual Artists (SVA) titled "Meet the Artists," which celebrates personal diversity and identity.
Sixteen artists from the SVA's nearly 100 professional and amateur artists are displaying work through March 22 in the Donald P. Taylor Gallery in Main Hall on campus, 2406 S. Alverno Road.
Erin LaBonte, an associate professor of art and Art Department co-chairwoman at Silver Lake College of the Holy Family, noted that SVA member Chrisje Sanders came up with the "Meet the Artists" theme.
"Each artist was invited to create and submit a work of art that was a self-portrait, so to speak," LaBonte said. "The 'self-portrait' did not have to be literal, but was meant to share something personal or a glimpse into the life of the artist. I imagine this was an interesting challenge for the artists."
Among the 16 SVA members contributing work to the "Meet the Artists" show is current Silver Lake College of the Holy Family student Kimberly Nysse. A large-scale self-portrait artist, Nysse uses bold color and graphic imagery to illicit a powerful, immediate response in her work. She draws from her personal emotional experiences as a catalyst for her art, and hopes the viewer feels a connection within themselves through her portraiture.
Gallery hours are 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Monday-Friday. The Donald P. Taylor Gallery is in the main campus building through the East Entrance.

Once a darling, Big Tech is now a target

Autor: Trumbull, Mark.

Resumen: The push for regulating America’s largest tech firms is about more than Facebook. It’s about a world coming to terms with how information shapes people’s lives.

Texto completo: When Facebook announced on March 6 a new emphasis on user privacy, much of the public reaction was along the lines of “we’ll believe it when we see it.” And two days later, when Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren pledged that her priorities would include breaking up giant tech companies like Google and Facebook, responses were similarly skeptical.
The grains of salt are warranted. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has pledged to respond to public concerns about privacy before. Major antitrust actions to bust apart giant companies are rare.
Yet those recent announcements also symbolize a change that has occurred over the past year or so. Public concerns about online privacy are on the rise. Prominent researchers are wondering aloud if the rise of “Big Tech” is bad for both the economy and society. Politicians of both parties are increasingly talking about the need for a national law to provide data-commerce rules of the road – and the industry itself increasingly agrees.
“There has been an enormous shift,” says Andrea Limbago, chief social scientist at Virtru, a technology firm focused on data protection. And it’s needed, she argues. “In the United States, we really need to have a counterweight to that movement that’s going on [globally toward] digital authoritarianism.”
Although the shift is significant, it doesn’t mean the pendulum is swinging completely toward an embrace of strict internet regulation and a “delete Facebook” rejection of Silicon Valley’s giants.
Legions of consumers are still hooked on Google searches, buying things on Amazon, and checking social media daily or hourly. (When Facebook and its sibling services Instagram and WhatsApp ran into simultaneous derailments Wednesday, users vented and adapted in the only way they knew how – by posting on Twitter.)
Beware the states? In fact, the momentum for a federal data-privacy law is partly rooted in the technology industry’s desire to hold regulatory impulses in check, rather than await the prospect of disparate and sometimes stringent state-level legislation.
Perhaps the central question surrounding proposed federal legislation is whether it will block states from enacting their own laws (as the industry and many innovation advocates urge).
Many Democrats in Congress are wary of preempting state laws unless they feel assured a new federal law will have sufficiently broad protections and enforcement for consumers.
Their desire for a strong law is bolstered by a range of indicators and incidents: 
A succession of high-profile data breaches have hit the news, including one revealed by Facebook last fall that affected as many as 30 million of its users.   On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Facebook’s deals to share user data with other firms. Separately, the Times has reported on mobile-app companies that track users’ locations without informing them that the data could be used in targeting ads. Polls over the past year have found a majority of Americans concerned about data privacy and want government to act (with two-thirds saying that in one SAS survey last summer). Official government reports have amplified concerns about efforts by Russia-based groups to influence U.S. elections, including the 2016 presidential race. Last August, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats described the latter trend as part of a “pervasive messaging campaign by Russia to try to weaken and divide the United States.”
To Ms. Limbago, it’s part of a global battle over how information will shape people’s lives. The Russian efforts, she says, are just one example of how, if unchecked, authoritarian practices can ripple from one nation to another. Conversely, she adds, steps to strengthen online data protection in the U.S. could help promote greater data integrity worldwide.
Others agree.
“It’s not just about protected privacy and competition. It’s really about what is the nature of our liberty in the 21st century both in America and around the world and other democratic societies,” says Jeff Chester, who heads the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer advocacy group in Washington. “That’s really what’s being decided.”
Backlash started in 2018 Although the public backlash started earlier, the changed atmosphere in U.S. policymaking circles began emerging last year as executives including Mr. Zuckerberg were called before Congress to testify and as Republicans joined Democrats in the grilling.
Although the fate of bills is far from certain, bipartisan efforts at legislation on a range of tech-industry issues are underway in both the Democrat-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate.
This week, it was Sens. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who took a turn, rolling out a proposed update for the law on children’s privacy. Then lawmakers questioned tech executives about location tracking and other data-collection practices. And Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted his support of Massachusetts Senator Warren, after reports that Facebook briefly took down some of her ads calling for the company’s breakup.
“She’s right,” Senator Cruz tweeted. “Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech…. A serious threat to our democracy.”
Although President Donald Trump has also criticized Big Tech giants like Amazon, the pendulum hasn’t swung all the way to Europe’s ambitious new protections of privacy.
A key question is how to balance privacy protections with continued U.S. leadership in new data-based products and services.
“We definitely want a federal privacy law that is uniformly and strongly enforced,” including a role for state attorneys general and a better-funded Federal Trade Commission, says Linda Moore, CEO of TechNet, a trade group for the industry. But “we don’t want it to have a chilling effect on innovation.”
Lessons from Europe She and others note the European Union’s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that went into effect last year has created new compliance costs that are harder to bear for small companies than large ones. The result is that, in effect, Big Tech has been getting bigger as a share of Europe’s information services market.
Ms. Moore says the U.S. has a chance to learn from Europe’s experience in creating legislation that guards against too-high compliance burdens while also helping consumers have transparency and control over how their data is used.
The question of whether a few firms have grown too powerful is another piece of the puzzle.
Senator Warren argues for possibly breaking off portions of Google, Amazon, and Facebook, based partly on the idea that a single company shouldn’t be both a key platform for online commerce and a provider of services on that platform.
Her proposal may be a long shot, but it has won some fans. And even defenders of existing antitrust law say it may need to be applied with more rigor toward those tech giants.
At the same time, others point to the penchant of younger Americans to shy away from Facebook – and of some longtime users to abandon the platform – as signs that the industry isn’t as monopoly-prone as critics say. Conservative analyst James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute critiqued Senator Warren’s proposal by pointing to a Fortune magazine cover from 1998 that has proved less than prescient in hindsight: “How Yahoo! won the search wars.”
Focus on the big or the small? Economists, meanwhile have been debating whether the rise of powerhouses like Amazon and Facebook have helped or hurt the overall economy.
However that debate over antitrust concerns shakes out, some say it’s important not to focus regulatory attention mostly on the highest-profile firms.
“The bigger driver of violating that privacy are these hidden data aggregators and data brokers that gather up information,” companies that consumers have no conscious relationship with, says Kirsten Martin, a technology expert at George Washington University. “They have an even more nuanced view of us than Facebook, because they’re buying all the little bits of data from all over, [from offline shopping to] our browsing history.”

Texto completo: It really has come to this: Americans can't even agree on what time it is.
As most of us were springing our clocks forward and feeling like we were robbed of another hour of sleep last weekend, debates on the wisdom or folly of daylight-saving time raged across the nation.
Texas is among a few states considering whether to join Hawaii and Arizona in staying on standard time. Others want to stay on daylight-saving time, and not fall back an hour to standard time in November. President Trump signaled his support for the latter this week – though under the quirky 1966 law establishing daylight-saving time, staying on it year-round would take an act of Congress.
Confused yet? Well, consider how confounding it would be if there were a chaotic quilt of states from sea to shining sea choosing to set their own time of day. You'd have to wonder what time it is not just when crossing or calling across time zones, but state lines as well. And your favorite TV program – would it be on at 8 p.m. Eastern or Texan?
That alone is reason enough for Texas lawmakers to call a time out before monkeying with the time of day on a state level. This really needs to be a national decision, though there's always room, as there is now, for a very few rogue states to opt out.
Granted, it is rather silly, especially in this day and age, to arbitrarily require nearly every American household twice a year to change every clock, every watch and every time-keeping appliance in one's household – not to mention one's car.
Moreover, as the New York Times noted last weekend, "accidents, heart attacks and strokes tend to occur in greater numbers around the time shift."
Regardless of which we choose – standard time or daylight-saving – there is growing momentum to, as state Sen. Jose Menendez, D-San Antonio, puts it, "pick a time and stick with it." Menendez, whose Senate Bill 190 would opt the state out of daylight-saving after November's rollback, says he doesn't ultimately care which time we choose; just choose one, he says, and stop the "flipping back and forth."
Paradoxically, while either doing away with daylight-saving time or keeping it year-round has momentum at the water cooler, it likely has little traction in the state Capitol.
But that's a good thing.
It may not be the most important matter to reach the Capitol steps in Washington, D.C. But ultimately, a Congress that rarely seems to know will ultimately have to tell us what time it is.
Until then, two time changes a year are preferable to 50 different time zones.

Warren's trust busting plan a threat to California

Texto completo: I could direct this column at Silicon Valley with an "I told you so." Sen. Elizabeth Warren's recent proposal to break up big tech companies bears out my warning on this site from last September that tech companies' actions are setting the stage for a return to Teddy Roosevelt type trust-busting.
In her post explaining her plans to break up the likes of Google, Facebook, and Amazon, Warren referred to the trust-busting efforts of the early 20thcentury. She argues that now, like a hundred years ago, monopolies are bad and competition is good. The growing tech giants that gobble up competitors wipe out the competition that is needed to make companies better and stymies innovation.
Wonder if she applies that same philosophy to government monopolies that attempt to thwart competition in the field of education? But I digress.
Months ago, the U.S. Justice Department gave notice that it too was looking into the growing concern that big tech was hurting competition and stifling the free exchange of ideas.
The concern I raised last September that social media platforms could be declared public utilities is a plan Warren embraced as something called "platform utilities." Warren wrote: "These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform. Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties."
How will the Valley respond? Days before Warren's announcement, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg declared a new "privacy manifesto" to reassure users about Facebook's concern over privacy issues. Big tech is feeling heat. However, the offered solutions won't turn down the flame. Both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal panned Zuckerberg's proposal.
Be careful of all the regulators Warren plans to send out across the Internet to force the break-ups and the post-break-up adherences to whatever rules are created. There is also a danger to innovation and entrepreneurship from a swarming locust of regulators.
At the end of my trust busting column last September I asked: "Is it too hard to imagine that either political party, sensing public frustration with the dominance of the Internet mega companies, could pull out Teddy Roosevelt's big stick and attempt to re-create some form of trust busting for the modern era?"
Now, Warren has introduced the idea into the presidential contest, which begs the question, what will be the political repercussions?
Silicon Valley has had a cozy relationship with Democrats, sending large portions of political donations to Democrats. Will Republicans stand up for these businesses with the possible payoff of Silicon Valley donors switching sides? Or will vote counters find that the trust-busting appeals to the public and Republicans will come up with their own version of tech break-ups, presumably with fewer regulators?
And, how will Kamala Harris respond?
The California senator has good relationships in the Silicon Valley and counted on her friends there to support her presidential bid. Keeping a distance from the Warren proposals could strengthen her ties with Valley leaders at the risk of offending progressive voters who want to take big business down.

Dick's to pull guns from 125 locations

Texto completo: Dick's Sporting Goods announced Tuesday it will remove firearms from 125 of its stores, according to news reports.
The move follows the company's ban on assault-style weapons last year in the wake of the Parkland shooting.
CEO Ed Stack said Tuesday that Dick's will pull hunting gear from 125 stores starting in around August in response to its slumping sales in those stores, Bloomberg reported, a move that may spread to more stores next year.
It is unknown if the list of 125 stories includes any in the Southern Tier.
Dick's last year announced it would ban sales of assault-style weapons after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and revelations that its shooter, Nikolas Cruz, had purchased a gun from a Dick's store. The company also halted sales of high-capacity magazines and guns to anyone under 21 years old.
Hunting products started vanishing from 10 Dick's stores last fall as the retailer swapped those items for products such as kayaks and baseball gear. Stack said the stores saw higher sales, margins and foot traffic than when they had guns, according to Bloomberg.
Halting assault-style weapon sales put a dent in overall sales for Dick's, the company noted last fall, a dip furthered by a weaker gun market. On Tuesday, the Pittsburgh-area company said net income for the quarter fell to $102.6 million from $116 million in the year-earlier period, per MarketWatch.
Adjusted same-store sales fell 3.1 percent over a 12-month period ending Feb. 2 when compared to that period the year prior, The New York Times reported.
Dick's operates 729 stores — including ones in Binghamton, Vestal, Horseheads and Ithaca — along with 94 Golf Galaxy stores and 35 Field and Stream stores (including one in Big Flats), according to the newspaper.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation expelled Dick's from membership last year for "conduct detrimental" to the firearms trade group, but Stack remains undeterred in the company's direction.
"If we had a mulligan, we'd do it all over again," Stack said, per CNBC.
The CEO signed a letter last month backing a federal bill extending background checks, the network noted, and recently joined the Everytown Business Council for gun safety.

Resumen: Usually containing data and articles about events and people in their specific geographical locations, and usually published four times a year (hence the name "quarterlies"), they were generally un-noticed by researchers in other localities that were not subscribers -- that is until 1986 when the staff at Indiana's Allen County Public Library began creating an index, called PERSI, for PERiodical Source Index. Be sure to take note of NGS's Free Genealogy Resources, which include free fillable genealogy charts and templates, tutorials on the U.S. census and "How to Borrow Books" from the NGS Book Loan Collection, complimentary articles in the NGS Magazine, NGS Monthly and NGS Quarterly, links to 18 free genealogy websites and more. [...]as part of the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the U.S. involvement in WWI, the LOC has posted a special World War I Portal to its collections pertaining to that war at tinyurl.com/yy2p8jvb.

Texto completo: Genealogical societies have been publishing magazines for their members for decades. Usually containing data and articles about events and people in their specific geographical locations, and usually published four times a year (hence the name "quarterlies"), they were generally un-noticed by researchers in other localities that were not subscribers -- that is until 1986 when the staff at Indiana's Allen County Public Library began creating an index, called PERSI, for PERiodical Source Index.
Over the years PERSI has undergone many changes in format. Originally it was a 16-volume set which was available on microfiche. An annual print version was discontinued in 1997. Ancestry.com provided CDs to its customers for a while, and Heritage Quest Online at one time offered access. More recently, FindMyPast.com has the sole rights to the electronic database outside of the Allen County Public Library. The index can be searched free.
PERSI is not an every-name index, but it does provide an index to a location, a type of record, a how-to topic and a surname if the subject was in an article -- in thousands of periodicals. If an article of interest is found in the index, the Allen County Public Library will copy the article for a small fee. The order form can be found at tinyurl.com/ycxfj9pb. The charge is $7.50 for each order form (up to and including six articles), pre-paid to ACPLF, plus 20 cents per page billed to you.
A blog posted by Findmypast, at tinyurl.com/z7ulmp8, provides "Tips & Tricks for Searching PERSI like a Pro." Another post by Findmypast, at blog.findmypast.com/7-tips-to-help-you-find-your-american-ancestors-in-persi-2031868057.html, is titled "7 Tips to Help You Find Your American Ancestors in PERSI." Also, a website called Family Locket has provided helpful instructions at tinyurl.com/y567rfar. The official Findmypast search site is at tinyurl.com/y87dduc8; a direct periodical search can be made at tinyurl.com/y86fxgkq.
Now researchers have no excuse for missing some "hidden" information in an "unknown" periodical. PERSI can probably provide articles with long-sought research solutions.
Article praises genealogy
A recent article in The New York Times, "Why You Should Dig Up Your Family's History -- And How to Do It," can be found at tinyurl.com/yakjgkue. Hopefully many readers will be encouraged to embark on this "intellectual pursuit" ... "solving a puzzle at the highest level."
The National Genealogical Society (NGS) acknowledges that the article is based on the NGS and its new website. Visit ngsgenealogy.org and click on "Welcome to the new NGS Website -- See What's New." Be sure to take note of NGS's Free Genealogy Resources, which include free fillable genealogy charts and templates, tutorials on the U.S. census and "How to Borrow Books" from the NGS Book Loan Collection, complimentary articles in the NGS Magazine, NGS Monthly and NGS Quarterly, links to 18 free genealogy websites and more.
WWI materials posted
The Library of Congress (LOC) has digitized its collections of World War I materials and has posted a guide to these items at tinyurl.com/h9exkqy.
These materials include photographs, documents, newspapers, films, sheet music and sound recordings. The guide also provides links to external websites focusing on WWI as well as a bibliography.
Also, as part of the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the U.S. involvement in WWI, the LOC has posted a special World War I Portal to its collections pertaining to that war at tinyurl.com/yy2p8jvb. Resources for teachers are also included.
The LOC website now also has its collection of WWI newspaper clippings, 1914 to 1926, searchable at tinyurl.com/ydgxn76x. Keywords can be searched over the entire 79,621 pages "packed with war-related front pages, illustrated feature articles, editorial cartoons, and more. ... Coverage begins on June 29, 1914, with articles focusing on the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and continues into the post-war world through Dec. 31, 1926."
Queries, genealogical questions from researchers and genealogical materials readers would like to share will be printed in this column free.

TELL-ALL BOOK LOOKS AT POWER PLAYS BY IVANKA AND JARED

Texto completo: A new tell-all book, which focuses on how Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner rose to "extraordinary" power in the White House, is sure to bolster the opinion among President Donald Trump's critics that his daughter has a princess complex and that nepotism is the only reason she and her husband have their jobs as senior advisers.
According to The New York Times, "Kushner Inc.," by journalist Vicky Ward, portrays Ivanka Trump and Kushner as the heirs of New York real estate empires that were forged by domineering fathers. However, in Ivanka Trump's case, her father was "disengaged," and her childhood often was "isolated."
The book also describes, in reportedly unflattering ways, how the two "climbed to positions of power by disregarding protocol and skirting the rules when they can," added the Times, which got a sneak peek at Ward's book. One example of Ivanka Trump and Kushner's apparent sense of entitlement and rule-skirting comes in the way they have demanded use of Air Force One at times when it was "not appropriate," Ward writes, according to the Times.
The couple wanted to control who could travel on trips funded by the State Department, according to the Times. When former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson denied their requests, the couple tried to get around him by inviting along a cabinet secretary, usually Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, to get access to the plane.
One purpose of the book is to dissect the kind of influence Ivanka Trump and Kushner have on President Trump and on his administration's management and policies, the Times reported. There is a common "narrative" that the two serve as "stabilizing voices inside an otherwise chaotic White House," but the book instead depicts the two as Trump's "chief enablers," the Times reported.
According to the Times, Ward spent two years interviewing 200 people for her book, which will be published March 19.

Texto completo: In Rome, the college of cardinals is gathering to mourn one pope and select his successor. An ambitious rogue cardinal arrives on the island of Malta seeking ancient documents from the secretive Knights of Malta that will pave his way to the papacy. These are just two strands of the convoluted plot of "The Malta Exchange" (Minotaur Books, 393 pp., **), the 14th novel by Steve Berry featuring Cotton Malone, a retired Justice Department operative turned seller of rare books.
Malone arrives in Lake Como, Italy, in pursuit of letters exchanged between British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini that British intelligence fears will reveal some embarrassing dealmaking aimed at preventing Italy from joining forces with Germany in World War II.
Why is this so urgent in the 21st century? You got me. But Berry is a New York Times best-selling author, so to quote Pope Francis, "Who am I to judge?"
As Malone arrives at a villa to nab the letters, bullets zing by, bodies are strung up and, inexplicably, a bear rumbling through the villa attacks Malone. Soon, Malone is entwined in the case of Cardinal Gallo, the papal wannabe, and a murderous subsector of the Knights of Malta, a Catholic humanitarian group with its own agenda for the new pope. Gallo's estranged identical twin, Pollux, has been temporarily placed in charge of the Knights, seeking to thwart his brother's ambitions.
Author Berry has a passion for history and historical preservation, so look for long passages about the Catholic Church, Constantine, Mussolini and various other European conquerors. You'll find yourself wondering about several key plot points: Is any of this really true? For the most part, Berry confesses in an epilogue at the end, it isn't.
If you can make your way through a tortuous plot with dialogue that can be as wooden as a church pew, Berry makes some interesting points about religion and how powerful men created the tenets of faith (manufacturing the concepts of ideas of heaven, hell and the devil) to control the masses. But in the finale, good old Cotton shows he has a taste of his own for some righteous religious vengeance.

"House on Fire"
by Bonnie Kistler (Atria Books, fiction, on sale March 12)
What it's about: A blended family is plunged into crisis when the son of one parent kills the daughter of the other in a drunk-driving accident. Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.

by Matt Richtel (William Morrow, non-fiction, on sale March 12)
What it's about: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Matt Richtel provides a deeply reported and entertainingly written exploration of the human immune system and how it works, told through the intimate stories of four lives grappling with mortality.

"The Dragonfly Sea"
by Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor (Knopf, fiction, on sale March 12)
What it's about: On Pate Island, off the coast of Kenya, a young girl yearning for the father she never knew bonds with a sailor and soon finds herself called to the sea. With a rich and enormous cast of global characters, Owuor depicts the cultural complexities of East Africa in a stirring story of loss and discovery.
The buzz: A starred review in Publishers Weekly calls it a "sprawling, beautiful novel," an epic that "establishes Owuor as a considerable talent."

The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls the book a "worthy commemoration of a key historical moment."
"Too Much Is Not Enough," by Andrew Rannells (Crown, non-fiction, on sale March 12)

Texto completo: Q: On "The Resident," Jenna Dewan was playing the representative of a medical company and starting to have a relationship with one of the doctors. She was run off the road by some thugs and we have not seen her since. Did she die or will she be back on the show?
A: Actress-dancer Dewan will be back in the Fox drama's March 25 episode. Fox says Devon (Manish Dayal), who had become attracted to Dewan's character, Julian Booth, will finally discover the truth about what happened to her. But we don't know if she is alive or dead, and Fox is keeping mum about that.
At the same time, if you want to see more of Dewan, she still makes occasional appearances on NBC's "World of Dance" (though she no longer hosts the show), is in the current movie anthology "Berlin, I Love You," and has a new series, "Mixtape," coming to Netflix.

Q: Recently the name Ferrante appeared in literature and television as the author of a very popular book. She claims to be a woman from Naples, Italy. But the personal details describing the characters, especially the men, make it obvious (to me) that the author is male, not female. Surely there must be others who have come forward with the same surmise.
A: There are. Elena Ferrante has written four connected, best-selling novels starting with "My Brilliant Friend," which inspired an HBO series. Because Ferrante writes under a pseudonym and shuns face-to-face interviews, there have been attempts to guess her real name and speculation about her gender.
A New York Times story in 2014 noted rumors "regularly recycled in the Italian press that she is the Italian novelist Domenico Starnone," which Starnone himself called a "groundless hypothesis." In written answers to interviewers' questions, Ferrante maintained she is female. She told Vanity Fair in 2015 that she stays out of the public eye "to liberate myself from the anxiety of notoriety."
Talking about claims that women writing certain kinds of stories must in fact be men, Ferrante said that women "know how to think, we know how to tell stories, we know how to write them as well as, if not better, than men." Still, guessing games went on. In 2016, the Times reported on new talk about an Italian professor possibly being Ferrante; denials followed. But at least the professor was a woman.

Q: Back in 2016 there was a short series about an alien invasion that primarily affected members of Congress. It was called "Braindead," starred Tony Shalhoub among others and was, at times, hilarious. Are there any plans to replay it any time soon? In view of the craziness that is currently surrounding our government, the timing would be very interesting.
A: "Braindead" indeed aired for 13 episodes on CBS from June to September 2016. I do not know of any plans for a repeat on the network. You can still find the episodes on the CBS All Access subscription streaming service, on Amazon Prime Video and on DVD.

Q: On reruns of "Perry Mason" I saw a series of episodes where Perry was in the hospital and guest stars took his place - Barry Sullivan and Bette Davis among them. Was Raymond Burr, who played Perry, sick for real?
A: Yes. Burr was quite outspoken about the strain of doing the series, and there were times during its run when he had health problems. Surgery (sources vary about what kind) and illness were responsible for fill-ins in several episodes, among them the ones you remember with Sullivan and Davis.

AJC EXCLUSIVE: Science offers some heft to medical marijuana debate

Texto completo: For the sixth year in a row, the General Assembly has taken up legislation addressing the legal status of medicinal marijuana in Georgia.
This year is different. Political skepticism, while not disappearing, is clearly on the wane. Perhaps more important, the state's scientific and medical communities are weighing in as never before.
"We never had that. The medical support is here," said state Rep. Micah Gravley, R-Douglasville, author this year's effort, House Bill 324.
Which means the incremental steps taken so far by the Legislature haven't turned people away. "What we're seeing is that the sky hasn't fallen in," Gravley said.
State Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon, introduced the first medical marijuana bill in 2014, moved by stories of constituents who said that low-THC oil, a non-intoxicating ingredient drawn from marijuana, had helped children who suffered from epilepsy and other seizure-inducing conditions.
"Haleigh's Hope Act" was signed into law the next year. Over the next three sessions, Peake was able to get the list of patients who could use the oil expanded.
Peake retired from the Legislature last year, his work unfinished.
Marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I drug by the U.S. Justice Department. And Peake was unable to persuade the Republican leadership at the state Capitol -- Gov. Nathan Deal, in particular -- to embrace legislation that would permit the cultivation of low-THC marijuana in Georgia.
That would allow families in need of it to escape the possibility of federal prosecution as felons when they cross state lines with their cannabis oil in hand.
Gravley, who served as Peake's lieutenant in past battles over medical marijuana, has picked up that particular torch.
"My mission is to get lab-tested oil into the hands of the patients who are registered in the state, without requiring them to incur the expense of traveling to another state," Gravley said.
Given the expense, many who do seek low-THC oil elsewhere can only afford to make the trip once or twice a year. They load up. "What happens if you get caught in Kansas? What happens if you get caught in Oklahoma? They're having to bring a quantity back that could send them away for a good long while," the lawmaker said.
Gravley, like Peake before him, opposes legalizing marijuana for recreational use.
HB 324 is a "seed-to-sale" bill that would allow 10 licensees to grow and process low-THC marijuana under high-security conditions. All plants would be grown indoors, under 24/7 video monitoring.
Sixty dispensaries would be allowed across the state. No one without a state-issued card would be allowed to enter the retail outlets. In advertisements, these stores would be prohibited from using the word "marijuana" or words like it -- pot, weed, and such. Even signs with green lighting would be banned. And no vaping.
HB 324 passed the House last week, on a veto-proof 123 to 40 vote. An impressed Gov. Brian Kemp hasn't said a word against the measure. "When it passes with a constitutional majority, it might not matter what I think," the governor quipped this week.
Leaders of the GOP-con-trolled Senate say some changes to HB 324 might be demanded, but legislation to allow in-state cultivation of low-THC oil is likely to pass the chamber in coming weeks.
Opposition to medicinal marijuana legislation has been led by social conservative forces in the state Capitol -- the Georgia Baptist Mission Board and the Faith and Freedom Coalition, in particular. The Georgia Sheriffs' Association has also remained an implacable foe.
What's changed is the attitude of what might be called Georgia's lab coat crowd. Physicians and other academics are no longer on the sidelines, as they were in 2014. It is possible they were provoked.
Two weeks before House passage of HB 324, opponents brought Alex Berenson, a former New York Times reporter, before a House committee. Berenson is out with a new book on the hazards of marijuana: "Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence."
"I think cannabis is a much more psychiatrically destructive substance than is commonly understood. There is very strong evidence that cannabis can cause psychosis," Berenson said. "There is also strong evidence that cannabis can produce schizophrenia."
The author conceded that marijuana may help with nausea caused by chemotherapy, but dismissed other beneficial claims. "The idea that it can be a solution to the opioid crisis goes against generations of evidence that it's a gateway drug, and is based on very, very weak epidemiological data," Berenson said.
The trouble is, several people at the University of Georgia have been studying that very thing. One of them is David Bradford, a professor of public administration and policy.
In one paper, Bradford and his fellow researchers -- his own daughter among them -- found a 14.7 percent reduction in opioid use under Medicare Part D in states in which medical cannabis is offered through dispensaries. Other academics have found that opioid-related deaths fall by 25 percent in states where patients have access to cannabis.
"The evidence of cannabis' value, clinically, for a number of conditions, is unassailable at this point," Bradford told me. He acknowledged that there was slight merit in the argument Berenson lays out in his book.
"There are some hints about associations with schizophrenia, and some people with mental illness probably shouldn't use this option to treat chronic pain, but for a wide range of people, the clinical evidence is now pretty clear," Bradford said. "This book does misrepresent the science rather substantially."
Gravley has a letter from Bradford in hand to that effect. Other endorsements come from ranking figures at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, and Emory University. And the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
So sayeth the lab coats. But this is the Georgia General Assembly. Personal testifyin' and outright conversions -- not science -- make the best impressions.
Gravley says his strongest letter of support has come from Bob Starrett, chief of police in the city of Austell and a longtime foe of medicinal marijuana legislation.
Joe Jerkins is the mayor of Austell, and has been for 29 years. But he has decided not to seek re-election this year, citing health concerns.
"Our mayor was recently diagnosed with Parkinson's," Starrett wrote on official city stationery. Tremors and uncontrollable shaking made had made mayoral work difficult for him.
"He recently obtained a low-THC oil registration card. His symptoms improved after he began using the oil," Starrett wrote. "Access to this medication has allowed him to function more normally, including signing his name to this letter."
The signature of Mayor Joe Jerkins is indeed at the bottom of the letter, shaky but legible. And Starrett says he has changed his mind about cannabis oil.

Texto completo: Inquiry seeks to examine four loans, including attempt to buy Buffalo Bills
The New York attorney general has subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank related to three large loans the bank extended to President Trump's company in recent years - and a fourth loan that Trump sought to buy the NFL's Buffalo Bills, according to two people familiar with the subpoenas.
Those subpoenas signal a significant new inquiry by state regulators into the Trump Organization's financing.
The subpoena follows congressional testimony by Michael Cohen - Trump's former lawyer and longtime self-proclaimed "fixer" - that Trump inflated his net worth in documents he sent to Deutsche Bank while seeking loans.
The German bank also was crucial to Trump's real estate business in the last few years before he ran for president, lending him more than $360 million since 2012. The loans let Trump buy new properties and refinance old ones, despite his history of corporate bankruptcies and disputes with lenders.
In all cases, the loans came not from Deutsche Bank's main commercial lending division, but rather from a smaller office of the bank that manages money for high-net-worth clients.
Deutsche Bank had already received requests for documents from the House's Financial Services and Intelligence committees. This new inquiry seems to signal that New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) is investigating the same loans.
A spokeswoman for James declined to comment Tuesday. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.
Deutsche Bank issued a statement Tuesday saying only, "We remain committed to cooperating with authorized investigations."
Just last week, another New York agency - the Department of Financial Services, which oversees insurance - issued a subpoena to Trump's longtime insurance broker, Aon. Cohen had testified that Trump had used the same kind of inflated financial statements in attempting to lower his insurance premiums.
The Deutsche Bank subpoenas were for documents related to three Trump properties, all bought with loans from the bank, the two people confirmed. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal details of the documents.
Trump got $125 million to buy the Doral golf resort outside Miami. He got $170 million to create Trump International Hotel inside a federally owned building in Washington. And he got about $69 million from the bank in 2014 to refinance old Deutsche Bank loans on Trump's tower in Chicago.
In addition, the people said, the subpoena asks for documents related to Trump's attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2013 - a deal that did not materialize. During his congressional testimony last month, Cohen provided copies of "statements of financial condition," which he said were sent to Deutsche Bank in pursuit of a loan for that purchase.
"Did the president ever provide inflated assets to a bank in order to help them to obtain a loan?" Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) asked.
"These documents and others were provided to Deutsche Bank on one occasion when I was with him in our attempt to obtain money so that we can put a bid on the Buffalo Bills," Cohen said.
The "statements of financial condition" are not rigorously audited documents. According to a cover letter on one of the files obtained by The Washington Post, they represented Trump's own estimates about what he was worth and what he owed.
Cohen said these statements exaggerated the income Trump received from commercial properties. They also included a valuation of one property - a mansion Trump owns in suburban New York - at $291 million, when local assessors put the value around $19 million.
The subpoenas issued Monday were first reported by the New York Times. The Times also reported that Investors Bank, a New Jersey institution, had been subpoenaed for a 2010 loan it extended to the Trump Organization related to Trump Park Avenue, a residential building in Manhattan. That bank did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.

Facebook, already the leader in enabling you to share photos, videos and links, now wants to be a force in messaging, commerce, payments and just about everything else you do online.
The company's ambitions harken to how WeChat has become the centerpiece of digital life in China, where people use it to order movie tickets, subway passes, food delivery and rides. If Facebook succeeds in turning its own messaging services into a platform for everything, it could ultimately threaten established services such as Snapchat, Yelp, Venmo, eBay and even Apple and Amazon.
"It's clear that Facebook does have very broad ambitions here," said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst at Technalysis Research. "Their goal is to be the WeChat of everywhere but China."
But Facebook faces numerous hurdles. A key one is restoring user trust, following a string of privacy failures that includes the sharing of personal information from as many as 87 million users with a consulting firm affiliated with Donald Trump's campaign. And any change may cause users to rethink their relationship with Facebook.
"Facebook has a lot of momentum but it's not completely invincible," said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates. "People came to Facebook for a particular thing. Offer them a different thing, and they're likely to re-evaluate whether they want to be there at all."
After all, Friendster and Myspace came and went as Facebook grew. Yahoo and AltaVista moved over for Google. And remember when AOL was popular, powerful and rich enough to buy the traditional media company Time Warner? Both AOL and Yahoo are now fading brands within Verizon.
After building an advertising-supported service that depends on vacuuming up data on your hobbies, interests and political views, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced last week that Facebook will now emphasize ways for small groups to communicate in a truly private fashion.
This involves scrambling all messages in WhatsApp, Instagram Direct and Messenger so that even Facebook itself can't read them. Facebook will also let messages automatically disappear after a set amount of time, something rival Snapchat already does.
Facebook, Zuckerberg said, will "then build more ways for people to interact on top of that, including calls, video chats, groups, stories, businesses, payments, commerce, and ultimately a platform for many other kinds of private services."
Facebook declined to further elaborate on its ambitions, and a spokeswoman reinforced that it is early in the process. But there are clues in what Chinese tech giant Tencent has already done with WeChat in China. WeChat combines functions that are typically done by separate companies elsewhere — think of Facebook and its messaging services combined with PayPal and Uber. People use WeChat to buy goods in retail stores, split restaurant bills with friends, pay utility bills, donate to charities and hail rides from the Uber-like Didi Chuxing service.
Facebook already lets people send money to other individuals through Messenger in the U.S. and a few other countries and is testing payments through WhatsApp in India. The New York Times reported that Facebook is also developing its own digital currency to make it easier for users to send money to their messaging contacts.
Facebook didn't offer many details on its digital currency endeavors, but said a "new small team" was looking for ways to make use of the type of technology powering bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.
While the current payment options require linking Facebook to bank accounts or services such as PayPal, a digital currency could potentially work without them. That could appeal to users, especially in Asia and Africa, with limited access to banking services, said Avivah Litan, a Gartner analyst who specializes in security and payments.
And it would solve a key challenge with commerce on phones. Litan said entering credit card details on a phone is cumbersome, and businesses often lose customers before they complete orders. If Facebook can integrate payments into messaging, it can keep users within Facebook and convince advertisers they're more likely to complete sales.
Facebook could also diversify revenue beyond advertising. For instance, it could take a commission, whether for newspaper subscriptions or food deliveries, much as Apple already does with a cut of up to 30 percent for app payments.
Kay said messaging could become one-stop shop for Yelp-like business reviews, OpenTable restaurant reservations, on-demand delivery similar to Uber and a marketplace akin to eBay — the latter being something Facebook already offers on its main app. Amazon might be tougher to challenge, he said, given the company's expertise in delivery logistics, but there might be pieces such as grocery delivery that Facebook can go after.
Nonetheless, potential Facebook rivals need not pack up yet. Zuckerberg's blog read as a manifesto, a list of things he wants to implement, and it's unclear how much will actually get executed, eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said. She said it's too soon for competitors to start drastically adapting.
"You cannot be blase about anything Facebook says or does," she said. "But I think there is certainly time to see how this all plays out."
There also might be room for Facebook to sit alongside existing services. Facebook might turn to OpenTable within messaging, for instance, rather than build its own service for dinner reservations.
"It depends on what exactly the product looks like and how differently useful it is for different kinds of audiences," said Brian Wieser, an executive at the advertising consultancy GroupM. "It's not necessarily a zero-sum game."
For now, analysts say, potential competitors need to pay attention and be ready to adapt once details are out. Businesses that ignore the threat do so at their own peril.
Potential rivals can also start emphasizing how they are different from Facebook — as Apple is doing by stressing privacy protections in its devices and services. O'Donnell added that those in payments need to make sure their services are compelling and easy to use so that they can compete with whatever Facebook brings.
Apple, Amazon, eBay and OpenTable didn't respond to messages for comment. Yelp, Snap and PayPal, which also owns Venmo, declined to comment.
The most immediate threat Facebook poses is to other messaging services. Apple's iMessage is popular on iPhones, but there's no version for Android. Facebook could look more appealing as it breaks down walls and makes its three discrete messaging services work together as though they were one.
Snapchat, meanwhile, has struggled since Facebook and its Instagram service copied a feature for posting temporary "stories" that disappear after 24 hours. Zuckerberg dedicated a section of his blog announcement to "reducing permanence," suggesting that Facebook will now take on Snapchat's core feature of letting photos "disappear" after a set number of seconds.
"It's yet another example of Facebook trying to attack Snapchat," BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield said.
But whether Facebook succeeds will depend on how many people are willing to move their conversations. Greenfield said Snapchat has a lock on its core, younger audience.
Facebook's plan may face external competition of its own. Unlike WeChat, Facebook faces new privacy regulation in Europe and calls for more controls in the U.S., Forrester analyst Jessica Liu wrote . Zuckerberg is trying to strike an "impossible balance" between capturing more of users' time, appealing to advertisers and appealing to regulators.
"Zuckerberg can't have his cake and eat it, too," she wrote.

Texto completo: We interrupt the talk of the president “manufacturing” a crisis at the border with this hair-raising report about the crisis at the border.
Alarming new numbers about border apprehensions from U.S. Customs and Border Protection should puncture the lazy conventional wisdom about the border being under control, except in the lurid imagination of President Donald Trump.
More than 76,000 migrants were apprehended crossing the southern border last month, the highest February in more than 10 years and the highest month of the Trump administration. The number of apprehensions tops any month during the 2014 border surge under President Barack Obama, which no one had a problem calling a crisis at the time.
Every indication is that the situation is going to get worse. We could be about to experience a migrant surge worthy of Angela Merkel at her most openhanded, even though, in immigration terms, Viktor Orban — the Hungarian prime minister who favors tough border enforcement — is president.
Yes, there were more overall apprehensions in the 2000s. But it was a different population, made up overwhelmingly of adult males from Mexico who might be apprehended trying to cross multiple times and were reliably returned home when they were caught. Now, we are apprehending people but not returning them.
Migrants are coming in greater numbers from Central American countries instead of Mexico, and are primarily families and children. In an astonishing shift, in 2012, 10 percent of apprehended migrants were families and children; in recent months, it’s been 61 percent.
The rules for dealing with migrants from noncontiguous countries and with family units make it all but impossible to swiftly return or detain them, not to mention that our physical facilities were built with single adults in mind.
There is no mechanism to return these migrants home, to hold them after they cross the border, or to remove them once they are in the interior. And word has gotten out. There’s a reason that the subset of migrants that we can’t stop from getting into the country is growing so rapidly.
Needless to say, a spiraling border crisis is maddening for a president committed to controlling the border, which is why we’ve seen such frenetic activity from Trump.
He’s tried to prosecute all adults crossing the border illegally, and had to abandon it in the (understandable) firestorm over the resulting family separations. He’s tried to jawbone Mexico into helping, with some success, although migrants are still traveling through Mexico in large numbers. He’s tried to tighten up asylum policy but been blocked in the courts. He’s tried to get Congress to fix the rules for dealing with migrants, to no avail. And, of course, he’s tried to build a wall.
Trump’s rhetoric may be over the top, but the impulse to get a handle on this is absolutely correct.
First, there’s the question of basic sovereignty. If we are going to welcome a large number of migrants from three or four foreign countries, we should make that decision as a conscious policy, rather than slip-sliding into it unawares.
Then there’s the matter of assimilation and legality. Poorly educated immigrants, like the ones coming from Central America, have the hardest time assimilating, and they will lack legal status on top of it.
Finally, there’s the humanitarian question. Migrant families show up needing medical attention that we aren’t well-prepared to provide. We’d be much better positioned to tend to the migrants under our care if the numbers weren’t overwhelming.
But we are at a stalemate. The New York Times editorialized the other day that Trump declared “that there’s a crisis at the border, contrary to all evidence.” Then, the paper ran a news story headlined, “Border at ‘Breaking Point’ as More than 76,000 Migrants Cross in a Month.”
Both of those pieces can’t be right. There’s manufacturing a crisis, then there’s ignoring one for fear of conceding anything to Trump.

The Associated Press
SAN FRANCISCO - Google paid former search executive Amit Singhal $35 million in an exit package when he was reportedly forced to resign after a sexual assault investigation, according to court documents released Monday.
Details of the exit package were revealed as part of a shareholder lawsuit against the company, one that followed a published report of payouts Google made to executives accused of sexual misconduct.
The lawsuit targets the board of Google parent Alphabet, charging that its members had a duty to protect the company and its shareholders from risk and reputation damage. Instead, it says, the board agreed to pay off and otherwise support male executives facing misconduct charges - opening the company to reputational and financial damage by doing so.
Previously redacted portions of the lawsuit were made available Monday, including quotes from Alphabet board committee meetings.
One portion of the minutes showed that Singhal, a senior vice president of search who left the company in 2016, received two
$15 million payments and a payment of between $5 million to $15 million as part of a separation agreement. The total payment could have been up to $45 million.
Singhal was one subject of a New York Times investigation last year that revealed Google paid Android creator Andy Rubin $90 million in a severance package after the company found allegations of sexual assault against him were credible. Rubin and Singhal have denied the claims.

TM Landry moves to Lafayette

Texto completo: T.M. Landry College Preparatory students began having class in Lafayette Monday morning.
The school moved from Breaux Bridge after more than a week of working with state and local officials to get approval for this new location, which it got just in the nick of time.
The "equivalency appeal" to occupy a portion of the building at 3403 Moss St. in Lafayette was submitted Sunday afternoon.
It was approved by the fire marshal early Monday morning, according to the Office of State Fire Marshal.
That meant kids could return to school from their week-long Mardi Gras break in a new place, a former skating rink in Lafayette.
They can use part of the building — 4,293 square feet — while construction takes place on the rest of the structure to get it up to code to house students.
The new location in an old skating rink has no sprinkler system and is divided into two rooms separated by a fire-resistant wall.
The building will be divided into three sections with the addition of a second fire partition, thus avoiding the need for a sprinkler system, according to the architectural drawing notes. The partition will have fire sealant up to the roof deck.
The school has 180 days to complete improvements like the installation of a building-wide fire alarm system and pass a final inspection.
The school also must make the additional corrections/deficiencies for the remainder of the building's plans, which were noted in the change of occupancy request submission that was approved for construction last week, said Ashley Rodrigue, public affairs director for the state fire marshal's office.
Since the building doesn't have the proper fire alarms yet, they must take extra precautions during the next 180 days.
T.M. Landry must follow fire watch protocols, which designates one person to remain at the school during operating hours and complete safety checks around the occupied area throughout each day. He or she must maintain a log of those checks, Rodrigue explained.
"The school is also being required to have twice the amount of code-required fire extinguishers on-site at all times," she said. "Lastly, the school is to conduct its first fire drill within a week and continue with monthly fire drills throughout the 180 days."
The school had been on fire watch at its previous building in Breaux Bridge, according to a timeline of communication between the fire marshal's office and the school.
The private school had been in limbo since the fire marshal gave it a March 8 deadline to move out of its current Breaux Bridge location or come up with a plan of action for bringing the Breaux Bridge location into compliance.
Like the new location, the previous building was designated for storage use rather than educational use and needed to be upgraded for the school to continue using it.
"We had to make major improvements (to stay in the Breaux Bridge building)," said Greg Davis, the former Cajundome director who has taken over as chairman of the private school. "That was outside our budget."
He said officials looked in Lafayette because it would be convenient to students and their families.
"The greater Lafayette area is where most our parents are living," Davis said.
Enrollment at the school is at 75, down from 110 in November when a New York Times article published allegations of falsifying college applications and abuse of students by the school's leaders.
The school had received national attention prior to that for a record of placing graduates at Ivy League colleges.

Texto completo: When Matt Hogenauer walks the hallways at Falmouth High School, he wonders whether he is being exposed to preventable infectious diseases – a dangerous health risk for him that wouldn’t be a major concern if Maine didn’t have so many unvaccinated students.
“There’s the potential that all of these things would make me very sick,” said Hogenauer, a senior.
Hogenauer has non-rheumatoid arthritis, and the medications he takes suppress his immune system, making him vulnerable to infectious diseases like pertussis, measles, mumps and chickenpox.
Maine has one of the highest vaccination opt-out rates in the nation, as parents forgo school-required immunizations for their children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means the state is susceptible to outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has the worst rate of pertussis, or whooping cough, in the country.
On Wednesday, the Legislature’s education committee will hold a public hearing on a bill sponsored by Rep. Ryan Tipping, D-Orono, that would eliminate all non-medical exemptions to school-required vaccinations. If approved, Maine would join California, West Virginia and Mississippi as the only states to do so.
Washington state and New York City are grappling with measles outbreaks caused by un-vaccinated people spreading the infectious disease. Seventy-one people have so far fallen ill with measles in Washington, and 133 have been sickened in New York City, according to state and city health officials. In one private school in Brooklyn, one un-vaccinated student infected at least 21 others with measles, The New York Times reported.
From Jan. 1 to Feb. 28 of this year, 206 cases of measles were reported in 11 states, from Washington to Connecticut, the Maine CDC said in a news release Friday. The last reported measles case in Maine was in 2017, the agency said, and the person who was infected had acquired the disease after traveling overseas.
“Measles is still common in many parts of the world, including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa,” Maine CDC said in a news release. “People who are not vaccinated can contract measles while traveling, then bring it back to the U.S. and infect others who are un-vaccinated.”
Meanwhile, Maine has the worst per capita rate of pertussis in the nation, with 446 cases in 2018, a rate that’s more than five times the national average. Through February, 95 pertussis cases were reported in Maine this year, tracking ahead of 2018.
Hogenauer will already be out of Maine schools by the time the bill would go into effect — he’s slated to go into a pre-medicine program at Haverford College near Philadelphia this fall — but he said for the health benefits for other Maine students he’s become a strong advocate for the bill.
“I compare not getting vaccinated to drunk driving. You’re not only putting yourself at risk, but you could hurt others,” he said.
Hogenauer, 17, said he contracted pertussis in 2016, and he suspects — although he can’t prove it — that fellow students he knew were un-vaccinated and spread the disease to him.
“That’s when the anti-vaccine movement became a real, tangible thing to me,” Hogenauer said. “I had a really nasty cough for two to three weeks.”
Hogenauer’s health depends heavily on “herd immunity,” which is the protection granted to the immune-compromised or children too young for vaccines. When nearly everyone is vaccinated, the diseases aren’t circulating as much, which means they have a much more difficult time spreading.
Some of Maine’s schools have reported dangerously low vaccination rates, compromising herd immunity. For some infectious diseases, herd immunity can be weakened if there’s less than 95 percent of students vaccinated.
The Maine CDC said 31 public elementary schools were reporting 15 percent or higher rates of un-vaccinated kindergarten students in the 2017-18 school year, the latest year for which statistics were available.
In 2017-18, 5 percent of Maine children entering kindergarten — about 600 children statewide — had non-medical exemptions for immunizations, with their parents opting out on philosophic or religious grounds.
Dr. Laura Blaisdell, a Yarmouth pediatrician and advocate for vaccines, said immune-compromised people are not uncommon.
For instance, people who have had organ transplants, adults with cancer, diseases like lupus and arthritis and people who take long-term steroids all also potentially have weakened immune systems. Even people with a common condition like asthma can be temporarily immune-compromised when they are taking certain medications.
“There are many individuals in our communities living in an immune-compromised state,” Blaisdell said. “If these preventable diseases are circulating, it is unsafe for them. It’s the same reason we don’t allow smoking in our schools because we’ve determined that’s not safe.”
Research has proven that vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective and have prevented millions of diseases and thousands of deaths in the United States since the 1950s, when the polio vaccine was first introduced. Vaccines for measles, mumps and other common diseases became available in the 1960s, while the chickenpox vaccine was introduced in the 1990s.
Myths that vaccines cause autism have been debunked, and 1998 research that claimed a link was withdrawn and retracted. A new study of 650,000 children in Denmark studied over a decade and released this March again showed no link between autism and vaccines.
Blaisdell said people perpetuating scientific falsehoods about vaccines are “infuriating, fundamentally unnecessary and unfair. The parents who are deciding not to vaccinate their children, for the most part, don’t have to deal with the consequences of their decisions,” she said.
Bre and Doug Sanderson of Kennebunk have a daughter, Ashley, who was immune-compromised as a kindergartner in 2015 when she was finishing chemotherapy treatments for leukemia. She and had to be re-immunized for all preventable diseases.
Bre Sanderson, a nurse, said it was a harrowing time, knowing that Ashley would be vulnerable to chickenpox, measles and other diseases that could have resulted in hospitalization or even death. But they also believed it was important for Ashley to attend school, so they closely monitored her classroom for illnesses, and a few times kept her home if too many kids were ill.
No one in her class had chickenpox or measles, but there was one case of pertussis that year in the school. Ashley, now 9, has fully recovered from leukemia and is no longer immune-compromised.
“I feel very lucky it didn’t happen to us. It’s scary,” Bre Sanderson said. “Our child, regardless of her health, deserved an education. A school should be a safe zone for all kids.”
Tipping, the lawmaker sponsoring the bill, said he’s sensing momentum behind his measure, especially with the news of other infectious disease outbreaks in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere.
“I’m hearing more from families and parents who want this (bill) to happen in Maine, seeing what’s happening to families in the northwest. There is an urgency,” Tipping said.
Former Gov. Paul Le- Page vetoed a similar bill in 2015, and the Legislature came up a few votes short in a veto override attempt. Gov. Janet Mills has not said whether she supports Tipping’s bill, but in general she has been more supportive of public health efforts than her predecessor.
Hogenauer, the Falmouth High student, hopes learn more about the immune system in his college premed studies. If he has to miss weeks of college by contracting an infectious disease, that could set back his schooling. But he hopes Maine and other states strengthen vaccine requirements.
“We should use the public schools as leverage to get as many to vaccinate as possible,” he said.

Texto completo: Oscar-winning actress Holly Hunter grew up on a farm in Conyers in the 1960s and 1970s but wasn't allowed to partake in any of the heavy lifting.
"Boys had chores and girls did not," she said to Jane Pauley of "CBS Sunday Morning" in 2016, "i.e., drive tractors, bale hay, take care of cattle."
Hunter, the youngest of seven children, told the U.K. Metro last year that "I was very jealous of my brothers. I wanted to drive a tractor. I wanted responsibility. I wanted to be able to do a good job. I wished for that."
Instead, "I was mainly left unattended to play and pretend. Probably that's where I started thinking about acting."
That career choice has suited her well.
At age 60,Hunter has a résumé that covers verdant territory.TV movies.TV series. Broadway. Prestige films. Quirky indie films. Action films. Animation. She's worked with A-list actors such as Al Pacino, Tom Cruise, Robin Williams and Sigourney Weaver and legendary producers such as Steven Spielberg, Jonathan Demme and Sydney Pollack. She has garnered four Oscar nominations ( "Broadcast News," "The Firm," "The Piano" and "Thirteen"), winning for "The Piano."
Hunter was willing to jump between film and TV long before that became fashionable. She had an Emmy-winning turn in "Roe vs. Wade" for TV after "Broadcast News." Following her challenging role as a mute in "The Piano," she went full-on felonious in HBO's descriptive "The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom." She won an Emmy for that, too.
Given her relatively diminutive size (5 feet, 2 inches tall) and her distinctive Southern drawl, she doesn't fit the traditional Hollywood starlet mold along the lines of Smyrna-born Julia Roberts.
"I've always kind of drifted between being a character actress and being a leading lady,"Hunter told NPR last year. "It hasn't been a mainstream kind of thing that I've offered. And at the same time, I've been able to carve my own niche out of the culture."
And unlike many of her peers such as Sharon Stone and Michelle Pfeiffer, Hunter over the years assiduously stayed out of the tabloids. In interviews, she rarely talks about her kids or her personal life. "I shall neither confirm nor deny the existence of my children," Hunter joked to The New York Times last year.
Hunter began acting at Rockdale High School in the early 1970s, performing in "Oklahoma," "Man of La Mancha" and "Fiddler on the Roof."
"There were three or four of us who kinda dominated the productions," she told AJC's Eleanor Ringel in 1987. "I was certainly one of the regulars, but it was more than just me."
At a State Play Contest in Athens, Fred Chappell, artistic director of the Alliance Theater at the time, spotted her. She spent two summers with his stock company in Cortland, New York.
"Even at that age, she was so impressive," said Chappell, who now teaches at Florida State University, in an interview last week. "Very focused. Had a strong work ethic. She was very serious about her career even then."
After acting at Carnegie Mellon University, Hunter broke into Hollywood with a tiny part in a horror film, "The Burning." Then came the Coen brothers, who saw her on Broadway in "Crimes of the Heart" and asked her to read for their film "Blood Simple." The part went instead to future fellow Oscar winner Frances McDormand, but since the two actresses were best friends and roommates, there were no hard feelings The Coen brothers eventually wrote breakthrough film "Raising Arizona" specifically with Hunter in mind.
"So that film came about in a real family kind of way," Hunter said to the AJC in 1987. "The Coens had been friends for years, and as far as directing me, they'd mostly just say, 'Hey, Holly, go!' "
Early in her career, she worried her size might hold her back, but James L.Brooks -- seeking someone to play the hard-nosed yet vulnerable news producer Jane Craig on "Broadcast News" -- proved her wrong.
"With 'Broadcast News,' it became a non-issue, and with 'The Piano,' it became a non-issue," Hunter recalled in 2016 at the Hamptons International Film Festival. "Both parts were written for more statuesque women.It was nice to change people's minds about that because that's neither here nor there."
After her Emmy-nominated turn as the complex, morally blurry Grace in TNT's "Saving Grace" from 2007 to 2010,Hunter sought film roles as she entered her 50s and was sorely disappointed.
"I just thought that (Grace) was an incredible boundaryless character that I got to stretch out in over the course of 'Saving Grace,' " she said to NPR in 2018. "And when I got back to the feature film world, there was so little opportunity that I was really kind of stunned. I was looking to take a slight break but not exactly a hiatus."
Fortunately, she received accolades as a protective mom in 2017's "The Big Sick" and brought fire to Elastigirl in "Incredibles 2" last year.
"Now I'm 60, and I'm still acting," she said to the U.K. Daily Observer last year. "That's pretty good. So in a lot of ways, I defied my own expectations. I think acting has provided me with all these adventures that I never could have really anticipated. It's a great career and it continues to be a great career."

American carnage is real

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/american-carnage-is-real/docview/2191434066/se-2?accountid=14708

Texto completo: President Trump began his presidency uttering the phrase “American carnage,” and the commentators scoffed. Every month, it seems, we get new evidence that the carnage is real.

More Americans are dying of despair now than during any time in history, a new study finds. Suicide rates are climbing. Alcohol deaths are, too. The picture on drugs is even worse, with overdose deaths tripling in the past 20 years.

These numbers highlight how off-base was the reaction to Trump’s line in his inaugural address. “Trump gives us 'American carnage,’” wrote New York Times editor Andrew Rosenthal, as if these problems didn’t exist without Trump. The Times editorial that day chastised Trump’s “fantastical version of America.”

“With sweeping exaggeration,” the editors wrote, “Mr. Trump spoke of ‘carnage.’”

Of course, the carnage isn’t merely in the inner cities. Hidden in the new death data from the Trust for America’s Health is a telling correlation. The states with the highest and fastest-rising suicide rates include Montana, Wyoming, and Alaska. The states with the lowest rates include Maryland and New Jersey. Roughly, suicide in America seems inversely proportional with population density.

Put another way, isolation is killing us. The rise in opioid usage can be blamed on a similar phenomenon: “social vacancy,” as one West Virginia newspaperman put it. “People don’t feel they have a purpose.”

This highlights a weakness in the bipartisan elite consensus on the economy that existed before Trump crashed onto the scene: If free trade, subsidized trade, heavy regulation, and immigration policies aimed at maximizing the availability of low-skilled labor were bad for the working class, well, we could make it up to them with a more generous safety net.

But welfare and no work didn’t lead to healthy inner cities in the 1970s and 1980s, and it’s not leading to healthy rural counties today. As happened in the inner cities decades ago, rural America is seeing men drop out of the labor force and out of family life — marriage is falling, and out-of-wedlock births are increasing.

These ill effects are lost on most of the media because we live in bubbles where the evils are much rarer.

Recent numbers should shake us out of our slumber. Just because Trump says things are bad out there doesn’t mean we ought to deny it. Just because the struggling working-class families cling to their guns and vote for Trump doesn’t mean they deserve their suffering.

The carnage is real, even if Trump says so.

Julian Castro hits Bernie Sanders for balking on 'big check' for reparations

Texto completo: Democratic presidential hopeful Julian Castro suggested Sunday fellow primary contender, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was hypocritical for his comments on reparations.

Castro, speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union” with Jake Tapper, said the senator from Vermont supports writing “big checks” for a number of issues, but found it unusual that Sanders hasn't spoken in support of compensating the descendants of slaves.

“It's interesting to me that when it comes to 'Medicare for All,' healthcare, you know, the response there has been we need to write a big check,” Castro said. “ … So, if the issue is compensating the descendants of slaves, I don't think the argument about writing a big check ought to be the argument that you make if you're making an argument that a big check needs to be written for a whole bunch of other stuff.”

Castro’s support for reparations contrasts with Sanders, who said on “The View” in early March that he doubted the efficacy of giving money to African-American descendants of slavery. “Our job is to address the crisis facing the American people and our communities, and I think there are better ways to do that than just writing out a check,” Sanders said.

Despite his skepticism for monetary reparations, the senator said during a CNN town hall there are “massive disparities” that must be addressed. Sanders said he wants to target the issue on a more structural basis, advocating for legislation that would direct federal funds toward communities with high levels of poverty in order to end “institutional racism” in the U.S.

Castro affirmed in the interview Sunday that he supports some form of reparations and explained that if elected he would set up a task force to explore options on how to proceed.

“I've long believed that this country should address slavery, the original sin of slavery, including by looking at reparations. And if I'm president, then I'm going to appoint a commissioner task force to determine the best way to do that,” Castro said.

The topic of reparations has become an issue discussed among Democrats vying to unseat President Trump in the 2020 election. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have both said they support some form of program to make amends to black Americans for slavery.

Presidential candidates aren't the only ones weighing in. New York Times columnist David Brooks, who considers himself a moderate Republican, said Thursday in a column that he has changed his mind on the matter and now supports reparations.

It's not easy making an egg out of an omelet

Resumen: According to the Roman calendar, the Ides of March was the ancient empire's traditional day to settle debts. Few know this better than U.S. farmers and ranchers who have held their collective tongue while the White House used the past two years "to level the playing field" in multilateral trade, explains the Global Trade and Analysis Project (GTAP) at Purdue University. Worse, "If the current U.S. trade policy were to continue toward protectionism," GTAP surmises, "U.S. agricultural exports would drop by $21.8 billion ... (which) would result in an aggregate welfare loss of $42.5 billion to the U.S. economy."

Texto completo: According to the Roman calendar, the Ides of March was the ancient empire's traditional day to settle debts. In 44 B.C., Brutus and Cassius, two of Rome's elite senators, settled a political debt with Julius Caesar, their emperor, by stabbing him to death in the Senate on the Ides, or March 15.
Little blood is spilled on democracy's great debating floors today. Still, political careers do die on them regularly. An unwise alliance here, a loose tongue there and, thud, another public career is as dead as, well, Caesar.
That thud might soon ring in Great Britain's House of Commons, says Roger Cohen, an astute observer of British politics. It will be, predicts Cohen, who grew up in England, the sound of Prime Minister Theresa May's career hitting rock bottom somewhere around March 15 as she retreats - asks for an extension - to the March 29 deadline for the U.K. to leave, or "Brexit," the European Union.
But that doesn't mean Brexit will die, suspects Cohen in his March 2 New York Times column. "Anything is possible," he says, because Britain's politics, like America's, now operate from either the left or the right, not the center where leaders once met to arbitrate policy. That middle ground is now career quicksand.
The bilateral comparison isn't perfect, but May's loyalty to her political right and its anti-EU push has parallels in the United States and to President Donald J. Trump's devotion to the right wing of his political party.
For example, both May and Trump preside over deeply divided governments. Both use nationalism to recharge their power if it begins to fade. And while both nations are deeply embedded in the global economy, each believes it can stand alone - get better "deals" - in contentious issues like trade and nuclear weapons.
After three years of Brexit maneuvering and two years of unpredictable Trumpism, however, two realities are beginning to surface with the political left, right and center in each nation. First, going it alone might not be achievable and, second, it's probably not what either nation needs anyway.
That means, Cohen surmises, recent seat-of-the-pants policymaking by novices and neo-whatevers needs to yield to people who have the knowledge and experience to bridge today's growing gaps in trade, finance, and diplomacy.
Few know this better than U.S. farmers and ranchers who have held their collective tongue while the White House used the past two years "to level the playing field" in multilateral trade, explains the Global Trade and Analysis Project (GTAP) at Purdue University.
Those trade tactics, however, says the Purdue group, have done more burying than leveling. The White House's first move, pulling out of the almost-done Trans-Pacific Partnership, now "reduces agricultural and food exports by $1.8 billion a year."
Worse, "If the current U.S. trade policy were to continue toward protectionism," GTAP surmises, "U.S. agricultural exports would drop by $21.8 billion ... (which) would result in an aggregate welfare loss of $42.5 billion to the U.S. economy."
Keep in mind that this forecast didn't originate with some Trump-scorned news network or liberal think tank. It's the analysis of trade experts at Purdue University, the intellectual home to American agriculture's patron saint of free markets, Earl "Fencerow" Butz.
"What does all this mean?" GTAP asks in its final analysis.
"It suggests that U.S. agriculture is entering a volatile period in international trade. The data suggest the sector currently risks losing much of the trade achieved over the past three decades."
Cohen, the Times columnist, expresses the same thought differently; he quotes Pascal Lamy, the former head of the World Trade Organization who, when asked to comment on whether Brexit would succeed, wryly noted, "It's not easy making an egg out of an omelet."
No, it's not. But that doesn't mean this White House - or Ms. May - won't continue to try.

Texto completo: La hija del presidente Donald Trump y su esposo son investigados por el Comité de Supervisión de la Cámara de Representantes, que obtuvo documentos sobre el proceso de los permisos de seguridad otorgados a la pareja.
Ese Comité ya había solicitado a la Casa Blanca la información, pero se negó a proporcionarla, reveló el portal Axios sobre el caso Jared Kushner e Ivanka Trump .
La filtración de los documentos beneficiará al Congreso, lo que dificultará que la Casa Blanca retenga información para las indagatorias de los demócratas.
El New York Times reveló hace unas semanas que el presidente Trump habría presionado al exjefe de Gabinete, John Kelly, para que se otorgaran las autorizaciones.
Aunque el mandatario tiene ese derecho, el caso resulta relevante, debido a que se trata de miembros de su familia a quienes pudo haber otorgado permisos directamente.
Ahora el Comité tiene los documentos que detallan todo el proceso, desde la primavera de 2017 hasta la primavera de 2018, sobre cómo Kushner y su esposa finalmente obtuvieron los permisos de seguridad.
La Casa Blanca no ha dado una postura oficial sobre esta nueva pieza de información, pero un documento, obtenido por Axios, proporciona algunos detalles sobre por qué se cambió la autorización de seguridad de Kushner a “interina” en septiembre de 2017, tras informarse que la investigación sobre su pasado estaba “incompleta”.

Texto completo: Ellis Hay knew one of answers had to be "Bea Arthur."
"She is only Bea to be kind of famous enough for a crossword that I could find," he said.
The 2016 graduate of East Lansing High School made his New York Times debut March 4 with the publication of his B-themed crossword puzzle. Hay began work on the puzzle nearly a year ago. The Temple University music composition junior fittingly used music terms and homophones as well. Clue topics ranged from pop culture, as in "Backstreet Boys member ____ Dorough," to political, "Brooklyn-born Supreme Court Justice."
It took Hay more than a week to finish the puzzle. He submitted it last spring and learned in July that it would be published. The puzzle ran in the New York Times on Monday.
"My mom was excited to tell everyone she knows about it," he said.
The former quiz bowl team member said he can usually complete the New York Times crossword Monday through Thursday. The puzzle gets increasingly challenging as the week progresses. He can sometimes complete the Friday and Saturday puzzles, though not always.
Hay isn't a lifelong crossword puzzle fiend. He started in earnest in college and has submitted a few puzzles to the Times.
"I haven't submitted any in a few months, but, probably during the summer, I can focus a little bit more on puzzles."

Can trump stop the invasion?

Texto completo: In its lead editorial Wednesday, The New York Times called upon Congress to amend the National Emergency Act to "erect a wall against any President, not just Mr. Trump, who insists on creating emergencies where none exist."
Trump "took advantage" of a "loophole" in the NEA, said The Times, to declare "a crisis at the border, contrary to all evidence."
The Times news desk, however, apparently failed to alert the editorial page on what the top story would be that day.
"Record Numbers Crossing to U.S., Deluging Agents" was the page-one headline. The Times quoted Kevin K. McAleenan, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection: "The system is well beyond capacity, and remains at the breaking point. ... This is ... a border security and a humanitarian crisis."
Reporter Caitlin Dickerson explained what is behind CPB's alarm: "The number of migrant families crossing the southwest border has once again broken records, with unauthorized entries nearly double what they were a year ago."
She continued, "More than 76,000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in February, an 11-year high ... newcomers continue to arrive, sometimes by the busload, at the rate of 2,200 a day."
Only if one believes in open borders is this not an emergency, not a crisis. Consider the budgetary impact alone of this invasion.
The majority of migrants breaching the border are from Mexico and Central and South America. Most do not read, write or speak our English language, are not college graduates and arrive with few skills.
Almost all will enter the half of the U.S. population that consumes more in social benefits during their lifetime than they will ever pay in taxes.
With the U.S. debt over 100 percent of gross domestic product and the deficit running at nearly 5 percent of GDP, at full employment, the burden the migrant millions are imposing upon our social welfare state will one day collapse the system. For these folks are coming to a country where education K-12 is free and where, if the Democrats take over, pre-K though college will be free.
These folks will be eligible for city, county, state and federal programs that provide free or subsidized food, rent, housing and health care.
All were enacted for the benefit of U.S. citizens. Uninvited, the Third World is coming to partake of and enjoy them.
With 328 million people here now, approaching twice the number as in 1960, how many more can we take in before government sinks under the weight of its beneficiaries?
And there is a larger issue.
If, as appears probable, President Trump is not going to be able to build his wall and all the security measures taken in this century have proved inadequate to stanch the invasion of America, how does the invasion end?
Or is this the endless invasion, where the future is decided on our 1,900-mile border with Mexico and we, as the last superpower, are a pitiful, helpless giant too morally paralyzed to stop it?
The resolution and determination of Third World peoples to come to America, even if they have to break our laws to get in and stay, is proven.
And if there is no matching national will to halt the invasion, and no truly effective means that would be acceptable to our elites, the migrants are never going to stop coming. And why should they?
Politically, this invasion means the inevitable death of the national Republican Party, as peoples of color, who vote 70-90 percent Democratic in presidential elections, become the new majority of 21st-century America.
The bell will toll for the Grand Old Party when Texas votes like California in some presidential election.
That is game, set, match.
What is remarkable is how our cultural elites are giddily embracing what most of the advanced world is recoiling from.
The Times that berates Trump for trying to secure the border with his wall constantly bewails the rise of ethnic nationalism, populism, tribalism and "illiberal democracies" in Europe.
But the rising "isms" of the new Europe are driven by popular fear and loathing of the very future The Times cannot wait to embrace.
Japan's population of 127 million, the second oldest on Earth, has begun to shrink. But there seems to be no desire in Japan to import millions of East or South Asians or Africans to replace the vanishing Japanese.
Does China look upon its diversity as its greatest strength?
Hardly. Beijing is repopulating Tibet with Han Chinese, and has set up "re-education camps" to de-program Uighur Muslims and Kazakhs in the west so they sever their birth attachments to their ethnicity and faith and convert into good communists.
In the U.S., the ball is now in Trump's court.
If he cannot get a Democratic House to fund his wall and the forces now on the border are being overwhelmed by the migrants, as CPB reports, how does he propose to halt the invasion?
And if he does not stop it, who will?
And what does failure mean for America's future as one nation and one people?

Rockville house and owner had roles in 'Lilith,' which paid for new wallpaper

Texto completo: The book on which the 1964 film "Lilith" was based is primarily set in the Chestnut Lodge mental institution on West Montgomery Avenue in Rockville, Md. This beautiful brick building did not appear in the film, but some scenes were shot at a house in Rockville, and a scene was shot near Great Falls as well. Can you locate the Rockville home the movie was shot in?
- Michael Lloyd, Rockville
"They had a call for extras and everybody and his brother wanted to be in the movie," said Patricia Ebrahimi , who grew up in Rockville. She wasn't in the movie, but her great-aunt Lucy Neville Smith was - and so was her great-aunt's house: 108 Forest Ave.
"She lived there for 92 years, from birth to death," Patricia said. Patricia owns the house now, meaning it has been in the same family since it was built in 1890.
The house caught the eye of a film crew that came to Maryland in 1963 to scout locations for the screen version of J.R. Salamanca's 1961 novel "Lilith." The book tells the story of Vincent, an Army veteran who goes to work at a high-end mental hospital and falls under the spell of a beguiling patient, the titular Lilith.
Chestnut Lodge and Rockville stand in for the hospital "Poplar Lodge" and "Stonemont," respectively, in the novel. Salamanca knew what he was writing about: He was a former GI who worked at Chestnut Lodge. "Lilith" was his second book. He went on to become a creative-writing professor at the University of Maryland. (Among his students: a callow Answer Man.)
The director of "Lilith" was Robert Rossen , fresh off the success of "The Hustler," for which he'd received Oscar nominations as director and co-screenwriter. "Lilith" starred Warren Beatty and Jean Seberg as Vincent and Lilith. Kim Hunter played a psychiatrist and Peter Fonda a patient.
We still get excited when movies are made in our backyards. That was rarer in 1963, especially in Rockville and in Barnesville, a sleepy village that was the setting for a long carnival and jousting scene. (It is the state sport of Maryland, after all.)
Many extras were recruited - at $10 a day - from Poolesville High School. Paul Sisler , a Rockville postal employee, was hired to hold a fishing pole in scenes shot at Great Falls and the C&O Canal. "I'll say this," Sisler told a journalist. "It's not the most money I ever made. But it's the easiest."
Others, though, were bored by the endless retakes and complained about having to wear the same outfit for days on end, lest the continuity be ruined.
It wasn't only extras who were local. A few veterans from Arena Stage appeared in the film, including Anne Meacham and Rene Auberjonois in an uncredited role.
At first, all the producers wanted of Lucy Smith - "Aunt Sis" to Patricia and her family - was her house. But after meeting her, they changed the role of Beatty's grandfather to his grandmother and gave it to Smith.
The scenes set in the hospital were filmed at a mansion in Oyster Bay, N.Y., on Long Island, as were some of the interiors. A 16-year-old Patricia accompanied her great-aunt. "It was fabulous," she said. "I met Warren Beatty. Peter Fonda took me for a drive in his silver Stingray."
In the movie, Smith's house is the home of Beatty's ex-girlfriend and her husband: Jessica Walter , later to play Lucille Bluth on "Arrested Development," and a young (and creepy) Gene Hackman .
It's fascinating to compare today's Rockville to what's in the film. There's the G.C. Murphy five-and-dime, the Villa movie theater, the Confederate statue . . .
Most of the old downtown no longer exists, having been demolished to make way for the abysmal Rockville Mall, which was itself eventually torn down. The Confederate statue is now in White's Ferry.
Though it doesn't appear in the film, Chestnut Lodge is gone too. It closed as a mental hospital in 2001. There were plans to transform the main building into condominiums, but a fire destroyed it in 2009. There are single-family homes on the grounds today.
While Salamanca's novel had garnered glowing reviews - "polished prose of luminous beauty," wrote the New York Times - Rossen's film was less enthusiastically received. Local audiences who caught the D.C. premiere at the Dupont Theater on Oct. 14, 1964, enjoyed looking for familiar faces and places, but many found the film unsettling. It was no "My Fair Lady." It was dark, with - spoiler alert - implicit sex (hetero- and homosexual), suicide and an entirely inappropriate relationship at its core.
The Post's Richard L. Coe called "Lilith" an "absorbing, haunting story on the limitless unpredictabilities of love," but faulted its leading man. "Had Beatty made a few more pictures before coming to this role," Coe wrote, "he might have been equal to its demands."
Rossen apparently was disappointed by the reaction. He never made another film and died two years after the release of "Lilith." Salamanca died in 2013.
As for the house on Forest Avenue, said Patricia: "The movie paid enough money to Miss Lucy Neville Smith that she got the entire interior wallpapered."

Illinois American Water president: Infrastructure investment

Texto completo: As the local water and/or wastewater provider, the work of our team touches every one of our customers daily. We ensure safe, reliable service to make your morning coffee, wash your dishes, flush your toilet and other daily activities which often are taken for granted. This responsibility to our customers is something we take seriously. It’s why we continue to invest in our critical water and wastewater systems.
Last year, Illinois American Water invested over $122 million to install or rehabilitate more than 42 miles of water and sewer main. Water treatment processes, equipment, security and technology were also upgraded to comply with drinking water standards and enhance system reliability and resilience. In addition, hundreds of fire hydrants and water meters were installed or replaced across the state.
Similar investments are needed across the country as critical infrastructure is reaching the end of its useful life and water quality standards are becoming stricter. Unfortunately, some municipal water and wastewater systems struggle to make continued investments due to lack of funds, artificially low rates and what their community leaders may perceive as more pressing priorities. When investments are delayed or ignored, water quality and service reliability can be impacted, hindering fire protection, economic development and public health.
Last year, a national study of drinking water quality violations was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study — "National Trends in Drinking Water Quality" — is the first-ever study to assess trends in drinking water quality violations across several decades, and includes analysis of factors that lead to higher rates of violations.
USA Today, The New York Times, Science Magazine and other notable media outlets covered the findings. A reoccurring theme reported was "Privately owned utilities are less vulnerable to violations than systems under public ownership. The probability of a violation for a privately-owned utility is significantly lower than a government owned utility."
In 2016, 198 water systems in Illinois had water quality violations — about 73 percent were received by public systems. Our team did not receive one, NOT ONE, notice of violation — this is true for 2017 and 2018 as well. We are very proud of our track record and commitment to over 1.3 million persons.
In addition to ensuring public health, we contribute to the communities we serve through taxes, community donations and job creation. In 2018, American Water partnered with the University of Illinois Regional Economic Applications Laboratory to analyze the company’s impact on the economy in Illinois over a five-year period (2013—17). The study included data for not only Illinois American Water operations but also all-American Water subsidiaries operating in Illinois. The study showed American Water’s overall economic impact was $223 million to $245 million per year, for a total, estimated economic impact of $1.17 billion.
Communities with solid infrastructure already in place are also more capable to handle growth and attract new businesses. In 2019, Illinois American Water expects to invest over $100 million across its Illinois service areas. We are committed to the communities we serve.

Texto completo: Today is Saturday, March 9, the 68th day of 2019. There are 297 days left in the year.
Today’s Highlight in History:
On March 9, 1933, Congress, called into special session by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, began its “hundred days” of enacting New Deal legislation.
On this date:
In 1796, the future emperor of the French, Napoleon Bonaparte, married Josephine de Beauharnais. (The couple later divorced.)
In 1841, the U.S. Supreme Court, in United States v. The Amistad, ruled 7-1 in favor of a group of illegally enslaved Africans who were captured off the U.S. coast after seizing control of a Spanish schooner, La Amistad; the justices ruled that the Africans should be set free.
In 1862, during the Civil War, the ironclads USS Monitor and CSS Virginia (formerly USS Merrimac) clashed for five hours to a draw at Hampton Roads, Virginia.
In 1916, more than 400 Mexican raiders led by Pancho Villa attacked Columbus, New Mexico, killing 18 Americans. During the First World War, Germany declared war on Portugal.
In 1935, the animated cartoon character Porky Pig first appeared in the Warner Bros. animated short “I Haven’t Got a Hat.”
In 1945, during World War II, U.S. B-29 bombers began launching incendiary bomb attacks against Tokyo, resulting in an estimated 100,000 deaths.
In 1954, CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow critically reviewed Wisconsin Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy’s anti-communism campaign on “See It Now.”
In 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court, in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, raised the standard for public officials to prove they’d been libeled in their official capacity by news organizations.
In 1976, a cable car in the Italian ski resort of Cavalese fell some 700 feet to the ground when a supporting line snapped, killing 43 people.
In 1977, about a dozen armed Hanafi Muslims invaded three buildings in Washington, D.C., killing one person and taking more than 130 hostages. (The siege ended two days later.)
In 1989, the Senate rejected President George H.W. Bush’s nomination of John Tower to be defense secretary by a vote of 53-47. (The next day, Bush tapped Wyoming Rep. Dick Cheney, who went on to win unanimous Senate approval.)
In 1997, gangsta rapper The Notorious B.I.G. (Christopher Wallace) was killed in a still-unsolved drive-by shooting in Los Angeles; he was 24.
Ten years ago: President Barack Obama lifted George W. Bush-era limits on using federal dollars for embryonic stem cell research.
Five years ago: The search continued for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 that had gone missing the day before while over the South China Sea with 239 people on board. (The plane was never found.)
One year ago: A combat veteran who’d been expelled from a treatment program at a California veterans home fatally shot three mental health workers there before taking his own life. Weeks after the shooting that left 17 people dead at a Florida high school, Gov. Rick Scott signed a school-safety bill that included new restrictions on guns, prompting a lawsuit from the National Rifle Association; the bill raised to 21 the minimum age to buy rifles and created a program enabling some teachers and other school employees to carry guns. Martin Shkreli, the former pharmaceutical CEO who’d been vilified for jacking up the price of a lifesaving drug, was sentenced in New York to seven years in prison for securities fraud. A Kentucky neighbor of U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, Rene Boucher, pleaded guilty to a federal charge for tackling the lawmaker in an attack his attorney said was triggered by a dispute over lawn maintenance; Boucher served a 30-day prison sentence.

Texto completo: The State Fire Marshal has given the go-ahead for T.M. Landry College Preparatory School to begin remodeling the interior of its new home in Lafayette to bring it up to state fire code — thus lifting a cease and desist order on construction.
However, the school is prohibited from occupying the building until construction is complete and passes state inspection.
State Fire Marshal review planners approved the plans late Thursday afternoon for the occupancy change project for 3403 Moss St. submitted by Angelle Architects, for construction only.
"The release includes remaining deficiencies that will be allowed to be addressed during construction, which includes a plan review submission for a fire alarm system, among other things," said Ashley Rodrigue, spokeswoman for the State Fire Marshal.
Greg Davis, the former Cajundome director who has taken over as chairman of the private school, said Friday morning that the architects have applied to the city of Lafayette for a building permit to begin construction. Once in hand, the work on the Moss Street building will begin.
Davis said the school is requesting permission from the fire marshal to occupy a part of the building while the improvements take place, as the order not to occupy remains in effect until construction is complete and passes a final inspection to make sure the work was done according to the approved plans, Rodrigue said.
The State Fire Marshal may allow for partial occupancy as portions of construction are complete, but that requires a specific request that must be approved by State Fire Marshal plan reviewers.
In the meantime Davis said the school also is reaching out to other people and organizations for potential alternative places to have school.
They are waiting to hear back to see which alternative is possible for Monday. Students have been out this week on an extended Mardi Gras break.
The private school has been in limbo ever since the fire marshal said it had until March 8 to move out of its current Breaux Bridge location or come up with a plan of action for bringing the Breaux Bridge location into compliance.
The state first discovered the school was not in compliance in December 2017 and has let them remain in the Breaux Bridge building for more than a year. School officials said renovating the building in Breaux Bridge would be too expensive.
"Our deputies will be following up to determine that building's status," Rodrigue said.
The new location in an old skating rink has no sprinkler system and is divided into two rooms separated by a fire-resistant wall. The building will be divided into three sections with the addition of a second fire partition, thus avoiding the need for a sprinkler system, according to the architectural drawing notes.
The partition will have fire sealant up to the roof deck.
Also, two 90-minute-rated hollow metal doors and frames will be installed in the new fire partition.
The architects also plan to install a new, enhanced fire alarm system throughout the building.
The contractor — unnamed at this time — will submit shop drawings and paperwork to the fire marshal for review and approvals and pay all review fees.
T.M. Landry uses large, open classrooms. "As such, the large classrooms would normally require a sprinkler system on account of the code-calculated occupant load," the architects noted.
The enhanced fire system, the fire exits and a promise from the owner that occupancy wouldn't exceed 299 people will be equivalent to a sprinkler system, the plans said.
The owner will submit a "request for equivalency" to the fire marshal before the school takes occupancy, the architects said.
The school, once touted for its record of placing graduates at Ivy League schools, has come under fire after a New York Times article about allegations of falsifying college applications and abuse of students by the school's leaders.
Enrollment at the school is at 75, down from 110 when the article published, Davis said.
State Fire Marshal review planners approved the plans late Thursday afternoon for the occupancy change project for 3403 Moss Street.

Texto completo: Perhaps because so few Americans now serve in the military — less than 1 percent of the population — the serious health effects being suffered by veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who were exposed to the open burning of toxic waste have not received the attention they deserve. Recent testimony before the Vermont Senate Government Operations Committee by Wesley Black, a longtime Hartford firefighter who served two tours overseas with the Vermont Army National Guard, gave to the issue a heartbreakingly human face.
As VtDigger reported, Black, 33, told of being exposed to toxic fumes from burn pits near his base and his subsequent diagnosis with stage 4 colon cancer after years of suffering from symptoms the cause of which doctors were not able to pinpoint. “You’re essentially looking at a dead man walking,” Black, the father of a 3-year-old son, told lawmakers. He predicted that “this is going to be a nationwide health crisis in our veterans.”
Indeed, it is shaping up that way. According to The New York Times, tens of thousands of those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan were exposed to fumes from more than 250 burn pits, in which all kind of debris was disposed of by igniting it with jet fuel. The substances disposed of in this way include chemicals, paint, medical and human waste, aluminum cans, munitions and unexploded ordnance, petroleum and lubricants, plastics, rubber, wood and discarded food. Open burning was used because large bases were often established in locations that lacked the infrastructure for proper disposal, according to the Times.
Scores of veterans who have fallen ill and their families are convinced that their illnesses are the result of that exposure, as are some doctors who have treated those ailments. But so far, the Department of Defense has not acknowledged a link between open pit burning and health problems. And the Department of Veterans Affairs says that, “At this time, research does not show evidence of long-term health problems from exposure to burn pits. VA continues to study the health of deployed veterans.” Although it has established a registry for those exposed, the VA has denied all but about 20 percent of the burn-pit-related disability claims filed, citing either the lack of an official diagnosis of the condition or lack of evidence establishing a connection between the condition and military service.
This situation, of course, echoes an earlier tragedy dating from the Vietnam era. “It took decades and decades (until 2007) for the U.S. government to acknowledge that Agent Orange created devastating health effects for soldiers,” U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., told the Times. “We can’t let that happen again.”
It is also alarming that, according to VtDigger, burn pits continue to be used overseas by the military. An aide to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told the Vermont hearing that Sanders and other members of Congress who have urged the Pentagon to discontinue the practice have been told essentially that sufficient alternatives are not available. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld a ruling granting contractors that operate some of the pits immunity from legal liability.
We do not underestimate the difficulties of disposing of toxic waste in combat zones. But the Defense Department’s technical prowess, as reflected in ever-more sophisticated and expensive 21st century weaponry, surely could be brought to bear to solve a 20th- or even 19th- century problem without endangering the future health of its service members.
In the meantime, Congress should push the Pentagon and Veterans Affairs to compile the necessary data and urgently research the likely link between toxic fumes and the illnesses being suffered by former service members. Once that link is established, the government must do the right thing by those veterans, even if it proves very expensive. “Thank you for your service” cannot be just a catch phrase; it has to be a commitment to properly care for the latest generation of combat veterans.

10 Are Named Times Scholars

Texto completo: On a trip to Costco about four years ago, Jailine Peña López, now 18, asked her mother to buy her a little white table and a little red chair.
The set was made for children, but it meant a lot to Ms. López, who until then had done her homework on the bed, the bus or the subway. As she and her mother moved from place to place in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, she cherished the miniature furniture because it gave her a space all her own.
"The table and the chair became a motivation for me to keep going and keep doing my homework and pursue my dream of higher education," she said.
Her drive paid off. Ms. López is a star student at the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics and has participated in extracurricular activities like the Model United Nations.
And she is one of 10 students chosen this year for The New York Times College Scholarship Program, which means she will get up to $15,000 in financial assistance for every year of college, as well as mentoring and internship opportunities with The New York Times Company.
The scholarship, which is financed by reader donations and an endowment fund, has helped hundreds of students afford tuition at top-tier universities.
This year's winners shared their experiences with homelessness, poverty and abuse. They described family members' struggles with mental illness and addiction. They recalled traumatic experiences that, ultimately, motivated them to fight for change.
"I just want to stop the cycle, because it's just too much pain," said Davina Scott, 19, who witnessed devastating violence growing up in Jamaica and systemic injustice in Queens, where she lives now. She has been accepted to Howard University and wants to study political science and criminal justice.
Anchal Malh, 17, was evicted from her home in Queens on the night before her 12th birthday. Despite a period of homelessness, she excelled in school. This year, she will become the first woman in her family to attend college. For girls in future generations, she said, "it's my responsibility to make sure that they have a woman in the family to look up to."
Melanie Earle, 17, was involved in a car crash four years ago, leaving her with post-traumatic stress that she struggled to talk about for a long time. She hopes to use her scholarship to pursue mechanical engineering, humanitarian studies and maybe a language or two.
Jaylen Campbell, 17, earned top grades in middle school but was frustrated when his efforts did not improve life for his family in Brooklyn. So he collected bottles and cans on the street to recycle for a nickel apiece. Now he feels the academic work is paying off. Another scholarship has taken him to China, and in college, he wants to study engineering and use it to improve people's lives.
Nefertari Elshiekh, 18, worked several jobs to support her family and still became an honor student. She was so grateful for the education she received that she is determined to become an elementary schoolteacher -- and to fight for fair educational policies.
Hanah Jun, 17, watched her mother struggle with mental illness while she and her grandmother did their best to stay afloat in Queens. But Ms. Jun also excelled as a volleyball player and musician, participated in student government and held part-time jobs. She is passionate about the environment and open-minded about her career. "I just want to help people," she said. "I think that through everything, I've developed a very strong sense of empathy."
Ms. Jun and several other scholarship winners described their favorite young adult novels or comic books with infectious enthusiasm, explaining that they found role models in fiction when they could not find them in real life. But the nonfiction was less comforting: In essays and interviews, all 10 pointed to recent news headlines that had left them unnerved or afraid.
Salma Elsayed, 17, a model student who taught English to girls in Egypt in 2017, was struck by news reports of teachers going on strike across the United States. "The issue of education in this country is constantly something I think about, and the disparities that students face," she said.
Derek Rodriguez, 17, said news reports about children being separated from their parents at the United States border with Mexico struck a raw nerve. He could relate. His stepfather was taken away by immigration agents who stormed his home when he was 5. "That was the point when I had to grow up," he said.
Mr. Rodriguez wants to become an international businessman and see the world. Ms. Elsayed, inspired by activists in her own community, is considering running for office.
Runnie Exuma, 17, has creative ideas about what she might like to study in college -- something that combines technology, humanities and the arts. And as an activist, she has already worked for racial justice and immigrants' rights. "Any activist work I do is connected in a way," she said. "It's a struggle that we're all fighting for."
These students know a scholarship will not make their problems disappear. When Ms. Jun learned in late February that she was a winner, she was in the parking lot of a funeral home, mourning her mother's death. Ms. Scott said that her half sister, Latrar Scott, 25, went missing more than a year ago and still had not been found. And while Mr. Campbell's achievements have earned him travel opportunities and academic accolades, he still collects bottles from time to time to raise extra money for his family.
"I still want to help with groceries," he said.
The students are following in the footsteps of nearly 300 others who entered The New York Times College Scholarship Program before them, like Dextina Booker, 25, who was a member of the 2011 cohort.
Ms. Booker earned her bachelor's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is pursuing a master's in integrated design and management. Ultimately, she plans to go into academia.
During her undergraduate years, she learned to appreciate everything she has overcome -- not only because the difficulties made her stronger, but also because they gave her a useful perspective. "A lot of the ideas that I come up with stem from my background, from the people I know and the things they need," she said.
Ms. Booker added that the scholarship's mentorship opportunities made her feel less alone among college classmates who had grown up in relative privilege.
"Having someone there who understands even the basic things about you -- you feel seen," she said. "It feels like you're not alone."

Texto completo: Several news reporters are working hard this week to rescue the Democratic Party from its spectacular failure to hold Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., accountable for her frequent anti-Semitic outbursts.

It’s a dirty job, but someone’s got to do it.

Omar’s incessant anti-Semitism pitched her party into chaos. Her off-hand comments framing pro-Israel Jews as secret power-brokers and dual loyalists who have bought support in Congress got so bad, in fact, that Democratic leadership appeared ready to censure her. But then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and others lost their nerve, caved, and instead produced a meaningless show resolution this week calling for lawmakers to oppose all forms of hate, not just anti-Jewish bigotry.

In other words, Democrats pulled an “all lives matter” in response to a story that begins with one of their members claiming Israel has “hypnotized the world” to cause “evil.” It’s just as shameful as it sounds.

Twenty-three Republicans voted against the House resolution this week, many of them noting correctly that the sham proposal has been watered down to the point that it defeated its original purpose. By the time the final draft came around, it did nothing to hold Omar accountable.

This is where certain reporters stepped in to rescue the Democrats, spinning hard to argue that the real scandal is that a few members of the GOP caucus voted against an “anti-hate” resolution.

“So far FOURTEEN House Republicans have voted against a bill condemning Anti-Semitism, Anti-Muslim and Other Hatred. Wow. This is going to be hard to explain,” said the New York Times’ Michael Barbaro. Of course, it wouldn't be, if people like him explained it honestly to their reading and listening audiences.

Politico’s Jake Sherman tweeted, “House Democrats have been under pressure for a week on anti-semitism but House Republicans have bailed them out. … An embarrassing moment for house gop.” Again, it's as embarrassing as Sherman decides to make that the story, instead of what really happened.

“23 REPUBLICANS vote against anti-hate resolution, taking the heat off Ds after a very tough week. GOP handed Dems a political gift much to ponder,” he added.

The Associated Press’ Nick Riccardi added elsewhere, “The story went from how Dems were in disarray over anti-Semitism to only votes against a banal anti-racism resolution being GOP, with King notably abstaining.”

The Times’ Alex Burns even pulled a “both sides,” calling the eventual House vote a “bipartisan saga of overthinking it.”

To be clear, the House resolution exists only because Omar claimed, among other things, that Israel has "hypnotized the world" to its “evil,” that wealthy Jews dictate congressional Republicans' support for Israel and that Congress and American Jews have divided loyalties. But rather than censuring the Minnesota congresswoman outright, Democratic instead put together a wish-list resolution that reads in part:

"W]hite supremacists in the United States have exploited and continue to exploit bigotry and weaponize hate for political gain, targeting traditionally persecuted peoples, including African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other people of color, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, the LGBTQ community, immigrants, and others with verbal attacks, incitement, and violence. "

That Jews come in seventh place on that list is a nice touch. But let's not forget that the hate that inspired this resolution did not even originate with white supermacists. It originated with a sitting U.S. congresswoman.

The Democratic proposal was an exercise in mealy-mouthed cowardice. It’s an abdication of leadership, and its existence is an insult to the intelligence of those who read it. Yet, Republicans are the ones who’ve supposedly bungled this week, according to our very smart news media.

Here’s a parting thought: When the House voted in January to censure Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, for embracing white nationalism, Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., voted against the motion, claiming at the time that it “did not go far enough.”

Not a single one of the reporters mentioned above saw Rush's vote as an “embarrassing moment” or as something that would “be hard to explain.” That sort of chin-stroking was reserved for Thursday’s vote.

Ask yourself why. Much to ponder indeed.

From the Editorial Advisory Board: Cops confront black man

Texto completo: Illustration Boulder police on Friday, March 1, confront a black Naropa student, who was picking up trash at his own home.

Editor's note: This story has been updated to accurately identify the source of the words "It's likely you were profiled" heard in the video.
Boulder police officers, one with a weapon drawn, recently confronted an unarmed black student, who was not accused of a crime, outside his own residence. Your take?
It would be an understatement to say that things aren't looking so great for Boulder's newest on-paid-leave police officer. He's the star of a Facebook video that has streaked across the country, accumulating condemnation and scorn from all corners. His own police chief described the incident in question as "very concerning" and noted that the man, a Naropa student, our unnamed officer approached during it did nothing wrong. If you watch the 16-minute video to its completion, you can hear a person who is reported to be Naropa's director of safety and facilities tell the victim, "It's likely you were profiled."
In many ways it is a really good thing that this story has now been shared in the Washington Post, on CNN and in the New York Times. Our country cannot afford to continue to look the other way when it comes to incidents of racial bias, particularly when they involve people in positions of power.
Nor, for that matter, can our city. "Students, faculty and staff of color at Naropa have all experienced various degrees of racism in Boulder," said Charles Lief, that university's president, during the open comment at Tuesday's Boulder City Council meeting. In the 2018 community survey, non-white respondents were significantly less likely to view the city's police and sheriff services favorably compared to whites.
Still, we should remain conscious of how quickly a one-sided version of this story spread through social media. In this case, it so far seems likely that the video will prove to be an accurate representation of events, but ill-intentioned, biased and ignorant material can travel just as quickly. In pursuit of justice and equity, it is our responsibility to make sure that the news we consume is from sources we can trust, and we need take the time to always vet those sources before we share it.
Mara Abbott, abbottmarak@gmail.com
One thing we can say for sure about the incident between the police and the young man last Friday is that no matter how badly it started and escalated, it ended about as well as we could have hoped for. No arrests we made. No one got shot. And if you've watched the video and saw the tense interactions that occurred, that much is a small miracle.
But whether or not we acknowledge it, we are all part of a social contract with the police. We ask them to protect us and our property and to serve as the first line of defense in maintaining order. To be able to do this, we grant to the police immense power and authority and the right to carry and use weapons in order to protect themselves and us when necessary. We also acknowledge that from time to time we will just simply need to do what they ask without asking why.
In exchange for us granting the police these extraordinary powers, we expect them to exercise their authority judiciously and to have the necessary training so that situations like what happened last week don't occur. We trust that the police a) won't ask us why we are in our own backyards picking up trash and b) if for some reason they do, once we tell them we are there because we live there, that the officer will say, "Sorry, just doing my job. Thanks for cooperating."
But as we all know now, that didn't happen. And we all deserve to know why it didn't happen. The ball is in the court of the police chief now. A first step in restoring our faith and trust in the social contract would be to expedite the completion of their internal investigation. Why it will take 60 to 90 days strains credibility, and that is in short supply.
Chuck Wibby, cxwibby1@gmail.com
Again, the Boulder police have publicly over-reacted. A young man ditches a cab resulting in a Boulder officer shooting him — and the officer, as a result of ricochet in an occupied apartment building. In another incident, the SWAT team detained six students for several hours, only to find no weapons and make no arrests.
The introduction of race into this most recent incident does not minimize the outrage of the previous ones, or the ones we don't hear about. Let's keep focus on the actual problem — the culture of the Boulder Police Department and the tolerance of that culture, the headwaters of which lie in the city administration.
Whether drunk, mentally ill, black, homeless, "too young" to be driving "that" car, these are humans deserving of dignity. Our police department has a pattern of dehumanizing engagement. An agency that accepts inhumane treatment of any class of individual is susceptible to mission creep. If its OK to treat the homeless that way, then why not college students? Certainly Hispanic people, and soon, perhaps, you.
It is not the public's job to be calm when confronted by law enforcement unlawfully at their private residence. It is the job of law enforcement to not disturb the peace in the first place. Once the peace is disturbed, regardless who disturbed it, its is the job of police to de-escalate.
If you see one mouse in your house, that is merely one of the mice you have. Similarly, we have seen three examples of police over-reaction, merely three of the total we have.
What is the culture of the Boulder Police Department? And to what extent is the city administration ignorant, tolerant or encouraging of that culture? That is what we need to know.
Shawn Coleman, slcbdco@gmail.com
This is America.
The right to do yard work without harassment and intimidation by agents of the government is not shared equally among all Americans. It's funny to me that the people who are the most adamant about their right to possess deadly weapons and who beat their chests on Fox News about government overreach are reliably the same ones to defend cops like this one who abused his power and threatened a young black man holding a trash picker-upper, cleaning up his own front yard.
It's infuriating that the taxpayers have to give this police officer a two-to-three month paid vacation ("administrative leave") while the internal investigation takes place. With body cam footage of the entire incident, it doesn't seem like it should take that long. I assume he will get terminated eventually. I feel fairly confident that our city council wouldn't look too kindly on a police department that let him stay on, given all the national attention that we're getting for this injustice. I know our local government craves that national spotlight, but not for this!
What I'm nervous about is whether there's a system in place to prevent this guy from getting hired at a different police department. This behavior is a red flag. Incidents like this tend to escalate. The cop who killed Eric Garner had previously been sued twice for racially motivated wrongdoings. If I ran the world, anyone who demonstrates this level of willingness to abuse their power would be barred from any kind of police or security work and from possessing firearms.
My friend says the real takeaway from this incident is that we can disarm all the cops and give them trash picker-uppers instead, since they are apparently deadly weapons in the eyes of the Boulder Police Department.

Hayek says racism still rampant in Hollywood

Texto completo: Oscar-nominated, Mexican-born actress Salma Hayek said in a new interview that people in the entertainment industry are "terrified to say the wrong thing now," but that she has still noticed racism.

In the new issue of Town & Country, Hayek opens up about the sexual-misconduct allegations she brought against producer Harvey Weinstein in a 2017 piece for The New York Times and what has happened since. Hayek repeated her claim that Weinstein had denied her allegations against him, as well as those of Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o, because they are women of color.

"There is a theory that women of color are easier to discredit," Hayek told the magazine.

She noted that her husband, as well as actors Antonio Banderas and close friend Penelope Cruz, were upset she hadn't shared her Weinstein account with them previously.

When the interviewer asked if Hayek had experienced "other overt incidents of racism in the industry," she replied, "Millions."

One example Hayek cited: "A lot of people are very shocked that I married who I married," she said of her billionaire husband Francois-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of Hering retail company, whose brands include Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci. "And some people are even intimidated now by me. But it's another way of showing racism. They can't believe this Mexican ended up in the life that she has, and they're uncomfortable around me."

R. Kelly's 'girlfriends' come to his defense

R. Kelly's girlfriends, Joycelyn Savage, 23, and Azriel Clary, 21, are coming to his defense after denying claims that the singer has been holding them hostage in his home for years.

Ahead of the full interview, which was set to air Thursday on "CBS This Morning," the show shared an emotional clip from the conversation with the women, who vehemently deny the singer tore them away from their now-estranged families. The parents of both Savage and Clary claim the women are living with Kelly against their will and are a part of what the parents describe as his "sex cult."

Alice and Angelo Clary were interviewed in the explosive docu-series "Surviving R. Kelly" -- which aired on Lifetime in early January -- claiming they haven't had contact with their daughter for nearly three years. Timothy and Jonjelyn Savage were also interviewed in the series, where they revealed they believe R. Kelly is holding their daughter against her will.

On Wednesday morning, Kelly, 52, struggled to contain his emotions when he, too, sat down with "CBS This Morning" host Gayle King for the first interview following his arrest, where he spoke out about his "real" relationship with the young women.

"I love them and it's almost, like, they're my girlfriends," Kelly said. "It's like, you know, we have a relationship. It's real. And I know guys, I've known guys all my life that have five or six women, OK? So don't go there on me, OK? Because that's the truth."

Kelly was released from jail on Feb. 25 after being indicted by a grand jury on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against four alleged victims, Cook Country Sheriff confirmed to People. The R&B singer secured his release by paying 10 percent of his $1 million bail amount. Hours earlier, Kelly's attorney pleaded not guilty on his behalf, the Associated Press reported.

On Wednesday, Kelly was arrested again for failure to pay outstanding child support. Sophia Ansari, Cook County Sheriff's office spokeswoman, told the AP that Kelly will be transferred to the county jail, where he will remain until he pays $161,000 in back child support he owes.

'School of Rock' actor charged with stealing guitars

Child actor Joseph Gaydos has been arrested in Florida and is facing felony charges for larceny and grand theft. Gaydos, who played lead guitarist Zack alongside Jack Black in "School of Rock," allegedly swiped guitars and amplifiers from several music stores. According to police, he also stole from his father.

Police in Venice, Fla., shared surveillance footage on Facebook from Feb. 7 that appears to show Gaydos walking out of a store with a guitar valued around $700. Gaydos was picked up when he attempted to steal at another store days later.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and his team are said to be finishing their report, almost two years in the making, into possible Russian collusion and obstruction of justice by President Trump and those close to him. Four Times journalists who have been covering the developments closely, Amy Fiscus, Mark Mazzetti, Maggie Haberman and Katie Benner, dialed into a conference call with New York Times subscribers on Thursday morning. (Listen to the audio in full here.) They discussed their experience covering the story and answered questions from readers about the continuing investigation. Read a lightly edited excerpt from their conversation, led by Ms. Fiscus, here. Amy Fiscus What questions are you each looking for this report to answer? What have been your white whales of covering this investigation? Mark Mazzetti There are so many, since we've all been at this for so long. We have written so much about Russia, we've written about the different aspects of what's been called the "collusion case," we've written about Middle Eastern countries having a role in this investigation. I think it's going to be, to a degree, unsatisfying if, as we expect, the report is less expansive than we might want. And that's going to then set us up to go report out exactly what they knew about the evidence and why they decided not to bring charges. But I do think, stepping back, it's important to say that if you look at the breadth of what Mueller has done so far, these indictments are incredibly detailed. And far more than is normal, in many cases. And so even if this final "report" is less expansive than we might think, if you go back and look at the, for instance, two big Russia indictments, they're filled with information that is based on highly classified information that really does tell a narrative of what the Russians did in advance of the 2016 election, which is pretty breathtaking. Katie Benner Mueller has not yet indicted any member of the Trump campaign for working with Russia. He's largely indicted them for lying, but not for colluding with Russia. So the open question is, will the president be found to have worked with Russia or tried to obstruct justice? Maggie Haberman I was going to say, the point that I'm really looking toward is what it says about obstruction of justice or attempted obstruction of justice. Does Mueller draw any conclusions in the report or make any recommendations, or does he just do a laying-out of facts and explain how they came to learn certain information and where it's coming from? And then how rough the language is about the president. Even if the report is a couple dozen pages, a couple paragraphs about the president could or could not be pretty damning. Amy Fiscus I wanted to ask you guys more of a personal question about the past couple of years and being on the front lines of this. Can you talk a little about what has been the most challenging part about covering all of this -- Mueller, Trump, the White House, everything? Mark Mazzetti Besides sleep? I've been in Washington a fairly long time covering national security issues and investigations and never encountered an investigation that's more of a black box than this one is. It's meant that we really have to be very judicious and careful about not getting out ahead of ourselves, not saying more than we know, not inferring things. This in the face of real journalistic competition, with our colleagues doing really good work, it has been, as I joked about, we've lost a lot of sleep over it. But I do think that the media has done a good job in terms of providing real information, also, for the investigators themselves. We've uncovered things that we know they didn't even know about and they started to pursue.

2020 Democrats should test their mettle in a Fox News debate instead of running scared

Texto completo: The Democrats’ bewildering decision to prevent Fox News from hosting any of the party’s 12 presidential debates makes me wonder: What are they afraid of?
Emboldened by their takeover of the House and egged on by a ready-to-rumble party faithful, the Democratic National Committee is walking away from a confrontation with President Donald Trump’s favorite news operation — and a chance to make inroads with its audience.
Fox “is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates,’’ DNC Chair Tom Perez said, citing a report in The New Yorker about the close relationship between the conservative cable network and the White House.
Why are Democrats adding fuel to a media fire Trump has already ignited? And at what cost?
Fox News, the No. 1 cable network of any kind, is for better or worse a part of the media landscape, with an average of 2. 4 million very loyal viewers every weeknight. To convince even a few of them to defect from the Trump experiment will be no small challenge for Democrats in 2020.

Sean Hannity calls reporters covering Donald Trump rally 'fake news'
Fox News went all in for Donald Trump. In its eyes, the president can do no wrong.
Dems have many 2020 prospects. Our 12 debates will help them and voters: Tom Perez
If it’s hostile questioning the Democrats fear, isn’t a debate supposed to toughen up the candidates? How a Democrat answers questions on conservative targets such as “socialism” and the “Green New Deal” could very well make or break campaigns.
And wasn’t it a Fox questioner, Megyn Kelly, who aggressively asked Trump at a 2015 debate, “You've called women you don't like 'fat pigs,' 'dogs,' 'slobs' and 'disgusting animals. ’ … Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president?”
Despite the pro-Trump infield of Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham in prime time, the Fox reporters and anchors handling past debates have been politically sober and pretty much indistinguishable from their colleagues at other networks.
Fox senior vice president Bill Sammon said journalists such as Chris Wallace, Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum “embody the ultimate journalistic integrity. ’’ He also reminded Democrats of what should be obvious to them: that Fox boasts “the largest TV news audience in America, which includes many persuadable voters. ”
Obama considered boycotting Fox News
This is a long way from the days when the main sticking points were lighting, the height of the podiums and whether applause was allowed. The bland but hard-working League of Women Voters negotiated the who-when-and-where. At the first televised debates in 1960, Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy were each allowed eight-minute opening statements, an eternity even for YouTube.
More serious tensions will always exist. President Barack Obama said as early as 2010 that Fox News’ conservative tilt was “ultimately destructive” for the nation, and there was talk of the White House boycotting the network.
In 2015, a “pissed off” RNC Chair Reince Priebus said CNBC’s clumsy handling of a GOP debate “was nothing but a crap sandwich. ” There were threats that CNBC would never host a Republican debate again.
And then, of course, Trump made denouncing the “fake news” media a regular part of his political shtick, along with ousting a Spanish-language Univision anchor from a press conference, threatening Amazon’s postal rates (owner Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post), and ridiculing the “failing” New York Times.
Trump still sits down with media 'enemies'
The difference from the Democrats today is that for all his attacks, Trump regularly sits down with New York Times reporters and even with its publisher.
By contrast, the Democrats will be campaigning with blinders on. Excluding Fox, however satisfying it may be to them, will only make the media wars worse:
As the network's most important fan tweeted, “Democrats just blocked @FoxNews from holding a debate. Good, then I think I’ll do the same thing with the Fake News Networks and the Radical Left Democrats in the General Election debates!”
Democrats need to confront the Fox News machine. They need to target and cajole its viewers, not avoid them. An Oz-like pronouncement to “pay no attention to that man behind the curtain” would be the worst strategy of all.

Texto completo: As the Triple Crown season approaches, the talk should be about contenders for the Kentucky Derby. Instead, dead horses and canceled races are hot topics after Santa Anita Park suspended thoroughbred racing because of a spike in fatalities that has cast doubt on the safety of its racing surface.
A filly named Lets Light the Way was euthanized on Tuesday after shattering a sesamoid bone at the ankle joint. It was the 21st horse fatality in racing or training at Santa Anita since Dec. 26. That is more than the 20 deaths that occurred over 122 racing days in 2017, according to Jockey Club data.
"The safety, health and welfare of the horses and jockeys is our top priority," Tim Ritvo, the chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns the track, said in a statement. "While we are confident further testing will confirm the soundness of the track, the decision to close is the right thing to do at this time."
It was the second time in eight days that the historic track below the San Gabriel Mountains a few miles east of Pasadena, Calif., was shut down. The closure has forced the postponement on Saturday of the track's signature race, the Santa Anita Handicap, which was won by the storied horse Seabiscuit in 1940, and the San Felipe Handicap, a major prep race for 3-year-olds trying to qualify for the Kentucky Derby.
Santa Anita officials had little choice. Neither animal rights activists nor casual sports fans have the stomach to see a horse be put down after a catastrophic injury. Ever since the Kentucky Derby in 2008, when the filly Eight Belles had to be euthanized after finishing second, racing officials have worried that another high-profile breakdown could put the sport out of business.
"Quite frankly, we are no longer at a place or time where these incidents can withstand the status quo," Jim Gagliano, the president and chief operating officer of the Jockey Club, said. "The health and safety of the horse and rider is of the utmost importance, and the entire racing industry has to redouble our efforts to prevent these tragedies."
In a 2012 series, The New York Times showed that 24 horses died each week at racetracks across America, many of them because of over-medication or a lack of regulatory protection. It prompted meaningful regulations across the United States that led to a decline in the death rate of horses.
In 2017, for example, there were 1.61 deaths per 1,000 starts in the United States compared with two deaths per 1,000 in 2009. In California, horse deaths have decreased by 60 percent over the last 13 years, with most of the reduction coming in the last couple of years, according to the California Horse Racing Board.
So why have 21 horses died in such a short time?
Rick Arthur, the equine medical director for the Californian agency, pointed to a number of factors: heavy rains, a depleted horse population and impatience on the part of trainers and racetrack officials to get the most out of limited stock.
"Some people haven't been as cautious as they should have on both sides," Arthur said.
Nearly 12 inches of rain have fallen since the meeting began, which has made maintaining a dirt track difficult, especially when "sealing" a track, or packing the dirt tight enough so that no water penetrates its surface. It can mean concrete footing for fragile 1,100-pound horses with ankles as slim as a Coke bottle.
The track was closed on Feb. 26 and 27 after the 2017 Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile winner, Battle of Midway, was fatally injured during a workout. A track safety expert from the University of Kentucky, Mick Peterson, was brought in to search for possible irregularities that might explain the spike in fatalities.
He didn't find any. Shortly after the course was reopened, however, the filly Eskenforadrink became the 20th fatality, breaking down during a race and later being euthanized.
Track officials and horse trainers have, indeed, grown impatient with each other.
Ritvo is a trouble shooter for the Stronach Group, and was dispatched to California from its Maryland tracks in an effort to make Santa Anita more profitable. He has implemented policies to encourage trainers to run their horses more often in the afternoon races to ensure bigger fields in the hope of attracting more betting. The horsemen, in turn, grumbled when the racetrack was shut down for the recent testing, interrupting their training schedules to make particular races.
Statistically at least, California trainers appear to be more demanding of their horses. Horses at Santa Anita currently average 3.02 workouts per start compared with 0.88 workouts per start for horses running at Gulfstream Park in Florida and 0.42 at Aqueduct in New York, according to data compiled by Equibase.
Arthur believes more regulation and vigilance can be exerted during the morning training hours, when nine of the deaths occurred. When a horse is to run in a race, it is examined by state veterinarians for soundness and can undergo drug testing.
"In the mornings, we leave the training to the trainers and private vets," Arthur said.
As Santa Anita officials try to figure out why their racetrack has become so dangerous, it will also have to deal with a mounting public relations problem. Animal rights activists have protested outside the gates, and PETA has called on Gov. Gavin Newsom to close the track and asked the Los Angeles County district attorney to open an investigation into the use of drugs that mask injuries.
It is a problem that a beleaguered industry has long anticipated. In 2016 and again last year, members of the greyhound racing industry have anchored panels at the University of Arizona's annual Global Symposium on Racing. They have spoken about the missteps made as their sport has dwindled to 17 or so racetracks.
"Is It Possible That Horse Racing Is One Referendum Away From Disappearing in Your Jurisdiction?" the discussion was titled in December. "Lessons Learned From the Greyhound Industry."

Texto completo: Carlos Slim perdió $3,000 millones de dólares entre 2018 y 2019, pero eso fue como “quitarle un pelo a un gato”, ya que el empresario no bajó en su posición del ranking de Forbes sobre los más ricos.
La revista señala que Slim tiene una fortuna de $64,000 millones de dólares , cuando en el mismo mes de 2018 ascendía a $67,000 millones.
Parecería que eso lo haría perder posiciones, pero en realidad ganó dos lugares, al ocupar la posición 5 este año.
Slim es el mexicano más rico, de acuerdo con el conteo de Forbes, la cual destaca que él y su familia controlan América Móvil, la mayor empresa de telecomunicaciones telefonía celular de América Latina.
También que con socios de telecomunicaciones extranjeros, Slim compró una participación en Telmex, la única compañía telefónica de México, en 1990.
Además de poseer participaciones en empresas mexicanas de construcción, bienes de consumo, minería e inmobiliarias y el 17% de The New York Times.
En los últimos meses, Slim se enfrentó públicamente al presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador por la cancelación del Nuevo Aeropuerto Internacional de México (NAIM), donde su empresa tiene alta participación.

Hope 'ISIS Bride' will read 'A Man Without a Country'

Texto completo: Has Hoda Muthana, 24, the so-called ISIS Bride who joined the terrorist group at 19 and was widowed twice, ever heard of Civil War-era writer Edward Everett Hale?
I'd bet the answer is "No."
And that's unfortunate.
Because now I can't very well ask Muthana about Hale's famous story, "A Man Without a Country."
In part, that's because she's in a Syrian refugee camp, doing interviews and seeking pity from Americans as leverage against President Donald Trump, so she can get home to her family in Alabama and raise her baby boy in the good old U.S. of A.
"I realized I've made a big mistake and I know I've ruined my future and my son's future and I deeply, deeply regret it," she told the Guardian newspaper.
Being a victim is what it's all about now. That's her only play, to be a victim.
The ISIS Bride is 24 now, a little older than my sons. She ran away from home at 19, made her way to Syria and joined ISIS, was married three times and widowed twice.
That's the thing about ISIS members: When they're not chopping the heads off Christians, Muslims and American journalists, they have a habit of getting killed themselves.
When she left America as a teenager, I've got a feeling ISIS Bride wasn't condemning the monsters who took heads or burned people alive or drowned them in cages in the name of their god.
And I really don't think they teach Hale much in school these days, nor do schools teach civics that much.
Civics? You mean how government works and what, if any, are the responsibilities of American citizens?
Clearly, that kind of thing isn't taught in schools. If it were, then 60 percent of Americans wouldn't have failed a basic citizenship exam put out by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship. The group surveyed 41,000 Americans on basic questions about American history and government. But why would schools teach civics?
Now, if the fellowship had only given a test on whom Tristan Thompson cheated on Khloe Kardashian with, then many Americans would pass.
Ask people about the release date of "Game of Thrones" Season 8 and they'll know. But ask Americans how a bill is passed, or if abolishing the Electoral College would be the fastest way to destroy the republic and bring us to the brink of "Hunger Games"?
Meh.
Americans do know about becoming victims, though, and having victim status conferred upon them by media.
One thing we know about being a victim is that whatever the transgression or alleged crime, it's not your fault, it's someone else's fault, and they don't like you and therefore, they should pay.
And it helps if you look good on TV.
Muthana is an attractive woman, a seemingly devout Muslim, a mother who speaks in measured, thoughtful tones on TV.
She's a perfect victim, except of course FOR the stubborn facts of her earlier tweets. Muthana wasn't much concerned about the victim status of Syrian Orthodox Christians when, inside ISIS territory, in the Valley of the Christians, they were told to either convert and abandon their faith, pay a fine or die.
Consider her tweets when she called for American blood.
"Go on drive-bys and spill all of their blood, or rent a big truck and drive all over them," she tweeted in March 2015, as reported by The New York Times.
And that's exactly what some terrorists did, in the U.S. and in Europe.
President Donald Trump has said he doesn't want her in the country. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo explained further while doing an interview on WOC Radio in Iowa:
"This is a woman who went online and tried to kill young men and women of the United States of America," Pompeo said. "She advocated for jihad, for people to drive vans across streets here in the United States and kill Americans."
Though Muthana was born in the U.S., the daughter of a diplomat from Yemen, Pompeo and Trump insist she is not an American citizen. It's technical. The courts will decide.
"She's not a U.S. citizen. She has no claim of U.S. citizenship." Pompeo said. "In fact, she's a terrorist, and we shouldn't bring back foreign terrorists to the United States of America."
Her family's lawyer said she'd been brainwashed by ISIS. And she's told reporters it was all a terrible mistake, that she wants to be forgiven.
But how many 19-year-old boys make terrible mistakes, with guns in their hands? Our prisons are full of them.
In Hale's "A Man Without a Country," the traitor Philip Nolan was given the opportunity to address the judges and plead mercy.
"Damn the United States!" Nolan cried. "I wish I may never hear of the United States again!"
His sentence terrified me. He was sentenced to a life at sea, forbidden to set one foot in America, forbidden to see her shores. And while he lived, Nolan was never to hear the words "The United States" again.
He lived a long life. But that's a story. Just like the ISIS Bride who has been brainwashed is a story.
Her son is innocent. He should be brought here to be raised by her parents. And I think she's a citizen, since she was born here.
But citizens owe their county something.
I figure she owes 30 years in a federal penitentiary without parole.

Texto completo: The Brooklyn-based playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury won the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize on Monday for "Fairview," her much-lauded play that deals with issues of race and family -- and one particular family preparing for an important dinner.
The Blackburn Prize -- which comes with $25,000, as well as a signed print by Willem de Kooning -- is awarded every year to a woman who writes for the English-language theater.

Ms. Drury's "Fairview" was co-commissioned by Berkeley Repertory Theatre and Soho Rep, and debuted to sold-out theaters at both places in 2018. Sarah Benson was the director. After its run at the Soho Rep was extended three times, "Fairview" will go to Theater for a New Audience in Brooklyn this June. It will also have its London premiere in November.
"It's exciting and it's surprising," Ms. Drury, 37, said in an interview on Monday. "When we were working on the play, I think no one really had a sense of whether or not it would be received well. I was just excited to experiment, so to have it win a prize, and going to London is sort of surreal."
"Fairview" was critically acclaimed and popular, but it is by no means a simple play. It starts as a family comedy, about an extended black family preparing for the grandmother's birthday dinner. But, the New York Times co-chief theater critic Ben Brantley wrote, it moves into unexpected and uncomfortable territory: "And then abruptly you're free-falling down a rabbit hole, and there's no safe landing in sight,." (He also called the play "dazzling" and "extraordinary").

Along with Ms. Drury, nine finalists for the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize were honored and received $5,000 each. Among the finalists for this year's prize was Lily Padilla, for her play "How to Defend Yourself." Last week, Ms. Padilla won the Yale Drama Series Prize for that play.
Past winners of the Blackburn Prize have included Sarah Ruhl, Annie Baker and Wendy Wasserstein. Last year, Alice Birch won for her play "Anatomy of a Suicide."
Ms. Drury's latest play, "Marys Seacole" opened last week at Claire Tow Theater in a Lincoln Center production. "It has been a really exciting and slightly intense year," she said. "I've never worked on two things so close together, so it will be exciting to take a moment and spend some time reading and thinking."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: President Trump’s second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un last week was criticized by both parties in Washington long before Air Force One even touched down in Hanoi. Washington’s political class seemed terrified that the nearly 70 year state of “war” with North Korea might actually end. In the end the only positive thing they could say about the meeting was that Trump apparently walked away with nothing to show for it.
The location of the meeting – Hanoi, Vietnam – serves as a great example of what can be won in peace versus what is lost in war. After losing nearly 60,000 US service members in an unnecessary war that took a million Vietnamese lives, the US loss of the Vietnam war resulted not in a communist takeover of southeast Asia but something very different: the domino theory failed because communism was destined to fail. Now we are close trading partners with an increasingly pro-market Vietnam. The result of trade and exchange versus war is a better life for all.
Unfortunately for Washington, the real lesson of Vietnam has not been learned. That is why the Republicans, Democrats, and the entire mainstream media spoke as one against President Trump’s decision to take a bold step and actually meet again, one-on-one, with one of our “enemies” to see if we can avoid nuclear conflict.
One leading Democrat, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), attacked Trump for meeting with Kim because speaking to the North Korean “gives him legitimacy.” Does it make any sense that we should not even speak with our nuclear-armed adversaries because it gives them “legitimacy”? He’d rather have a nuclear war as long as Kim remains “illegitimate”? This is sadly the kind of thinking that prevails in Washington.
The media reported that Trump walked away from the meeting before the scheduled signing ceremony and closing press event. The talks broke down, it was reported, because Kim demanded an end to all sanctions before any reduction in North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. Washington sighed with relief and said all together, “better no deal than a bad deal.”
Meanwhile the North Koreans held a rare press conference clarifying that they only asked for partial sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling one of their main nuclear facilities. Further, press reports began to surface that National Security Advisor John Bolton threw additional demands on the table which led Kim to draw the meeting to an early close.
Who’s telling the truth? We likely won’t know. But given Bolton’s strong opposition to any kind of peace agreement with North Korea it’s hard to doubt that he had something to do with the blow-up of the summit. As the New York Times reported over the weekend, while Trump’s advisors were shocked when he decided to meet Kim face-to-face the first time for negotiations, John Bolton wasn’t worried at all. As the Times writes, “Mr. Bolton told colleagues not to worry. The negotiations, he said, would collapse on their own.” And so they did.
Will Trump continue to allow his diplomatic efforts to be undermined by his own staff? Let’s hope the president will ignore Washington, ignore the neocons, and continue to work for peace with North Korea.

Rampell: The biggest lesson from Michael Cohen’s explosive testimony

Texto completo: There were lots of takeaways from Michael Cohen’s explosive congressional testimony this week: about Russia, racism, redemption.
To me, the biggest lesson was that we desperately need to increase the Internal Revenue Service’s budget.
Cohen, formerly President Trump’s personal lawyer, repeatedly offered accounts of not only how comfortable Trump became with cheating Uncle Sam but also how ill-equipped our tax cops were to catch him.
We heard, for instance, Cohen’s story about how the president used the Trump Foundation, supposedly a charitable organization, as his personal piggy bank.
According to Cohen, Trump directed him to hire a straw bidder to purchase a nine-foot painting of Trump at auction. The bidder was then reimbursed with tax-advantaged funds from the Trump Foundation. Cohen said Trump had similarly used foundation funds to buy other portraits of himself that now hang in his golf clubs, a pattern previously documented by my colleague David Fahrenthold.
Cohen also spoke about arranging a service contract for Trump to speak at the Ukrainian-American Economic Forum. At Trump’s direction, Cohen said, he had the $150,000 payment for these Skyped-in remarks made to the Trump Foundation instead of to Trump directly.
Having payment for a service made to a foundation rather than to the provider of the service, apparently to allow the provider to evade taxes, “seems like outright tax fraud,” said University of California at Irvine law professor Omri Marian.
Further questioning from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., addressed a New York Times report about the Trump family’s use of dubious or outright fraudulent schemes to duck taxes on Fred Trump’s estate. And, of course, Republicans hammered Cohen about Cohen’s (BEG ITAL)own(END ITAL) tax misdeeds; as part of his plea agreement, Cohen pleaded guilty to tax fraud. Trump has said he has “brilliantly” used the tax laws to his advantage, but has repeatedly denied any lawbreaking.
Many of Trump’s (and his associates’) alleged attempts to evade the taxman -- with the evidence often hanging in broad daylight, as it were, in his clubs -- were astoundingly brazen. That may partly just reflect who Trump is. But it also may reflect Trump’s (accurate) assessment of just how outgunned the taxman has become.
Cohen again: “When telling me in 2008 or 2009 that he was cutting employee salaries in half, including mine, he showed me what he claimed was a $10 million IRS tax refund, and he said that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving ‘someone like him’ that much money back.”
When asked why Trump was reluctant to release his tax returns, Cohen suggested that Trump feared that if anyone had the expertise and bandwidth to go through his tax filings, they’d probably find something fishy.
“What he didn’t want was to have an entire group of think tanks that are tax experts run through his tax return and start ripping it to pieces, and then he’ll end up in an audit and he’ll ultimately have tax -- taxable consequences, penalties and so on,” Cohen explained.
If true, that statement (that Trump feared an audit) would undercut Trump’s sorry excuse for not releasing his returns (that he was (BEG ITAL)already(END ITAL) under audit). But it would also reflect a grim reality: IRS enforcement activity has indeed loosened over the years, especially when it comes to the ultra-wealthy.
Since fiscal 2011, the audit rate for large corporations (with at least $10 million in assets) has halved. For households with income of more than $1 million, it has declined by two-thirds, according to IRS data.
Likewise, federal prosecutions referred by the IRS have plunged to their lowest level on record, according to data from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. In fact, adjusted for population size, IRS-referred prosecutions are just a (BEG ITAL)quarter(END ITAL) of their early-’90s peak.
Tax cheating by the wealthy is not costless. When they shirk, it just means law-abiding suckers -- aka Leona Helmsley’s “little people” -- have to pay more to make up for the shortfall.
So why has enforcement fallen? Why have people such as Trump -- and Cohen, Paul Manafort and others with major red flags -- been so confident their taxes won’t be scrutinized? It’s not because the “deep state” wants to go easy on well-heeled tax cheats.
It’s that our policymakers have systematically hobbled the IRS. Congress has given the agency more responsibilities while simultaneously slashing its resources. IRS staffing for key enforcement occupations has shrunk by about a third over the past six years.
That’s bad news if you care about fiscal responsibility, since the IRS brings in several dollars for every dollar it spends. It’s also bad news if you care about catching bad actors.

Yarmuth: 'Perpetual bind' for McConnell

Texto completo: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will be in a tough spot politically over the next two weeks due to the White House's demand for a wall at the southern border.
House Democrats easily approved a resolution last Tuesday to terminate President Donald Trump's emergency declaration to free up money for additional barriers.
McConnell, who oversees the Republican-controlled Senate, can't ignore the measure because it is part of the National Emergencies Act, which means it has to be voted upon by the upper chamber within 18 calendar days.
McConnell's office bypassed a request for an interview, and pointed to a previous statement describing Trump's declaration as a "predictable and understandable consequence" of Democrats refusing to fully fund the border wall.
But in an interview with The New York Times Magazine, McConnell said he hoped Trump didn't "go down that path" to secure the border.
"Mitch is going to be in a perpetual bind," said U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., who voted for the House resolution. "He's going to face the choice of forcing his members to take some potentially dangerous votes or be accused of obstructing popular policies."
Yarmuth said it is "paramount" that Congress assert its authority to control U.S. purse strings, and a handful of Republicans, including Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., agreed. Massie was one of 13 GOP lawmakers who supported the resolution on constitutional grounds.
Trump has vowed a veto, and it is unlikely that Congress has the votes to overturn the president's powerful pen. But the resolution still presents a problem for McConnell and his 53-member GOP caucus.
"Trump's divisive role in today's politics makes Mitch McConnell's job holding together the Republican caucus much harder," said Stephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky.
Some Senate Republicans have said they are uncomfortable with Trump using a national emergency to get funding for his wall. Others expressed concern that if Trump is successful, a future Democratic president could use the same lever on gun control or climate change.
GOP senators must weigh whether standing against executive overreach is worth crossing a president who remains popular in red states like Kentucky.
"As of the moment, I couldn't handicap the outcome of the vote," McConnell told reporters in Washington. "All I can tell you is it certainly will occur."
Trump made the emergency declaration after Congress allocated $1.3 billion for the wall, much less than the $5.7 billion he demanded. The fight over wall funding was at the center of a historic 35-day federal government shutdown.
White House officials have said the emergency declaration and other budget maneuvers will free up to $6.6 billion, which would build at least 234 miles of border wall.
At issue is whether Trump has the authority to divert funding that has been allocated by Congress. The decision is likely to draw several legal challenges in federal court. Sixteen states already filed a lawsuit over Trump's emergency declaration, arguing it exceeds a president's constitutional authority.
It is a legal question that McConnell wasn't able to answer when asked about the declaration's legality this past week.
"I haven't reached a total conclusion," he said. "I wouldn't go to me ... I did go to law school, but we had some real serious lawyers in there discussing that very issue."
Voss, the political science professor, said the symbolic nature of the Democratic resolution is meant to draw a contrast with Republicans. It also brings attention to GOP senators still on the fence and who are likely to be running in tight elections in 2020.
But Trump's vow of a veto might give McConnell a way out if he can't secure the necessary votes to block the resolution.
"I'm not convinced that McConnell is obligated to stop the resolution from going to the president's desk," Voss said. "He can allow members of his caucus to go one way or another based on the politics of their home states. Some will know it's better to vote for it, some will know it's better to vote against it, and that's how you hold your majority together next election time."

Texto completo: A six-part drama series wraps up on TNT. And a new special about a Michael Jackson documentary is on HBO.
What's on TV
I AM THE NIGHT 9 p.m. on TNT. This mini-series draws from the life of Fauna Hodel, an author who, after learning she was adopted by African-American parents, discovered that one of her grandfathers was George Hodel, a prime suspect in the unsolved Black Dahlia murder of 1947. But the rest of the story is largely fiction, and "the result is a bland hodgepodge," Mike Hale wrote in his review in The New York Times. Chris Pine, as Jay, a journalist who clings to Fauna (India Eisley) for his own reporting, may be the show's strongest asset. In this series finale, the Watts riots erupt in Los Angeles as Jay sits in a cell and Fauna desperately searches for a way home.
AMERICA'S HIDDEN STORIES 8 p.m. on Smithsonian. The Smithsonian channel claims to shed new light on pivotal moments of American history with this series. In the first episode, scholars scour old documents and use 3-D computer mapping techniques to uncover the site of the 17th-century Salem witch trial hangings. Later episodes highlight the Spanish influenza of 1918, the treason of Benedict Arnold and a spy ring involved in the Pearl Harbor attack.
INSIDE MY HEART (2018) 9 p.m. on Starz. For nearly three years, the photojournalist and director Debra Kellner filmed three families that fled war-torn Syria and Afghanistan for safer lives elsewhere. In this touching documentary, we see the families take risky journeys, contemplating sacrifices made and the future that awaits. One refugee only looks forward and defiantly declares, "Going back is no longer an option."
OPRAH WINFREY PRESENTS: AFTER NEVERLAND (2019) 10 p.m. on OWN and HBO; streaming on HBO platforms. This special follows the second half of the HBO documentary "Leaving Neverland," in which Wade Robson and James Safechuck accuse Michael Jackson of abusing them from childhood into adolescence. In a recent interview with CBS, Robson said of Jackson, "I find it hard to believe that he had boys around for any other reason than to sexually abuse them." Here, Oprah Winfrey unpacks the film with Robson, Safechuck and the director Dan Reed in front of an audience of survivors of sexual abuse.
What's Streaming
EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990) Stream on Amazon or Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. This "Beauty and the Beast"-like fantasy drama is the first onscreen collaboration between Tim Burton and his favorite eccentric, Johnny Depp. Depp stars as the title character, a man-made creation whose inventor died before giving him human hands (hence the name). After years of isolation, Edward is discovered by a saleswoman who invites him to stay with her family in their suburban neighborhood. His shears initially frighten the residents, then he finds his place as a coveted hairstylist. But trouble begins when a teenager (Winona Ryder) falls for the innocent man behind Edward's pale skin and lethal fingers.

Texto completo: After nearly 20 years, Tyler Perry is making his final appearances as Madea onscreen, in "A Madea Family Funeral," beginning March 1, and onstage in "Madea's Farewell Tour" running through May.
When I was a kid, my mother, Maxine, would take me into the projects in New Orleans for her regular Friday night card game. This was no bridge game with a table of proper ladies - this was an apartment full of sharp-witted, drinking, cussing, smoking, strong, irreverent but caring women. I can clearly remember sitting on the concrete floor, choking from the smoke and covering my ears from the loud laughter and blasting blues music. Every now and again I would listen to these women talk about the woes in their lives and relationships, but no sooner had sadness entered the room than one of them would make a joke and the laughter would start all over again.
Looking back on this now, I realize that I was in a master class and my 6-year-old brain was soaking it all in. It was in those moments that I learned that laughter can stand arm in arm with agony.
Later when my mother and I were home, and my father would fly off into his usual fits of abusive rage, I quickly used my newfound tactics on my mother. After he left the room, I would walk in and imitate her and those card-playing women, and eventually she'd laugh. That laugh was medicine for my young soul.
Now I look back on a lot of my early writing and I feel that I was subconsciously talking to my mother. I was carrying her and those beautiful, powerful, strong Black women in my spirit. And much to the dismay of my critics, I'm pretty sure that this is how and why I started putting very serious subject matter right alongside humor in my work. I knew that my audience was full of women like the ones that I loved so much growing up.
To that end, when I first did the tough-talking, truth-telling Madea at the Regal Theater in Chicago almost 20 years ago, I had no idea that imitating my mother would end up bringing joy to millions of people around the world. I thought I was just an actor donning a costume to entertain in a live comedic play. Most of the show was full of over-the-top jokes that brought lots of laughter, but around the last 30 minutes something happened. Madea got the opportunity to riff about pain and heartache, forgiveness, and God and faith. When I got to those life lessons, something happened. There was utter silence in the theaters, and it became so clear to me that the audience was hanging on her every word.
I understood very early on that this mostly blue-collar African-American audience was feeling inspired. They were getting answers to a lot of what was going on in our community that no one was talking about. I was blown away that somehow this ridiculous-looking 6-foot-6 guy in a dress had found a way to do for this audience the same thing that I had done for my mother. I could lift them with humor and use that laughter as an anesthetic and talk about really deep, sensitive issues that were destroying so many of us - things like rape and molestation and the inability to forgive.
This was further confirmed when I started receiving messages like "Madea did in two hours what my family hasn't been able to do in 12 years - convince my sister to finally leave an abusive relationship." I understood then how important it was to continue in the rawness of what I had created. To continue speaking a language that was a shorthand my audience and I understood. To continue to break all the traditional rules of storytelling.
If these strong, nurturing Black women from my childhood knew that their stories and strengths had inspired me to pay homage to them and that this loving tribute had moved, helped and lifted people all around the world, they would be so proud.
For these reasons, I wrestled for a while with the question of the right time to end the character. But then I thought - this is the year I'm turning 50. There's much more I want to do, so many more stories I want to tell and more roles I want to play. I was thrilled to be Colin Powell in "Vice" and Tanner Bolt in "Gone Girl," and I'm looking forward to more opportunities like those. But that old broad has been good to me, so who knows - maybe one day I'll tell the story of Madea in the '70s and hire a real actress to play the role. But the time of playing her has come to an end.
I have to say it's very evident that the audience is not ready to say goodbye to her either: 25,000 to 30,000 people still show up every week to the Madea Farewell Play tour. And as always, the last half-hour of the show is the only time I don't feel ridiculous in that dress, because I'm doing what the character was created to do.
I recently got a call from Oprah telling me that the girls at her school in South Africa were talking about the lessons Madea taught them in my movies and plays, lessons like self-esteem, respecting yourself, and staying strong. I'll admit that my resolve to let Madea go wavered again, but even with those wonderful words of inspiration, I feel that it's time.
It has always and will always be my hope that something this character has done or said has made someone's life better. And that some little child who is sitting on the floor with their mother in pain can play one of these movies or shows and they both can smile together. She's been that for me and I hope she continues to be that for the world.

YANGSZE CHOO'S NIGHT TIGER' MERGES TWO MALAYSIAN TALES

Texto completo: To read a novel by Palo Alto author Yangsze Choo is to enter a provocative other world swirled by mysticism, Chinese folklore, dreams, fantasy, mystery and romance. A vigorous researcher, Choo populates swift-moving narratives with multigenerational characters whose vulnerabilities, flaws and strengths cast broad, entirely believable human rainbows. Remarkably, her storytelling achieves a now/then duality with prescient, future-driven plots also rich in historic, culturally accurate details.
The New York Times best-selling writer's second book, "The Night Tiger" (Flatiron Books, $26.99), follows Choo's well-received 2013 debut, "The Ghost Bride." The new novel centers on the search for the owner of a corroded, severed finger suspended in a vial and on five characters whose lives interweave in 1930's colonial Malaysia. Mysterious deaths, man-eating tigers, tension between classes, gender inequities and more are revealed in two protagonists' alternating voices: 11-year-old houseboy Ren's experience unfurls in third person present; Ji Lin, a dressmaker's apprentice who secretly works as a dancehall girl to pay off her mother's debts, springs to life in first person, past tense.
"I thought that by using both voices, it would bring them closer to the reader," says Choo, 45, in an interview. Choo also adheres to strict principles of her own: "Entering a book is like entering a dream you must sustain for the reader. Historical fiction, it must feel rooted in the right time. I wrote the two novels about places I'd been to. I must know how hot it feels, the smell of the rain. I went to towns to check distances; learned what people were eating and thinking in the 1930s from microfiche newspaper archives in the national library in Singapore. There's a slightly swimmy feeling if you read, and that kind of thing is not right."
Choo is a fourth-generation Malaysian of Chinese descent whose father's career as a diplomat gave her a peripatetic childhood. Raised in Thailand, Germany, Japan and Singapore, she graduated from Harvard University and worked as a management consultant before writing "Ghost Bride." Despite moving frequently, she recalls her family's treasured books a "traveling mini library" of Malaysian history, traveler's' first-person accounts, classic gothic English novels, Chinese comic books and National Geographic magazines. "They made me interested in animals. One about whales, it came with a plastic record in a sleeve insert. You could hear the whales. I thought it was amazing," she says.
To this day, Choo describes her greatest fear as "what I would do if there were no books to read." A favorite childhood memory involves a time when her father returned from a trip to London with a large bag of books. "My sister and I were overjoyed." Now that she reads on a phone or e-reader, she says the terror of not having a book in hand has been removed. Even so, she's never far from admired authors' latest works: Oyinkan Braithwaite's "My Sister, the Serial Killer," Haruki Murakami's "Killing Commendatore" and others. Novels with well-written, swift-moving prose or meandering narratives that sweep her to "a galaxy one over from ours" reaffirm her conviction that the best fiction feels experiential. "When Murakami describes a sandwich, I want to eat it. His books are transporting," says Choo.
If books sweep us to other worlds, they also must be emotionally and psychologically rewarding and relevant, Choo suggests. Each character in "Tiger" is flawed, but endearingly so. We believe in and feel sympathy for the orphaned Ren, whose life as a servant is far from the privileged existence of the three doctors he works for. Ji LIn's feminism is a nuanced blend of rebellion and anomalous acceptance of patriarchal systems and attitudes in the medical field and 1930s South East Asian society.
She found herself surprised by twist and turns in the plot and unexpected characters who appeared during the four years she wrote "Tiger," but Choo had already learned from her first book to cut extraneous words. "I was more mindful of word count. With two narratives, it's two books in one. It could have been chunky. I found freedom in cutting scenes I realized were boring."
She writes instinctively, always starting with a single scene. "I can only see a little down the road. At one point, Tiger' topped out at 200,000 words! The practice of figuring out what you don't need, has beauty. I much prefer the writing to pruning, but both are important."
Her first novel, "The Ghost Bride," is now being made into a Netflix series, and she is ecstatic about it. "When I saw the trailer, I was in tears. When they said they wanted to make it as a Chinese series, I felt happy, because it's more authentic. It's about the Chinese afterlife, which is like an ornate bureaucracy and a strong narrative in Chinese literature."
Although she says starting a new novel while still in the "half-life of muttering along about Night Tiger' while driving or vacuuming," she does have a first scene in mind. When she questions her ability to ever complete another novel, she gives herself the same answer as in the past. "It will just have to be written, to see where the story goes," she says,

Texto completo: A celebrity chef known for helping inspire the Jon Favreau movie "Chef" in 2014 will make his way to DMACC to give a cooking demonstration.
Roy Choi, a Korean-American chef who gained prominence as one of the founders of the gourmet food truck movement, will deliver a keynote address and cooking demonstration at the DMACC Iowa Culinary Institute.
The event takes place from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Wednesday at the DMACC West Campus, located at 5959 Grand Avenue in West Des Moines.
Choi is one of the featured speakers at the 10th annual Celebrate! Innovation Week, also known as ciWeek 10, being held Monday through Friday at the DMACC West Des Moines campus.
Choi was born in Seoul, South Korea and raised in Los Angeles, where he became fascinated with Emeril Lagasse's "Essence of Emeril show." It inspired him to enroll in culinary school.
After working as a chef in a variety of restaurants in both New York and Los Angeles, he created and co-founded the gourmet Korean taco truck, Kogi.
Choi was named one of the top ten "Best New Chefs" of 2010 by Food and Wine magazine, and Time magazine included him in their TIME 100 list of the most influential people in the world for both 2011 and 2016.
At the time, fellow chef Anthony Bourdain wrote that "Roy Choi first changed the world when he elevated the food-truck concept from 'roach coach' to highly sought-after, ultra-hot-yet-democratic rolling restaurant."
Working as a technical advisor to actor and filmmaker Jon Favreau on the set of "Chef," Favreau toured and trained in several of Choi's restaurants and kitchens, and Choi oversaw cooking and restaurant scenes. Choi appears in the end credits.
Choi's cookbook and memoir "L.A. Son: My Life, My City, My Food" was a New York Times bestseller in 2013, and his restaurant, Locol, received the first-ever LA Times Restaurant of the Year Award in 2017.

No Charges for Police in Fatal Shooting

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- Two Sacramento police officers who shot and killed an unarmed black man in his grandmother's backyard last year will not face criminal prosecution, the Sacramento County district attorney announced on Saturday, stirring fresh outrage in a city roiled by protests over the killing.
For nearly a year, community members and activists have demanded police accountability for the death of Stephon Clark, 22, who was killed last March by Officers Terrence Mercadal and Jared Robinet. The officers had been dispatched to investigate a routine vandalism complaint. Within 10 minutes of their arrival, after a brief pursuit, Mr. Clark was dead.
The shooting touched off waves of protests in Sacramento that shut down busy streets, disrupted sporting events and overtook City Council meetings. Mr. Clark's death took on national significance amid continuing tensions over discriminatory policing in black neighborhoods and excessive use of force by police officers.
"Was a crime committed? There's no question that a human being died," District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert said on Saturday in Sacramento. "But when we look at the facts and the law, and we follow our ethical responsibilities, the answer to that question is no. And as a result, we will not charge these officers."
Ms. Schubert said the officers had probable cause to stop and detain Mr. Clark. She added that police officers are legally justified in using deadly force "if the officer honestly and reasonably believes" he is in danger of death or injury.
"We must recognize that they are often forced to make split-second decisions," she said. "We must also recognize that they are under tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving circumstances."
The officers fired their weapons 20 times in Mr. Clark's direction within seconds of turning a blind corner. "Both officers believed that he was pointing a gun at them," Ms. Schubert said. She added that police video showed Mr. Clark was "advancing" on the officers.
Mr. Clark was later found to be unarmed; his cellphone was found under his body.
An autopsy released by the Sacramento County Coroner's Office in May found at least seven bullets had hit Mr. Clark.
A comprehensive analysis of police video footage by The New York Times found that gunfire continued after Mr. Clark had fallen to his hands and knees. Six of the seven shots most likely hit Mr. Clark as he was falling or was already on the ground, according to The Times's analysis. Three minutes passed after the shooting before police officers identified themselves to Mr. Clark, and he did not receive medical attention for six minutes.
Black activists have expressed long-simmering frustrations about how their neighborhoods have been policed by the Sacramento Police Department and the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department.
After the shooting, the Sacramento Police Department sought to swiftly quell public outrage. The department released body camera footage within days of the shooting. Daniel Hahn, the city's first black police chief, reiterated that the department required training related to race-based discrimination and de-escalation tactics. The next month, the Sacramento Police Department issued new guidance about when officers can mute their body cameras.
In July, the department also instated a foot-pursuit policy that instructs officers to weigh "whether the need for apprehension justifies the risk to the safety of the officer(s), the public, and the fleeing suspect."
Mr. Hahn and the department have not commented on Officer Mercadal and Officer Robinet's actions specifically. The department did not return a request for comment on Saturday.
Timothy Davis, the president of the Sacramento Police Officers Association, said in a statement on Saturday that the case had seen unprecedented levels of transparency and oversight.
"Officers have faced volatile life-and-death situations since the inception of policing," Mr. Davis said. "The officers in this case were clearly afraid for their life, and were legally justified in their use of force. We will continue to review our policies and procedures to find ways to reduce tragic outcomes in the future."
In January, Mr. Clark's family filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the City of Sacramento and the two officers.
During her presentation, Ms. Schubert noted that Mr. Clark had been accused of domestic violence days before his death. A review of his cellphone, conducted by the California Department of Justice, found text messages suggesting a tense relationship between Mr. Clark and the mother of one of his children.
The review also found that he had researched how to commit suicide, she said.
"All of this shows us that many things were weighing heavily" on Mr. Clark on the day of his death, Ms. Schubert said. She added that the facts were uncomfortable but relevant to her legal recommendation not to charge the officers because they would be relevant to a jury.
The officers, as she noted, did not know any of this when they were searching the neighborhood for vandals.
But even with that rationale, the district attorney's presentation did not sit well with Mr. Clark's family.
During a news conference Saturday, Mr. Clark's mother, Sequette Clark, said "we're outraged" that the district attorney decided not to prosecute the officers. She blasted Ms. Schubert for delving into details she said were irrelevant to the officers' conduct, including personal text messages and a toxicology report showing that Mr. Clark had alcohol, codeine, marijuana, cocaine and Xanax in his system.
"She wants to go on a smear campaign on his character and his actions," Ms. Clark said. "That is not a permit to kill him."
She said Mr. Clark's killing should have resulted in charges.
"I'm disgusted and it's disrespectful," Tanya Faison, who leads the local Black Lives Matter group, said in a statement released on Twitter. "He was completely disrespected. The mother of his child was completely disrespected."
On Saturday, Gov. Gavin Newsom called for criminal justice reforms to improve relations between the police and "the communities they serve."
"We need to acknowledge the hard truth -- our criminal justice system treats young black and Latino men and women differently than their white counterparts," he said. "That must change."
Anticipating more protests over the announcement, Ms. Schubert sought to strike a conciliatory tone throughout her presentation.
"I don't think there's any question that people will be very upset and very angry," she said. "But I want people to understand the fact that no criminal charges will be filed in this case does not diminish in any way the tragedy, the anger, the frustration that we've heard since the time of his death."
"We cannot ignore that. Me as an elected official, as a public-facing leader, me as a human being, we cannot ignore that there is a rage in our community."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: The cancellation of the classic “To Kill a Mockingbird” at Salt Lake City’s Grand Theatre may not be the last word, after a powerful Broadway producer faced a barrage of bad publicity and had a change of heart.
Cast members of The Grand’s production were in rehearsals on Feb. 16 when they learned that the production would be dropped because of a legal dispute. Producer Scott Rudin argues licensing company Dramatic Publishing Inc. improperly agreed to allow certain regional theaters — including The Grand — to stage the 1991 stage adaptation of Harper Lee’s classic novel. Dramatic Publishing holds the rights to that version.
Rudin has had a new adaptation on Broadway since December, written by Aaron Sorkin, the creator of TV’s “The West Wing” and “The Newsroom,” and an Oscar winner for “The Social Network.”
The Grand was one of at least eight regional theaters that were mounting productions of the 1991 version and had received letters from Rudin’s lawyers threatening expensive legal action if they didn’t cancel their productions. The Grand and several others, without the funds for a legal battle, decided to cancel.
On Friday, Rudin — facing bad publicity, an online boycott threat, and a story about the controversy on the front page of The New York Times — relented. Rudin made a stunning offer: The regional theaters that received his lawyers’ letters could produce “To Kill a Mockingbird,” with the new Sorkin script, without a fee.
Some of the theater companies — given a rare chance to stage a play that’s still on Broadway — are taking Rudin up on the offer, or contemplating it, The Times reported Friday. The Grand, for now, isn’t one of them.
Seth Miller, The Grand’s executive artistic director, told The Times it was too late to mount a new version of the play for the scheduled opening of March 21. Miller would like to try next season, but he’s not sure if Rudin’s offer would still be available then.
Miller told The Times that The Grand was going to lose about $20,000 because of the cancellation. The Grand has extended the run of its current play, the romantic musical “First Date,” to March 16, to recoup some of that money.

Texto completo: Headnote Who Knew'?
STORIES THAT WILL MAKE YOU SAY, "WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT."
On March 16, 1957, in celebration of St. Patrick's Day, parade bands on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue blared classic Irish tunes, while marchers carried American and Irish flags. The scene was, according to The New York Times, a "musical river of green filled with thousands of merry lads and lasses." Fueling the excitement, the lord mayor of Dublin, Robert Briscoe, had just arrived from Ireland, reportedly on a plane piloted by his own son.
Briscoe was the ultimate Irishman, an Irish Republican Army gunrunner turned popular legislator with a hearty sense of humor. But the lord mayor was also Jewish. And in the United States he would be spending time among both the Irish and Jewish diasporas, promoting tourism to Ireland while fundraising for the United Jewish Appeal. "It will take a bit of doing to satisfy both groups," the New York Herald Tribune remarked.
The concept of an Irish Jew was captivating. Throughout the celebrations, Briscoe stood alongside then-New York City mayor Robert Wagner and joked about how his dual identity might make him a formidable New York mayoral candidate. The city's rabbis debated whether parade marching was shomer Shabbos.
Briscoe's parents, like the ancestors of many of Ireland's 5,000 Jews, had emigrated from Lithuania in the second half of the 19th century. As a young man, Briscoe worked alongside the nationalist group Sinn Fein and the early IRA. Those politics brought Briscoe to New York for the first time in 1922. Then, at the height of the Irish Civil War, he helped orchestrate an occupation of New York City's Irish Consulate, in an unsuccessful protest against the treaty that served to keep Ireland within the British Empire until 1949.
He eventually returned to Ireland, and in 1927 he joined the country's legislature as a representative from Dublin. While in office, Briscoe became more active in Zionist organizing and fundraising. During World War II he publicly campaigned for the formation of a Jewish army to fight Hitler.
But on the global stage, Briscoe went mostly unnoticed until June 1956, when foreign newspapers declared the surprising news that the overwhelmingly Catholic country of Ireland had just produced a Jewish lord mayor of Dublin. He would be the first Jew to fill the position (technically, the Irish Jew Lewis Wormser Harris was the first elected, in 1876, but he died before beginning his duties). People in America took notice of Briscoe's new office (Yogi Berra opined "Only in America!"). In July, Michael Mann, head of the Irish Jewish Club of the Midwest, arrived in Dublin to personally deliver Briscoe's invitation to head the New York St. Patrick's Day parade.
Americans loved him. He was a guest on the TV game show "What's My Line?" In June 1957, CBS aired a biopic starring Art Carney as Briscoe. In Cincinnati, Briscoe raised $25,000 and Mayor Charles Taft, proclaimed a "Robert Briscoe Day."
"[Briscoe] was all the things Irishmen are famous for: He was jovial, fun, enjoyed a drink and being with people. These were not things Jews were famous for," said the University of Florida professor Rachel Gordan, who studies American Jews in the post-World War II period. "He was a real Irish patriot, and he was an Orthodox Jew. That was such an usual combination, and it sort of reminded Americans that they're not the only ones who do this religious tolerance thing."
During his tour, Briscoe was frequently asked about anti-Semitism. He often cited his own election as evidence of Ireland's tolerance. His cheery presentation at times ignored the fact that some Irish politicians and conservative Catholic leaders had evoked anti-Semitic views. And, despite advocacy from Ireland's Jewish leadership - including Briscoe himself - the country accepted relatively few Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis.
In Ireland, Briscoe's tour was deemed a success. He reportedly raised tens of millions of dollars. In June 1957, New York's Irish tourist office reported that travel requests had jumped 20% since the previous month. The chief rabbi of Ireland, Immanuel Jakobovits, was also inspired to tour North America.
Briscoe was not re-elected to his post the following year, though he returned to the position in 1961. He also remained in the legislature and continued to visit the U.S. throughout his life. In March 1962, the Jewish lord mayor's American tours brought him to the White House to meet America's first Catholic president.
"Everybody in Ireland, I think, has invited your president to come visit not Dublin, but the whole of Ireland," he told reporters that day. "We'd be very happy to be able to cheer your president in our country, the country of his descent."

Who's Afraid of Amy Klobuchar? Former aides claim the Minnesota senator is a difficult boss. But are we too tough on tough leaders?

Texto completo: After declaring her candidacy for president in a howling blizzard on an 18-degree day, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar probably assumed the next storm she'd face would be something less dramatic, maybe a rigorous public vetting of her legislative record.
Instead, the forecast got worse. Several of her former Senate aides gave anonymous interviews in which they accused her of being a demanding, disrespectful and demeaning boss—the kind who flings binders across the room in fits of pique.
To bolster their claims, they cited figures that suggest her employee turnover rate is among the highest in the Senate.
Some of these unnamed critics also said nice things, and several of Sen. Klobuchar's current staffers spoke in her defense. She later addressed the reports at a CNN town hall event. "You have to know that I love my staff," she said. "Am I a tough boss sometimes? Yes. Have I pushed people too hard? Yes. But I have kept expectations for myself that are very high. I've asked my staff to meet those same expectations."
Some people thought this unconventional line of criticism, rarely directed at male senators, reeked of sexism. Maybe so. For me, one of the strangest angles of the story came from another set of Congressional data nobody mentioned.
In a five-year period from 2014 to 2018, according to GovTrack.us , Sen. Klobuchar's allegedly browbeaten staff helped her co-sponsor 1,967 bills—more than any other senator except Connecticut's Richard Blumenthal. Another study, conducted in 2016, ranked her No. 1 in the Senate in lending her name to bills that were enacted into law. Perhaps her former staffers wouldn't have become so disgruntled if they'd gotten more sleep.
Another factor that hasn't been thoroughly explored is something Sen. Klobuchar flicked at on CNN. Before winning her first election in 1998, she spent 14 years in the private sector managing teams at law firms. If she learned about leadership in a rough-and-tumble corporate performance culture, it's probably safe to assume that she runs her Senate shop a bit differently than a career politician.
Most young Senate staffers don't arrive on Capitol Hill with vast experience inside hard-driving businesses. In that context, I'm not sure a boss who once ripped her staff for giving her a salad to eat on a plane without a fork, as the New York Times reported , or remarked one day at the Capitol that she'd happily trade three of them for a bottle of water, would seem unusual enough to single out.
A spokeswoman for Sen. Klobuchar declined to comment.
In any event, these allegations should not be dismissed. The sheer number of anecdotes raises the possibility that there are even more to come. They're also timely: In the wake of the #MeToo movement, the business world has been agonizing over toxic workplaces and gargoyle bosses, and many executives have been subjected to harsh public reviews . Whether or not Sen. Klobuchar deserves this, one thing is certain: Too many bosses treat employees like dirt, and it's time we started thinning the herd.
This, of course, is easier said than done.
Before deciding where the future line should be drawn, it's worth exploring a nagging question. Are difficult bosses more likely to succeed, or inevitably doomed to fail?
There's no question that every so often a demanding, even belittling boss will possess enough raw leadership talent to achieve outsize results. Apple's Steve Jobs, who famously lit into employees, reducing some to tears, generated profits hand over fist. It's hard to argue that these unicorns should be discarded.
At the same time, it's often difficult to distinguish between a "tough" boss and an outright abusive one. The best yardstick, according to Stanford University professor Robert Sutton, author of "The No-Asshole Rule: Building a Civilized Workplace and Surviving One That Isn't," is a leader's emotional impact on others. On that front, he says, research overwhelmingly suggests that bullied workers suffer greatly.
They're more likely to quit and call in sick, and to battle depression and anxiety. They're less liable to challenge the boss, point out errors, tell the truth, take risks or go the extra mile. "There might be some exceptions," Dr. Sutton says, "but you have to look at the weight of the evidence."
Another question is how often mistreated employees will themselves become abusive managers. There's plenty of evidence that churlish behavior is contagious, but a recent study on this topic in the Journal of Applied Psychology yielded a surprising result.
Sometimes, the authors found, workers respond to an abusive boss by resolving to do better. In fact, they'll go to great lengths to show subordinates that they're nothing like the ogre upstairs. By reframing their experience and trying to prevent it from infecting their own behavior, they become better leaders.
In other words, bad bosses often fail and inflict emotional damage along the way, but they're not always a virus that spreads.
The final question is whether there's any version of gladiatorial leadership that's worth tolerating.
Nearly all managers, at some point, "are going to have episodes that others perceive as bad behavior," Dr. Sutton says. Yelling at people all the time isn't good, but "there are times when a strategic temper tantrum works." If constructive conflict is the hallmark of any great team, then occasionally dressing someone down, especially if they're not accustomed to it, can have a strong motivating effect.
The problem with prosecuting individual cases of bad behavior is that it may force an overcorrection. If we criminalize toughness, Dr. Sutton says, people might start to view the most benign criticism as a personal attack.
There's some evidence that we're already headed down that road. Many companies are softening their approach to employees; offering perks, conducting frequent satisfaction surveys and focusing on "engagement." Some firms have tried to expunge the unbending "pay-your-dues" cultures of the past. As I wrote in November, some prominent companies have avoided chief executives with big personalities and sharp elbows in favor of unassuming, low-key managers in the mold of Mr. Rogers.
In my view, personality is overrated. Human beings are born with different temperaments: some burn hot, others run cool. But the instincts that make people extraordinary leaders are randomly distributed.
Sen. Klobuchar is clearly wired to be a demanding boss. It's also possible that the spotlight of the presidential campaign will reveal her to be a genuinely defective one. Either way, she's likely to lose some employees. Trust and loyalty are fragile, and a single ugly episode can shatter them forever.
The important question for voters to ponder is whether Sen. Klobuchar's management style is unacceptable, or whether it generally falls inside the range of what's tolerable for most people. If the former is true, she shouldn't be elected. If it's the latter, however, there's a strong argument for letting her be.
A time then when good leaders are hard to find is a terrible moment to toss out every candidate on the aggressive side of the spectrum.

Texto completo: Rags-to-riches gangster films flooded the market in the early 1930s. But few were as briskly cynical as "Quick Millions" (1931).
The movie was directed by Rowland Brown, a onetime reporter, from a script he wrote with another newsman, Courtenay Terrett, the author of "Only Saps Work: A Ballyhoo for Racketeering." It is screening three times in March at the Museum of Modern Art as part of the series "William Fox Presents: More Restorations and Rediscoveries from the Fox Film Corporation."
"Quick Millions" is as fast as it is flavorsome. Slang flies. Not one scene is held too long; the movie often suggests a succession of staged tabloid photos.
Spencer Tracy, in his second feature, stars as "Bugs" Raymond, a shrewd, cocky roughneck who rises from working-stiff truck driver to the ruling racket boss of an unnamed Midwestern metropolis. In his first scene, he intentionally bends a limousine fender and tackles a cop. "That name 'Bugs' suits you like a punch in the nose," remarks his consort (Sally Eilers), a tough-talking moll who gives as good as she gets.
Graduating from fists to lead pipes, then to dynamite, Raymond and his partner "Nails" Markey (Warner Richmond) sell protection, corrupt unions, buy judges, shake down developers and even threaten the city's food supply. But as Raymond ascends, he falls for a debutante. The gang thinks "you're putting on the high hat," Markey warns him -- anticipating the movie's kiss-off image of a topper flung from a car.
"Quick Millions" is largely forgotten today, but it was critically well received in the 1930s. "Although cinema patrons may be surfeited with underworld tales, this particular effusion has the distinct advantage of being endowed with originality and suspense and also of being exceedingly well directed," Mordaunt Hall wrote in The New York Times. While not a hit, the movie did contribute a number of ideas to Howard Hawks's 1932 "Scarface."
Outrageous gestures abound: A hooker strikes a match off a cop's badge, and Raymond gets a quick $12,000 in petty cash out of a gang member's pocket. George Raft, anticipating his role in "Scarface," appears as Raymond's enforcer, so smooth he picks out a revolver to match his evening clothes. (Raft, a professional tango dancer before he entered movies, here enlivens a gangster party with a suave soft-shoe shimmy.)
There's no shortage of attitude. One hoodlum sneers at "laws made by lawyers for other lawyers to break." The movie stops dead for an irate district attorney to launch into a long rant regarding millionaire racketeers and big-business crime, attacking his audience, Chamber of Commerce types playing footsie with the mob, as "yellow" cowards.
Fox promoted Brown as an expert on crime who has "had frequent contact with gangster types and concededly knows more about them than any other person in motion pictures." True or not, he was an obviously talented filmmaker who apparently rubbed his bosses the wrong way. Characterized by the film historian Carlos Clarens as a "pugnacious leftist," Brown would only direct two other movies, "Hell's Highway" (1932) and "Blood Money" (1933), both in the hard-boiled crime territory he staked out with "Quick Millions."

Texto completo: MIAMI BEACH -- MIAMI BEACH -- Mitchell Kaplan remembers Lundy's market with the kosher butcher shop, Friedman's Bakery and the Art Deco synagogue down the street. He remembers the Yiddish in the air. He remembers the deli-grocery where he picked up a sesame bagel with cream cheese on the way to school.
Back then, everyone on South Beach -- the southern tip of Miami Beach -- was much older. "They were all like my grandparents," Mr. Kaplan said the other day.
It was the late 1970s, the beginning of the '80s, and South Beach was a Jewish retirement village, a tropical shtetl, some people called it, a shtetl with palm trees. "It was so Jewish, I thought everybody in the world was Jewish," said Mr. Kaplan, who grew up on South Beach, started the independent bookstore, Books & Books, and was a founder of the Miami Book Fair.
It was a world that vaporized as developers poured money into South Beach, turned it into a flashy, artsy American Riviera. Friedman's bakery is an Argentine fast-food place now. The synagogue is a museum.
But two young photographers made a project of capturing life in the South Beach shtetl and their work has been revived in a new book of photography, "Shtetl in the Sun," and a documentary film, "The Last Resort," which is being shown in theaters around the country.
"Shtetl in the Sun," is filled with photos by Andy Sweet, cherubic, always smiling, every bubbe's darling. He shot in color with a Hasselblad. His photography partner, Gary Monroe, used a Leica. He worked in black and white. In the documentary, photos, reminiscences of Mr. Kaplan and others, archival footage and video of South Beach today tell the story of the shtetl with palm trees and its passing.
The photographers developed different styles -- Mr. Sweet more casual, catching scenes as if by chance; Mr. Monroe, more meticulous, more concerned about structure. Their photographs exude warmth and empathy. They bring to mind Diane Arbus -- without the weirdness -- and Robert Frank. Mr. Sweet admired William Eggleston. Henri Cartier-Bresson and Garry Winogrand were models for Mr. Monroe, who went on to photograph around the world, write books, curate museum exhibitions and teach photography.
The camera is often looking into people's faces: Ordinary people doing ordinary things -- sitting in a folding plastic chair on an Art Deco hotel porch, walking along a sun-bleached, nearly empty boulevard.
The faces are soulful, ambiguous. Sad, but not terminally sad. Happy but not endlessly happy. Sometimes it looks like resignation, or maybe weariness, or longing. A man in a powder blue sport coat looks annoyed. "Yeah, what about it?" his tight face seems to be saying.
One black-and-white shot cuts across a man's torso and forearms, one arm scarred with a concentration camp tattoo. In another photograph, three women in a party crowd seem alone and isolated, even from each other, absorbed in grave thoughts. A little distance behind them and unawares, a man in a checked sport coat and pointed paper hat beams into the camera.
The life they were living had been decades in the making. They were working-class New Yorkers, people from other cold places, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston; Holocaust survivors. They had ended up with little money. Miami Beach had drifted out of favor with tourists. Frank Sinatra and his crew and Jackie Gleason were gone. The Art Deco hotels were getting ragged and renting for almost nothing.
But there was plenty of sunshine, and always a nice breeze riffling the palm fronds. They played cards and mah-jongg and shuffleboard on big concrete courts and danced at parties, lots of parties.
"What could be better?" says a man in an unbuttoned blue dress shirt in some vintage footage.
But people missed their families up north, their children, their grandchildren. "Fun?" one deeply tanned woman says into the video camera. "Nothing. I sit on the porch. This is my fun." A woman in a sleeveless, knit, aqua blouse says, "Some of these parents have not heard from their children in years."
The book and the film might never have been possible if not for a burst of luck after several calamities. On Oct. 16, 1982, Andy Sweet was murdered in his apartment not far from South Beach, stabbed 27 times. Three men were implicated. One went to prison. Mr. Sweet may have known them. Cocaine and sex may have been factors. "It was really never that clear," his older sister, Ellen Sweet Moss, says in the film.
Mr. Sweet's family entrusted thousands of his South Beach negatives to an art storage company. Somehow everything was lost. Then Stan Hughes, the partner of Mr. Sweet's sister, took a stack of comics one day to the family's household storage locker. As he was leaving, his eyes fell on some long, flat boxes. One label read: "Work Prints 371- 440, Roll #5."
Mr. Hughes had stumbled upon work the family hadn't known existed, hundreds of Mr. Sweet's rough work prints, contact sheets and even some big, finished prints. Many were badly faded. Mr. Hughes, who had taught animation and Photoshop to college students in Chicago, spent the next 10 years, off and on, restoring the photos. Ms. Sweet Moss put some on Facebook and, two years ago, they became the inspiration for the book and the film.
By chance, Mr. Sweet's path in life meandered close to Mr. Kaplan's. They were a year apart at Miami Beach Senior High School. Mr. Sweet was on the school newspaper. "I remember him always with a camera around his neck," Mr. Kaplan said.
Mr. Kaplan graduated from the University of Colorado. Mr. Sweet and Mr. Monroe went there for M.F.A. degrees. In 1982, a few months before Mr. Sweet's murder, Mr. Kaplan opened Books & Books. Two years later, the Book Fair debuted.
"Andy was such a talent," Mr. Kaplan said. "So many things could have been."
Brett Sokol, a contributor to The New York Times and the arts editor of Ocean Drive magazine, and Francesco Casale, a photographer and graphic designer, published "Shtetl in the Sun," at their nonprofit Letter16 Press.
Dennis Scholl, one of two directors of "The Last Resort," said he originally thought the film was going to be mostly about Andy Sweet and Gary Monroe and a little about the Jewish community on South Beach. But, he added, "the reverse turned out to be true."
The film had an initial run in New York at the turn of the year. "After the shows in New York," said Kareem Tabsch, the film's other director, "we asked people, 'How many of you have relatives who spent time in South Beach in the 1970s and early '80s?"'
"Half the audience," he said, "raised their hands."

Texto completo: As the officially designated columnist of Black History Month, it's my duty to deliver the annual report on how the month worked out. One day removed from February 2019, let me just say the obvious: It's been a helluva Black History Month.
That's not to say it's been the worst Black History Month ever. Pick any random February between 1619 and 1865, and that February will have February 2019 beat by a factor of 1,000 on the misery index for black folks.
Sure, things got a little better during Reconstruction, but February took a big nosedive during Jim Crow and didn't let up until the signing of both the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts in the mid-1960s.
When Negro History Week got upgraded to Black History Month in 1970, black folks didn't know what to do with 28 whole days to play with - 29 counting Leap Year. Somehow, we figured it out, but the results have been mixed, to say the least.
We eased into Black History Month 2019 being chased by actor Liam Neeson. The veteran Irish actor admitted during an interview for "Cold Pursuit" that many decades ago, he roamed the streets of some town for a week looking for a random "black bastard" to kill for sexually assaulting a friend.
Because no black guy wants to turn around and see the dude from "Taken" chasing him with a baseball bat, it was a pretty scary revelation. Mr. Neeson apologized for his homicidal racism and said he'd been "cured," but black folks stayed away from his new film in droves - just in case he's prone to relapses.
Meanwhile, Virginia became the blackface capital of America early last month when three of its top white officials - two Democrats (the governor and the attorney general) and one Republican (State Senate majority leader) - were discovered to have engaged in minstrelsy-by-yearbook decades ago.
Alas, Justin Fairfax, Virginia's black lieutenant governor, doesn't have much of a leg to stand on since he's been accused of sexual assault by two women. Virginia, that old cradle of the Confederacy, is still a mess, folks.
Inexplicably, international fashion behemoth Gucci thought it might be a good idea to imitate blackface with a wool balaclava turtleneck sweater - complete with big lips for the least discerning racists.
Meanwhile, down south in Alabama, Goodloe Sutton, the former publisher and editor of the Democrat-Reporter, wrote an editorial encouraging the Ku Klux Klan to clean up Washington by riding again and lynching liberals in both parties. He wasn't joking.
After being denounced by everyone, Mr. Sutton, who still owns the paper, stepped aside while Elecia Dexter, a black woman with a media background, took over publishing and editing roles. Mr. Sutton remains unrepentant, but says he will now use his free time to "chase women."
Oh, it was a rough month, indeed. A substitute teacher in North Carolina told her elementary school students that Martin Luther King wasn't assassinated, but rather killed himself. She resigned and won't be allowed to teach in the district again.
On the bright side, the NFL did settle with quarterback Colin Kaepernick over charges that he was the victim of collusion by team owners. Mr. Kaepernick was paid an undisclosed amount and assured he would probably play again next season. He took on the most powerful sports monopoly in America - and won.
One surprising political development has been the boldness with which nearly a half dozen candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination have embraced the idea of some form of reparations for slavery. Who saw this coming as an issue?
But what would February 2019 have been without a self-inflicted scandal initiated by a celebrity? "Empire" star Jussie Smollett was arrested and charged with falsely reporting a hate crime - his alleged assault early one morning by two white men shouting "MAGA." Mr. Smollett maintains his innocence and insists he's being setup, but the evidence is steadily mounting against him. The controversy has, unfairly, put activists in the black and LGBTQ+ communities on the defensive.
Meanwhile, "Green Book," a sentimental buddy flick about a bigoted white chauffeur and a cultured black musician traveling through the American South during Jim Crow, trounced far superior films to win the best picture Oscar. It also won best supporting actor for Mahershala Ali as pianist Don Shirley.
"Black Panther," which was a far better movie, didn't go away empty-handed. It won in three coveted categories - costumes, production design and movie score - and earned Marvel/Disney its first best picture nomination.
Despite the Academy's preference for politically inoffensive movies, director Spike Lee managed to score his first competitive Oscar win for the "BlacKkKlansman" screenplay. Thirty years after being snubbed for "Do the Right Thing," Mr. Lee was getting some long-belated justice.
For me, one of the highlights of February had to be Regina King's well-deserved Oscar win for her supporting role in "If Beale Street Could Talk," director Barry Jenkins' gorgeous adaptation of the James Baldwin novel. Ms. King is one of the best actresses of her generation and has been denied this honor for too long. This win will open a pathway to the roles she deserves.
With the arrest of singer R. Kelly after decades of allegedly exploiting underage girls in Chicago, February ended on a hopeful note. Yes, Michael Cohen's House Oversight testimony about the particulars of President Donald Trump's racism is stunning and depressing, but his bigotry isn't limited to February. We get to celebrate that all year.
Rep. Rashida Tlaib calling out Rep. Mark Meadows' "black woman as prop" stunt at that hearing was another February highlight. Chairman Elijah Cummings' ambivalent, world-weary facial reaction to it was the most Black History Month-thing ever.

Will we ever know who killed the Bordens?

Texto completo: Lizzie Andrew Borden is the stuff of New England legend. Acquitted in the 1892 axe murders of her father and stepmother, the woman from Fall River has been memorialized in folk rhyme, film, opera, theater, literature, and even a feminist rock musical.
In “The Trial of Lizzie Borden," Cara Robertson delves deep into the record, recounting every twist in the legal proceedings, as well as Borden's life. Drawing on transcripts, contemporaneous newspaper accounts, and newly available letters and a defense lawyer's papers, Robertson, even-handed to a fault, details the inquest, the preliminary hearing and the trial step by step.
She offers insight into the prevailing weirdness of the Borden household, with its penchant for locked doors, and mounting familial resentments. She also provides thumbnail sketches of a variety of characters, including the lawyers and the reporters covering the trial. But her mostly chronological approach is plodding and repetitive, slowing her narrative to a crawl.
Robertson began researching the case in 1990 for her Harvard undergraduate thesis. She has since earned a doctorate in English (from Oxford University) and a law degree (from Stanford), clerked at the US Supreme Court, and served as a legal adviser to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
Her legal expertise serves her well. But she's a neophyte at crafting narrative nonfiction, which demands tighter control of the material.
Robertson draws her epigraph from a prescient 1893 New York Times story that seems to predict the longstanding controversy. “There is so little absolute evidence that everybody can interpret the probabilities and circumstantial indications to suit himself," the Times suggests. “There seems to be little prospect that the mystery will be cleared up by the trial." Nevertheless, the reader is bound to hope that Robertson will supply the puzzle's missing pieces.
“The Trial of Lizzie Borden" opens with a Fall River pharmacist's account of a failed attempt by a woman he identifies as Lizzie Borden to buy prussic acid, a poison. (This incident, like many, is revisited throughout the narrative.) Then Robertson sketches the Borden ménage: Andrew, a frugal, self-made businessman; his second wife, Abby; his two grown, unmarried daughters, Emma and Lizzie; and a servant, Bridget Sullivan.
As Robertson recounts, Abby's success at persuading Andrew to help her half-sister purchase a house galled her envious stepdaughters, transforming “chilly tolerance to open animosity." Andrew's general miserliness apparently was another source of household distress. But was any of this enough to motivate murder?
On Aug. 4, 1892, Lizzie raised the first alarm, to a neighbor, about her father's slaying. In the Borden house, that neighbor and the housemaid also spotted the corpse of Abby. It was unclear how the two murders, committed about an hour and a half apart, could have been the work of a stranger — especially without Lizzie or Bridget, both of them home, spotting the intruder.
Robertson occasionally steps back from her narrative to situate Lizzie in the context of her times. Like most 19th-century middle-class women, Robertson writes, she “was relegated to unproductive marginality," all the more so because she never married and still lived in her father's house.
More inculpating than Borden's unhappiness, however, were her inconsistent accounts of her whereabouts and other details of the day of the murders. “Her stories were contradictory," Robertson reports, and “the inquest presented a damning picture," leading to Borden's arrest.
During her subsequent ordeal, the defendant was fortunate in her legal representation and key judicial rulings. She never testified at trial, where she sat “unruffled, the still center of the spectacle unfolding around her."
Press coverage was voluminous, sometimes sympathetic and often sensationalistic. Its nadir was the claim that her father had threatened to evict a pregnant Borden from their home if she did not reveal her lover's name. An “elaborate hoax," it nevertheless made its way into The Boston Globe.
Direct evidence of Borden's guilt was lacking: There were no eyewitnesses; the murder weapon was never definitively identified; and no blood was discovered on Borden herself, despite the grisly nature of the slayings. (Her burning of a dress — spattered with either paint, as she claimed, or blood — is one of the case's many mysteries.) Still, opportunity (if not clear motive), the lack of other viable suspects, and Borden's own shifting accounts pointed to her as the killer.
For the New Bedford jury, the circumstantial evidence proved insufficient. But many of Borden's acquaintances would later shun her, including her own sister. Controversial then as now, the verdict, on June 20, 1893, hardly resolved the matter of her guilt. Despite Robertson's impressive research, “The Trial of Lizzie Borden" won't either.

Texto completo: Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera integró al abogado Marc Fernich para dirigir su estrategia para solicitar ante la Corte Federal de Brooklyn un nuevo juicio, luego de que un jurado revelara que al menos cinco de sus compañeros incumplieron con las reglas del proceso.
Durante cada receso del juicio, el juez Brian Cogan recordó a las ocho mujeres y cuatro hombres que tenían prohibido revisar información sobre el caso en internet, en redes sociales y medios de comunicación, algo que varios de ellos hicieron, según revelaciones a VICE News.
Tras ello, los abogados del mexicano dieron un paso adelante, al pedir una extensión del periodo para solicitar un nuevo juicio. El juez Cogan autorizó ampliar el tiempo, pero es complicado que haya un nuevo juicio, según expertos.
“El estándar en los tribunales federales es muy estricto para la defensa” , dijo Josh Dubin , un abogado consultado por el New York Times que se especializa en asuntos relacionados con el jurado. “Tienen que demostrar que el jurado realmente fue perjudicado por la información externa a la que fueron expuestos. Una demostración de mala conducta del jurado no es suficiente” .
La defensa de Guzmán Loera no ha especificado cómo pudo afectar a su cliente que el jurado revisara información en internet, pero una de las historias que más desataron polémica fue la compra de menores por parte del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas , un tema que no fue presentado como prueba en su contra y, por tanto, no es posible utilizarlo.
Jessica Roth, exfiscal federal que ahora es profesora en la Facultad de Derecho de Cardozo en la Universidad Yeshiva, dijo que para proteger las deliberaciones del jurado, las reglas federales de evidencia limitan las circunstancias en las que un juez puede escuchar el testimonio en vivo de un jurado.
Si la defensa hace una moción para anular el veredicto, el juez Cogan podría cuestionar al jurado solo sobre la “cuestión limitada de lo que los jurados estuvieron expuestos en forma de tuits y otras información en la prensa”, dijo, pero agregó que “al jurado no se le permitiría testificar acerca de cómo esos materiales impactaron sus deliberaciones” .

Texto completo: Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera integró al abogado Marc Fernich para dirigir su estrategia para solicitar ante la Corte Federal de Brooklyn un nuevo juicio, luego de que un jurado revelara que al menos cinco de sus compañeros incumplieron con las reglas del proceso.
Durante cada receso del juicio, el juez Brian Cogan recordó a las ocho mujeres y cuatro hombres que tenían prohibido revisar información sobre el caso en internet, en redes sociales y medios de comunicación, algo que varios de ellos hicieron, según revelaciones a VICE News.
Tras ello, los abogados del mexicano dieron un paso adelante, al pedir una extensión del periodo para solicitar un nuevo juicio. El juez Cogan autorizó ampliar el tiempo, pero es complicado que haya un nuevo juicio, según expertos.
“El estándar en los tribunales federales es muy estricto para la defensa” , dijo Josh Dubin , un abogado consultado por el New York Times que se especializa en asuntos relacionados con el jurado. “Tienen que demostrar que el jurado realmente fue perjudicado por la información externa a la que fueron expuestos. Una demostración de mala conducta del jurado no es suficiente” .
La defensa de Guzmán Loera no ha especificado cómo pudo afectar a su cliente que el jurado revisara información en internet, pero una de las historias que más desataron polémica fue la compra de menores por parte del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas , un tema que no fue presentado como prueba en su contra y, por tanto, no es posible utilizarlo.
Jessica Roth, exfiscal federal que ahora es profesora en la Facultad de Derecho de Cardozo en la Universidad Yeshiva, dijo que para proteger las deliberaciones del jurado, las reglas federales de evidencia limitan las circunstancias en las que un juez puede escuchar el testimonio en vivo de un jurado.
Si la defensa hace una moción para anular el veredicto, el juez Cogan podría cuestionar al jurado solo sobre la “cuestión limitada de lo que los jurados estuvieron expuestos en forma de tuits y otras información en la prensa”, dijo, pero agregó que “al jurado no se le permitiría testificar acerca de cómo esos materiales impactaron sus deliberaciones” .

Texto completo: In 1999, Randy Parker, then a 10-year veteran of the York Daily Record, left York for what he believed was a greener pasture, accepting an assistant city position at the Dallas Morning News.
It lasted less than a year.
"The whole time I was there, it felt like I was working at somebody else's newspaper in somebody else's town," he said.
He missed York. And he missed the York Daily Record. Before the end of 1999, he was back in York, working as the Record's news editor, running the copy desk. The Record, he believed then, and still believes now, was a special place.
He had always wanted to work for the Record. While still in college, he worked summers as a correspondent, a part-time free-lancer, covering municipal government and school board meetings. After graduating from Temple University's Ambler campus, where he was editor of the school paper, he applied for a reporting job at the Record, only to be beat out by another applicant from the Baltimore Sun, a man who now works as an editor at the New York Times.
The Record was home to him.
And now, he is set to ascend to the top position in the newsroom, taking over for Jim McClure, who will retire on April 1.
He will be the executive editor of the York Daily Record/Sunday News. And as Pennsylvania state editor of the USA Today Network, he will oversee editorial operations at the newsrooms in Lebanon, Chambersburg and Hanover.
"Everything I've done in the last 35 years has led to this moment," Parker said. "I've been preparing myself for this job for the longest time. I'm as on fire for what we're doing here as I've ever been."
Except for that brief detour to Texas, Parker has spent his entire career at the Record, sticking with the paper through thick and thin, part of a management team that has created a news organization that's successfully transitioned to the digital world and that routinely wins accolades and awards from its peers.
He grew up all over the country, the son of an Air Force officer. He moved to York County in the middle of his junior year of high school, graduating in 1984 from Dallastown Area High School.
He wanted to be a reporter, and he got to be one, though by a circuitous route. He joined the Record as a copy editor in January 1989, after being turned down for the reporting job.
"You could see, 30 years ago, great promise in his leadership and journalism skills," McClure said. "It wasn't long before we gave him different challenges."
Parker had worked his way to becoming the assistant news editor, working with the news editor to manage the copy desk, an old newspaper term for the people who edited stories, wrote headlines and laid out pages.
But he wanted to be on the streets, and when the position of police reporter opened up, he applied for it, and got it.
The reporting experience had a profound impact on him. "You get to be next to people at the most important moments in their lives, whether it was the family of somebody who had been murdered or a person accused of a crime," he said. "It's an amazing honor sharing those moments with people."
Among the stories he worked on was a series of pieces about the homeless population in York. He spent weeks on the streets, talking to the homeless and living among them, once staying in a homeless shelter for a week. "That had a lifelong impact," he said.
From reporting, he was named the paper's news editor, running the copy desk and then city editor. Then, after his brief stint in Dallas, he returned to the Record as news editor and in 2004, was elevated to managing editor. More recently, as the newsroom has changed, he has served as news director, working more directly with reporters on day-to-day journalism and heading up the paper's investigative efforts.
And on April 1, he will become editor.
He balks at the phrase "dream job" and probably for good reason. It may be the culmination of his career at the Record, but it also comes with serious challenges. The news business has rapidly changed in the past decade, at least, and is facing tough financial times.
Parker believes it may be helpful that he has worked at the Record for the past three decades, 30 years marked by change and evolving ownership, from a small, privately held chain to the now management of Gannett, the nation's largest newspaper chain.
He believes that has prepared him and gives him insight as the newsroom tries to navigate journalism's roiling seas.
"In the last 15 years," McClure said, "he has been a part of everything we've done."
Those 15 years include winning numerous awards, including Newspaper of the Year from the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association four times and, an indication of how things have changed in the business, two Emmys.
Hollis Towns, Gannett's northeast region group editor and executive editor of the Asbury Park Press in New Jersey, said, "I'm really looking forward to Randy's leadership. He's done a magnificent job with Jim...and we expect nothing but continued excellence."
McClure said, "He's really more than ready. He has the journalism chops, the interest in the community, and he can articulate and communicate strategy wonderfully. He has a tremendously big heart for the community."
People who have worked with Parker can attest to that. He often becomes so passionate about people and their stories that he is moved to tears – the antithesis of the stereotypical hard-bitten, cynical journalist.
"Clearly, this is where I want to be," he said. "My trip to Dallas clarified it. This is where my heart is."
Parker, 53, lives in York Township with his wife, Jeanie. His two children, Nick, 19, and Caitlyn, 20, are both in college – Nick, a freshman at Coastal Carolina, where he plays on the baseball team, and Caitlyn at West Virginia, where she's a junior majoring in genetics.
YDR News Director Randy Parker served as MC for the York Storytellers Project "School Days" event Sept. 21 at York's Central Market.

COUNCIL TO TAKE UP MAKING PREGNANCY A PROTECTED CLASS

Texto completo: Just four weeks before her due date, Pittsburgh Councilwoman Erika Strassburger proposed amendments to the city's anti-discrimination law, calling on council to elevate pregnancy to its own protected class under an existing city ordinance.
The proposal would bar employers from discriminatory practices related to hiring, training, promotions and firing, among other actions, based on whether a woman is pregnant, and extend new rights to the woman's partner.
"This legislation expands and clarifies exactly the type of employment discrimination that is not allowed when it comes to pregnant workers anywhere in Pittsburgh," Ms. Strassburger said at a press conference Tuesday.
She was joined at the podium by representatives from the city's Human Relations Commission as well as local women's advocates.
"It's just not an opportunity, it's a legal right to choose to have a baby and to work and to live," said Kathi Elliott, CEO of Gwen's Girls, a nonprofit serving low-income girls in Allegheny County.
Pregnancy is already protected under the city's workplace anti-discrimination code but is categorized under the class of sex. Pregnancy was included in 2014 when then-Councilman Dan Gilman championed the measure. Mr. Gilman is now Mayor Bill Peduto's chief of staff.
Employment discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, sexual orientation and nine other classes is illegal in Pittsburgh. Under the proposal, the law would continue to apply to workplaces with at least five employees.
Ms. Strassburger said the city's Commission on Human Relations brought to her attention that pregnancy could become its own protected class under the city code, and she worked with the commission to develop the proposed amendment.
Being pregnant has heightened her awareness, she said, and a recent New York Times series on pregnancy discrimination in the workplace caught her attention.
Megan Stanley, the commission's deputy director, said pregnancy discrimination is "probably very underreported."
"This year we've seen more pregnancy discrimination cases than in prior years," Ms. Stanley said. "People are coming forward and saying 'You know, I'm not sure if this is discrimination, but I was told that since I'm about to have a child that maybe I don't want that promotion because maybe I wouldn't have the time for it.' Those are discriminatory statements."
Still, Ms. Stanley said, pregnancy discrimination complaints account for less than 10 percent of complaints filed.
The scrutiny of discriminatory practices under the proposed amendment would also extend to partners - without regard to gender and marital status - who need to care for pregnant partners, a provision that Ms. Strassburger characterized as "trailblazing."
"If you're a partner, and you feel you need to go to an appointment with your partner or need to spend time with a [pregnant] partner who's grieving after a miscarriage or whatever it is, you're protected under this law," she said.
The commission has explicit power to investigate discrimination complaints, Ms. Strassburger and Ms. Stanley said, and therefore the amendment would not be subject to state pre-emption. That means it might not face a court challenge, like council efforts to mandate paid sick leave, which are currently before the state Supreme Court.
"For example, we added gender identity and expression. We've added, for housing protections, survivors of domestic violence. Commissions around the country do this under home rule charters all the time," Ms. Stanley said.
While federal and state pregnancy protection laws exist, Susan Frietsche, senior staff attorney for the Women's Law Project, calls them "weak," as not all employers are included and "reasonable" accommodations for pregnant workers are not guaranteed. Federal and state bills addressing this issue "have not moved an inch," she said.
"There are a lot of gaps in the law" that the city may be able to fill, Ms. Frietsche said.
A pregnant worker would have 365 days to file a complaint with the city's human relations commission. From there, the agency would begin an investigation process.
Ms. Strassburger urged the notion of the commission as a resource.
"You can ask a question, you can get answers from the commission as to whether what you're experiencing is discrimination," she said.
The commission issued a guidance document along with Ms. Strassburger's proposed changes to the law.
Council could discuss the proposal next week.

U.S. disrupted Russian troll factory's internet during midterms

Texto completo: The U.S. military blocked internet access to a Russian entity seeking to sow discord among Americans during the 2018 midtermelections, several U.S. officials said, a warning that the group's operations against the U.S. are not cost-free.
The strike on the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, a company underwritten by an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin, was part of the first offensive cyber campaign against Russia designed to thwart attempts to interfere with a U.S. election, the officials said.
"They basically took the IRA offline," according to one individual familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information. "They shut 'em down."
The operation marked the first muscle-flexing by U.S. Cyber Command, with intelligence from the National Security Agency, under new authorities it was granted by President Donald Trump and Congress last year to bolster offensive capabilities.
Russia's tactics are evolving, and some analysts were skeptical of the deterrent value on either the Russian troll factory or on Putin, who, according to U.S. officials, ordered an "influence" campaign in 2016 to undermine faith in U.S. democracy. Officials have also assessed that the Internet Research Agency works on behalf of the Kremlin.
Cyber Command and the NSA declined to comment.
Disruption to Internet Research Agency networks took place as Americans went to the polls and a day or so afterward, as the votes were tallied, to prevent the Russians from mounting a disinformation campaign casting doubt on results, according to officials.
The blockage was so frustrating to the trolls that they complained to their system administrators about the disruption, the officials said.
The Internet Research Agency, according to federal prosecutors, is financed by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a tycoon from St. Petersburg and an ally of Putin. Prigozhin, the Internet Research Agency and a company Prigozhin runs called Concord Management and Consulting, were among 16 Russian individuals and companies that a grand jury indicted a year ago as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Another element of the Cyber Command campaign, first reported by the New York Times, involved "direct messaging" that targeted the trolls as well as hackers who work for the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. Using emails, pop-ups, text or direct messages, U.S. operatives beginning last October let the Russians know that their real names and online handles were known and they should not interfere in other nations' affairs, defense officials said.

Black history trail makes 200 stops across Massachusetts

Texto completo: MEDFORD, Mass. - During Black History Month, Massachusetts likes to point out its reputation as the enlightened 19th-century hub of the abolition movement. The state was one of the first to end slavery, long before the 13th Amendment formally banned it nationwide in 1365.
Less well known is that Massachusetts was the first to legalize slavery, in 1641. Even before then, merchants in the Massachusetts Bay Colony had enslaved Native Americans, and by 1638 were bartering them for Africans in the West Indies. The slave trade grew from there and soon became a pillar of the colonial economy.
Two professors at Tufts University, Kendra Field and Kerri Greenidge, are among the many scholars who have been tracing the history of Massachusetts' African-American residents, from slavery to Black Lives Matter.
Their research, a collaboration with students and nonprofit organizations, has evolved into what they call the African American Trail Project, a website that maps out more than 200 historic sites across the state.
They include the Royall House and Slave Quarters in Medford, the intact home of the largest slaveholders in Massachusetts and the only remaining slave quarters in the northern United States; the "Hear Us" Women's Memorial inside the Massachusetts Statehouse in Boston; and the home of abolitionist Frederick Douglass in Lynn.
"We wanted to make the history more visible and the facts accessible," Field said.
The professors sought to link these disparate people and places together so that a visitor - a tourist, student or local resident - might see them not in isolation but in historical context.
Greenidge said people often think of Boston as either "where fugitive slaves came and were 'rescued' by the abolitionists, or as the place where people were throwing bricks at Black children" during busing protests in the 1970s. (The site of protests against the Boston School Committee, at 15 Beacon St., is one of the sites.)
Their goal, the professors said, is to "complicate the narrative," to fill in gaps, show African-American people in all their dimensions and place present-day struggles for racial justice in a continuum.
Local "trails" of African-American significance have long existed. These trails, which can be walked in a few hours, include the Black Heritage Trail on Beacon Hill in Boston, a self-guided tour of anti-slavery sites in Concord, and the African American Heritage Trail at Mount Auburn Cemetery.
By contrast, the Tufts Trail Project is not a self-contained walking tour but more of a planning tool for the do-it-yourselfer, especially beyond Beacon Hill, where so much of the popular narrative has been focused. The website features a map with a bird's-eye view of most of the known sites in Massachusetts as well as further information. It allows readers to suggest new locations.
Some of the locations, like the 1806 African Meeting House on Beacon Hill, the oldest extant Black church in the country, are open year-round and offer tours; others consist of a statue, plaque or historic home; some are not open to the public; and some are not marked at all. Here are four notable sites to see.
The Royall House and Slave Quarters (Medford)
Only 35 feet separate the slave quarters from the Royall family's manor house at this one-time 500-acre farm north of Boston. A :our of the quarters and home, with their artifacts of bondage and bounty, shows how the enslaved Africans toiled to keep the manor house functioning for the wealthy Royalls.
"Where this country is in terms of racial conflict isn't by accident," Penny Outlaw, co-president of the site's board of directors, said on a recent informal tour. "There were so many antecedents in the 18th century."
After the enslaved people on the farm were freed, many had to stay on as sharecroppers to earn clothes and focd. "Black people weren't starting out owning anything," she said. "What they got was ownership of themselves"
Grave site of Harriet Jacobs IMtunt Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge)
Harriet Jacobs was born into slavery in 1813 in North Ceroina, where her mistress broke thelaw and taught her to read and white. Jacobs was later transferred to a brutal plantation owner who began to whisper foul words in my ear," she wrote. "I turned from him with disgust and hatred. But he was my master."
She described the experierce (and her shame over her involvement with a married white man) in her stunning memoir, "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Written by Herself." It appeared under a pseudonym (Linda Brent) in 1861, and was forgotten untilit was authenticated in 1981
After hiding from her master for seven years in crawl spaces, Jacobs eventually escaped and ended up in Boston, where her book, now regarded as a signifcant feminist slave narrative, was printed.
A. Phillip Randolph Statue (Back Bay Station, Boston)
After the Civil War, the Pullman Car Co. was one of the few employers hiring former slaves. The pay was terrible and conditions demeaning. All porters were called "George," after company owner George Pullman, a vestige of when enslaved people were addressed by their owner's name.
In 1925 the porters asked A, Phillip Randolph, a Harlem labor leader, to help them form a union. A decade after, the Brothernood of Sleeping Car Porters became the first Black union to sign a labor agreement with a major corporation.
A larger-than-life statue of Randolph, the union's first president, sits inside the Back Bay Station in Boston, often ignored by commuters and homeless people alike as they sprawl around it.
Among Randolph's achievements, said Larry Tye, author of "Rising From the Rails: Pullman Porters and the Making of the Black Middle Class" (2004), was getting nameplates for the porters' uniforms, so they were no longer called George.
'Faces of Dudley' Mural (Rosbury)
Mike Womble, the street artist responsible for 20 wall murals in Boston, painted this expansive piece of public art in 1995 in Roxbx'y's Dudley Square. Womble said in an interview that he wanted to pay homage to the sense of community in this largely Black neighborhood, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. marched in 1965.
All people depicted were pased on actual residents. Famous neighbors in the painting include Melnea Cess, the suffragist and civil rights activist. Anotner was Malcolm X. who lived as a teenager in Roxbury in the 1940s and appears three times in the mural - "as a pimp in a zoot suit, as a hustler and as the man he became." Womble, 45, said. "I wanted to show kids they could rise to be something Digger."

Texto completo: Michael Cohen , exabogado personal del presidente Donald Trump , planea decir todo sobre los trabajos que realizó para su jefe, especialmente aquellos relacionados con demandas e investigaciones sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
En la sesión a puerta cerrada ante el Comité de la Cámara de Representantes se espera que Cohen detalle aspectos negativos de su exjefe, como sus expresiones racistas, la forma en que acumuló su riqueza y su posible conducta delictiva, reportó New York Times.
El Times habló con una fuente familiarizada con el testimonio, quien adelantó que Cohen llevará documentos para probar sus dichos, pero también detallará experiencias personales de los alrededor de 15 años de colaboración.
Se agrega que uno de los aspectos potencialmente dañinos del testimonio de Cohen será la evidencia de una posible conducta criminal desde que Trump asumió la presidencia .
El presidente Trump y sus aliados se han estado preparando durante varios días para los impactos del testimonio de Cohen, que tendrá lugar durante varias horas mientras el presidente se encuentra en Vietnam para una cumbre con el líder de Corea del Norte, Kim Jong-un .
Se espera que los republicanos que forman parte del Comité de Supervisión y Reforma de la Cámara cuestionen agresivamente la credibilidad de Cohen, a fin de hacerlo ver como un mentiroso.
La portavoz de la Casa Blanca, Sarah Huckabee Sanders , calificó a Cohen de mentiroso y lo señaló como “un criminal”.
“El criminal deshonrado Michael Cohen irá a la cárcel por mentir al Congreso y hacer otras declaraciones falsas”, dijo. “Lamentablemente, irá al Congreso esta semana y podemos esperar más de lo mismo. Es risible que alguien le crea a un mentiroso condenado como Cohen”.

A Few Steps to Minimize the Risk of Falls

Texto completo: Every day, I scan the obituaries to see why or how people die. You might call it morbid fascination, but I attribute it to the combined influence of my age (77) and my profession (health reporting). Obituaries give me ideas for Personal Health columns like this one that might help others -- and me -- avoid a preventable ailment or accident and premature demise.
One of the most frequent causes of death listed for people my age, as well as some younger and many older folks, is "complications from a fall," the explanation given for the death last month at 93 of Russell Baker, the much-loved Pulitzer Prize-winning humorist and columnist for The New York Times.
Falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries among older adults. Every 19 minutes in this country, an older person dies from a fall.
To be sure, nearly everyone falls now and then, and some falls are unavoidable. But falling is not an inevitable consequence of aging. Most age-related falls are preventable once you know why they happen and take steps to minimize the risk for yourself, relatives and friends whose age or health status renders them especially vulnerable.
More than a quarter of individuals age 65 and older fall each year, and falling once doubles their chances of falling again, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A fall that may be run-of-the-mill for a young person (as in the lyric "Pick yourself up, brush yourself off and start all over again") can be very dangerous for the elderly.
One fall in five among older adults results in a serious injury, and older people are less able to recover from the trauma physically and emotionally.
Although broken bones are usually regarded as the most common serious consequence of falls, even if no fracture occurs, a fall can result in irreversible harm to an elderly person's health, social interactions and psychological well-being.
A frequent aftermath when older people fall is a heightened fear of falling, prompting them to limit their activities and cause further physical decline, depression and social isolation, which in turn can hasten death.
Many factors common among older people can increase the risk of falling: medical and orthopedic problems and the medications taken to treat them; physical changes that impair balance, gait and muscle strength; sensory declines in vision, hearing and awareness of body position; and pain that distorts body movements.
At the same time, there are ways to minimize the chances of a dangerous fall, starting with regular exercise to maintain leg strength, balance, endurance and coordination that can help you "catch yourself" and avoid a fall if you should trip. Tai Chi is an excellent, low-impact way to improve balance. Also, practice standing on one foot when you brush your teeth, wash dishes or prep a recipe. You might also get Carol Clements's new book, "Better Balance for Life," that details a 10-week plan for improving stability.
Get your eyes checked at least once a year or more often if you have a gradually worsening condition like cataracts or macular degeneration. Don't delay recommended cataract surgery; blurry vision can foster serious stumbles. Regularly update your prescription for corrective lenses. Older people often do better with single-focus lenses, which may mean two different pairs, one for distance and another for reading, rather than one pair of progressive or bifocal lenses.
Also get regular hearing checkups and consider hearing aids if needed. You don't want to be startled into a fall by someone or something approaching from behind.
Have your doctor review all your medications, both prescription and over-the-counter, for their ability to cause dizziness or drowsiness. Wherever possible, eliminate or lower the dose of those that are potentially troublesome.
Dr. Leslie Kernisan, a geriatrician in the San Francisco Bay Area, lists these medications that may be especially likely to create a fall risk: psychoactive drugs like benzodiazepines (e.g. Xanax and Valium) and sleep medications like Ambien and Lunesta that affect the brain; antidepressants like Prozac, Zoloft and Elavil; medications that lower blood pressure, including Flomax and related drugs used to improve urination; medications that lower blood sugar, including metformin; and anticholinergic drugs like Benadryl, "PM" versions of over-the-counter pain relievers, the muscle relaxant Flexeril and the bladder relaxants Ditropan and Detrol.
Last, but by no means least, do a thorough evaluation of the fall risks in and outside your home environment. Get rid of clutter -- no books, papers, clothing or pet toys left on the floor or furniture that partially obstructs paths to the bathroom, bedroom, kitchen or front door. Install railings on stairways -- and always use them -- and grab bars around the shower or tub and toilet.
Evaluate the safety of floors and floor coverings, including throw rugs (a big no-no), loose carpets and raised ledges between rooms. Use a top quality nonskid mat in the shower. Repair all broken or uneven stairs and flooring. Keep electric and phone cords off the floor. Wipe up all spills immediately.
Invest in the best lighting you can afford. I leave several lights on 24/7 wherever darkness can spell danger and I replaced those bulbs with long-lasting, money-saving and brighter LEDs. At the very least, keep a night light on between the bedroom and bathroom or place a flashlight next to your pillow or bed and use it if you get up in the dark.
Make an honest assessment of your footwear. Shoes should fit well and be comfortable and supportive. Low heels and soles with good grips are essential. Throw away or give away any footwear that may cause you to catch a foot. I recently donated a brand-new pair of costly UGG boots for just this reason.
Never walk around in socks or stockings. Wear slippers that are not slippery. Mine are the last thing to come off when I get in bed and the first thing I put on before my feet hit the floor in the morning or during the night. A barefoot or sock-clad trek to the bathroom is a lousy idea. Two of my friends broke toes that way.
Outdoors, use footwear appropriate for the weather and surface conditions. And always look where you're going -- not at your cellphone or a distraction across the street. My rule of thumb: I walk looking about 10 feet ahead of me to anticipate trip hazards. Anywhere and any time your stability is uncertain, use a walking stick (or two), a cane or a walker.
Think you'll be painfully embarrassed? Think how much more humiliating and painful it will be if you fall.

Texto completo: President Trump announced Monday that an American who was taken hostage in Yemen in September 2017 has been freed.

“It is my honor today to announce that Danny Burch, a United States citizen who has been held hostage in Yemen for 18 months, has been recovered and reunited with his wife and children,” Trump said in a tweet while on his way to Vietnam for his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Tweet
Trump said the United Arab Emirates played a role in Burch’s release.

Burch, who worked for Yemeni Safer oil and was married to a Yemeni citizen, was abducted by Houthis after taking his children to school.

Reuters reported in January 2018 that the Houthis had released Burch and sent him to Oman on a flight that also carried Mohammed Abdel-Salam, a top leader of the Iran-allied group.

Burch had worked in the oil industry in Yemen since 1994. He traveled between the U.S. and Yemen until he moved to Arabian Peninsula in 2005. He converted to Islam and married Nadia Forsa, with whom he has three children, the New York Times reported in 2017.

Harry Reid: I may have cried wolf a bit when I said George W. Bush was the worst ever

Texto completo: Regrets, former Sen. Harry Reid, has a few.

The former Democratic leader says he wishes “every day” for a president like George W. Bush. Yes, the man who once declared America’s 43rd commander in the “worst president” in U.S. history now pines for the halcyon days of the Bush years, back when we were all so young and innocent.

The moment occurred after Reid was asked by CNN’s Dana Bash whether he has anything positive to say about President Trump.

"I just have trouble accepting him as a person, so frankly I don't see anything he's doing right,” the former senator said during the interview.

Bash then reminded Reid that he once said that George W. Bush was the “worst president we’ve ever had."

"He and I had our differences, but no one ever questioned his patriotism. Our battles were strictly political battles," Reid responded.

Oh, please. This is a lie, which is about par for the course for the man who admittedly lied when he accused 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney of being a tax dodge.

During Bush’s two terms in office, Reid regularly railed against the GOP president in personal and demeaning terms, calling him a "loser" and a "liar." Reid even told Bush to his face that his dog was “fat.” Reid once reportedly said in 2007 in reference to Bush that he was “mystified, dumbfounded about how difficult it is to work with this guy,” according to the New York Times. The former senator also said in 2007: “I fear that the Bush years will be known as a rare, even dark time.”

But now that Trump is in office, well, Reid has nothing but respect for his former president.

"There's no question in my mind that George Bush would be Babe Ruth in this league that he's in with Donald Trump in the league. Donald Trump wouldn't make the team," the senator told Bash.

Uh-huh.

Let's move on from the lie that Reid kept it professional when he opposed 43, and consider the idea that the former senator merely has had a change of heart regarding how he feels about Bush. Again, I say, "uh-huh."

I’d probably be more inclined to believe that Reid has evolved on the matter were it not for the fact that Democrats do this all the time, claiming they prefer whichever Republican is no longer in power to the one who currently is. It’s like a lazy, lame-brained version of, “the only good Republican is a dead Republican” cliche.

Democrats have one mode when it comes to opposing GOP presidents, and it’s to scream uncontrollably that that Republican is the worst person in history. Only after that Republican exits office do Democrats (sometimes) tone it down a notch, claiming later that their opposition wasn’t purely partisan fear-mongering. They claim later that their opposition was based on professional and mutual respect the whole way. The problem with this is that some of us have decent memories.

Some of us remember that Democrats treat all Republicans with equal disdain, which is probably why Republican and independent voters ignored the Left’s repeated attacks and warnings about Trump in 2016. It wasn’t anything they hadn’t heard before.

Amy Klobuchar's bad-boss flaws are disturbing. Should Democrats write her off for 2020?

Texto completo: Sen. Amy Klobuchar sounds like a strange and unpleasant boss. New reporting on her management style is especially striking given her outward persona as a “Minnesota nice” next-door neighbor.
The record shows Klobuchar has consistently high staff turnover. Accounts in HuffPost, BuzzFeed News and The New York Times, based on reviews of documents and internal emails as well as interviews with as many as 20 former staffers who insisted on anonymity, suggest Klobuchar can be volatile, abusive and paranoid — dressing down aides in public and in humiliating emails copied to many others, calling their work “slop,” suspecting them of sabotage, making it hard for them to find other jobs, making them pick up her clothes and wash her dishes (including a comb she used to eat a salad after berating an aide who didn't bring a fork).
Is it sexist to discuss this topic? Is it irrelevant? Is it unfair, given the deficiencies of the “manager” now in the White House? And is it so damaging that Democrats should write off Klobuchar as a presidential contender?
The answer in every case should be no.
Read more commentary:
Elizabeth Warren didn't miss her presidential moment. Win or lose, 2020 is her time.
How Bernie Sanders and Democrats can avoid the 2016 mistakes that gave us Trump
The Obamas showed Dems how to bridge the race gap between left and center voters
Klobuchar is relatively centrist in a party moving left. This makes her the type of Democrat many Republicans and independents are hoping will win the 2020 nomination — that is, one they can vote for because they can’t abide President Donald Trump. It also makes her the great hope of Democrats who believe that the overriding imperative in 2020 is to nominate the candidate who has the broadest appeal — particularly in the industrial Midwest's battleground states — and best odds of winning the White House.
In that respect 2020 is shaping up like 1992, when Democrats were determined to end 12 years of Republican presidencies. In focus groups and interviews I did for The Associated Press in New Hampshire, the overriding theme was electability. “I love (liberal populist Iowa Sen. ) Tom Harkin but we have to win so …” “I love (wildly unconventional Vietnam War veteran) Bob Kerrey but we have to win so …” “I love (even more wildly unconventional former and future California Gov. ) Jerry Brown but we have to win so …”
The electable choice was a moderate Southern governor. The end of the sentence was always “I’m voting for Bill Clinton. ”
Klobuchar could bridge Democratic divides
Of the major Democrats now running, Klobuchar most resembles that candidate in the abstract. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and others could eventually join her in the center lane.
Klobuchar has so far handled the party’s left-center split in ways that reflect preparation and, one hopes, authenticity. Medicare for All? “It could be a possibility in the future. I'm just looking at something that will work now,” like allowing the public to buy Medicare or Medicaid coverage, she said this month in her CNN town hall. Green New Deal? “An aspiration in that (it’s) something we need to move towards,” starting with immediately rejoining the Paris climate accord and restoring Obama-era clean power rules and gas mileage standards.
Nor did Klobuchar appear fazed when Bob Gigliotti, an assistant professor of business management at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, asked whether she is "a difficult person to work for. " She replied that she had managed “hundreds of prosecutors” as Hennepin County attorney in Minneapolis and that, on Capitol Hill, “My chief of staff has worked for me for six years, my state director for seven years, my campaign manager for 14 years. ”
But even in Klobuchar's Hennepin County attorney days, there were oddities and complaints, and she knows she still has a lot to prove. She suggested the presidential campaign will be her crucible: “That's a pretty good way to judge people and how they manage something. ”
Volatility yardstick is crucial, not sexist bias
She’s right about that. One reason for Barack Obama's 2008 successes is that he demonstrated solid, disciplined management of his campaign from February 2007 to November 2008. That aura of steady competence, through crises as personal as his controversial pastor and as terrifying as Wall Street's meltdown, helped him beat the best known woman in the country in the Democratic primaries and the experienced (but sometimes impetuous) Arizona Sen. John McCain in the general election.
And it was not a bait and switch. Obama’s presidency had its problems, but he ran an orderly, fact-based, minimal-drama administration that “the best people” did not flee or trash.
Are Klobuchar’s apparent management flaws disturbing? Yes. Are they disqualifying? Not yet. In the next 20 months, she has a sustained chance to show she has learned and changed — that she can run a drama-free Senate office and a stable, even-keeled presidential campaign.
It's not biased to apply this yardstick. It has nothing to do with Klobuchar’s gender or any double standard. Trump shows us every single day why competence, discipline and management skills are absolutely essential in the next president. It is a top consideration on my check list for all candidates, as it should be for every American desperate to end the Trump era.

Texto completo: "To think that some young man risked his life for us, all those years ago, or maybe he made the ultimate sacrifice and bled out on some European battlefield, as one of the heroes of 'Spearhead' actually did, I don't think it's right for us to ever forget their names."
Adam Makos
author of "Spearhead: An American Gunner, His Enemy, and a Collision of Lives in World War II"
It was Adam Makos' grandfathers' service in World War II that inspired a career for their grandson, leading to Makos' deep interest in the military and the American heroes whose stories he feels is his duty to tell.
The author's newest book, "Spearhead: An American Gunner, His Enemy, and a Collision of Lives in World War II," chronicles not only the surreal story of one young tank gunner's epic battle in Germany, but that soldier's deliverance from its trauma that would come some 70 years later.
Having earned a spot in what has been called "the top ranks of military writers," Makos' previous works include New York Times bestseller "A Higher Call" and the widely acclaimed "Devotion."
Today he lives in Denver.
Your books have highlighted tales of historical military heroes whose stories would have otherwise gone unheard by the American public. Why has this pursuit been a such a passion for you personally?
I love searching for untold stories because it gives my readers a chance to see a new side of World War II, or to meet a new hero, like watching a movie for the first time.
To me, it's also about justice. To think that some young man risked his life for us, all those years ago, or maybe he made the ultimate sacrifice and bled out on some European battlefield, as one of the heroes of "Spearhead" actually did, I don't think it's right for us to ever forget their names.
How did you find out about Clarence Smoyer, a U.S. Army corporal and tank gunner from Pennsylvania coal country who served in World War II?
I truly feel I'm "led" to some of these stories, in the spookiest ways. A college buddy told me about Clarence, a quiet hero from his hometown. So one day in 2012 I went up to Clarence's brick row house and knocked on the door. He welcomed me inside, pulled up a chair at the kitchen table and we talked for a bit before he stunned me with a revelation when he asked, "Would you like to see a letter from the German I fought against?" He was in touch with his former enemy.
Smoyer's defining moment of the war was a dramatic showdown in Cologne, Germany, between the newfangled American M-26 Pershing "Super Tank" he commanded and the fiercely infamous German Panther tank – a 1945 duel that was, almost unbelievably, captured on film. What was it about his story that compelled you to meticulously research and document it in "Spearhead"?
Before I met him, I knew about Clarence's remarkable, Wild West-style tank duel in the street of Cologne. It's considered one of the most famous actions of World War II, because it was caught on film. Now, anyone can watch it with the click of a mouse button.
But even putting the reader into the middle of that duel, two tanks quick-drawing on each other, 75 yards apart, wasn't enough to fill a book. It was the deeper, human story that drew me to write "Spearhead." Our World War II tank crewmen faced a terrible reality every time they started their engines.
The first tank always gets hit.
That was the nature of tank combat on the Western Front in early 1945. The Germans were on the defense; they could dig in and wait for our guys to come over the hill or around the bend. They could wait to fire until the first American tank rolled into their crosshairs.
So to go first took guts, because that guy was probably going to get hit. When Clarence was assigned the Pershing, a deadly new role fell to him: now, his tank would go first, in every battle.
So I asked myself: Why would any man saddle up for that? Why did Clarence? And the answer was quite profound. He did it to keep his buddies safe. He told himself: We have the biggest gun, we belong out front.
You recount Smoyer's disturbing decades-long bout with PTSD, and how he finally decided to face it. Explain how this unlikely outcome (of meeting his former enemy in person in their later years) was such a defining chapter in his life.
Like many veterans, Clarence came home and buttoned-up his memories of the war and never aired out the troubling things he'd seen.
So, in his later years, when the memories resurfaced, there was no one left to talk with – all of the men from his crew had passed. There was just one man he could turn to, who had seen the same horrors in Cologne, but from the other end of the street. This man had been his enemy (in the tank duel), Gustav Schaefer.
When Clarence returned to Cologne in 2013 and sat down to talk with Gustav, his former enemy proved to be his saving grace. Talking. It's what helped him put his ghosts to rest. And he emerged from the ordeal with a new friend. He and Gustav called each other war buddies. They used to exchange Christmas cards and letters. They even Skyped on the computer, talking face to face.
It's a one in a million chance that they'd have found each other, 70 years after they fought. Then to have actually met, with Clarence flying across the ocean and Gustav driving from northern Germany. And then for them to become inseparable friends? You couldn't script a better ending to a war story.
Any plans for your next book?
I do have a new World War II book in the works, likely the last I'll write while veterans are alive to share their stories. For now, however, I'm just enjoying my time celebrating the heroes of Spearhead.
Clarence is 95. Buck Marsh, the GI who used to ride into battle on Clarence's tank, he's 95, and he's coming with me to Jackson, to our signing at Lemuria books on March 1.
For now, I just want to throw a big party for these heroes, to let people meet them and shake their hands, and realize how lucky we are to still have them, 75 years later.
Signing
Adam Makos and Buck Marsh will visit Lemuria Books in Jackson at 5 p.m. Friday.

Texto completo: 've locked myself out of my apartment more times than I can count. While I wait for help, jiggling a doorknob that just won't open, I've often thought: The only thing standing between me and dinner is that I cannot pick this lock. So when I found out that The New York Times, where I work, was offering a class to employees on lock-picking, I jumped at the chance. Now I want to share some of what I've learned with you.
Your parents may hate this. But you can tell them that lock-picking can be both useful -- have you ever lost your locker key? -- and fun. It's called locksport, a hobby that thousands of people around the world participate in. There are a few rules. The Open Organization of Lockpickers, a group that educates the public on lock-picking, has three big ones: Don't ever pick a lock that isn't yours unless you have permission; don't tell someone how to pick a lock if you think they're going to break Rule No. 1; and follow all the laws around lock-picking in your community.
Below are instructions for picking padlocks, the type of lock with a U-shaped piece of metal (called the shackle) that you loop through whatever you're trying to protect. Padlocks often use a mechanism called a pin tumbler, in which a series of pins holds a tube in place. The key opens the lock by raising those pins into just the right place so that the tube can rotate, releasing the shackle. Picking a lock simulates how the key moves the pins around. Fun fact: Researchers have found padlocks dating back to the Roman Empire! What you'll need
A tension wrench. This tool helps you turn the lock as you're picking it. You can make your own with a large paper clip by unfolding the longest segment out to a 90-degree angle, then folding that long piece in half into a hook.
A "rake." The rake is your makeshift key, which you'll use to move the pins in the lock. Find a bobby pin, and unfold it. Have your parents remove the round bulb on the wavy end of the bobby pin (you might need scissors), and stick that end into the lock, bending the pin's tip upward into a hook.
Let's Get Picking
Step 1: Insert the hooked end of the paper clip into the bottom part of the keyhole. Use the rest of the paper clip as a handle and press it in the clockwise direction, keeping slight pressure on it with your thumb.
Step 2: While keeping pressure on the paper clip, insert the hooked end of the bobby pin into the top part of the hole with your other hand.
Step 3: Slowly jiggle the bobby pin up and down, as if you were trying to scoop each pin up, one by one. There's no magic formula for this step, which is the hard part -- each lock is different. (One hint for practicing: You can use the shape of the padlock's key to guess how much you need to move each pin. For example, if the ridges on the key are high in the middle and lower at the end, then the pins in the middle need to be pushed up more than the ones at the end.)
Step 4: The deeper you're able to get the end of the bobby pin inside the lock, the more pins you're moving into place. You'll also know you're getting closer as you're able to turn the paper clip more, until -- voilà! -- the lock finally pops open. ◊

Don't fall for the SPLC's lies

Texto completo: Newsrooms were on fire this week with terrible news: The number of hate groups in the United States has soared to record highs under President Trump.

There are most certainly hate groups in the U.S., and even one is one too many, but I’d encourage everyone to approach the numbers reported this week with calm and caution. There’s nothing partisan operatives would love more than for you to panic and to believe them when they suggest that the problem can be solved by expelling "the other team" from power. That the figures cited by newsrooms come via the decidedly unreliable and hyper-partisan Southern Poverty Law Center also doesn’t help anything.

The New York Times reported, “Over 1,000 Hate Groups Are Now Active in United States, Civil Rights Group Says.”

“Hate groups ‘surge’ across the country since Charlottesville riot, report says,” reads the headline from the Miami Herald.

“Trump 'Fear-Mongering' Fuels Rise of U.S. Hate Groups to Record: Watchdog,” U.S. News and World Report said in a headline that sort of gives the game away.

First, let's keep things in perspective. Remember, for example, that the rise in the number of hate crimes is attributable in some way to the fact that there are more reporting agencies (hundreds, in fact!) than ever before. It’s easy to say, “Oh, it’s all because of President Trump,” pointing to incidents like his disastrous Charlottesville statement. But the problem of bigotry is far older and deeper than the current administration. That the Trump White House isn’t helping anything is one complaint, but don’t fall for the suggestion that it’s the main driver.

Second, while we’re on the topic of taking things seriously, it’s important to remember that the SPLC is not an organization whose declarations should be taken seriously or treated as fact. As I've written before, much of its “hate group” reporting is trash.

In 2015, for example, the group put Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson on its “extremist watch list,” citing the one-time presidential candidate’s “anti-LGBT views.” Later, in 2016, the SPLC labeled women’s rights activist, female genital mutilation victim, atheist, and ex-Muslim Ayaan Hirsi Ali an “anti-Muslim extremist” because she opposes Islamic extremism. The British activist and extremist-turned-counterextremist Maajid Nawaz was placed in the same category. The SPLC lumps pro-family and pro-Israel organizations in with actual neo-Nazis.

The SPLC is not in the business of exploring and addressing racial and ethnic bigotry. It's in the business of crushing anything to the right of the Democratic Party.

As for the report the SPLC just released this week, it concedes there is an uptick in the number of black nationalist groups since 2017, but it downplays this fact by claiming those groups “have little or no impact on mainstream politics and no defenders in high office.” I must’ve just imagined noted-anti-Semite and frequent Democratic guest Louis Farrakhan.

The report also has a section titled, “HATE GOES TO WASHINGTON: Meet the Members of Congress Who Traffic in Hate and Extremism.” It includes Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Mark Harris, R-N.C., for supporting the traditional definition of marriage that Barack Obama supported until a few years ago. In fact, the section on members of Congress includes only Republicans, which is interesting considering that Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., an actual out-and-proud anti-Semite, also went to Washington this year.

The report takes aim at Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and U.S. national security adviser John Bolton. The SPLC report lists the Alliance Defending Freedom, the Family Research Council, and the Family Research Institute as anti-gay “hate groups.” No report that lumps these groups in the same category as the Westboro Baptist Church should ever be relied on by journalists.

Hate groups are real. Hate crimes are real. The SPLC is not. It exploits hate groups to raise money and further political interests unrelated to the problem of hate. Don't fall for the SPLC's lies.

Trump comparte un viejo video de reparación de cercas como su nuevo “muro” en la frontera

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump está fingiendo que el video de una cerca que se reparó hace 5 meses prueba que su “muro” se está construyendo en este momento, reporta Task and Purpose.
La mentira es la última humillación de Trump, a quien se le ha negado repetidamente la posibilidad de gastar miles de millones de dólares del presupuesto en el proyecto del muro en la frontera sur de Estados Unidos.
Trump primero compartió el video el miércoles en su cuenta de Twitter. “Acabamos de construir este poderoso Muro en Nuevo México”, escribió el presidente. “Completado el 30 de enero de 2019, ¡47 días antes de lo previsto! ¡Muchas millas más ahora en construcción!
Y usó la etiqueta #FinishTheWall (#TerminenElMuro)
We have just built this powerful Wall in New Mexico. Completed on January 30, 2019 – 47 days ahead of schedule! Many miles more now under construction! #FinishTheWall pic.twitter.com/TYkj3KRdOC
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2019
Y luego el jueves:
THE WALL IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW! https://t.co/exUJCiITsz
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2019
El gran problema es que las imágenes que está transmitiendo como nuevas, son en realidad trabajos de reparación a estructuras existentes realizados hace cinco meses.
Nuevamente, a pesar de la sugerencia del presidente, esta no es una nueva sección del muro.
Es un trabajo de restauración y parte del Proyecto de Reemplazo del Muro Fronterizo del Proyecto Santa Teresa de $73.3 millones de dólares.
El trabajo está siendo emprendido por el Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército de Estados Unidos (USACE). Trump lo aprobó él mismo, cuando asumió el cargo por primera vez en enero de 2017.
“El segmento de la cerca fue construido y financiado por las autoridades de DHS / CBP con el Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército de Estados Unidos que proporciona la contratación / supervisión de la construcción a través de nuestra misión de apoyo interinstitucional”, d ijo a Task & Purpose la vocera del Cuartel General de USACE, Raini Brunson. “El video, que se filmó en septiembre de 2018, tiene el logotipo de USACE porque fue producido por USACE”.
El Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército no pudo confirmar de inmediato dónde se originó la solicitud de las imágenes y cómo acabó en la cuenta de Twitter del presidente.
El New York Times informó el mes pasado que no se habían construido nuevas millas de barreras fronterizas bajo la administración de Trump.
Algo que Trump hizo bien, es que el reemplazo en las 20 millas de barreras que se muestran en el clip sí se terminó a fines de enero.
No es la primera vez que el presidente ha intentado este truco, para pasar el trabajo de reparación como el progreso en su promesa de campaña. Usó fotos de partes reconstruidas del muro existente de la misma manera en marzo de 2018, según
Entonces, como ahora, el presidente fue llamado por los verificadores de los hechos y la oposición, mientras que muchos de sus partidarios continuaron retuiteando sus falsas noticias sin críticas.

Texto completo: BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Her first movie made Lebanon laugh at itself, her second gift-wrapped the trauma of its civil war in tender comedy, and Nadine Labaki's third film, "Capernaum," well, made people cry. Its title means something like "chaos" or "hell," and it offers a not-far-from-real story of child abuse, vicious poverty and despair only a short drive from Lebanon's grandest neighborhoods.
NPR called it "Dickensian." Reviewing it for The New York Times, A.O. Scott called Beirut, as seen through Ms. Labaki's camera, a "teeming vision of the inferno." It is this image of Lebanon -- rather than its hellish civil war, its beauty culture, its beaches and ski resorts or its hummus -- that has captivated international audiences over the past year, winning the jury prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival, an Oscar nomination for best foreign-language film and a spot in Mr. Scott's Top-10 list for 2018.
But though international success has made Ms. Labaki the country's best-known filmmaker, it is Lebanese eyes, hearts and consciences that she is after.
"Lebanese people need to know what's going on," she said. "They need to face it."
"It," as "Capernaum" shows, is an angry brew of seemingly every major Lebanese social ill of recent years, problems that rarely get a prominent airing in Lebanon.
Zain, a Huck Finnesque hero of about 12 (his exact age is a mystery to him), is suing his parents for bringing him into a world where they have neither the means nor, it seems, the will to care for him and his siblings, who are literally countless (it is never clear how many there are). Like many Lebanese families, they are too poor even to register their children with the government, all but cutting them off from schools, hospitals and legitimate employment.
Abused, neglected and forced to work, Zain witnesses a child marriage and commits a violent crime that lands him in prison. In between, he meets a Syrian refugee child, one of the million or so Syrians who fled the civil war for Lebanon, and finds a makeshift home with an undocumented Ethiopian woman -- one of Lebanon's large underclass of migrant laborers -- and her toddler son.
Zain's odyssey is a movie. Yet, Ms. Labaki, not wanting it to be dismissed as an exaggeration, made sure it was not quite fiction.
Ms. Labaki and her husband, Khaled Mouzanar, the film's producer, co-writer and composer, spent three years researching the impoverished neighborhoods where "Capernaum" is set.
They shadowed social workers as they made the rounds of overcrowded apartments, visited prisons where juveniles and migrant workers were held and observed court proceedings. They found children left home alone, feeding themselves by spooning powdered milk straight from the can because they had no water; children shivering with cold; children who, diminished by malnutrition, looked years younger than their age.
They went on to cast mostly nonprofessional Lebanese actors from the same neighborhoods, most of whom had known only the privations the film depicts. They changed the apartments and streets where they filmed as little as possible.
The film's star, Zain Al Rafeea, is a young Syrian refugee from a poor family who Ms. Labaki said had grown up largely on the streets, developing an eye-watering fluency in profanity that topped even that of his character, whose every third word seems to be a curse. (The United Nations resettled the family in Norway last year; Ms. Labaki said Zain was adjusting well. In fact, Ms. Labaki's team has helped all the young children in the film enroll either in schools or part-time classes since the end of filming.)
None of this is Ms. Labaki's usual milieu.
"This is happening five minutes away from a completely different life," she said on a recent afternoon as her Land Rover jounced from the well-groomed streets of Achrafieh, where she lives and works, to the hardscrabble neighborhood called Nabaa, where she shot the bulk of the film. Garbage littered the sidewalks. Electrical wires sagged overhead; laundry slumped from balconies. Cockroaches trundled by Ms. Labaki's gray Converse sneakers.
As Ms. Labaki got out, people hung out from balconies or waved from corner stores to congratulate her -- "Mabrouk!" -- on the Oscar nomination.
It was Ms. Labaki's own ignorance about places like Nabaa, she said, that generated the film's shock-and-dismay approach, which put off some reviewers.
"You know it's happening," she said, "but it's shocking to see how unbearable it is. It's different to be inside of it."
Like "Capernaum," Ms. Labaki is a homegrown product of Lebanon, one of only a few contemporary Arab directors not to have pursued her training or career in the West. Growing up in a village outside Beirut during Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war, which killed more than 150,000 people, she remembers being cooped up at home with little to do but watch movies like "Annie" and "Grease" as the fighting burned outside.
She studied filmmaking in Beirut before making "Caramel," a gentle 2007 social comedy about women of different religious backgrounds working together in a beauty parlor. Then, in 2011 came "Where Do We Go Now?" a riff on Lebanon's history of religious strife in which village women go to increasingly absurd lengths to keep their menfolk from fighting one another. (Ms. Labaki, a sometime actress with dark, intense eyes, also starred in both movies.)
The civil war furnished Ms. Labaki with filmmaking grist. But she speculated that it had also inured the Lebanese to suffering, confining discussion of the problems "Capernaum" depicts to a few activist corners of society.
"We've learned to live with injustice," Ms. Labaki said. "Every family has a tragedy. We've learned not to look. It's become part of our story."
Ms. Labaki said she had always wanted to make films that pricked the conscience, but did not know how. She began her "Capernaum" research after one night several years ago when she was returning home late from a party and saw a mother and son sitting on the sidewalk, the child asleep and vulnerable.
Doing her research, she was most struck by the juvenile detainees she met. Like Zain, few could say how old they were. When she asked, "Are you happy to be alive?" many answered, "No, I wish I was dead," she said.
When she began filming in Nabaa, Ms. Labaki was breast-feeding her second child, a daughter. At first, she said, she was unable to contain her fury at the mothers who left their young children home alone, like the small girl she saw crying in a window day after day.
Ms. Labaki eventually confronted the girl's mother. She responded, "What do you want me to do? I have to go to work," the director recalled.
"Every time you sit down with the parents, you realize you can't judge. You don't know what to think anymore," Ms. Labaki said. "It's not their fault -- it's the whole system that is not helping anyone."
Some Lebanese have emerged from seeing "Capernaum" arguing that the poor must be stopped from having more children. There are some who have questioned whether Ms. Labaki is proposing just that, with reviewers divided over whether the film condemns a systematic failure or the poor.
The film makes Zain's case that it "probably would have been better if he'd never been born," one Cannes reviewer wrote. When Zain's parents tell his lawyer, played by Ms. Labaki, "that she has no right to judge them, and her eyes tear up, the guilt feels phony," another wrote.
But Ms. Labaki, who sometimes speaks about the plot as though it were true, insists it is all real. She told the woman who played Zain's mother, Kawsar al-Haddad, to draw on her own story for the scene, as she did with the other actors throughout the filming.
Now Ms. Labaki, who once ran unsuccessfully in a Beirut municipal election, wants to take her activism further, aware that good intentions may go only so far.
At one point in "Capernaum," a group of volunteer musicians visits a prison to put on a concert. Some of the detainees sing along from behind the bars, but the camera lingers on those who do not, whose despair seems beyond the reach of any music.
But Ms. Labaki insists on trying.
"It's really a luxury not to talk about politics," Ms. Labaki said, "especially if you live on this side of the world, where nothing is going right."

Duterte's Facebook Trolls

Texto completo: Harassing journalists is one of Rodrigo Duterte's specialties. Mr. Duterte, the strongman president of the Philippines, has been going after Maria Ressa, a former CNN reporter and a founder of the online news site Rappler, for two years. The campaign against her combines criminal charges with Facebook smears intended to tarnish her reputation and spread lies about her work.
Last week, Ms. Ressa spent a night in jail on a charge of "cyberlibel" for a 2012 article that Rappler published about allegations of corrupt ties between a businessman and a judge.
When we spoke over Skype on Thursday about the attempts to silence her, she said, "I have to adjust that this is normal, even if there is nothing normal about this." She added, "It does not scare me, but it is meant to scare everyone else."
Technically, she spent the night in a conference room, rather than a cell -- because the National Bureau of Investigation agents were trying "to be nice," she was told.
It was perhaps a small gracious act in what has been a relentless assault on Ms. Ressa and Rappler.
Rappler has been all over President Duterte's brutal regime, publishing articles on extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses. In mid-2017, in a State of the Union speech, the president struck back by criticizing Rappler for being owned by Americans (some of its investors are indeed from the United States). He attempted to get its license revoked. Ms. Ressa was then charged with tax evasion. Then the arrest for cyberlibel, which is considered a criminal act.
While she seemed tired of these legal roadblocks, she was undaunted and even funny when we spoke. "I think I have paid more in bail than Imelda Marcos," she said, referring to the shoe-loving wife of the longtime ruler of the Philippines who went down in ignominy.
It was morning in Manila, but she was not doing any journalism. Instead, she was adding more security to Rappler's offices to protect its 100 employees and forking over more money to pay for lawyers. Legal fees already account for a quarter of its operating budget, she said.
She is also contending with the relentless manipulation of social media by what she says are government-friendly sources to spread false information about her and Rappler. These trolls focus on Facebook, which is where most Filipinos get their news. She has been called a foreign agent, a troublemaker, a tax cheat, a traitor and ugly.
Last week, two people whom Ms. Ressa suspects were working for the government managed to slip into Rappler's building and broadcast a video on Facebook Live from just outside its door urging protests and social media attacks. Among the comments on the feed: "Hang Ressa," "Bomb Ressa" and "Behead her."
Government officials have said she is "enjoying" the attention. She is not, and Ms. Ressa reported the video to Facebook. She had already provided the company with copious evidence of the way its platform has been abused by Mr. Duterte's troll army. This time Facebook responded by blocking the user who posted the video for 30 days (he may have popped up again on Facebook in Singapore, though).
It's a cat-and-mouse game, and Ms. Ressa said Facebook is haphazard about enforcing the rules. While individual executives have been helpful, Ms. Ressa said, she's had a hard time dealing with Facebook, which has responded slowly.
"Facebook is now the world's largest distributor of news and yet it has refused to be the gatekeeper," she told me in a recent onstage interview. "And when it does that, when you allow lies to actually get on the same playing field as facts, it taints the entire public sphere." At some point, she said, Facebook has to "take down the lies."
As she noted to me on Thursday night, "A lie told a million times is truth." On social media, though, that is more like a billion times.
Ms. Ressa said she wished she had tried to stop the online abuse sooner: "We ignored it far too long and that is the lesson I have learned."
She said she would continue to try to work with Facebook and other social media outlets. "Looking at my social media feed is impossible now, since I can't defend myself as I watch my reputation being dragged down," she said. Lately, Ms. Ressa said, the attacks on her on Twitter have worsened. And I have been weirdly pummeled on the platform by users calling Ms. Ressa a con artist since I posted that I was speaking to her.
To try to deal with it all, Ms. Ressa said, she thinks a lot about Reinhold Niebuhr's Serenity Prayer. "I will look at stuff in my area of control, like making sure my staff is safe and we have a business to be able to continue to do what we are doing," she said, with a weary sigh. "I don't want to be the story."

New testing ordered in Cooper case; Governor wants wider analysis of items found at scene of quadruple slaying in Chino Hills.

Texto completo: Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Friday morning requiring additional testing of evidence in the quadruple-murder case of death row inmate Kevin Cooper.
The executive order broadens an order by former Gov. Jerry Brown, who in December requested "limited retesting" of a tan T-shirt, an orange towel, a hatchet handle and a hatchet sheath after Cooper's attorneys said some key items weren't properly tested and should be analyzed using more current DNA technology.
Newsom's order requires the DNA testing and analysis of untested hairs from the victims' hands and the crime scene, a blood vial, a blood drop, fingernail scrapings from the victims and a green button.

"I take no position regarding Mr. Cooper's guilt or innocence at this time," Newsom said in the order. "Especially in cases where the government seeks to impose the ultimate punishment of death, I need to be satisfied that all relevant evidence is carefully and fairly examined."
Newsom said the purpose of testing the additional pieces of evidence was to determine whether DNA from Cooper -- or anyone else -- is detectable on the items.
Cooper has maintained his innocence throughout the case and has said that law enforcement planted evidence and ignored statements by witnesses that pointed to other possible suspects. He has lost more than a dozen appeals.
Cooper, now 61, was convicted and sentenced to death in 1985 for the slayings of three family members and an unrelated boy, 11-year-old Christopher Hughes. They were found hacked and slashed to death in a Chino Hills home.
The boy's father discovered the killings when he went to the hilltop home looking for Christopher. Through the window, he saw the bodies of Doug and Peggy Ryen; their 10-year-old daughter, Jessica; and Christopher. They had been stabbed a total of 143 times with an ice pick, an ax and a knife. The Ryens' 8-year-old son, Joshua, was slashed across the throat but survived.
Two days before the killings, Cooper had escaped from a prison in Chino, where he was serving a sentence for burglary. Police found ample evidence -- cigarette butts, a button from a prison uniform, a leather hatchet sheath -- that Cooper had spent two days in a house near the Ryens' after his escape.
He was arrested about seven weeks after the killings. At his trial, jurors heard Joshua Ryen give a videotaped statement that conflicted with what he had said when he was first interviewed by authorities.
After Joshua was airlifted to a hospital, he told a sheriff's deputy and a social worker that his attackers were three white men. An hour later, he said they were Latino. Later that month, the boy told a deputy that Cooper, who is black, was not the killer after he saw the man's face on a wanted poster on television.
Jurors heard him say that he saw just one man or maybe a shadow in his home.
The clues at the Ryens' unlocked home were scant: a bloody shoe print on a sheet in the master bedroom and a single drop of blood on a wall in the hallway.
At trial and throughout the appeals process, Cooper's attorneys argued that the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department had destroyed or suppressed evidence suggesting that the attackers were three white men, including a convicted contract killer.
Brown's December order came after four California law school deans called on him to open an independent investigation, saying that Cooper's claim of innocence "has never been fully and fairly evaluated."
Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called for the DNA testing in May after a New York Times column called the case against Cooper "outrageous."

Texto completo: I start with the pain. A couple times a week I give a speech somewhere in the country about social isolation and social fragmentation. Very often a parent comes up to me afterward and says, "My daughter took her life when she was 14." Or, "My son died of an overdose when he was 20."
Their eyes flood with tears. I don't know what to say. I squeeze their shoulders, but the crying does not stop. As it turns to weeping they rush out of the auditorium, and I am left with my own futility.
This kind of pain is an epidemic in our society. When you cover the sociology beat as I do, you see other kinds of pain. The African-American woman in Greenville who is indignant because young black kids in her neighborhood face injustice just as gross as she did in 1953. The college student in the Midwest who is convinced that she is the only one haunted by compulsive thoughts about her own worthlessness.
They share a common thread: our lack of healthy connection to each other, our inability to see the full dignity of each other, and the resulting culture of fear, distrust, tribalism and strife.
On Dec. 7, 1941, countless Americans saw that their nation was in peril and walked into recruiting stations. We don't have anything as dramatic as Pearl Harbor, but when 47,000 Americans kill themselves every year and 72,000 more die from drug addiction, isn't that a silent Pearl Harbor? When the basic norms of decency, civility and democracy are under threat, isn't that a silent Pearl Harbor? Aren't we all called at moments like these to do something extra?
My something extra was starting something nine months ago at the Aspen Institute called Weave: The Social Fabric Project. The first core idea was that social isolation is the problem underlying a lot of our other problems. The second idea was that this problem is being solved by people around the country, at the local level, who are building community and weaving the social fabric. How can we learn from their example and nationalize their effect?
We traveled around the country and found them everywhere. We'd plop into cities and small towns, and we'd find 25 to 100 community "Weavers" almost immediately. This is a movement that doesn't know it's a movement.
Some of them work at organizations: a veteran who helps other veterans with mental illnesses in New Orleans; a guy who runs a boxing gym in Appalachian Ohio, where he nominally teaches young men boxing, but really teaches them life. Many others do their weaving in the course of everyday life - because that's what neighbors do.
We're living with the excesses of 60 years of hyperindividualism. There's a lot of emphasis in our culture on personal freedom, self-interest, self-expression, the idea that life is an individual journey. But Weavers share an ethos that puts relationship over self. "We" precedes "me."
Whether they live in red or blue America, they often use the same terms and embody the same values - deep hospitality, showing up for people, putting town before self. 
The trait that leaps out above all others is "radical mutuality": We are all completely equal, regardless of where society ranks us. "We don't do things for people. We don't do things to people. We do things with people," said a woman who builds community for teenagers in New Orleans.
Being around these people has been one of the most uplifting experiences of my life. Obviously, it's made me want to be more neighborly. But it has also changed my moral lens. I've become so impatient with the politicians I cover. They are so self-absorbed; Weavers live for others and are more joyful as a result.
The big question is how do we take the success the Weavers are having on the local level and make it national? The Weavers are building relationships one by one, which takes time. Relationships do not scale.
But norms scale. If you can change the culture, you can change behavior on a large scale.
Culture changes when a small group of people, often on the margins of society, find a better way to live, and other people begin to copy them. These Weavers have found a better way to live.
We at Weave - and all of us - need to illuminate their example, synthesize their values so we understand what it means to be a relationalist and not an individualist. We need to create hubs where these decentralized networks can come together for solidarity and support.
I guess my ask is that you declare your own personal declaration of interdependence and decide to become a Weaver instead of a ripper. This is partly about communication. Every time you assault and stereotype a person, you've ripped the social fabric. Every time you see that person deeply and make her or him feel known, you've woven it.
I ask that you in your context think about what little extra you can do to be a neighbor, citizen and Weaver. I ask you to have faith. Renewal is building, relationship by relationship, community by community. It will spread and spread, as the sparks fly upward.

Texto completo: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ call to kick libel law back to the states is baffling and dangerous. In an era where the president of the United States routinely attacks the press, our landmark libel case, New York Times v. Sullivan, must remain a cornerstone of First Amendment law.
Thomas seems to be supporting President Donald Trump’s call to “open up” libel laws to make it easier to successfully sue media companies.
“We are going to have people sue you like you’ve never got sued before,” Trump said at a Fort Worth rally during the frenzied 2016 presidential primary season. His lawyers may have convinced him that this would be tough to do under Sullivan, hence his “enemy of the people” diatribes on Twitter.
The press is under attack from our highest political office and the far right, and in this contentious political climate, journalists must remain protected against a vindictive government bearing down on us via our legal system.

All Americans have a constitutional right to criticize President Donald Trump
Trump's not being defamed. If he was, he wouldn't need to change the libel laws.
Mr. Trump, DOJ is not your personal justice department
In the landmark Sullivan ruling, the Supreme Court set a standard for actual malice that had to be met for press reports about public officials could be considered libel. Sullivan was birthed 55 years ago from civil rights-era conflicts as African-American leaders criticized police brutality against protesters in Alabama.
Without Sullivan, coverage of the protests in the South would have been squelched as southern public officials sought to use libel law as a cudgel to silence civil rights leaders and the reporters who covered them. Indeed, Sullivan was as much a civil rights case as it was a libel case.
Civil rights, Vietnam and Watergate reporting
How ironic then that Justice Thomas, the only African-American on the Supreme Court, is calling for a retreat on these civil rights-era protections. He made this remark in a concurring opinion released Tuesday when the court turned down an appeal from Kathrine McKee, who accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault. She sued Cosby for libel after his lawyers called her dishonest.
Thomas often treads his own path in the area of First Amendment law. He is a noted defender of advertising, also called commercial speech, questioning why it should be more heavily regulated than other types of speech, even political speech. He has questioned laws that regulate political contributions, and strongly supported less government regulation of street and lawn signs. However, he has opposed free speech protections for high school students and prisoners.
During the middle of the last century, the media and civil rights protesters often faced financially crippling libel suits filed by public officials and even police officers such as L. B. Sullivan of Montgomery, Alabama. The Supreme Court’s 1964 ruling in Sullivan cleared the way for more robust coverage of the Vietnam war and Watergate. The free press is compromised if it is not free to cover issues of public concern without fear of being hauled into court.
Journalists don't always win libel suits
To be clear, journalists are not totally protected from libel suits, nor are we owed blanket immunity from reckless practice. For instance, Sen. Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican presidential nominee, prevailed in his libel suit against Fact magazine over “The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater,” which was published before the election.
The magazine contended that Goldwater had a severely paranoid personality and was psychologically unfit to be president. Under Sullivan, Fact editor Ralph Ginzburg was found to have acted with actual malice: knowledge that the content was false before he published it or with reckless disregard of whether the information was false.
Provable truth is the ultimate defense in a libel suit. According to our federal law via Sullivan, if reporters get it wrong, they can certainly lose a libel case. And that’s how it should be.

Texto completo: Actor and author Andrew Rannells will bring his book "Too Much is Not Enough" to Naperville next month for an appearance at North Central College’s Wentz Concert Hall.
Rannells, who has starred in Broadway’s "The Book of Morman" and HBO’s "Girls," will sign copies of his book, pose for photos and participate in a question-and-answer session at 7 p.m. Tuesday, March 19, at 171 E. Chicago Ave. His appearance is sponsored by Anderson’s Bookshop.
Tickets are required and available exclusively at AndrewRannellsAndersons.brownpapertickets.com. Additional books will be sold at the event.
"Too Much is Not Enough" is a coming-of-age memoir of a Midwestern boy surviving bad auditions, bad relationships and some really bad highlights as he chases his dreams in New York City.
When Rannells left Nebraska for New York in 1997, he, like many young hopefuls, saw the city as a chance to break free. To start over. To transform the fiercely ambitious but sexually confused teenager he saw in the mirror into the Broadway leading man of his dreams.
In his book, Rannells takes readers on the journey of a 20-something hungry to experience everything New York has to offer: new friends, wild nights, great art, standing ovations.
At the heart of his hunger lies a powerful drive to reconcile the boy he was when he left Omaha with the man he desperately wants to be.
Rannells is best known for originating the role of Elder Price in "The Book of Mormon" and playing Elijah Krantz in "Girls."
A Tony and Drama Desk nominee and Grammy winner, he also has played Hedwig in "Hedwig and the Angry Inch," King George III in "Hamilton" and Whizzer in "Falsettos." He most recently starred in the 2018 Broadway revival of "The Boys in The Band."
In addition to "Girls," his TV appearances have included "The New Normal," "The Knick" and the recent Amazon anthology series "The Romanoffs." His film credits include "Why Him?" "The Intern," "Bachelorette" and "A Simple Favor."
His writing has been published in The New York Times "Modern Love" column. This is his first book.

PRESIDENT TRUMP ESCALATES ATTACKS ON NEW YORK TIMES

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Wednesday took direct aim at The New York Times, calling the news organization a "true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE," in an escalation from his previous lashings, which were typically addressed to a group of news organizations or over specific Times articles.
Mr. Trump did not cite a specific article in his Twitter post, but his blunt declaration came a day after The Times published a report describing how he had tried to influence and undermine investigations surrounding him, his presidential campaign and his administration.
The Times' publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, in a statement cited previous presidents of both political parties who not only championed the free press but said it was a crucial foundation of a free society.
The Times also defended the article about Mr. Trump, which it said "was rigorously reported and based on a review of confidential White House documents as well as interviews with dozens of current and former government officials and others close to President Trump."
COHEN PRISON STAY DELAYED UNTIL MAY 6
Michael Cohen can remain a free man for a bit longer so he can recover from shoulder surgery and testify before Congress, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled Wednesday.
Michael Monico, Cohen's new lawyer, put in a request that his client be allowed to start his three-year prison sentence May 6 instead of March 6, saying President Donald Trump's former personal attorney and fixer "needs to undergo intensive post-surgical physical therapy."
Mr. Monico also noted that Cohen expects to be called to testify before three congressional committees, and imprisonment would make the grillings harder to schedule.
BERNIE SANDERS TOUTS SUCCESSFUL FUNDRAISING
WASHINGTON - In the 24 hours since launching his second presidential bid, Bernie Sanders said he has raised roughly $6 million.
The independent senator from Vermont, who built a deep stable of low-dollar donors during his 2016 campaign, touted his fundraising haul in a Wednesday morning tweet, in which he claimed 225,000 contributors since making his new bid official Tuesday morning.
Mr. Sanders has also tapped Faiz Shakir, a veteran political operative who had been serving as the national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union, to manage his campaign.
In morning tweets Wednesday, President Donald Trump also greeted Mr. Sanders' entry into the contest.
"Crazy Bernie has just entered the race. I wish him well!" Mr. Trump said, using the same nickname he used to deride Mr. Sanders when he sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.
"What's crazy is that we have a president who is a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and a fraud," Mr. Sanders responded on Twitter. "We are going to bring people together and not only defeat Trump but transform the economic and political life of this country."

Texto completo: When in the grips of oratorical passion, President Obama liked to paraphrase the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. about the "long arc of history" bending toward justice.
But when it comes to the oratory of American politicians, history's long arc is bending away from such lofty rhetorical flourishes. New research finds that the punch-and-jab style of President Trump's public speech -- pugnaciously declarative, larded with personal pronouns, and light on the kinds of phrases that soften a claim or elevate an idea -- appears to be just where presidential discourse is headed.
The sweeping linguistic analysis of American leaders suggests that far from being an aberration, Trump's style of communication -- called "intuitive" because it closely resembles ordinary conversational speech -- is the most recent exemplar of a trend that goes back to the early 1900s.

For more than a century, presidents' public speech patterns have been evolving toward more forceful assertions of personal leadership -- a measure the researchers call "clout." At the same time, the complexity of presidential speech has been trending downward.
"Voters may increasingly be drawn to leaders who can make difficult, complex problems easier to understand with intuitive, confident answers," the psychology researchers wrote this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The findings "confirm that President Trump and leaders like him did not emerge out of nowhere," they added. Rather, when it comes to using language that conveys personal power and complex thought, Trump and similarly plain-spoken politicians "are the most recent incarnation of long-term political trends."
Kayla N. Jordan, a graduate student specializing in language and political psychology at the University of Texas, and her coauthors took a rigorous look at U.S. presidents' speech since 1780. They also explored the utterances of lawmakers in the House and Senate.
The effort subjected billions of words -- delivered on stumps, at rallies and behind lecterns -- to the scrutiny of computer software that deconstructs grammar and counts and classifies words by their function in a sentence.
Such "automated text analysis" can reveal the distinctive patterns of an individual's speech. Using similar methods in 2015, University of Texas psychologist James W. Pennebaker dissected a play of disputed authorship and judged it to have been written by William Shakespeare. (Pennebaker worked on the new study as well.)
Now psychologists are demonstrating that such text analysis can offer clues to a speaker's thinking style -- whether she is inclined to lead or follow others, whether he tends to see the world in simple or complex terms, and whether her views are shaped more by abstract ideas or by personal experiences.
"It's a fascinating idea: that grammar and speech reflects cognitive style," said University of Chicago psychologist Thomas Talhelm, whose own research explores the link between language and cultural and individual differences.
The oratory of British, Canadian, Australian and European Union leader also got the textual-analysis treatment. To compare political speech to other modes of communication, the researchers used software to dissect the language of 5,418 books, 11,921 movies, 2,141,668 articles published in the New York Times, and daily transcripts from the cable news channel CNN.
Few stark contrasts emerged among the world's English-speaking politicians. But one trend became evident over time: American presidents' style of speech was changing.
From the early days of the republic until around the outbreak of World War I, presidents spoke to the nation in a style that reflected a bent toward "analytic thinking," the researchers found. A linguistic measure of power and assertiveness -- clout -- stayed at a relatively low level.
Earlier presidents favored complex sentences that were more difficult for a casual listener to grasp. They used more prepositions -- words like "in," "above" and "whether" -- which tend to introduce context or stitch separate ideas into a single sentence. They went lighter on articles of speech like adverbs, the kinds of words that project power and action. And they used a lot of articles -- "the," "a" and "an" -- which usually precede nouns.
To understand why the copious use of articles and their fellow travelers, nouns, signifies abstract thinking, Jordan offers this illustration: Contrast a sentence such as "the people voted" with "the people engaged in voting behavior." An intuitive speaker would simply use the verb "voted." An abstract thinker would elevate it to an abstract behavior -- voting -- and use two nouns instead of one.
Finally, early presidents frequently used collective pronouns like "we" and "us," and they rarely used personal pronouns ("I," "me" and "my") that would invite a more direct and conversational connection to a listener. (For more on these distinctions, see Pennebaker's book "The Secret Life of Pronouns: What Our Words Say About Us.")
The language of pre-1900 presidents projected less authority as well, the authors said. These leaders used more negations -- "we won't do this" as opposed to "we'll do that" -- a form of speech that conveys less personal confidence. And they made greater use of grammatical constructions that hedged a bold assertion (words like "actually," "although," "despite" and "otherwise").
Clout and "analytic" speech don't necessarily oppose each other, and politicians rely on both to communicate. But the mix changes from person to person. Speech that is more intuitive may make a direct connection with an audience, something modern voters seem to value, Jordan said. And a leader's use of personal pronouns may promote that connection too. But those highly accessible turns of phrase don't position the speaker above his audience -- they don't convey clout. And they don't always sound very smart, she said.
Presidential patterns of speech started to change in the early 1900s. In inaugural speeches, State of the Union addresses, public papers and political debates, presidents began to address the nation in increasingly simple, straightforward sentences that a casual listener could more readily follow.
Around the time of Woodrow Wilson's presidency (1913 to 1921), speech that reflected high levels of analytical thought began to decline, and speech that conveyed a speaker's clout began to rise. Not every president fit the model perfectly, but the trend was clear: as the century progressed and the current millennium began, American presidents spoke ever more plainly, and in more confident and personal terms.
That trend almost certainly doesn't reflect the emergence of a simpler world, the authors said. Whether it reflects the rise of populism remains to be tested, they added.
What is apparent is that changes in presidential speaking styles track with rapid changes in the means of communication.
"The style used by early presidents who communicated through writing in newspapers and in-person speeches to small audiences likely was increasingly ineffective in the face of mass communication technologies, such as radio, television, and the internet today," the authors wrote.
By the time Trump came along, his high-clout, low-analysis mode of speech was not a stark departure from his immediate predecessors, the researchers found. And that includes Obama.
The only case in which Trump diverged significantly was in the candidate debates, where he was much less analytic and spoke with much more clout than what would have been predicted by the arc of presidential oratory. Because debates aren't scripted, they probably offer the best evidence of Trump's "natural inclination to a less analytic thinking style," the authors wrote.
"Our analysis suggests that Donald Trump -- while somewhat more extreme than would have been predicted -- conforms to the direction of previous trends and is not an outlier from those trends, statistically speaking," the team wrote.
To the extent that Jordan, Pennebaker and their colleagues infer leaders' individual thinking styles from their public speeches, they "may make the case a bit too strongly," said Talhelm, who was not involved in the study. But they certainly appear to have captured important shifts in the ways that leaders communicate with the public, including the decline of elitism, he said.
Oh, and that metaphor that conjures the abstract notion of morality and invites listeners to visualize its trajectory over time? If you ran that through a textual analysis, it would seem more typical of the speech that prevailed in the mid-19th century, right?
Indeed, it is: The adage that Obama was so fond of paraphrasing -- "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice" -- was first penned in 1853 by the abolitionist Unitarian minister Theodore Parker. The quotation reappeared in a number of forms throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and was reprised by King in a sermon delivered in 1964.

Texto completo: Some of the most zealous NeverTrump conservatives are seeking a candidate to challenge President Trump in the 2020 Republican primaries. It's an uphill slog in GOP politics, where the incumbent president enjoys substantial support and huge tactical advantages. But the NeverTrumpers' task could be further complicated by developments on the Democratic side of the race.

The dilemma: A primary challenge could weaken Trump and ensure the election of a Democrat. And as the Democratic Party lurches left, that could mean the work of NeverTrump conservatives ensures the election of a radical candidate on a platform of the Green New Deal, tax rates above 70 percent, universal health care, free college, even more liberal abortion policies, and more. It would be hard to imagine a more self-defeating result for activists who previously worked in conservative Republican politics.

This is not a secret. NeverTrump strategists are well aware that primary challenges weaken sitting presidents and help the opposition party. Some strategists are actually reminding potential supporters of that fact as they seek to organize a challenge to Trump. In 1976, President Gerald Ford faced a primary challenge and went on to lose the election. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter faced a primary challenge and went on to lose the election. In 1992, President George H.W. Bush faced a primary challenge and went on to lose the election.

Of course, there were other factors involved, particularly in the post-Watergate year of 1976. But in none of those cases did the primary challenger -- Ronald Reagan, Ted Kennedy, and Pat Buchanan -- go on to win his party's nomination that year.

Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist working with former Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol in an anti-Trump group called Defending Democracy Together, recently cited another example from history. "In 1968, incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson -- supposedly on a glide path to the Democratic nomination -- was stunned to win barely 50 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary against Sen. Eugene McCarthy's 42 percent," Longwell wrote in a February 1 Washington Post op-ed. "Johnson dropped out of the race."

Longwell neglected to mention that McCarthy did not go on to win the Democratic nomination in 1968. The man who did, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, was defeated in the general election. But Longwell's NeverTrump readers cannot have failed to get the message: Challenge Trump and he will lose.

Last month, the New York Times reported that Longwell and Kristol "have been meeting with Republican donors and potential challengers, sharing focus-group and polling data about the president's vulnerability with what they call 'Reluctant Trump Voters.'"

If NeverTrump politicos persuade a reasonably well-known Republican -- Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, or former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, who has just launched an exploratory committee -- to challenge Trump in the GOP primaries, the likely result will not be that the party will nominate Hogan or Kasich or Weld but that it will nominate an incumbent damaged by the primary battle.

"I think any primary challenge of Trump is doomed to fail and silly to even start," Republican strategist Brad Todd told me in a recent email exchange. "Trump was the left-most candidate in the 2016 primary, and now his record is more conservative than his platform was then. You don't beat Republican incumbents in primaries from the left. The question is whether NeverTrumpers are willing to get it out of their system via a primary challenge. If they run a primary and lose, will they unite to beat the socialists in November? That is the question we should be asking."

Another GOP strategist, David Carney, suggested that Trump has vulnerabilities, while at the same time NeverTrumpers are not the ones to exploit them.

"The tone and tenor matter more than just running," Carney said in an email exchange. "The problem with the NeverTrumpers is they never gave Trump a chance and are perceived as being negative, on the whole, about everything Trump does or says. Primary voters will think they were not 'team members.' Someone else, if they run a serious effort and not just for media attention, could have a shot."

Perhaps. NeverTrumpers point to a few polls from early voting states to show that Republican voters would be open to a primary challenge to Trump. Longwell noted a Des Moines Register poll showing 63 percent of registered Republicans in Iowa would be open to a challenge, and a New Hampshire Journal poll showing 40 percent of GOP voters think a challenge would be a good thing.

At the moment, such polls are the NeverTrumpers' best case for a challenge. But there are doubts about whether the surveys really say much, because voters generally don't like to tell pollsters that their minds are closed a year before an election. "At this early point in any campaign, people are not going to shut their minds," said Republican pollster David Winston in a recent conversation. "They just don't do that. There's a huge difference between people saying they're thinking through things and how they behave. My guess is those polls are probably true, but that's because the electorate is trying to be thoughtful."

Winston believes the Democratic move to the left will change the nature of the 2020 race. The more Democrats advocate policies that were on the party's far left just a short time ago -- and are still out of the larger political mainstream -- the more the race will become a referendum on the future of the country, on which way it should go, and not on the personalities of the candidates. That could unite Republicans -- and many independents -- against moving in a policy direction so antithetical to their beliefs.

An example of that, Winston noted, is the recent progressive Democratic opposition that forced Amazon to pull out of a plan to build a second headquarters in New York City. The Amazon opponents, Winston wrote in Roll Call, "showed the American people the real-world consequences of progressive socialism and gave Republicans the perfect example to illustrate the choice in 2020 -- radical economic policies that cost jobs or pragmatic, commonsense economic policies that drive growth and create jobs."

But maybe there is some other way a GOP Trump challenge might work. Maybe the Democratic Party will shift again and nominate former Vice President Joe Biden as a more centrist candidate. It's possible, although it seems hard to believe Biden could win the nomination without moving steadily left. In any event, NeverTrumpers could cite a "moderate" Biden presidency as an acceptable outcome of their challenge to Trump.

That is theoretically possible, but the fact is, the 2020 choice is likely to be between Trump and a sharp turn left. And if that comes to pass, NeverTrumpers challenging the president -- on the explicit grounds that the challenge will weaken him and cause him to lose -- would be a key part of that sharp turn left.

There is yet one more possibility. Some NeverTrumpers could be betting that a damning report from Trump-Russia special counsel Robert Mueller will fatally weaken Trump and possibly lead to impeachment and even removal from office, sending Republicans scrambling for another candidate. In that case, it is probably safe to say that the GOP would be screwed whatever it does. A NeverTrump challenge would be just one element of an extremely ugly post-Mueller intra-party battle.

Short of that, though, it seems likely that Republican voters will stick with the Republican president. And that is even more likely if Democrats keep moving left. Yet some NeverTrumpers, long committed to "disposing of" Trump (Kristol's phrase), will no doubt keep trying, no matter where that might lead.

George Pyle: Three newspaper publishers I’m glad I don’t work for

Texto completo: In about four decades in the newspaper dodge, I’ve worked for editors (in charge of the news-gathering operation) and publishers (who run the whole shooting match) who were old, young, male, female, conservative, liberal, loud, quiet, tall and dark, short and fair, anchored to their communities, just passing through, who ran their newspapers from a typewriter or from an adding machine.
Only one of them fired me. So far.
I was lucky I never had to report to — or about — anybody like this:
An Alabama newspaper editor wants to bring back lynching — Antonia Noori Farzan | The Washington Post
"Two decades ago, the editor of the tiny Democrat-Reporter newspaper in Linden, Alabama, was being talked about as a potential contender for the Pulitzer Prize. ... Glowing profiles in The New York Times, People magazine and the American Journalism Review highlighted his tenacious reporting and down-home Southern charm.
"Now, Goodloe Sutton is back in the news again — this time because he recently called for mass lynchings and suggested that the Ku Klux Klan should return to ‘clean out’ Washington. ...
“When the Advertiser’s Melissa Brown asked him whether it was appropriate for a newspaper publisher to suggest that Americans should be lynched, Sutton replied, ‘It’s not calling for the lynchings of Americans. These are socialist-communists we’re talking about. Do you know what socialism and communism is?’ ...”
Alabama newspaper editor calls for Klan return to ‘clean out D.C.’ — Melissa Brown | The Montgomery [Ala.] Advertiser
“The editor of a small-town Alabama newspaper published an editorial calling for “the Ku Klux Klan to night ride again” against ‘Democrats in the Republican Party and Democrats (who) are plotting to raise taxes in Alabama.’
"Goodloe Sutton, who is the publisher of the Democrat-Reporter newspaper in Linden, confirmed to the Montgomery Advertiser on Monday that he authored the Feb. 14 editorial calling for the return of a white supremacist hate group. ...
Post-Gazette Appoints Writer of ‘Reason as Racism’ Editorial as Its Newsroom Leader — Kim Lyons | The New York Times
"PITTSBURGH — Last year, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette chose Martin Luther King’s Birthday as the publication date for an editorial headlined “Reason as Racism.” On Monday, a little more than a year after that piece drew national criticism, The Post-Gazette named its editorial page director, Keith C. Burris, as its newsroom leader.
Mr. Burris was appointed executive editor at a stormy time at the Pittsburgh daily.
Relations between its workers’ union, the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh, and the paper’s owner, Block Communications, have been tense. Things came to a head on the night of Feb. 9, when John R. Block, the publisher, subjected staff members to a tirade in the newsroom. According to several journalists who were present, Mr. Block threatened employees’ jobs as his young daughter, whom he had brought with him, sobbed and begged him to stop. Block Communications has disputed the journalists’ version of events. ...
" ... Mr. Burris also had a hand in the firing of a longtime editorial cartoonist, Rob Rogers , in June, after Mr. Rogers complained that his cartoons critical of President Trump had been censored. ..."
I actually interviewed to be the editorial page editor of the other newspaper the Block family owns, The Toledo Blade, when both newspapers were run by other, rather more reasonable, members of the same family. That’s one job interview that I am glad didn’t go anywhere.
Arizona newspaper publisher uses his publication to accuse wife of poisoning attempt — Associated Press via NBC
"PRESCOTT, Ariz. — An award-winning Arizona newspaper publisher and his wife are locked in a bizarre divorce case that has morphed into something more: a journalism ethics saga.
"Joseph Soldwedel has accused his wife, Felice Soldwedel, in a lawsuit of trying to kill him by poisoning him, and detailed the allegations in one of the small-town newspapers he owns, the 13,000-circulation Prescott Daily Courier.
"None of the three news stories in the paper named his wife. But the Courier ran an ad accusing her by name, with a photo of her, bordered with images of skulls and rats. The ad said she had an unnamed accomplice, and it offered a $10,000 reward for tips.
“Soldwedel’s wife of eight years calls the poisoning claims ludicrous and says he is retaliating against her for seeking a divorce. ...”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday called for reconsideration of the Supreme Court's landmark decision making it more difficult for public officials to claim defamation as the court turned down a request from an accuser of Bill Cosby.
The court declined to take the case of Kathrine McKee, who accused Cosby of raping her more than 40 years ago. She sued after Cosby's attorney leaked a letter that she said distorted her background to "damage her reputation for truthfulness and honesty" and to shame her.
Thomas said he agreed with his colleagues not to accept McKee's "factbound" appeal.
But he launched a detailed critique of the landmark libel ruling, which he said was a "policy-driven" decision "masquerading as constitutional law." No other justice joined his concurrence.
But President Donald Trump has also expressed support for making it easier to sue for defamation, and during the campaign - and afterward - he complained about "hit pieces" in The Washington Post and The New York Times.
"I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money," Trump said during the campaign. Over the weekend, he complained about a "Saturday Night Live" skit and wondered about "retribution."
Some media law experts expressed concern over Thomas' declaration.
Jonathan Peters, a professor of media law at the University of Georgia, said New York Times v. Sullivan "is essential to our modern understanding of press freedom."
Peters said the ruling "had the immediate impact of emboldening news organizations to cover the civil rights movement more forcefully - and later the Vietnam War and Watergate."
But Thomas and Justice Antonin Scalia have said the court may have intruded into a space in which it was not needed.
"We should not continue to reflexively apply this policy driven approach to the Constitution," Thomas wrote. "Instead, we should carefully examine the original meaning of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. If the Constitution does not require public figures to satisfy an actual-malice standard in state-law defamation suits, then neither should we."
The media for decades has depended on New York Times v. Sullivan as a shield for reporting on public figures. But Thomas said Justice Byron White had also expressed concern after he was in the majority in the case.

Focusing on electrification, Honda to close English plant

Texto completo: One of the biggest employers in Ohio, Honda, has said it will shut down a vehicle assembly operation in the United Kingdom.
Honda of the UK Manufacturing (HUM) said it is focusing anew on electrified cars, a response to sweeping changes in the global automotive industry.
“The significant challenges of electrification will see Honda revise its global manufacturing operations, and focus activity in regions where it expects to have high production volumes,” the company said in a statement Tuesday.
“Under this proposed restructure, HUM’s current role as a global manufacturing hub may no longer be viable,” the automaker added.
The automaker said it was informing Swindon employees that at the end of the current model’s production lifecycle, in 2021, that plant will be closed.
The Swindon plant produces 150,000 cars per year, and employs about 3,500 people, Honda said.
Greg Clark, Britain’s business secretary, called the decision “devastating,” the New York Times reported.
Honda has about 13,000 Ohio employees, mostly in West-Central Ohio north of Springfield and northwest of Columbus, as well as an extensive distribution operation in Troy.
The company has estimated that about 1,000 Dayton-area residents commute to its Ohio assembly plants each day, including its Anna engine plant located about an hour’s drive north of Dayton along Interstate 75.
Asked if the accelerated focus on electrification held any implications for Ohio plants, a company spokesman in Ohio said efforts to strengthen electrification will be concentrated in China, Japan and the United States.
“It’s too early to speculate on impacts on specific plants at this time,” Honda spokesman Chris Abbruzzese said.

Sen. Bernie Sanders Says He's Running For President In 2020

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose insurgent 2016 presidential campaign reshaped Democratic politics, announced Tuesday that he is running for president in 2020.
"Our campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump," the 77-year-old self-described democratic socialist said in an email to supporters. "Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice."
An enthusiastic progressive who embraces proposals ranging from Medicare for All to free college tuition, Sanders stunned the Democratic establishment in 2016 with his spirited challenge to Hillary Clinton. While she ultimately became the party's nominee, his campaign helped lay the groundwork for the leftward lurch that has dominated Democratic politics in the Trump era.
The question now for Sanders is whether he can stand out in a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates who also embrace many of his policy ideas and are newer to the national political stage. That's far different from 2016, when he was Clinton's lone progressive adversary.
Still, there is no question that Sanders will be a formidable contender for the Democratic nomination. He won more than 13 million votes in 2016 and dozens of primaries and caucuses. He opens his campaign with a nationwide organization and a proven small-dollar fundraising effort.
"We're gonna win," Sanders told CBS.
He said he was going to launch "what I think is unprecedented in modern American history": a grassroots movement "to lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political life of this country."
Sanders described his new White House bid as a "continuation of what we did in 2016," noting that policies he advocated for then are now embraced by the Democratic Party.
"You know what's happened in over three years?" he said. "All of these ideas and many more are now part of the political mainstream."
Sanders could be well positioned to compete in the nation's first primary in neighboring New Hampshire, which he won by 22 points in 2016. But he won't have the state to himself.
Sen. Kamala Harris of California, another Democratic presidential contender, was in New Hampshire on Monday and said she'd compete for the state. She also appeared to take a dig at Sanders.
"The people of New Hampshire will tell me what's required to compete in New Hampshire," she told shoppers at a bookstore in Concord. "But I will tell you I'm not a democratic socialist."
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of nearby Massachusetts will be in New Hampshire on Friday.
One of the biggest questions surrounding Sanders' candidacy is how he'll compete against someone like Warren, who shares many of his policy goals. Warren has already launched her campaign and has planned an aggressive swing through the early primary states.
Shortly after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren hired Brendan Summers, who managed Sanders' 2016 Iowa campaign. Other staffers from Sanders' first bid also have said they would consider working for other candidates in 2020.
The crowded field includes a number of other candidates who will likely make strong appeals to the Democratic base including Harris and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. The field could also grow, with a number of high-profile Democrats still considering presidential bids, including former Vice President Joe Biden and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.
While Sanders had been working to lay the groundwork for a second campaign for months, it was unclear whether he will be able to expand his appeal beyond his largely white base of supporters. In 2016, Sanders notably struggled to garner support from black voters, an issue that could become particularly pervasive during a primary race that could include several non-white candidates.
Last month, he joined Booker at an event in Columbia, South Carolina, marking the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. In 2016, Sanders lost the South Carolina primary, which features a heavily black electorate, by 47 points.
Sanders also faces different pressures in the #MeToo era. Some of his male staffers and supporters in 2016 were described as "Bernie bros" for their treatment of women.
In the run-up to Sanders' 2020 announcement, persistent allegations emerged of sexual harassment of women by male staffers during his 2016 campaign. Politico and The New York Times reported several allegations of unwanted sexual advances and pay inequity.
In an interview with CNN after the initial allegations surfaced, Sanders apologized but also noted he was "a little busy running around the country trying to make the case."
As additional allegations emerged, he offered a more unequivocal apology.
"What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable and certainly not what a progressive campaign - or any campaign - should be about," Sanders said Jan. 10 on Capitol Hill. "Every woman in this country who goes to work today or tomorrow has the right to make sure that she is working in an environment which is free of harassment, which is safe and is comfortable, and I will do my best to make that happen."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is considering four people to be his next United Nations ambassador: Goldman Sachs Group partner Dina Powell; the current ambassadors to Canada and Germany, Kelly Craft and Richard Grenell, respectively; and John James, a former Republican Senate candidate from Michigan, according to people familiar with the matter.
The people asked not to be identified because Trump hasn't made a decision. Top White House aides have also discussed nominating Trump's daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump if no front-runner emerges.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert withdrew her nomination to replace Nikki Haley in the job, partly due to issues that arose around a nanny Nauert once employed. The nanny was a legal U.S. immigrant but wasn't authorized to work, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Powell is a veteran of the Trump administration who served as a deputy national security adviser before returning to Goldman Sachs last year. Craft was deeply involved in Trump's renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and is married to Joe Craft, a billionaire Republican fundraiser and executive at coal producer Alliance Resource Partners.
Grenell manages the U.S. relationship with the German government, which has grown tense because of a variety of conflicts, including the president's consideration of tariffs on imported cars.
James fell short in an attempt to unseat Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow last year.
Tensions increase in Kashmir as 9 are killed in gunbattle
SRINAGAR, India - Tensions escalated in the aftermath of a suicide attack in disputed Kashmir, with nine people killed Monday in a gunbattle.
Government forces surrounded a village in the southern Pulwama area on a tip that militants were hiding there, security officials said. As troops began conducting searches, they came under heavy gunfire, leading to a clash that killed four soldiers, three suspected militants, a police official and a civilian.
Three army officers, a senior police officer and three other soldiers were wounded in the operation, which follows a Feb. 14 suicide attack on a paramilitary convoy that killed at least 40 soldiers.
India blamed the attack on Pakistan and promised a "jaw-breaking response."
Pakistan has warned India against linking it to the attack without an investigation.
New York City guidelines take aim at hairstyle discrimination
NEW YORK - New York City doesn't want people to have their hairstyles held against them, and it unveiled novel guidelines Monday against hairdo discrimination.
The new legal guidance says the city's existing human rights law protects New Yorkers' right to "maintain natural hair or hairstyles that are closely associated with their racial, ethnic or cultural identities."
The New York Times reported that they are believed to be the first such measure nationwide.
In effect, the guidance enables people to seek fines and other remedies if they've been harassed or punished in workplaces, schools or public spaces because of their hair texture or style. Hair nets, ties and the like can still be required for health and safety reasons.
Stone apologizes for photo of judge with crosshairs symbol
NEW YORK - Roger Stone apologized to the federal judge overseeing his criminal case Monday after blasting her as an "Obama appointed" partisan and posting and deleting a photo of her face next to what appeared to be a crosshairs symbol.
The embattled confidant to President Donald Trump initially put out the picture of U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Instagram but deleted it after reporters asked about the symbol.
Minutes later, he posted the photo with the crosshairs cropped out but still called Jackson a shill for special counsel Robert Mueller - even though the federal judge had issued a gag order on his case last week.
Hours later, Stone deleted that photo and filed a formal "notice of apology" in Jackson's Washington court.
Mexico to close infamous island penal colony
MEXICO CITY - Mexico will close a famed island penal colony off the country's Pacific coast and convert it into a cultural and environmental education center, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Monday.
The federal prison on the largest of the Islas Marias will release about 200 of its approximately 600 inmates and the rest will be relocated to other prisons.
The prison founded in 1905 on Maria Madre passed through periods of infamous brutality. When Panama closed its Isla Coiba penal colony in 2004, Isla Marias was the last one remaining in the Americas.
He noted that the last riot there occurred in 2003 because it was over capacity. At that time there were 8,000 prisoners there, he said.
The island is about 70 miles off the coast of Nayarit state.
Oakland Diocese names 45 accused of sexual abuse
OAKLAND, Calif. - The Catholic Diocese of Oakland has released the names of 45 priests, deacons and religious brothers who officials say are "credibly accused" of sexually abusing minors.
The San Francisco Chronicle said Monday that Oakland's list goes back to 1962 - when the diocese was founded. None of the men are currently in the ministry. Of the 45 people named, 20 were priests.
Oakland is the latest in a series of dioceses across the country to release names amid a scandal involving pedophile priests and decades of church cover-ups.
Most of the listed abuse dates from the 1960s into the 1980s. Diocese officials say there have been no credible accusations of abuse since 1988, but acknowledge that the list may grow in the coming months.
In Bolivia: A passenger bus crashed head-on with a dump truck in southern Bolivia on Monday, killing at least 24 people and injuring 12 more, police said.
The accident occurred in a dense fog about 135 miles south of the capital, La Paz. Two buses collided on the same highway in January, killing 22 people.
In Britain: British border officials have picked up 34 people thought to be migrants who were trying to cross the English Channel in a small boat. The Home Office said their nationalities were unknown, but they were taken ashore for interviews Monday while three men were arrested for suspected immigration offenses.

Don't make it easy for Trump to hide his failure

Texto completo: By E.J. Dionne Jr.

WASHINGTON -- President Trump's regular threats to close down parts of the government to vindicate an applause line make you almost nostalgic for the shutdowns of the past.

When Sen Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pushed the government to a 16-day halt in 2013 in an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, at least he was fighting over something that mattered.

I said "almost" about that nostalgia because the closure Cruz championed was, from the beginning, a doomed tactical ploy for a wrongheaded objective. Josh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called Cruz's gambit "a toddler's version of legislating."

That Trump's fixation over a useless border wall looks even more juvenile than a preschooler's tantrum explains why Republicans, including McConnell, finally said "Enough!" to a president they had been coddling for fear of retaliation and in the pursuit of conservative dominance over the federal judiciary. This time, they told him he had to surrender his wall-funding dreams.

But the Republicans did not come to this realization entirely of their own accord. A little over a month ago, the same McConnell said he would not bring budget legislation to the floor that he knew the president would veto. The result was the wrenching 35-day shutdown.

McConnell did not reckon with the impact of Democratic control of the House of Representatives. With power in her hands, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, along with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, refused to accommodate a presidential objective they knew was phony and, worse, racist in its underlying motivation. This is why Pelosi (to much hand-wringing) called the wall "immoral."

The president's proclivity to tweet or talk without much reflection was helpful on this front, too. On Sunday, he picked up on a Gallup Poll suggesting, as Trump put it, that "Open Borders will potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans." He added: "This would be a disaster for the U.S. We need the Wall now!"

So we know it's "Latin Americans" in general and not just those "criminals" he talks about whom Trump sees as the grave danger. And, by the way, the compromise spending bill shows that Democrats have no interest in "open borders."

Trump's lost mojo with Senate Republicans creates a new playing field. Republicans can see what a 2020 thumping would look like in the nearly 10-million-vote margin Democrats won in the 2018 House races. They also learned from the price they paid for the last shutdown that they will be blamed for the president's shenanigans.

Meanwhile, Trump shows no signs of backing down from his fantasy approach to public communications. He updated his "Build the Wall!" slogan into "Finish the Wall!" as if he has achieved something he has not.

Noting Trump's recent statement that "we're building a lot of wall," The New York Times calmly reported on Tuesday: "In fact, no new walls have been built or financed by Congress based on the prototypes that the Trump administration unveiled in October 2017. Projects to replace or repair about 40 miles of existing barriers have been started or completed since 2017."

But Democrats need to learn lessons from all this, too. First, they should stay tough. Second, they need to be disciplined.

This episode shows that standing up to Trump's worst instincts will pay rewards. Democrats forced Senate Republicans into a very old-fashioned conference committee that reached a budget deal in a very old-fashioned way because the legislators were operating in a largely Trump-free zone. This only happened because Democrats resisted calls to play Trump's game. "Comity" and "civility" are never achieved by capitulating to bullying and hostage-taking.

At the same time, the GOP, including Trump, is already signaling that its main goal is to pick up on the most adventurous proposals from Democratic legislators -- and any reckless or offensive statements from individual Democrats -- to pretend that Republicans are, against the evidence of the last two years, a mainstream bunch.

Dealing with this issue is much trickier. For the long run, it's useful for progressive Democrats to push the boundaries of the policy debate. But they should leave the incendiary tweets to Trump, keep the focus on his extremism, and legislate in areas where their party is united -- political reform, voting rights, repairs to the health care system, protections for the Dreamers, and infrastructure.

Successful parties manage to do more than one thing at the same time. To keep the initiative, the Democrats need to show that they can master this essential political art.

Historian dives into Indiana's story

Texto completo: Growing up in Brooklyn, Susan Hall Dotson's parents and grandparents regaled her with stories of the people and places of New York City, and, as a self-described "newspaper head," she spent Sunday mornings reading The New York Times or Daily News and devoured Ebony, Life and Look magazines.
Museums were always accessible, and she spent countless hours at the Brooklyn Museum, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Museum of Modern Art. She noted that as children, "you take in more than you realize."
As the new coordinator of African-American history at the Indiana Historical Society, Dotson hasn't missed a beat "taking in" the history of Indiana since she started her job in July.
Dotson is carving her own path in a position formerly held by the late Wilma Moore, who died this past spring. Moore retired from the IHS in 2017 after a 30-year career as a passionate champion of black history education in Indiana.
Dotson has immersed herself in the stories of blacks in Indiana. She's traveled to the early black settlement of Lyles Station and met descendants of the settlers. She also went to the site of the Marion lynchings and learned about former Indiana KKK leader D.C. Stephenson.
The Cleveland State University graduate focused on communications for most of her career and worked in every aspect of media in her 30-plus years, from research and exhibits to radio and advertising. That includes a stint at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, where she served as senior coordinator of community programs, which meant working with the likes of The Temptations, B.B. King, Bonnie Raitt and Cheap Trick.
"9/11 comes, and I get laid off along with 21 people. There are no jobs in marketing, because those are the first jobs to go," Dotson said. Her mindset of "always interested in history but not as a scholarly pursuit," was about to change.
She returned to Cleveland State, where she received her master's degree in history with a minor in black studies. Right out of the gate, she began working as director of community relations and curator of the Western Reserve Historical Society, where she spent the past 12 years.
It's been a whirlwind year for Dotson: On the day of her going-away party in Cleveland, she became engaged to architect Olon Dotson and soon after, started a new job at the Indiana Historical Society. The couple got married at the Eugene and Marilyn Glick Indiana History Center in November.
Dotson has set some goals in her new job: "To continue what the historical society as well as what Wilma did in collecting the stories and the requisite collections of film, photos, journals, diaries and correspondence from everyday black people throughout the state."
With that goal in mind, she is encouraging people to share their memorabilia with the Historical Society.
As for exhibits, she said "my biggest goal is to take what we have and take it out of the box and put them on exhibit in the society's 'You Are There' interactive exhibits like the Madame Walker exhibit that will be unveiled in this fall," Dotson said.
Dodson is not afraid to stir things up in her new role, too.
"Someone coming from the outside doesn't have the boundaries," she said. "I want more exhibits, to collect more items and not tell the same stories, and give light to the difficult stories. I don't run from the bad stories, because bad stories are the real stories. It's not a blame game. It is what it is, not just a black story, it's white people's story, it's everyone's story, but how we tell the story is important."

Texto completo: Marc Stein, an N.B.A. reporter for more than 30 years who now covers the league for The New York Times, and Ralph Lawler, longtime broadcaster for the Los Angeles Clippers, were honored on Friday by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which named them as the 2019 Curt Gowdy Media Award recipients for their contributions to basketball.
Stein, 49, and Lawler, 80, will be among those honored at the Hall of Fame's September enshrinement ceremonies in Springfield, Mass.
Stein started his career covering the Clippers and then the Lakers for The Los Angeles Daily News, before moving to The Dallas Morning News as a Mavericks beat reporter and eventually a national columnist. From there, he went to ESPN for 15 years, developing a reputation for breaking news and helping the network build its digital coverage of the N.B.A. He joined The Times in 2017.
Lawler has announced that he will retire at the end of this season after more than 2,000 broadcasts in his 30 years with the Clippers. He established his reputation as a broadcaster in Philadelphia, working on Phillies, Flyers and 76ers games.
The Hall of Fame also announced 13 finalists for induction this year, including four first-time finalists: Marques Johnson, the 1977 national collegiate player of the year; Jack Sikma, a seven-time N.B.A. All-Star; Ben Wallace, a four-time recipient of the Defensive Player of the Year Award; and Paul Westphal, a four-time All-Star and a longtime coach.
The other finalists are Leta Andrews, Hugh Evans, Bill Fitch, Bobby Jones, Sidney Moncrief, Barbara Stevens, Eddie Sutton, Teresa Weatherspoon and Chris Webber.
The election results will be announced at the men's Final Four in April.

Texto completo: Patrick Caddell, a pollster who in his mid-20s helped propel Jimmy Carter to the White House but who later backed Donald Trump for president, has died.

Caddell died at 68 of complications from a stroke, the New York Times reported.

Caddell earned national buzz advising the 1972 Democratic primary campaign of Sen. George McGovern. The campaign of McGovern, a left-wing populist from South Dakota, used new party rules to capture the nomination over more establishment rivals, though he lost in a landslide that fall to Republican president Richard Nixon.

Caddell, a Harvard senior during that campaign, then hooked on with the nascent White House effort of former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter. Little-known nationally, Carter followed Caddell's advice in campaigning heavily ahead of the Iowa caucuses and building up party support in states his rivals weren't targeting as heavily.

After beating President Gerald Ford, Carter frequently turned to Caddell for political advice. But not all of Caddell's governing-related insights proved as far-sighted as his campaign work. Caddell urged Carter in 1979 to address the nation on what the president perceived as a national torpor and loss of spirit. Widely derided as the "malaise" speech — though Carter never used that term — Caddell's professional reputation took a hit.

Still, he continued to attract big-name Democratic clients. During the late Reagan years, he advised Sen. Joe Biden's campaign for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. Caddell was known as an outsize presence on the Delaware senator's campaign who frequently clashed with other advisers. No matter, the future vice president's campaign imploded amid plagiarism charges, and Caddell was out in the political cold.

Caddell in the 1990s became disaffected with the Democratic Party, criticizing it for shunning its populist roots and relying on corporate cash. In later years, Caddell appeared frequently on Fox News and advised Steve Bannon, who became President Trump’s chief White House strategist.

Texto completo: How do you know if a stock is a good deal? Or the stock market?
The industry bombards us with complicated analysis and unreadable, unnecessarily intimidating jargon. How can you simplify it to what matters?
The easiest way to fathom a stock’s (or the market’s) value is to think like you’re buying the whole business. What’s the price, and what will you get back in the long run?
The price part is easy. Stock prices and broad indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 are quoted widely.
For the “get back” part, many use a figure called the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E. It’s a stock or index price divided by its earnings per share. Some use the past 12 months’ earnings. Others use estimates for the next year (which I prefer, called forward P/Es). If a P/E is 12, you’re paying $12 for every dollar of earnings. Most pundits presume stocks are expensive when P/Es are high and cheap when they’re low. They think high P/E implies low return potential (and vice versa). But there is a better two-step way.
First, flip it by dividing earnings by price. Or, just look up the stock’s P/E ratio at Google Finance and invert it (divide 1 by the P/E). Currently, the S&P 500’s forward P/E is 16. So divide 1 by 16, and you get 0. 0625 or 6. 25 percent. This is the S&P 500’s “earnings yield. ” It’s what you would get each year after tax, forever, if the S&P 500 were a company, you owned it all – 100 percent – and earnings never grew.
Second, to sense value, compare them to long-term bond interest rates. Ten-year U. S. Treasurys currently pay 2. 73 percent. Stocks’ earnings yield is much higher, so a better long-term deal. BBB-rated corporate bonds – investment grade for the average public company, not too risky – yield 4. 45 percent. That’s pretax, so in an average family with a 26 percent tax rate (state and federal) that’s 3. 3 percent after you take out taxes.
Stocks’ 6. 25 percent is almost twice as high. So owning the S&P 500 earns a better return than lending to these same companies.
As mentioned earlier, the earnings yield is your forever, after-tax return from all stocks if earnings never grow. But they do grow! Businesses adapt in the long term, capturing technological change and innovation. New inventions bring new sources of corporate earnings. Think about how many products use a simple microchip. Firm’s routinely dream up new ways to collide evolving technology with basic products and services. Medical progress is unending. It’s all future potential profit.
When you own stocks, you own that future. When you lend by owning bonds, you don’t. You get fixed interest payments. If you need long-term growth to fund your long-term retirement, stocks are the surest way to get it. Earnings yields tell you this future is a bargain today.
Of course, that says nothing about stock prices a month, six months or a year from now. Could be higher or lower. Those wiggles are the short-term and all about society’s varying sentiment toward owing volatile assets. This framework is just how to measure value in the long term and a great way to think about value. For more – and to learn more about different market segments – try some classic investment books. Andrew Tobias’ "The Only Investment Guide You’ll Ever Need" is quite handy. So is "The Wall Street Journal Guide to Understanding Money & Investing. "

Ilhan Omar's History of America; The United States as Cold War villain.

Texto completo: Not that it will make Israelis feel any better, but Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) doesn't seem to like America all that much, either.
Shortly after apologizing for anti-Semitic comments, the House freshman Democrat set about trashing America's conduct during its successful Cold War against the Soviet empire.
Rep. Omar's views may not have been entirely clear to Minnesota voters last November. A public broadcasting report shortly before her November election to the U.S. House described her this way:
Omar fled her native Somalia when she was 8 years old and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya. She came to the US as a 12-year-old and eventually settled in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, which has long been a first stop for new arrivals in the US. There, she "fell in love with democracy" and started spending time as a community organizer until she ran for office.
... For Omar, the inspiration to get involved in politics came from her family, who were always talking about politics, world news and democracy over meals.
But in a New York Times report almost two months after last year's election, her experience in America didn't exactly sound like a love affair:
Her arrival in this country was the first time, Ms. Omar has said, that she had confronted "my otherness" as both a black person and a Muslim. She became a citizen in 2000, when she was 17. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, she decided to wear the hijab, as an open declaration of her identity. But from "the first day we arrived in America," she said, she concluded that it was not the golden land that she had heard about.
"I think back to the orientations I went through a little over 20 years ago in the process of coming to this country, and in those orientations they did not have people who were homeless. There was an America that extended liberty and justice to everyone. There was an America where prosperity was guaranteed regardless of where you were born and what you looked like and who you prayed to," she said, adding, "I wasn't comfortable with that hypocrisy."
Many Americans are no doubt sorry our country didn't live up to her expectations. But if Ms. Omar thought prosperity in America was guaranteed, the fault lies with those expectations. The real guarantee that has inspired millions of people to come to this land is the freedom to succeed or fail.
And while Rep. Omar may claim that she "fell in love with democracy," recent events suggest it was at best a temporary crush. How else to explain her recent tweet echoing the propaganda of Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro as he presides over a humanitarian disaster and prevents the restoration of that country's democracy? Wrote Rep. Omar:
A US backed coup in Venezuela is not a solution to the dire issues they face. Trump's efforts to install a far right opposition will only incite violence and further destabilize the region. We must support Mexico, Uruguay & the Vatican's efforts to facilitate a peaceful dialogue.
There is no U.S.-backed coup. As the Journal's Mary Anastasia O'Grady explained recently, the Venezuelan constitution gives the democratically elected National Assembly the power to declare Mr. Maduro's 2018 re-election invalid. "It did so at the time because the election didn't meet minimum democratic standards. The Lima Group of Latin American nations, Canada, the Group of Seven leading industrial nations and the European Union all refused to recognize the election for the same reasons," noted Ms. O'Grady, adding:
As a result, when Mr. Maduro's first term expired on Jan. 10 there was no legitimately elected president and the seat was legally vacant. According to the constitution, the job then fell to the president of the National Assembly, Mr. Guaidó. The U.S. didn't "anoint" him president, nor did he anoint himself; he is constitutionally obligated to accept the role for an interim period and organize a new election.
Dozens of democracies around the world have recognized Mr. Guaidó's government, called for a new presidential election, or both. He has the backing of the Organization of American States, the Lima Group and the European Parliament.
The Venezuelan people are desperate to end the era of misery and hyperinflation. But this week Rep. Omar used an appearance on Capitol Hill by Elliott Abrams, the U.S. special envoy to Venezuela, to try to score political points on behalf of Mr. Maduro. RealClearPolitics has a video of the amazing exchange at the House foreign relations committee in which Rep. Omar essentially expressed the Marxist view of the Cold War. She attacked the former Reagan administration official for a 1982 atrocity in El Salvador by U.S.-backed forces that massacred hundreds of people. She didn't mention that during the Cold War America's communist foes massacred a hundred million people in atrocities too numerous to count.
Here's RealClear's transcript:
REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): ...You later said that the U.S. policy in El Salvador was a fabulous achievement. Yes or no do you still think so?
ABRAMS: From the day that President Duarte was elected in a free election to this day, El Salvador has been a democracy. That's a fabulous achievement.
OMAR: Yes or no, do you think that massacre was a fabulous achievement that happened under our watch?
ABRAMS: That is a ridiculous question.
OMAR: Yes or no?
ABRAMS: No.
OMAR: I will take that as a yes.
ABRAMS: I am not going to respond to that kind of personal attack, which is not a question.
Rep. Omar wasn't done. "Yes or no, would you support an armed faction within Venezuela that engages in war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide if you believed they were serving U.S. interests, as you did in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala?" she asked.
Whose interest is Rep. Omar serving?

Peter Kauffmann, a former spokesman for Hillary Clinton and longtime Queens resident, noted that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was elected with fewer votes than Amazon was promising in jobs.
"I don't think anyone knows right now what the political consequences of that will be," he said in a Thursday interview. "Traditionally, if you define yourself by opposing good jobs for your district, it's not good for you electorally. I'm not sure one primary election, no matter how earth-shattering, changes that dynamic."

Texto completo: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday unveiled a plan to address PFAS chemicals, a class of toxic man-made compounds that has contaminated drinking water around Fairchild Air Force Base and other communities across the country. PFAS chemicals, also known as per- and polyfluoroalkyls, are prized for their nonstick, stain-resistant and fire-retardant qualities.
The plan involves additional monitoring and increased research, cleanup and risk-communication efforts. The EPA also plans to take a first step toward setting an enforceable limit for PFAS chemicals in drinking water by the end of 2019, Chris Hladick, the agency's regional director for the Pacific Northwest, said in a conference call with reporters.
But the first stage of that rule-making process only determines whether a maximum contaminant level, or MCL, is needed.
"If it's a yes, then they're still years away from setting an MCL," said Barbara Morrissey, an expert in the environmental toxicology division of Washington's Department of Health.
Environmentalists and Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the plan, saying it effectively delays much-needed regulations on PFAS chemicals, which have been linked to cancer and other health problems after decades of use in consumer products and firefighting foam.
"The EPA plan will not protect Washingtonians from these harmful chemicals that last indefinitely in the environment and get into drinking water," Erika Schreder, science director for Toxic-Free Future, a Seattle-based advocacy group, said in a statement. "Washington state is far ahead of EPA in providing residents real protections from these chemicals and must continue to lead."
A spokeswoman for Toxic-Free Future noted that Democrats in Olympia are sponsoring legislation that would require manufacturers to provide information on certain "priority chemicals," such as PFAS compounds, to the state Department of Ecology. One of those bills passed the Senate Committee on Environment, Energy and Technology on Thursday.
EPA officials, including Hladick, described the PFAS plan as the first of its kind, a concerted nationwide effort that will address the "emerging" public health threat on multiple fronts.
Andrew Wheeler, the EPA's acting administrator and President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the agency permanently, called the plan a "pivotal moment in the history of the agency."
U.S. Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, both of Washington, were among 20 Democratic senators who signed a Feb. 1 letter to Wheeler, urging the EPA to quickly adopt enforceable drinking-water standards.
"Washingtonians should not have to worry if their water is contaminated with harmful chemicals," Murray said in a statement Thursday, "yet once again the Trump administration has chosen to sacrifice public health in pursuit of loose rules for wealthy special interests that would further pollute our water supply and cause additional harm to our environment."
In an email, an EPA spokeswoman said the agency is "committed to following the (maximum contaminant level) rulemaking process as established by the Safe Drinking Water Act - a process that is designed to ensure public participation, transparency and the use of the best available science and other technical information. This process will provide regulatory certainty, while ensuring the legal defensibility of EPA's regulatory actions."
Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, said in a statement: "I urge Mr. Wheeler to reverse course and treat this public health threat with the urgency it deserves. And I ask my colleagues in the Senate to take note of Mr. Wheeler's lack of urgency in addressing this threat as they consider his nomination to be EPA's permanent administrator."
A spokesman for U.S. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers did not immediately have a comment on the EPA plan.
The two most prevalent PFAS compounds, known as PFOS and PFOA, were used for decades in food packaging, cookware and stain repellents. They were phased out of use in the United States by the mid-2000s, but experts say similar replacement chemicals, including one called GenX, may be just as hazardous.
The chemicals degrade extremely slowly, if at all, and are known to accumulate in the environment and in people. Tests on lab animals have linked the compounds to an array of health problems.
Their effects on humans are less clear, but Morrissey, with the state Health Department, said new studies are being published each week.
"It's a really active area of research, and so I think we're going to know a lot more in the next few years," she said.
The EPA issued an unenforceable health advisory for PFOS and PFOA in 2016, saying concentrations in drinking water should not exceed 70 parts per trillion.
But a report released last summer by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that "minimum risk levels" for oral exposure to those chemicals are much lower than the EPA limit.
The EPA, under former Administrator Scott Pruitt, along with the White House, had sought to block the publication of the HHS report, with one Trump administration aide warning it would cause a "public relations nightmare."
Fairchild officials first acknowledged in early 2017 that groundwater around the air base was contaminated by PFAS chemicals. They were key ingredients in aqueous film-forming foam, a widely used fire retardant that seeped into the water table from training sites on the base. The contamination prompted lawsuits and forced Airway Heights to flush millions of gallons from its drinking water system.
Tens of millions of people in the United States rely on tap water containing unsafe levels of the compounds, according to the Environmental Working Group. In their Feb. 1 letter to Wheeler, the Democratic senators wrote that a lack of clear guidance from the EPA "has led to a patchwork of conflicting drinking water standards and guidelines in nine states with widely varying maximum contaminant levels."
Manufacturers of PFAS chemicals, including DuPont and 3M Co., have paid hundreds of millions of dollars to settle lawsuits over drinking water contamination. In a statement Thursday, the American Chemistry Council, an industry lobbying group, voiced support for the EPA plan.
"We continue to support strong national leadership in addressing PFAS and firmly believe that EPA is best positioned to provide the public with a comprehensive strategy informed by a full understanding of the safety and benefits of different PFAS chemistries," the group said.
The New York Times reported in October 2017 that Nancy Beck - a top EPA political appointee and former executive at the American Chemistry Council - had pushed for rule changes that make it harder to regulate PFOA and other chemicals. Beck holds a doctorate in environmental health from the University of Washington and worked at the state Health Department from 1999 to 2000.
Morrissey said the EPA tends to rely on its own data when creating new regulations. The agency's own sampling several years ago found PFAS contamination in only small pockets of the country, but later samplings by the military and other researchers found the problem was much bigger, she said.
"If the EPA doesn't consider all of that, they might say, 'Hey, we don't need to regulate it because there's not a significant occurrence,'" Morrissey said.
In an email, an EPA spokeswoman said the agency would continue monitoring efforts because new lab methods can detect PFAS chemicals at lower concentrations than previously possible.

Resumen: Concerned when Trump fired FBI Director James Comey not long after taking office, McCabe also said Justice Department officials had discussed bringing the Cabinet together to consider using the Constitution's 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, according to CBS News, which conducted the interview and will air it in full Sunday on "60 Minutes." The Justice Department did not deny those discussions took place but said in a statement that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein does not believe there is a basis for invoking the 25th Amendment, which enables Cabinet members to seek a president's ouster if they believe he or she is unfit for office. According to the CBS report, McCabe confirmed meetings at the Justice Department in the days after Comey was fired in which officials discussed potentially invoking the 25th Amendment to seek the president's removal.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said in an interview that aired Thursday that he moved quickly after his boss was fired to protect an investigation into President Donald Trump's potential ties to Russia and prevent it from being shut down in case he, too, was dismissed.

Concerned when Trump fired FBI Director James Comey not long after taking office, McCabe also said Justice Department officials had discussed bringing the Cabinet together to consider using the Constitution's 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, according to CBS News, which conducted the interview and will air it in full Sunday on "60 Minutes."

CBS described McCabe's comments on the 25th Amendment in a news story about its interview but did not release excerpts from that part.

The Justice Department did not deny those discussions took place but said in a statement that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein does not believe there is a basis for invoking the 25th Amendment, which enables Cabinet members to seek a president's

ouster if they believe he or she is unfit for office.

The interview with McCabe, a 1985 graduate of The Bolles School, comes ahead of the release next week of his memoir, "The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump."

The book and the publicity around it are likely to refocus attention on the tumultuous eight-day period between Trump's firing of Comey and Rosenstein's appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The situation strained relations between FBI and Justice Department leaders, with McCabe -- who was elevated to acting FBI director upon Comey's firing -- becoming suspicious of Rosenstein, and Rosenstein removing McCabe from the Russia investigation.

McCabe, a frequent target of Trump's ire, was fired from the FBI last year after the Justice Department inspector general concluded he had lied during an internal investigation into a news media disclosure. The allegations, which McCabe has denied, have been referred for investigation to the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington.

Trump responded on Twitter to news reports of the new interview, saying: "Disgraced FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe pretends to be a ‘poor little Angel' when in fact he was a big part of the Crooked Hillary Scandal & the Russia Hoax - a puppet for Leakin' James Comey. I.G. report on McCabe was devastating."

The White House said in a statement that McCabe had been fired in "disgrace from the FBI because he lied to investigators on multiple occasions, including under oath" and that he had no credibility.

Asked in the CBS interview when he had opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's connections to Russia, and a criminal investigation into whether the president had sought to obstruct justice, McCabe said he acted almost immediately after Comey's firing and after discussing the firing with Trump himself.

Alarmed that Trump "might have won the White House with the aid of the government of Russia," he assembled his investigators the following day to discuss the investigations surrounding Trump and how to keep them moving forward in the event he was fired or reassigned.

"I was very concerned that I was able to put the Russia case on absolutely solid ground, in an indelible fashion," McCabe said. "That were I removed quickly, or reassigned or fired, that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace."

McCabe added, "I wanted to make sure that our case was on solid ground and if somebody came in behind me and closed it and tried to walk away from it, they would not be able to do that without creating a record of why they made that decision."

In a book excerpt obtained by The Atlantic, McCabe said the meeting with investigators was one in a series he held about protecting and preserving the probes.

He asked the team to say where they were on investigations that already were open into Trump associates -- which, at the time, included former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- and whether there was a need to open additional cases.

According to the CBS report, McCabe confirmed meetings at the Justice Department in the days after Comey was fired in which officials discussed potentially invoking the 25th Amendment to seek the president's removal.

CBS said McCabe also confirmed a report first published by The New York Times that Rosenstein had suggested wearing a wire to record conversations with the president.

McCabe told CBS that he took the comment seriously. The Justice Department has previously issued a statement from another official in the room who said he interpreted Rosenstein's remark as sarcastic.

The Justice Department issued a new statement Thursday asserting that Rosenstein "never authorized any recording that Mr. McCabe references."

"As the Deputy Attorney General previously has stated, based on his personal dealings with the President, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment, nor was (Rosenstein) in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment," the statement says.

It also notes that Rosenstein removed McCabe from the chain of command and instead appointed Mueller as special counsel.

Texto completo: Headnote JAZZ NOTES
In honor of her devotion to the worldwide African family, Nana Camille Yarbrough was enstooled as Naa Kuokor Agyman 1, founder of the Stool House of Flarriet Tubman, by a community of traditional Ghanaian elders in New York (Abladei, Inc.). The honorary title of "Nana" was given to her at that time.
"In the tradition of the African jelimuso/griot, I am charged to do more than share stories, but I must preserve the meaning and beauty of culture," said Yarbrough. "That work transcends time and space."
On Feb. 14, Yarbrough will present a special performance of her poetic and musical works entitled "No Matter What" at The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (515 Malcolm X Blvd). The program begins at 7 p.m.
Centered around Yarbrough's popular songs and poems from her album "Iron Pot Cooker," the live show will feature Yarbrough performing some of her work, plus performances from actresses Althea Vyfhuis and Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin and vocalist Tulivu Donna Cumberbatch.
Special guest speakers will include Pam Africa, Imhotep Gary Byrd, Bob Law and Chief Baba Neil Clarke. The Ancestor House Band will be led by musical director Michael Mustafa Ulmer with percussionist Michael Wimberly, guitarist Sharief and bassist Trevor Allen.
There will be a screening of video clips on Yarbrough's life, as directed by filmmaker Nahdege Ptah of MAAT Films.
Born in Chicago, grounded in Harlem, Yarbrough is a natural storyteller whose love of African people shapes all that she touches. Respected as an award-winning performance artist and dancer, best-selling author and devoted cultural activist, Yarbrough spent the early stages of her career as a member of the Katherine Dunham Company of dancers, singers and musicians.
Her distinguished accomplishments span more than 60 years in theater, film, television and academia. Yarbrough at age 85, is first and foremost, a custodian and champion of African culture.
General admission start at $25/ students $15. Tickets are available at http://bit.ly/nomatterwhatn.
The man, Dexter Gordon, was a legend in his own time, and after death he became an iconic jazzman whose name was whispered through the clouds as stories of his great musical conquests rained down upon us mere mortals.
The tenor saxophonist had a captivating sound tirat made the birds swing to another tune, a hip distinct melody that made folks in his native city of Los Angeles stand up and cheer, and by the time he arrived in New York some were already shouting his name. Bebop chords turned jazz on its ear in 1944, when he joined the Billy Eckstine band, the bandstand of bebop innovators and future prominent bandleaders.
On Feb. 14 at Prentis Hall, Room 101, 632 W. 125th St., Maxine Gordon, the widow of Dexter, will present a book talk based on her recently completed book, "Sophisticated Giant: The Life and Legacy of Dexter Gordon." This book is an attempt to fill in the gaps created by our misperceptions and those left by Dexter himself.
Gordon's guests will include pianist George Cables with the Rev. Dr. Dwight Andrews, Dr. Farah Jasmine Griffin, Dr. Robert G. O'Meally and saxophonist Salim Washington.
In a context of biography, history and memoir, Gordon has completed the book that her late husband began, weaving his "solo" turns with her voice and a chorus of voices from past and present. Reading like a jazz composition, the blend of research, anecdote and a selection of Dexter's personal letters reflects his colorful life and legendary times.
This event is free and open to the public but an RSVP is required. Please email columbiajazzstudies@gmail.com or call 212-851-9270. Books will be available for purchase.
One Book One Bronx is a new style reading group that encourages and delights readers. Every week, they meet to discuss one book that reflects the people of the Bronx. Sessions are free to join. The first 25 attendees receive a free copy of the book.
On Feb. 14, the group will be concluding their discussion on "Bloodchild: And Other Stories by Octavia E. Butler" at the Bronx Library Center/ NYPL, 310 E. Kingsbridge Rd., 6:30 pm to 8 p.m.
This New York Times Notable Book is the winner of both the Flugo and the Nebula awards. Butler is one of the most esteemed science fiction writers of the 20th century. The flautist and composer Nicole Mitchell See JAZZ on page 22 was so inspired by Butler's writing that she composed and released "Xenogenesis Suite" with her Black Earth Ensemble (Firehouse 12, 2007) based on the author's novel series.
One Book One Bronx reading selections reflect the racial, economic and gender demographics of the borough and build bridges to engagement while (re)sparking a love of literature. Sponsored by the Literary Freedom Project. This event is free to the public. Please visit the website to RSVP.
What does iconic musician, master of the Hammond B3 organ Dr. Lonnie Smith do on his down time? Easy, he performs in the community. He resides in Fort Lauderdale but took time to travel a few miles away to perform at Delray, Florida's popular jazz, blues and rock club the Arts Garage.
Smith appeared with his steady guitarist Jonathan Kreisberg and the young drummer Xavier Breaker from Chicago. No different from his Manhattan gigs, the doctor was in the house, swinging like a blistering tornado. His B3 chords were so forceful one had to hold on to their chairs or risk being blown into a kingdom of the funky blues and high guitar voicings. Breaker, although rather new to the trio, followed the intuitive flow of street swing infused with gospel chords and funk, that junk box swing. On ballads the doctor's B3 sounded like that Baptist church organ preaching the spirited gospel blues spiked with funk.
Aside from the constant music at the Havana Jazz festival we also frequented the noted jazz club Zorra Y Cuervo (Fox and Crow). One evening an outstanding all-female band Zoé Fuentes y Canela de Cuba performed. The ladies went straight to the traditional jazz source going in hard on such tunes as Return To Forever's "The Warrior" and Wayne Shorter's "Footprints." The vocal interpretation of the standard "Misty" by Yuleydi Sosa and Jennyfer Bauza was stirring. A crazy diving riffing trumpet led the way on the well-oiled tune "Caravan."
The 10-piece ensemble kept to its Afro Cuban roots with its mainstay timbales, congas and drums. This outing included a romping violinist, trumpeter and trombone that made for a bold blaring brass voice of Cubano swing.
On another night we caught an incredible young musician Sergio Jimenez ? HabanaSer. The saxophonist Jimenez led a quintet with drums, keyboards and guitar. The amazing factor-he was also the second drummer (yes two drums), and wow what a blast. The call and response between Jimenez and the accompanying drummer was outrageous, at times their blazing assaults sounded like a slamming HBCU marching band. Hopefully at some point he will get to New York so the east coast can experience his creativity.

Texto completo: Before the 2009 release of "One Second After," which would go on to hold a spot on "The New York Times" Best Seller list for 12 weeks on its way to selling over a million copies, few people were aware of what life might look like in the aftermath of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack.
Author and Montreat College history professor and faculty fellow William Forstchen painted a detailed portrait, set in his hometown of Black Mountain, depicting the struggles modern society would face moving forward in a world devoid of electricity.
In his newest novel, "48 Hours," Forstchen examines humanity in the hours before an eminent extinction level event.
"A CME, or a coronal mass ejection, is a solar storm," Forstchen said. "When I wrote 'One Second After' I didn't even know about it. Hardly anyone did."
Forstchen began reading about the solar storm of 1859, also known as the Carrington Event. The powerful geomagnetic storm produced a CME that interacted with Earth's magnetosphere.
In modern times, such an event would likely disrupt the electric grid. As Forstchen researched the phenomenon, he was drawn to another naturally occurring product of the sun — coronal proton ejections (CPE). Known commonly as solar flares, severe versions of these disruptions can send high levels of radiation toward Earth.
In normal circumstances, he continued, the earth's magnetosphere would protect it from a coronal proton ejection. In "48 Hours," Forstchen conceives a scenario in which a CME peels away the planet's magnetic field before the sun releases a massive solar flare.
"I came across articles where those events happened in reverse," he said. "I just postulated they happen the other way around."
It was easy to imagine a world where "bureaucrats mess everything up and you have your heroes running around and your bad people and cities burning," the author said. "But then I thought, 'that sucks, it's derivative.'"
In "One Second After" and the subsequent books in the trilogy, Forstchen spins a tale of humanity facing an uncertain future in an unforgiving new dark age. The story is a cautionary tale of society's dependence on modern technology and "One Second After" was cited on the floor of U.S. Congress as a "fact-based scenario" of life after an EMP attack.
Its effectiveness as a harbinger of potential disaster was enhanced by the author's use of relatable characters in a real-life setting. While Forstchen intended to ring an alarm about the threat of an EMP, the story itself crystallized once he began thinking about how the loss of electricity might impact the daily lives of everyone.
"I was wrestling with the book and it was going nowhere, and I was at a (Montreat College) graduation ceremony," he recalled. "This is before Anderson Auditorium was updated and it was unbelievably hot in there."
Forstchen had just scratched the idea of building a narrative around a heroic, Jack Ryan-like character as he sweat through the ceremony.
"I'm sitting there, and I'm looking at the audience and looking at my (students) and I had what I call a 'God moment,'" he said. "The entire idea formed that quickly and I'm wondering what happens to everyone in here if this nightmare happens?"
As Forstchen struggled to find the story that would properly relay the threat of a solar-related extinction level event, it was another real setting that prompted his epiphany for "48 Hours."
While lamenting his struggles to develop the story for his latest novel to a friend, he learned of the Springfield Underground in Missouri. The warehouse facility provides 2.5 million square feet of space in a former limestone mine. It contains over three miles of roadway and rail service.
Forstchen realized "we could survive down there."
"I was in a green room waiting to do a television interview and I had another 'God moment,'" he said. "I got home and immediately starting writing this book."
The conflict in the book, however, revolves around just who would have access to the limited space. It pits citizens against government officials in the final hours of the world as we know it.
"Suppose you only have 48 hours, then why do some people survive and some don't?" he said. "Why should senator so-and-so have an assistant who survives while the Nobel Prize laureate guy who lives down the street gets left there?"
Forstchen admits that writing about such a bleak topic is taxing, but as he did with "One Second After," he felt an obligation.
"It's a message," he said. "We all face our mortality individually, but suppose all of humanity was facing its mortality simultaneously. What would you do?"
The book, Forstchen hopes, will make readers ask themselves what's important.
"It's all so fragile," he said of society. "We live in the most technologically advanced civilization in the history of humanity and the sword of Damocles hangs by the slimmest of threads."

Labor unions protested. Democrats signed on to a bill to rewrite the law. Even dozens of moderate Republicans asked Bush to reconsider.
But then a single congressman used a parliamentary maneuver – never attempted before or since – to challenge the underpinnings of the national emergency itself.
Bush backed down without even a vote.

The largely forgotten story of Bush's capitulation explains why Republicans have advised President Donald Trump against bypassing Congress and invoking a national emergency to build a wall along the Mexican border.
In addition to raising legal questions – such a move would inevitably be challenged in court – a declaration would invite Congress to exercise its long-dormant power to revoke national emergencies.
And all it would take is one member of Congress to force the issue.
In 2005, that member was Rep. George Miller, a California lawmaker who was the top Democrat on the House Education and Labor Committee.
Calling Bush's decision "callous and misguided," Miller's first move was to try to amend the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931. That law sets the prevailing wage for federal contracts, but allows the president to grant waivers in times of national emergency.
But Democrats were in the minority, and while some Republicans were grumbling about Bush's move, they were unwilling to sign on to Miller's legislation – meaning it would never get to the House floor.

So Miller changed tack. He dug up the National Emergencies Act of 1975, one in a series of post-Watergate reforms. It allowed Congress to terminate a presidential emergency by simple majority vote.
Republican leadership couldn't block the vote: Under the law, they had 15 business days to bring it out of committee and to the floor.
Miller introduced his resolution on Oct. 20, and a vote was scheduled for Nov. 8.
On Oct. 26, the Bush administration announced it would terminate the emergency effective Nov. 7.
Bush Labor Secretary Elaine Chao said the administration had re-examined the issue and discovered that it wouldn't save as much money as initially forecast. (Chao is now Trump's transportation secretary, and her husband is Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. )
Miller declared victory.
"Let me be clear," he told The New York Times. "The president is backing down today only because he had no other choice. "
Mark Zuckerman, who was the Democratic staff director of the House Education and Labor Committee at the time, says all it took was the threat of a vote.
"It can be revealing when you make people vote on something," he says.
"We thought it was an unacceptable and inappropriate use of emergency powers, but we also wanted to check to see if there was really Republican support for something like this. I think it’s part of the genius of the procedure is that it tests sentiment on Capitol Hill for your unilateral idea. "
The original intent of the 1975 law was to allow Congress a block a presidential emergency by simple majority vote. But in 1983, the U. S. Supreme Court struck down the legislative veto. So now, any joint resolution by Congress to terminate an emergency can be vetoed by the president.
And McConnell said Trump could do exactly that.
"The president could win anyway by vetoing the bill and then trying to get enough votes to sustain it, so may ultimately be able to prevail on the national emergency alternative," McConnell told Fox News on Tuesday.
Still, some GOP senators are already expressing discomfort over such a vote, and have asked Trump this week – both publicly and privately – not to put them in that position.
"It's not my preferred choice," said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.
"I hope he doesn't do it," said. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.
"It might be a – you know – a tough vote to win here in the Senate," said Sen. John Thune, R-S. D.
One concern is the precedent such a declaration would set.
"I think most Republicans will tell you that we really would like to find a way to avoid that type of a discussion if at all possible because this goes beyond just this president," Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S. D. , told CNN on Wednesday. "This goes on to future presidents and what they might decide to declare an emergency for. "

That was exactly what Congress expected when it voted overwhelmingly to pass the National Emergencies Act.
The law called for every emergency to be reviewed – and possibly voted on – every six months. But in 44 years, presidents have declared at least 60 national emergencies without Congress taking a single vote.
Thirty-one of those emergencies remain in place today.

The use of emergency powers became so routine that the Obama administration said in 2015 that they were mere formalities – despite their boilerplate language that they're in response to an "unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security. " And presidents seem to have ignored requirements that they update Congress on the costs of those emergencies.
More: The Obama White House claimed that national emergencies were just formalities
Liza Goitein, director of the national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, has advocated reforms to presidential emergency powers.
"I think Congress has woken up to the idea that the process for declaring emergencies is too permissive," she says.
"This isn’t going to look good if the Republican Senate is voting to curtail the president's power. It’s going to split Republicans and force Republicans to take a vote they don’t want to take – and it may not go Trump's way. "
Trump did not mention the national emergency in his State of the Union address Tuesday, but says he's still considering it. A national emergency could allow him to transfer unspent military construction funds toward a wall.
"I don't like to take things off the table," Trump told CBS in a pre-Super Bowl interview. "It's that alternative. It's national emergency, it's other things and, you know, there have been plenty national emergencies called. "

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s regular threats to close down parts of the government to vindicate an applause line make you almost nostalgic for the shutdowns of the past.
When Sen Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, pushed the government to a 16-day halt in 2013 in an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, at least he was fighting over something that mattered.
I said "almost" about that nostalgia because the closure Cruz championed was, from the beginning, a doomed tactical ploy for a wrongheaded objective. Josh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, called Cruz’s gambit "a toddler’s version of legislating."
That Trump’s fixation over a useless border wall looks even more juvenile than a preschooler’s tantrum explains why Republicans, including McConnell, finally said "Enough!" to a president they had been coddling for fear of retaliation and in the pursuit of conservative dominance over the federal judiciary. This time, they told him he had to surrender his wall-funding dreams. But the Republicans did not come to this realization entirely of their own accord. A little over a month ago, the same McConnell said he would not bring budget legislation to the floor that he knew the president would veto. The result was the wrenching 35-day shutdown.
McConnell did not reckon with the impact of Democratic control of the House of Representatives. With power in her hands, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, along with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, refused to accommodate a presidential objective they knew was phony and, worse, racist in its underlying motivation. This is why Pelosi (to much hand-wringing) called the wall "immoral."
The president’s proclivity to tweet or talk without much reflection was helpful on this front, too. On Sunday, he picked up on a Gallup Poll suggesting, as Trump put it, that "Open Borders will potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans." He added: "This would be a disaster for the U.S. We need the Wall now!"
So we know it’s "Latin Americans" in general and not just those "criminals" he talks about whom Trump sees as the grave danger. And, by the way, the compromise spending bill shows that Democrats have no interest in "open borders."
Trump’s lost mojo with Senate Republicans creates a new playing field. Republicans can see what a 2020 thumping would look like in the nearly 10-million-vote margin Democrats won in the 2018 House races. They also learned from the price they paid for the last shutdown that they will be blamed for the president’s shenanigans.
Meanwhile, Trump shows no signs of backing down from his fantasy approach to public communications. He updated his "Build the Wall!" slogan into "Finish the Wall!" as if he has achieved something he has not.
Noting Trump’s recent statement that "we’re building a lot of wall," The New York Times calmly reported on Tuesday: "In fact, no new walls have been built or financed by Congress based on the prototypes that the Trump administration unveiled in October 2017. Projects to replace or repair about 40 miles of existing barriers have been started or completed since 2017."
But Democrats need to learn lessons from all this, too. First, they should stay tough. Second, they need to be disciplined.
This episode shows that standing up to Trump’s worst instincts will pay rewards. Democrats forced Senate Republicans into a very old-fashioned conference committee that reached a budget deal in a very old-fashioned way because the legislators were operating in a largely Trump-free zone. This only happened because Democrats resisted calls to play Trump’s game. "Comity" and "civility" are never achieved by capitulating to bullying and hostage-taking.
At the same time, the GOP, including Trump, is already signaling that its main goal is to pick up on the most adventurous proposals from Democratic legislators — and any reckless or offensive statements from individual Democrats — to pretend that Republicans are, against the evidence of the last two years, a mainstream bunch.
Dealing with this issue is much trickier. For the long run, it’s useful for progressive Democrats to push the boundaries of the policy debate. But they should leave the incendiary tweets to Trump, keep the focus on his extremism, and legislate in areas where their party is united — political reform, voting rights, repairs to the health care system, protections for the Dreamers, and infrastructure.
Successful parties manage to do more than one thing at the same time. To keep the initiative, the Democrats need to show that they can master this essential political art.

House Votes to Halt Aid for Saudi Arabia's War in Yemen

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The House voted on Wednesday to end American military assistance for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, a defiant and rare move to curtail presidential war powers that underscored anger with President Trump's unflagging support for Saudi Arabia even after the killing of a Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi.
The 248-to-177 vote, condemning a nearly four-year conflict in Yemen that has killed thousands of civilians and inflicted a devastating famine, will pressure the Republican-controlled Senate to respond. Eighteen Republicans -- almost all of them hard-line conservatives with the Freedom Caucus -- voted with the Democratic majority.
Congress's upper chamber in December passed a parallel resolution, 56 to 41, in a striking rebuke to the president and his administration's defense of the kingdom. But that measure died with the last Congress after the House Republican leadership blocked a vote.
Dozens of Democrats, however, softened the blow when they defected to a Republican amendment to allow intelligence sharing with Saudi Arabia to continue when "appropriate in the national security interest of the United States."
Senate passage of the Yemen resolution could prompt Mr. Trump to issue the first veto of his presidency, and it would come after Republicans have registered their unhappiness over other foreign policy issues, such as the president's plan to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan and his threats to pull the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators introduced new sanctions on Moscow that would require the secretary of state to submit a determination of "whether the Russian Federation meets the criteria for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism."
Democrats demanded Senate action.
"This is their opportunity to send a message to the Saudis that their behavior on Khashoggi and their flagrant disregard of human rights is not consistent with the American way of doing business and not in line with American values," Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, the bill's lead sponsor, said in an interview, adding that he was "relieved" that Congress finally took action on the resolution, which he first introduced in 2017.
The House resolution is a rare use of the 1973 War Powers Act, which gave Congress the ability to compel the removal of military forces absent a formal declaration of war. Those powers, created in the wake of the Vietnam War, have almost never been used, as lawmakers have demurred from intervening in politically sensitive matters of war, peace and support for the troops.
But the conflict in Yemen is proving to be different. Senators sponsoring their own resolution are expected to act quickly to force a vote, as lawmakers in both parties fume over how the administration has responded to Saudi Arabia's role in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, who was based in Virginia. Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and one of the sponsors, said he anticipated a vote "within the next 30 days."
The White House pre-emptively threatened to block the resolution over the weekend, with administration officials arguing in a statement of administration policy that "the premise of the joint resolution is flawed" because the United States has provided only "limited support to member countries of the Saudi-led coalition" in Yemen.
Senate aides involved in the resolution say they are optimistic that it will pass, though it is unclear whether it will garner the same level of support among Republicans that it did in December. Some Republicans, mindful of an embarrassing veto showdown with Mr. Trump, are looking for other ways to show their dissatisfaction.
Members of Congress expressed fresh outrage last weekend after the White House declined on Friday to meet a legally mandated deadline to report whether the administration believed Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was personally responsible for Mr. Khashoggi's death, as the C.I.A. has concluded.
In a letter sent to Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Foreign Relations, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised the administration's "dedication to promoting accountability" in placing sanctions on 17 Saudis for their involvement in Mr. Khashoggi's killing, and pledged to continue to "impose tangible and significant consequences." The day before, The New York Times reported that the crown prince told an aide in 2017 he would use "a bullet" on Mr. Khashoggi if he did not end his criticism of the government.
The response drew widespread condemnation from members of Mr. Trump's own party.
"Everyone involved in this gruesome crime must be identified and held accountable," said Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the ranking Republican on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. "When the United States fails to lead, we compromise our integrity and abandon those pursuing justice around the world."
Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, told reporters on Tuesday that "the sooner the White House gets there the better," adding: "I don't know what's taking so long. I think it's pretty obvious the crown prince had to be involved in this."
Mr. Trump did find a vote of confidence from Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the new chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who has cooled what was once a hotbed of dissent over the Trump administration's foreign policies. Mr. Risch broke from his colleagues to express satisfaction at the administration's response, telling reporters on Tuesday that "the administration has been very forthcoming, the State Department has been very forthcoming."
Indignation at the administration's response to the killing led seven Senate Republicans to break with their party in December and back a Yemen resolution drafted by Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah.
This time around, with the Democrats controlling the House, some of those dissenters are seeking ways to hold the Saudi government accountable without invoking the War Powers Act. Mr. Menendez and Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, introduced legislation last week that would impose broader sanctions on the Saudi government, including a ban on American refueling of Saudi coalition aircraft in Yemen, without calling for a removal of military support.
Some senators frustrated with the administration's response have refused to back the resolution, arguing that the invocation of the War Powers Resolution must be evaluated independently from their discontent with the White House.
"I think that's separate -- it has to be, from a point of pragmatism -- from Mr. Khashoggi and his murder," Mr. Rubio, who will not support the measure, said on Tuesday.
The House enacted the War Powers Resolution by overriding President Richard M. Nixon's veto. The resolution grew out of frustration that Congress's role in deciding when the country would go to war had eroded during the first decades of the Cold War, when presidents of both parties began dispatching troops into combat, including the Korean War, without lawmakers' permission.
Among other things, the War Powers Resolution says presidents may unilaterally deploy troops into combat situations only if the United States has been attacked, and it created a mechanism for Congress to direct a deployment's immediate termination. The House measure says that American military assistance to the Saudi-led coalition counts as a deployment into unauthorized hostilities under the War Powers Act and must end.
Unlike many recent disputes over presidential war powers -- such as the legal basis for the Obama and Trump administrations' war against the Islamic State -- the current debate does not turn on how far the executive branch may stretch the 2001 and 2002 authorizations to use military force against Al Qaeda and Iraq. The Houthi rebel forces in Yemen have no connection to those two conflicts.
The Trump administration, however, has said that it can rely on congressional authority from other statutes, including one that permits the Pentagon to provide logistical assistance to allies, as a basis for its help to the Saudi-led coalition.
The White House also argues that the assistance the United States is providing -- intelligence sharing for targeting purposes, logistics support and, until recently, aerial refueling -- falls short of a deployment into the sort of hostilities that is covered by the War Powers Resolution.
The White House has suggested that it could be an unconstitutional encroachment on Mr. Trump's powers as commander in chief for Congress to override his judgment and try to terminate the mission.

Casa Terra brings vegan fine dining to Glendale

Texto completo: At 28, Jason Wyrick was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. He was in a marketing job he hated. He had high blood sugar and failing eyesight. To combat the health issues, he adopted a vegan diet.
That was 18 years ago.
"I stayed vegan because I now have two brothers with gray hair and glasses, and I don't," Wyrick says with a wry smile.
Today, he's just days away from opening the first vegan fine-dining restaurant in metro Phoenix.
Casa Terra is a new 50-seat, white-tablecloth restaurant just off the main drag in downtown Glendale.
In the years since becoming a vegan, he has become an expert on how a plant-based diet can not only be great for your health, but also enjoyable to eat. He has co-written a New York Times best-selling book on the subject and owns The Vegan Taste, which he says was the first vegan nationwide meal delivery service at the time.
Wyrick hopes Casa Terra will expose an even wider audience to how delicious vegan food can be.
"I don't think it matters whether it's vegan or not if it's just good food. People are going to be satisfied," he says.
Wyrick studied philosophy at Texas Christian University and, at first, became vegetarian for moral reasons. He made the shift to veganism to help relieve his health issues and lose weight. Within months, Wyrick says, he had dropped 80 pounds and reversed his diabetes.
The problem was that in the early 2000s, there were few options for vegan restaurants and prepared foods. "No one was doing vegan back then," he remembers.
So he taught himself. "And that's how I became a chef," he says.
In 2004, the Glendale native returned to Phoenix from Texas and plugged into the city's small but growing vegan community. Soon enough, he was being asked to host cooking classes and cater events.
By 2008, he had become a vegan chef at the Scottsdale Culinary Institute — a first for the now-closed school, he says. Initially, students were shy to express their interest in cooking vegan food.
"This was, like, long before vegan was cool," Wryick says. "After class, half of the students came up to me and say, 'We want to learn more about this vegan food.' The teachers did, too.'"
From vegan meals to vegan restaurant By this time, he had already launched The Vegan Taste, a weekly vegan meal delivery service that predates both the meal service and vegan trends by at least a decade.
Wyrick and his staff — which includes his wife, also a vegan chef — deliver vegan meals to customers from Avondale to Apache Junction every Monday. Meals range from penne with arugula pesto, grilled zucchini and white beans to coconut mushroom chowder with potatoes and corn.
For two years, Wryick had been using the Casa Terra kitchen as a commissary for the meal service. So when the lease for the dining room also became available, he decided it was time to open a restaurant.
He chose to buck the trend of the fast-casual service and offer white tablecloths instead. While the number of vegan and vegetarian restaurants in Phoenix is on the rise, the city still lacks many options for full-service vegan restaurants open for lunch and dinner.
"There's no vegan fine dining anywhere in the state," Wyrick says. "Plus, I had to find a way to draw people out to Glendale."
What's on the vegan menu? Casa Terra will serve "Mexican-Mediterranean fusion," according to the chef.
Almost half the menu is dedicated to small plates, salads and soups. The other half is divided between wood-fired pizzas, entrees and desserts.
Omnivores may be surprised to see dishes with decidedly non-vegan ingredients on the menu, such as arancini and ricotta or chorizo verde flautas.
The reason: Wyrick makes a handful of vegan "cheeses" in house. Using nut milks, he follows the same coagulation processes used to make traditional dairy cheeses, so his almond milk mozzarella has the familiar soft, moist texture of the "real" thing.
The pizza section of the menu is something of a self-indulgence for the chef, who fell in love with wood-fired pizzas during a trip to Italy. He came home and installed an oven at his house and required that the restaurant have one, too.
On three-day sourdough pizza dough, Wryick serves pies topped with salted agave, apple, almond-milk ricotta and aleppo chile or marinara sauce, almond milk mozzarella, olive oil and basil.
To make ingredients like chorizo and carnitas, Wyrick gives plant-based proteins like seitan and tofu the same treatment as their less animal-friendly counterparts. The goal? Dishes with flavor profiles that leave little to be desired.
Vegan treat: sweet and free Even the desert selection holds a few surprises. Diners can order churros or a coconut flan, but every diner also gets a complimentary convent fudge. These chocolate-free candies get their name from their origins in Mexican convents, where nuns with little resources to buy cocoa made candies out of vegetables, fruits and nuts instead.
At Casa Terra, they're made with peanut butter that's rolled in mezcal and covered in pepitas.
This anything-goes attitude is more than just a part of the approach to making candies. Wyrick is a believer in the idea that vegan eating is more about intention and impact than anything else.
It's why he hopes Casa Terra will be a place for all omnivores, vegans and everyone in between.
"Being vegan is about causing the least amount of harm you can while still having a normal life more than a hard-and-fast set of rules," Wyrick says. "I want people to have fun here. I want people to smile and laugh and have badass food."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump likes to say that he hires only the best people and that his White House operates like a well-oiled machine.
But a steady stream of insider accounts flowing out of the West Wing suggests there's more madness than method to the president and his administration.
The most recent entries are two books that just hit best-seller lists, one by former White House aide Cliff Sims, the other by ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a onetime Trump adviser.
OPPOSING VIEW: Donald Trump wasn’t elected to just be conventional
Sims dishes about Oval Office back-stabbing in his explicitly titled "Team of Vipers. " Christie's "Let Me Finish" laments Trump's choice of "amateurs, grifters, weaklings, convicted and unconvicted felons . . . hustled into jobs they were never suited for. "
The authors join a pantheon of disgruntled leakers or tattling ex-staffers telling tales of incompetence at the highest executive levels. Last week, someone handed Axios three months of Trump's daily schedule, revealing in mortifying detail how the president spends more than half of his workday in "executive time" activities such as watching TV, tweeting and making calls.
The consistent and growing evidence of internal dysfunction is growing increasingly difficult to ignore or explain away. Remember, these accounts aren't coming from Democrats or anti-Trump pundits. They're from people who have worked inside the administration and seen White House operations up close and personal:
►A senior Trump administration official, writing an anonymous column in The New York Times, characterized the president as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective," with decisions that are "half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless. "
►Journalist Bob Woodward, in his best-selling book "Fear," diagnosed a White House suffering a "nervous breakdown," with aides stealing papers off Trump's desk to deter bad policy. Former Chief of Staff John Kelly was quoted as saying: "We're in Crazytown. "
►"Fire and Fury" by writer Michael Wolff and "Unhinged" by Omarosa Manigault Newman, the ex-White House aide and former television reality star, questioned the president's mental well-being.
Sprinkled throughout these tell-all tomes are unflattering assessments of the president by some of his top-drawer executives. Ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to Woodward, said Trump comprehends like a "fifth- or sixth-grader. " And former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has never denied multiple reports that he labeled Trump a "moron. "
Trump and his supporters have questioned the credibility of some writers, or dismissed their accounts as sour grapes. But you have to wonder how so many aides who were hailed as brilliant choices on their way into the administration suddenly became incompetent hacks on their way out.
With more books in the pipeline, the Trump campaign is eager to try to enforce nondisclosure agreements signed by ex-staffers. What doesn't the White House want the public to know?
People who've served inside the Trump administration keep trying to warn the world that something is terribly awry. Americans ignore them at their peril.

Texto completo: SANTA TERESA DE CAJON, Costa Rica - At his home on the misty slope of Costa Rica's tallest mountain, Dario Angulo keeps a set of photographs from the years he tended the rolling fairways and clipped greens of a faraway American golf resort.
Angulo learned to drive backhoes and bulldozers, carving water hazards and tee boxes out of former horse pastures in Bedminster, N.J., where a famous New Yorker was building a world-class course. Angulo earned $8 an hour, a fraction of what a state-licensed heavy equipment operator would make, with no benefits or overtime pay. But he stayed seven years on the grounds crew, saving enough for a small piece of land and some cattle back home.
Now the 34-year-old lives with his wife and daughters in a sturdy house built by "Trump money," as he put it, with a porch to watch the sun go down.
It's a common story in this small town.
Other former employees of President Donald Trump's company live nearby: men who once raked the sand traps and pushed mowers through thick heat on prized golf property - the "Summer White House," as aides have called it - where his daughter Ivanka got married and where he wants to build a family cemetery.
"Many of us helped him get what he has today," Angulo said. "This golf course was built by illegals."
The Washington Post spoke with 16 men and women from Costa Rica and other Latin American countries, including six in Santa Teresa de Cajon, who said they were employed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. All of them said they worked for Trump without legal status - and that their managers knew.
The former employees who still live in New Jersey provided pay slips documenting their work at the Bedminster club. They identified friends and relatives in Costa Rica who also were employed at the course. In Costa Rica, The Post located former workers in two regions who provided detailed accounts of their time at the Bedminster property and shared memorabilia they had kept, such as Trump-branded golf tees, as well as photos of themselves at the club.
The brightly painted homes that line the road in Santa Teresa de Cajon, many paid for by wages earned more than 4,000 miles away, are the fruits of a long-running pipeline of illegal workers to the president's course, one that carried far more than a few unauthorized employees who slipped through the cracks.
Soon after Trump broke ground at Bedminster in 2002 with a golden shovel, this village emerged as a wellspring of low-paid labor for the private club, which charges tens of thousands of dollars to join. Over the years, dozens of workers from Costa Rica filled jobs as groundskeepers, housekeepers and dishwashers at Bedminster, former employees said. The club hired others from El Salvador, Mexico and Guatemala who spoke to The Post. Many ended up in the blue-collar borough of Bound Brook, N.J., piling into vans before dawn to head to the course each morning.
Their descriptions of Bedminster's long reliance on illegal workers are bolstered by a newly obtained police report showing that the club's head of security was told in 2011 about an employee suspected of using false identification papers - the first known documentation of a warning to the Trump Organization about the legal status of a worker.
Other supervisors received similar flags over the years, including Bedminster's general manager, who was told by a worker from Ecuador several years ago that she entered the country illegally, the employee said.
Eric Trump, a son of the president who runs the Trump Organization along with brother Donald Trump Jr., declined to comment on the accounts by the former workers. Bedminster managers did not return requests for comment.
The company's recent purge of unauthorized workers from at least five Trump properties contributes to mounting evidence that the president benefited for years from the work of illegal laborers he now vilifies.
It remains unclear what measures Trump or his company took to avoid hiring such workers, even after he launched a White House bid built around the threat he says they pose to Americans.
White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Eric Trump has said he and other senior Trump Organization executives did not know the company hired illegal workers, noting that the employees used falsified documents.
"We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices," the company said in a statement in December. "If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately. We take this issue very seriously."
Over the years, the network from Costa Rica to Bedminster expanded as workers recruited friends and relatives, some flying to the United States on tourist visas and others paying smugglers thousands of dollars to help them cross the U.S.-Mexico border, former employees said. New hires needed little more than a crudely printed phony green card and a fake Social Security number to land a job, they said.
Some workers described Bedminster as their launchpad to buy homes and start businesses. Others remembered it as grueling labor under bosses who were demanding, even bigoted - and who at times used the workers' illegal status against them.
After the New York Times in December reported about two housekeepers without legal status who worked at Bedminster, the Trump Organization fired at least 18 employees at five golf courses in New York and New Jersey, part of what Eric Trump has said is "a broad effort" to identify unauthorized workers. An additional undisclosed number were fired from Bedminster, former employees said.
As president, his father has repeatedly called for a crackdown on illegal immigration.
"Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate - it is cruel," Trump said during his recent State of the Union address
But the lax hiring practices at Bedminster and other Trump properties described by former employees - including some who said their supervisors discussed their fake documents - stand in sharp contrast with Trump's rhetoric.
While other top-tier golf U.S. courses adopted the federal government's E-Verify system to check the immigration status of potential hires, the Trump Organization is only now planning to implement it.

MONDAY BUSINESS; THE AGENDA: MARIJUANA INDUSTRY; New vaporizers help get pot dosage right; Dosing is an issue for the industry because newbies don't know how much potent weed they can handle.

Texto completo: A Colorado start-up says it's solved one of the emerging problems in the legal cannabis industry: how to get the dose exactly right.
Gofire Inc. is raising $5 million in a round that values the Denver company at almost $30 million, Chief Executive Peter Calfee said. Its high-end vaporizer, backed by patents, will retail for $499. It doles out a precise amount of marijuana oil -- 2.5 milligrams -- that is heated, turned into vapor and inhaled.
With legal access to cannabis spreading, the marijuana industry is trying to demystify and rebrand the drug in a bid to broaden its reach beyond established stoners. Dosing has become a hot topic, part of the pitch to the inexperienced cannabis consumers who are starting to visit dispensaries to buy the potent weed that's available these days.

As the thinking goes, the soccer mom swapping Chardonnay for a vape pen as she tries to unwind doesn't have four hours to spend locked to the couch, so she needs a way to control how much marijuana she's consuming.
Vaporizers, including disposable pens, are becoming more popular in legal cannabis markets because they're discreet and generally deliver a lighter dose, which is increasingly becoming part of the marketing pitch.
Getting the dose right isn't unique to marijuana. Drinkers have been overindulging for about as long as alcohol has existed, and it's pretty easy to have too much wine and embarrass yourself at the office party.
The difference, industry observers say, is that more and more consumers with little to no cannabis experience are coming into the market, and they don't know much about the products or their tolerance. And although most drinkers learn their limits, weed can be more unpredictable. The concern is that new consumers will be turned off by a bad experience, much like what happened with Maureen Dowd.
The New York Times columnist ate too much of a cannabis chocolate bar during a visit to Colorado in 2014 and spent the next eight hours paranoid and hallucinating in her hotel room.
"When you give a kid Benadryl, you don't just give them the bottle and say swig it," says Gunner Winston, a hedge fund veteran who now runs Dosist, a Santa Monica company that makes vape pens. "There needs to be control -- without that, it can be scary."
Increasingly, cannabis consumers are moving away from flower, the industry's preferred term for actual bud. In 2018, vapes accounted for 20% of the marijuana sales in Colorado, Nevada, Washington and California, according to the cannabis data firm Headset. That was up from 10% in 2017.
Dosist is one of the best-known brands of vape pens in California, the world's largest pot market. The sleek white devices are disposable, and one containing marijuana oil for 200 doses sells for $100. The product buzzes and shuts off after the user inhales for about three seconds, doling out 2.25 milligrams of weed.
Going to a dinner party? Maybe one puff is enough. Relaxing with Netflix on Friday night? That could be a double-dose occasion.
"The idea is to take the guesswork out of cannabis," Winston says.
High-end vaporizers are nothing new. Storz & Bickel, a popular brand sold at dispensaries, makes a device called the Volcano Digit that sells for $599, while a portable version, called Mighty, goes for $349. Heavy users have long seen vaporizers, which heat but don't burn marijuana, as a safer way to consume cannabis.
Pax Labs, which split from the e-cigarette company Juul, makes a popular cannabis vaporizer that first hit the market in 2012. Its latest, fully outfitted model, Pax 3, costs $250 and can be used with a mobile app that lets the user set the temperature to heat the marijuana and choose from settings -- micro, small, medium and large -- that control "draw strength."
"People want to get exactly the right feel," says Bharat Vasan, Pax's CEO. He compared different temperature settings to a drinker choosing among a shot, a beer or a glass of wine. "They want that predictability and control."

Texto completo: More than 60 former staffers of U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar have signed an open letter stating that they have good things to say about her.
The letter, posted Sunday in Medium.com, is in response to a number of reports — most recently from The New York Times, depicting the Minnesota Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate as an overly demanding and at-times demeaning senator to work for, even by Senate standards.
There’s more to her than that, the letter states, noting that many of those who signed it have been contacted by political reporters, who have hotly pursued the story.
“Unfortunately, the positive anecdotes and stories we experienced have not been fully reported by the Times and other media,” the letter reads. “We do not believe these reports adequately describe our thoughts on Amy Klobuchar, many of which we shared with the authors.”
“Amy would be there for us after a loss in the family or help make an important call instrumental to our careers,” notes the letter — echoing themes that in fact were noted in several media accounts. “She’d celebrate our professional accomplishments and be part of our lives, whether it was dancing at our weddings or visiting us after we brought our newborns home. She was there for us in the hard times, too.”
The letter, whose signers include a number of Minnesota political figures, never attempts to rebut any of the allegations made in the stories — all of which came from sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Klobuchar herself has acknowledged pushing her workers “too hard” at times.
Instead, it concludes: “And at the office, she pushed us to be better professionals and public servants. We remain grateful for our time in Senator Klobuchar’s office and still consider Amy a mentor and friend. Sadly, this was not fully conveyed in the recent news reports.”

NY Times: The time the senator ate salad with a comb. And wasn’t happy with her staff about it.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar berated a staff member for not bringing a fork aboard an airplane and then ate her salad with a comb, according to a 2008 anecdote reported in detail for the first time Friday by The New York Times.
The 2008 incident leads a Times piece headlined “How Amy Klobuchar Treats Her Staff,” the latest piece by the national media to scrutinize Klobuchar’s behind-the-scenes behavior. Like previous stories in the Huffington Post and BuzzFeed, the Times reports that none of its two dozen sources would allow their names to be used. In telling several anecdotes that portray Klobuchar demeaning her staff, the story also cites internal emails its reporters obtained.
In various statements since announcing her 2020 presidential candidacy — which coincided with the stories of her treatment of those working for her, Klobuchar has acknowledged she has “pushed people too hard” and is a “tough boss.”
When asked for comment directly by the Times, campaign spokeswoman Carlie Waibel said: “The senator has repeatedly acknowledged that she can be tough and push people hard. But these anonymous stories — some of which are just plain ridiculous — do not overshadow the countless experiences of people on the senator’s team who she has been so proud to work with.”
The Times story also quotes former Klobuchar Senate or campaign workers who praised her, and it explores her internal parental leave policy, which was described as unusual.
First campaign stop in South Carolina will be first snow-free campaign trip
Posted Feb. 22, 2019
Presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar is heading to South Carolina for the first time since announcing her run before hitting New Hampshire again.
On Saturday, Klobuchar will speak at the monthly breakfast fo the Greenville County Democrats, where her Minnesota accent — and yes, they’ll here one in Greenville — will be met with piedmont drawl. This might also be the Amy for America’s first event without snow; the forecast calls for temps in the upper 40s, possibly 50, with rain. She has an evening event at a home in Columbia, the state’s capital.
South Carolina is a perennial early-and-often campaign stop because it’s one of the few pre-Super Tuesday primaries.
Here’s the order:
* Feb. 3: Iowa caucuses
* Feb. 11: New Hampshire primary
* Feb. 22: Nevada caucuses
* Feb. 29: South Carolina primary
Then on March 3, it’s Super Tuesday, which includes powerhouses Texas and California, as well as Minnesota.
On Sunday, she’ll return to New Hampshire.
Campaign staff takes shape with new hires
Posted Feb. 22, 2019
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s presidential campaign staff includes some national names and some that should look familiar to Minnesota insiders.

* Carlie Waibel, national press secretary, is a Minnesota native with national campaign experience who will forever be known among the media as the comms contact during “that snowy day in Minnesota when Klobuchar announced.”
* Elise Convy, deputy national finance director, has managed Senator Klobuchar’s fundraising efforts for the past four years.
* Sam Clark, special advisor, served as the St. Paul city attorney after previously working for Klobuchar as state director and general counsel.
* Jeff Blodgett, special advisor, is an operative of prominence in Minnesota. He oversaw both of Barack Obama’s victories here, and founded Wellstone Action, the liberal organizing group named after the late Sen. Paul Wellstone, where Blodgett cut his teeth.

* Tina Stoll, national finance consultant, runs a political consulting shop and worked on all of Klobuchar’s Senate campaigns.
Georgia fundraiser planned for senator on Friday
Posted Feb. 18, 2019
Presidential hopeful Sen. Amy Klobuchar will head to Atlanta later this week for a fundraiser hosted by several influential Georgians.
According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the Minnesota senator will be at a Friday fundraiser at the home of Gordon Giffin, the former U.S. ambassador to Canada. The gathering’s co-hosts include former Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes and Sheri and Steve Labovitz, “prominent donors to Democratic causes.”
The fundraiser will cost $1,000 to attend and $5,600 to co-host, according to the Journal-Constitution.
Klobuchar hits $1 million fundraising mark in 48 hours
Posted Feb. 13, 2019
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s 2020 presidential campaign has raised more than $1 million, the campaign says.
Campaigns frequently tout such milestones as a way to garner more donations. The $1 million mark was reached within 48 hours of Klobuchar’s campaign announcement, the campaign announced Tuesday evening.
Another milestone the campaign pushed out to the media and supporters: ” Less than 20 minutes after the Senator’s campaign officially launched on Sunday, she received campaign contributions from every state in the country.”
Do with that what you will.

Klobuchar issues statement on Ilhan Omar’s allegedly anti-Semitic remarks
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has weighed in on the latest controversy surrounding fellow Minnesota Democrat U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minneapolis and her views toward Jews.
“Anti-Semitic language should have no place in Congress or our country,” according to the statement, emailed by a campaign official to the Pioneer Press. “Apologizing was the right thing to do.” That’s the entire statement.
Omar said she “unequivocally” apologized after a tweet suggesting that supporters of Israel in Congress are bought and paid for by a bipartisan pro-Israel lobbying group. To many, the remark went beyond a critique of money’s influence in politics and evoked the anti-Semitic trope that Jews seek to control the world via money. It drew swift rebukes from leaders of both political parties.
Senator won’t take campaign money from corporate PACs
Posted Feb. 11, 2019
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar won’t take money from corporate political action committees as she seeks the Democratic nomination for president in 2020.
A campaign spokeswoman confirmed her rejection, first reported by MSNBC, to the Pioneer Press Monday.
She has, in her previous runs for the Senate, accepted corporate PAC donations. Her refusal to accept them in her 2020 bid could be a way for her to try to establish herself, in her words in her announcement Sunday, as someone with “grit” who will stand up big money.

First Wisconsin, then Iowa, then New Hampshire for CNN town hall with senator
Posted Feb. 11, 2019
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar will head to Wisconsin and Iowa this weekend before appearing at a CNN town hall in New Hampshire on Monday as she begins campaigning for president in earnest.
Iowa is a no-brainer; the state’s precinct caucuses a year from now are the first test for any candidate. New Hampshire’s primary comes next — so also a no-brainer.
But Wisconsin? It’s personal, Klobuchar said: Her mom is from Wisconsin.
And, she strongly hinted, she doesn’t want to make the same mistake as Hillary Clinton, who largely ignored the Badger State — and lost it to President Donald Trump.
“There wasn’t a lot of campaigning in Wisconsin in 2016. That changes with me,” the three-term Minnesota Democrat said Sunday after announcing her run for the White House in 2020. Details of her Wisconsin and Iowa stops weren’t immediately available, but a spokesman said it’ll be Wisconsin and Iowa on Saturday, and Iowa-only on Sunday.
A day after announcing her run for president, CNN reported that it will host a town hall discussion with Amy Klobuchar in New Hampshire. The gathering will introduce the U.S. senator from Minnesota to voters at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire. The town hall will air at 9 p.m. Minnesota time, next Monday on CNN. CNN’s Don Lemon will moderate the discussion.
Klobuchar declares: What national news outlets are saying
Posted Feb. 10, 2019
Here’s what national media outlets are saying about Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s announcement Sunday that she will run for president:
* The Washington Post’s headline about Klobuchar said she made her announcement by “touting herself as a bridge builder.”
* The New York Times ran a “Who is Amy Klobuchar?” video and said she announced, “hopeful that her moderate politics, Midwestern roots and carefully cultivated history of bipartisanship can appeal to a broad swath of voters in contentious times.
* The Hill, a Washington, D.C., outlet covered her announcement but had President Trump mocking Klobuchar’s timing, in a tweet. The president tweeted: “Well, it happened again. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!”
* Online news site Vox noted in its headline that Klobuchar has won every one of her elections by large margins — by 26 percent in 2018 — and emphasized her pragmatism.
* In an opinion piece titled “The Case for Amy Klobuchar,” the Wall Street Journal opened with the statement that Klobuchar “perhaps … can be the Democrats’ consensus candidate.” The op-ed, published before her announcement and then updated Sunday, said she wouldn’t be the “first choice of the socialist left,” but “liberal enough” and a sharp contrast in temperament to Trump.
* An article by Huffington Post said Klobuchar might struggle to get recognition on the stage next to Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey.
* The Los Angeles Times reported that, though Klobuchar lacks much star power “in a Democratic primary packed with it,” she has “the promise of credibility with Midwesterners like those who soured on the Democratic Party in 2016” and could help stop a Trump re-election.

MADURO APPEARS UNLIKELY TO LEAVE WITHOUT A FIGHT

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The pressure is building on Nicolas Maduro.
A host of European countries recognized Juan Guaido as Venezuela's president Monday, after Mr. Maduro predictably failed to meet their eight-day deadline to schedule free and fair elections. President Donald Trump and congressional leaders say all options are on the table. And recently announced U.S. oil sanctions will begin to take effect in the coming weeks as the international community attempts to send humanitarian aid to Venezuelans without Mr. Maduro's assistance.
But Mr. Maduro's past attempts to consolidate power, combined with an unprecedented international response to recognize a leader who does not control the country's military, institutions or a portion of territory, are not seen as having a direct correlation with other U.S.-backed efforts in Latin America and elsewhere. Experts who are both skeptical and supportive of the decision to recognize Mr. Guaido's government and a warp-speed time frame to hold elections in a matter of weeks say violence beyond the sporadic street clashes over the past few weeks is likely, whether foreign troops enter the country or not.
"I don't see Maduro leaving peacefully," said Eric Farnsworth, a former State Department official who is now a vice president of the Council of the Americas and a supporter of the decision to recognize Mr. Guaido. "He's not going to wake up with an epiphany; he's going to have to be forced out. If it happens, it's going to be by Venezuelans . members of the security forces or members of his own coalition, if they see him as ineffective."
Mr. Farnsworth is a critic of arguments made by Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and former Obama foreign policy adviser Ben Rhodes in a Washington Post op-ed last week, who said recognizing Mr. Guaido puts the U.S. in an inflexible position if Mr. Maduro doesn't relent.
"Chest-thumping declarations that melt away over time weaken American power and credibility," Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Murphy wrote. "In Venezuela, if the armed forces continue to back Maduro, then last week's move may come to look feckless, while offering Maduro the opportunity to rally his domestic and foreign backers against U.S. intervention. Reckless talk of military options only compounds this problem."
Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Murphy's argument differed from that of other Democrats who said that sanctions on Venezuelan oil would further cripple Venezuela's economy and hinder the ability for people to obtain food and medicine.
Shannon O'Neil, a senior fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the decision to recognize Mr. Guaido is a "huge break from precedent" where governments continue to recognize de facto leaders who control institutions.
"If you look back historically, the U.S. was not pleased with the Soviet Union for 50 plus years but they still recognized them," Ms. O'Neil said. "I think Ben Rhodes and Chris Murphy were right, it's a risky move. Not only are you condemning Maduro, you're taking it one step further by saying we don't recognize his right to rule because he wasn't elected."
Ms. O'Neil said the move by the U.S. and dozens of other countries is unprecedented.
"You give a rallying focus and hopefully momentum builds behind this person," Ms. O'Neil said. "The risk is that if that doesn't happen, then you're stuck in this limbo with fewer alternatives than if you held your cards a little bit closer."
Mr. Farnsworth said the situation in Venezuela is unique, though the U.S. involvement and eventual invasion to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega in 1989 is the best comparison to the current situation. In that case, the U.S. recognized Guillermo Endara as president on the eve of invading the country, even though Mr. Endara did not control the military or a sizable portion of territory. Both countries have a prized asset that generated billions in revenue - the Panama Canal and Venezuela's massive oil reserves.
In Panama's case, recognizing Mr. Endara gave his government access to the canal's coffers, similar to the U.S. oil sanctions on Venezuela's state-run oil company announced at the end of January. Since the invasion, Panama has held six elections that have generally been considered free and fair.
But in Panama's case the U.S. was acting largely alone and had thousands of troops already stationed in the country. It invaded after Noriega's forces killed U.S. citizens stationed in the country, which hasn't happened in Venezuela. The invasion of Panama drew intense criticism from the Organization of American States at the time, though the organization is now supportive of the decision not to recognize Mr. Maduro.
"If people are not prepared to take steps designed to support the nascent Guaido government, this could flop and that would be a huge setback," Mr. Farnsworth said. "Does that mean the ultimate answer is U.S. troops? I don't think that's a healthy conversation to have. If Maduro wants to have U.S. troops at his doorstep, he'll start targeting U.S. citizens."
Mr. Farnsworth said the only scenario where Mr. Maduro is pressured to leave without violence involves Russia and China becoming convinced that Mr. Maduro's potential successor would be better for them than the status quo and working with the international community on a transition plan. Russia and China continue to recognize Mr. Maduro, and Russia has sent aircraft to Venezuela amid reports that Mr. Maduro is looking to remove gold reserves from the country.
"That's the cleanest way but also the least likely," Mr. Farnsworth said.
Dany Bahar, a Venezuelan economist and Brookings Institute fellow, said the ongoing humanitarian crisis is the variable that makes Mr. Maduro vulnerable compared to other autocratic rulers who maintained power for decades.
"If the humanitarian crisis keeps going it's not going to stabilize, it's only going to get worse," Mr. Bahar said. "Even if Maduro manages to stay in power it's going to be very challenging. Even if he has all the power and all the weapons, he's going to be in a very unstable environment."
The instability due to sanctions could hinder Mr. Maduro's ability to dole out money to cronies and senior military officers, and increase the chances that military officers throw their power and guns behind Mr. Guaido. Venezuelan air force Gen. Francisco Yanez defected from Mr. Maduro early this month, though most senior military officers are sticking with him for now.
"I think it's pretty uncharted territory. If it pushes momentum and leads to the end of Maduro's regime it will be deemed a huge success and it will be worth it," Ms. O'Neil said. "If Maduro is still the head of the regime three months from now . you can make it worse. You have some repression, you've seen 40-plus people killed, but there's scenarios where it gets worse and you could see a civil war. The crackdown gets so bad that you see many people dead and another 3 to 5 million people flee."

GOVERNMENT SHOULD LEAVE THE TELEGRAPH ALONE; WHAT WE SAID 150 YEARS AGO

Texto completo: This State Journal editorial ran on Jan. 26, 1869:
The proposition that the government shall take the whole business of the telegraph into its hands is, we are pleased to observe, meeting with formidable opposition.
We can see no good reason why the government should assume control of the telegraph any more than of the business of the express companies. With the same propriety it might go into a general retail business, and establish shops throughout the country for the sale of groceries and dry goods.
A proposition has already been made for the government to purchase all the cotton grown in the country and retail it. It might equally well buy all the wheat, tobacco and corn.
The proper function of government, however, as defined by the highest authorities, is to refrain as far as possible from any interference with trade and industry, and confine itself to the protection of every citizen in the enjoyment of all his natural rights which do not interfere with the equal rights of his fellows.
We hope the government will let the telegraph alone, and leave private enterprise to build all the telegraphic lines it pleases and control them as it pleases.
It has been claimed that in some countries in Europe where the government owns and manages all telegraphic lines that dispatches are sent more cheaply and with more promptness and accuracy. These assertions, however, are challenged in an able article by The New York Times. ...
While the average cost of telegrams in Europe was 81 cents, in the three countries where the people were let alone and suffered to manage the business themselves, it averages only 51 cents. ...

Texto completo: In a little-noticed side impact of California's 2018 law granting drivers the option of listing their gender as nonbinary, California's Department of Insurance has decreed that auto insurance companies can no longer grant breaks in insurance rates to teen drivers who are female or charge young men more.
Outgoing Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones, in one of his final acts in office, issued a regulation last month prohibiting the use of gender in automobile insurance rating, similar to regulations in six other states.
Jones' replacement, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, supports that policy, saying in a statement: "Gender, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation are beyond your control, and it is not a fair or even an effective way to predict risk."
Jones' regulatory action received coverage in The New York Times and elsewhere. But the genesis of Jones' decision received far less attention—and had nothing to do with car insurance.
It was, at least in part, legislation by Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins granting motorists the option of listing their gender as male, female or nonbinary. As the bill wended its way through the Legislature, Atkins and other backers said it would be a blow for equality.
"Mindful of all the people I know who are gender-nonconforming, and the families I know with transgender children, I wanted to make sure that California continued to be a leader in gender-identity equality," Atkins said after Gov. Jerry Brown signed it into law in October.
Lobbyists for insurance companies had been neutral on the bill, having received assurances that it would have no impact on auto insurance rates.
Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, which represents several major auto insurance companies, said insurers were blindsided by Jones' justification for the regulation, pointing out that none of the 10 legislative analyses of the Atkins bill made any mention of the bill's impact on insurance rates.
"It is commonly understood that teenage male drivers are generally a higher risk than teenage female drivers," Frazier said in a letter to the Department of Insurance. "Eliminating gender rating would require female teenage drivers to subsidize teenage male drivers."
Frazier said the gender of teen drivers can result in an additional cost for boys or discount for girls of about 6 percent on their premiums.
Drivers who list their gender as nonbinary probably would have been given a lower cost than boys, he said, though under the new rule, gender cannot be taken into account.
In a separate letter to the Insurance Department, the American Insurance Association, an insurance trade group, wrote: "Senate Bill 179 was designed to reduce barriers to existing name and gender change procedures. The bill was never intended, nor was it drafted, to affect established and demonstrated insurance rating factors such as gender."
The association also cited a 2016 Insurance Institute report saying: "Men typically drive more miles than women and more often engage in risky driving practices, including not using safety belts, driving while impaired by alcohol, and speeding."
In the rule-making process, Jones responded to the insurance groups by stating that "the Legislature may not have specifically intended to eliminate gender-based insurance rating" but that Atkins' legislation had "relevance as a statement of California's values around the role of gender in society."

Texto completo: Baltimore electronic music wizard Dan Deacon will headline this spring's Tallahassee Film Festival with a DJ set at Gaines Street bar and eatery The Wilbury and a conversation about composing for film.
Deacon's April 6 show, co-sponsored by Word of South and COCA, promises to be one highlight among many at the weekend-long celebration of independent and international cinema. The fest's first wave of film announcements surveys some of the most compelling non-fiction projects of the new year.
The lineup includes two features focused on controversial free-speech issues in the polarized space of American public life.
Penny Lane's subversive Sundance hit "Hail Satan?," a "hilarious movie about the Satanic Temple and its devilish role in the culture wars" (New York Times), will be of interest to Tallahasseeans who remember the kerfuffle over the Temple's fight to claim a place among the religious holiday displays in the Florida Capitol. "The Commons" is an immersive look at the debate over Confederate statuary in a Southern college town by North Carolina filmmakers Michael Galinsky and Suki Hawley ("Halos and Horns").
Southern cultural figures flourish in another pair of films. New Orleans filmmaker Lily Keber ("Bayou Maharajah") brings her new documentary "Buckjumping," about the Big Easy's buoyant street dance tradition, while Frosty Myers, a fabled sculptor and Warhol Factory member – and now a St. Augustine resident – is celebrated in "The Art and Times of Frosty Myers."
Another Southern artist, Tallahassee native Jimmy Joe Roche, brings it home from his current base in Baltimore on April 6 to host a retrospective of his short experimental films.
The festival opens April 5 at CMX Cinemas Fallschase – film to be announced – then moves to multiple venues around Railroad Square and College Town, including All Saints Cinema, the Mickee Faust Club and the Student Life Cinema at Florida State University.
Pre-festival events include a free April 3 appearance by filmmaker and author Mallory O'Meara reading from her book "The Lady from the Black Lagoon" at Midtown Reader, followed by a screening of the Wakulla Springs-shot creature feature at Waterworks.
On April 4, New York singer-songwriter Peg Simone presents a "Southern Gothic Pocket Opera" in collaboration with Tallahassee artist Linda Hall at All Saints Cinema. The performance precedes a screening of Charles Laughton's nightmarish 1954 classic "Night of the Hunter."
General admission to most screenings and events is $10. VIP passes are now on sale at the early-bird rate of $50, and includes admission to the Filmmaker's Brunch April 7 at The Gathering. Early-bird all-access passes are $35. Visit www.tallahasseefilmfestival.com to purchase passes and get more information.
New York singer-songwriter Peg Simone returns to Tallahassee for this year's film festival to present a "Southern Gothic Pocket Opera" in collaboration with Tallahassee artist Linda Hall.

Texto completo: This has been, I say with complete confidence, the weirdest week ever.
Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, wrote a fiery missive accusing the National Enquirer of extortion over his ... what are we calling them? Racy photos? He's not wearing a lot of clothes, but he is wearing a wedding ring. And the intended recipient of said photos was not his wife. Or the National Enquirer, for that matter. Anyway, his essay is fiery and, despite the sordid circumstances, rather awesome.
(Like I said. Weirdest week ever.)
Jill Abramson, former executive editor of The New York Times, is mired in plagiarism claims over her new book, "Merchants of Truth," which is about journalism.
Gucci apologized for selling an $890 sweater that looks like blackface.
Blackface, of course, is already on our minds and tongues because elected officials in Virginia keep admitting they posed in it. Or edited yearbooks full of it. Except the lieutenant governor, who's accused of sexual assault.
Joe Ricketts, the billionaire dad of Cubs owner Tom Ricketts, appears to enjoy and share racist, Islamophobic emails.
Actor Liam Neeson told a newspaper he once prowled the streets looking for a black person to kill.
And actress Michelle Rodriguez said Neeson can't be racist because of the way he kissed Viola Davis.
"Dude, have you watched 'Widows'?" she said at a Wednesday night gala.
"His tongue was so far down Viola Davis' throat. You can't call him a racist ever. Racists don't make out with the race that they hate, especially in the way he does with his tongue -- so deep down her throat. I don't care how good of an actor you are."
Mmmmmkay.
I'd like to stay on that last bit for a minute.
Wanting to have sex with a person is not the same as seeing that person as your equal.
Harvey Weinstein, man. That guy LOVES women. Look how many he tried to get naked!
See how ridiculous that sounds?
You can desire a person, passionately kiss a person, have sex with a person and still not fully recognize or respect that person's worth, outside of the ability to satisfy your needs -- sexual or otherwise.
Slaveholders raped slaves. Strom Thurmond, a notorious segregationist, fathered a daughter with his African-American housekeeper.
I'm not equating Neeson's words with raping slaves or pushing for segregation. I'm saying history proves sexual desire doesn't equal open-mindedness or the desire for parity.
What has a person done to champion equality in his or her community? How has a person pushed for inclusion at his or her workplace? What has a person done to chip away at bias -- inherent, structural, historic or otherwise?
Who are a person's close friends?
That, I'll listen to. He kissed hard? Eh.
Crazy stuff happens in the bedroom. Or in the pursuit of the bedroom. Ask Jeff Bezos. It's not the place to judge a person's commitment to a fair and equal society. And pretending it is distracts from the larger, more thoughtful and useful conversations we need to be having around race, gender, power, equality.
If we can take away one thing from this supremely weird week, I hope it's that.

The state of journalism

Texto completo: Jill Abramson became the first woman executive editor of The New York Times in 2011, when newspapers everywhere were facing shrinking advertising, declining readership and fierce competition from the web. They were cutting staffs, news pages, foreign and domestic bureaus and in some cases shutting down completely.
Because of Craigslist and similar websites, the classified advertising that had accounted for 40 percent of newspaper revenues disappeared overnight. Circulation nose-dived as people began getting news from computers and smartphones. And the country was flooded with digital content that looked like news but was in fact advertising, entertainment and political propaganda posing as news. When Ben Smith created the first news operation at BuzzFeed in 2012, he said that the staff had so little understanding of traditional journalism that "They didn't even know what rules they were breaking."
Abramson's tenure was brief. Three years into the job she was fired by the publisher, Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. In part it was because an internal study said she had been slow to integrate the paper's website into the newsroom and had resisted efforts to help generate new revenue. In part it was because of a remarkably wrongheaded move in which she offered someone a job as co-managing editor without telling Dean Baquet, the popular managing editor, what she was doing. And in part it was because an evaluation by Sulzberger that she says told her, in effect, "People think you're a bitch."     
Abramson felt some of Sulzberger's criticisms were sexist. But if she had failings as an editor, her new book, "Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," shows that she's an excellent reporter and a talented writer. It's a lively, engaging, provocative and important book about the difficulties of doing honest journalism when there's less money to pay for it. 
The book focuses on two formerly wealthy and powerful newspapers, the Times and The Washington Post, that were threatened by the changes, and two wildly successful digital startups, BuzzFeed and Vice, that began doing serious news after developing huge audiences by offering pictures of dogs wearing sunglasses and "native advertising" puff pieces about paying clients disguised as news. Abramson writes that the two newcomers, along with other digital media, "were giving the old guard serious competition - and heartburn."  
She shows how newspapers were slow to embrace the new technologies, with many journalists looking down on digital staffers. She shows missed opportunities, with Sulzberger declining to invest in Google, and The Washington Post allowing Mark Zuckerberg renege on an agreement to let it buy 10 percent of Facebook. And she describes in compelling detail how the Sulzbergers managed to save the Times while the Graham family, which owned the Post, was forced to sell the Post.    
"Merchants of Truth" has been criticized for several supposed errors and for score-settling, and Fox News gloated that the book claims the Times news pages are "unmistakably anti-Trump."  She also has been accused of plagiarism.  It's hard to find any 400-page book without a few minor errors, and score-settling is to be expected given that Abramson was driven out of the Times like a typhoid carrier. But it's a solid work, and she in fact has high praise for the Times' coverage of the president.  
Abramson believes the Times and the Post have performed a great public service with their coverage of a dangerously inept presidency, showing the urgency of a free press and the role that traditional reporting still plays. She applauds Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, who bought the Post and is using his great personal wealth to revive an important news organization at an important time. 
She remains troubled by the evisceration of local news; by fake news and foreign intervention; by Facebook's eschewing standards to ensure material on its platform is truthful and fair; by the polarization that has people choosing only those news outlets that reinforce their predispositions; and by cable television's reliance on punditry, which is cheap, rather than on reporting, which is costly. And she's troubled by the ongoing volatility that caused recent cutbacks in the news units of BuzzFeed and Vice.  
What's at risk today, Abramson says, is not just the media industry but "truth and freedom in a democratic society, an informed citizenry, and news sources that [are] above politics in their reporting." All of which makes her appreciative of the man who fired her. "During the darkest financial hours, Sulzberger had kept the lights on," she concludes, ensuring the Times would remain "a beacon of truth and fierce protector of facts."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general, told Congress on Friday that he had "not interfered in any way with the special counsel's investigation" into Russia's 2016 election-manipulation operation since President Trump installed him atop the Justice Department.
During an often contentious oversight hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Whitaker also testified that he had provided no inside information about that inquiry, or related ones in the Southern District of New York, to Mr. Trump or his lawyers and White House aides.
"I do not believe that I have briefed third-party individuals outside of the Department of Justice," Mr. Whitaker said. "I have received the briefings myself, and I'm usually the endpoint of that information."
While Mr. Whitaker provided those bottom-line claims up front, he refused to discuss many other things -- like his conversations with Mr. Trump, or why he recently said the special counsel inquiry would soon wrap up -- as questions about the Russia investigation dominated the hearing. The committee chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, told Mr. Whitaker that he would seek to force him to submit to further questioning in a later deposition.
After taking control of the House in the midterm elections, Democrats made it an early priority to get Mr. Whitaker in front of the oversight committee before his expected replacement by William P. Barr, whom the Senate is likely to confirm next week as attorney general. Mr. Whitaker's voluntary appearance followed a last-minute fight with Democrats on Thursday over whether they would commit to not serving him with a subpoena before or on Friday -- a precursor to potentially citing him for contempt of Congress.
The hearing also touched on a series of other topics. Among them, Mr. Whitaker denied that the Justice Department had recently decided to issue a legal opinion restricting online gambling -- reversing an interpretation the department had issued in 2011 -- as a gift to casino owners like Sheldon G. Adelson, the casino magnate and a major Republican donor. Mr. Whitaker said he had no involvement in the opinion, but rejected as "absolutely wrong" the premise that the process was corrupt.
But the hearing focused mainly on the Russia investigation. It quickly became contentious, as Mr. Nadler used his opening statement to blast Mr. Whitaker for refusing to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation despite the recommendation of Justice Department ethics officials that he step aside because of his past public comments criticizing it.
The panel's ranking Republican, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, in turn accused Mr. Nadler of engaging in "character assassination" and "political theater" and of wasting time by obtaining authority to subpoena Mr. Whitaker. Mr. Collins then forced an unsuccessful roll-call vote on whether to immediately adjourn the hearing.
And when Mr. Nadler began questioning Mr. Whitaker, the acting attorney general refused to provide details about when and how many times he had been briefed about the Russia investigation, which is led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Then, when Mr. Nadler asked Mr. Whitaker if he had ever been asked to approve any request for action to be taken by Mr. Mueller, Mr. Whitaker audaciously replied: "Mr. Chairman, I see that your five minutes is up."
The room broke into laughter as Mr. Nadler looked up in apparent disbelief at the breach of decorum, but then grinned himself and let it slide, noting that he did not enforce the five-minute rule during Mr. Whitaker's opening statement. Mr. Nadler then directed Mr. Whitaker to "answer the question, please."
Mr. Whitaker's retorts to lawmakers soon irked Democrats. "Mr. Attorney General, we are not joking here," said Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas, during one exchange. "And your humor is not acceptable."
But as a matter of substance, the takeaway was that Mr. Whitaker testified under oath that he had never used his position to provide inside information about the Russia inquiry to Mr. Trump or his proxies, nor had he taken any step to impede Mr. Mueller's work -- both fears that Democrats have repeatedly expressed since Mr. Trump installed him as acting head of the department.
"I want to be very specific about this, Mr. Chairman, because I think it will allay a lot of fears that have existed among this committee, among the legislative branch, largely, and maybe amongst some American people," Mr. Whitaker said. "We have followed the special counsel's regulations to a T. There's been no event, no decision that has required me to take any action, and I've not interfered in any way with the special counsel's investigation."
Mr. Whitaker pointedly declined at multiple points, though, to defend Mr. Mueller and his investigation from accusations by Mr. Trump or others that he was conducting a "witch hunt."
Several moments in Mr. Whitaker's testimony were notable because they raised potential tensions with news reports. For example, CNN reported in December that Mr. Trump had yelled at Mr. Whitaker after two developments in the case involving the president's former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, that rattled the White House: Mr. Cohen's decision to plead guilty to lying about the Trump Organization's work on a tower project in Moscow and the fact that the president was identified as Individual-1 in the Cohen plea papers.
Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, brought up that report and asked whether it was true that Mr. Trump had lashed out at Mr. Whitaker, who at first seemed to demur, noting that Mr. Trump had said on Twitter that he did not lash out.
But Mr. Cicilline, saying he did not have confidence in the veracity of what Mr. Trump tweets, pressed Mr. Whitaker to answer under oath about whether the president had lashed out or otherwise expressed dissatisfaction over the Cohen case developments.
"No, he did not," Mr. Whitaker said.
Mr. Whitaker also told several lawmakers that he had never talked to anyone at the White House or in Mr. Trump's circle about his views of the Mueller inquiry before joining the Justice Department in September 2017 as chief of staff to Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general.
Mr. Whitaker had made public comments that were skeptical of the Russia investigation during that period, and The New York Times has reported that in July 2017, Mr. Whitaker had interviewed with Donald F. McGahn II, then serving as Mr. Trump's White House counsel, about the possibility of becoming the main White House lawyer who would manage and respond to the Mueller investigation. The White House instead ended up giving that job to Ty Cobb.
Later, under questioning by Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, Mr. Whitaker acknowledged having applied for the job that went to Mr. Cobb. But he said he had spoken only with Mr. McGahn's chief of staff, Annie Donaldson, and not Mr. McGahn himself about it. Either way, when Mr. Swalwell expressed incredulity that his views of the Mueller investigation would not have come up during such an interview, Mr. Whitaker insisted that Ms. Donaldson had not asked about them.
"They did not want to talk about the investigation because the folks were dealing with that investigation, and that's why they wanted to bring in someone that had been unrelated to the investigation and the campaign," Mr. Whitaker said, adding: "We did not discuss it. We discussed about my background as a U.S. attorney and my legal practice."
But at the end of the hearing, Mr. Nadler called Mr. Whitaker's testimony on the topic of communications with the White House before joining the Justice Department inconsistent at best. And Mr. Nadler reiterated his intention to call Mr. Whitaker back for another interview, "under subpoena if necessary," to answer additional questions he had declined to address on Friday.
"It is not credible that you both interviewed for a job handling the president's response to the special counsel investigation and never conveyed your opinions about that investigation to the White House," Mr. Nadler said. "We require answers to these questions."

Texto completo: Anyone remember blogs?
Years before Facebook, Instagram and Twitter took over as the prime spots for oversharing, people had to go to websites like Open Diary, Blogger and LiveJournal to publish their thoughts for the world to read.
But over time, social media became the way that people shared articles that reflected their politics, posted images of loved ones and sent out messages of frustration or exultation.
Medium, the online open platform and publisher, is one bloglike platform that has persisted and innovated in the social media era. With 90 million unique monthly visitors, it has maintained relevance as a destination for open letters, petitions and personal essays. But it scarcely sparks such frenetic reactions as it did Thursday night.
That was when Jeff Bezos, Amazon's billionaire chief executive, took to the website to accuse American Media Inc., the parent company of The National Enquirer, of "extortion and blackmail." The headline of the post was "No thank you, Mr. Pecker," a reference to David J. Pecker, the chairman of American Media.
The post went viral, and Medium soon found itself in the middle of a major news story.
In a statement, a Medium spokeswoman said the site hadn't known that Mr. Bezos was going to publish the post.
"We do not actively monitor the specific, nonpublic details and actions of these (or any) accounts out of respect to and adherence to their individual privacies," the spokeswoman, Sandee Roston, said in an emailed statement.
The opportunity to publish for a nonbranded platform has made Medium, which was founded by Ev Williams in 2012, an appealing destination for a number of marquee media figures and chief executives.
Katie Couric has used Medium to promote interviews and philanthropic partnerships. Joanna Coles, the former chief content officer of Hearst Magazines, used the platform to write about her experience as a working mother.
In 2015, Jay Carney, the senior vice president of global corporate affairs for Amazon, disputed an article in The New York Times about Amazon's work culture in a post on Medium. Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, responded on the platform, defending The Times's reporting.
Medium can be appealing because it's unfiltered and posts can be however long the writer wants them to be. For Mr. Bezos, that was about 2,100 words.
"When people have something to say, they come to Medium, where they can say it at length," Ms. Roston, the spokeswoman, said in the statement. "We make it easy for people to publish; it's clean and well designed, and there are no ads."

Texto completo: Jake Flores is excited to hit the road again.
It's what he does as a comedian.
“Whenever I can, I'll get on the road,” he says in a recent phone interview. “I operate out of New York, and I'm building my audience through my shows. Nowadays, I'm able to get out more and I can draw an audience in places I've never been.”
Flores began stand-up comedy when he was 19.
Now 32, he's found his voice and uses it to talk about a myriad of issues.
His comedy has gotten him raided by the government for a 2018 tweet, retweeted by everyone from Tom Morello to Bette Midler, and published in The New York Times.
He has toured nationally, opening for Doug Stanhope, Tig Notaro, Greg Fitzsimmons, Jim Norton, Felipe Esparza and Patton Oswalt.
He's signed to Stand Up! Records and tours regularly while not running his popular Brooklyn show, “Yoko.”
“What's attractive about comedy is that you do have a point of view,” he says. “But you also have to get to the point and make it funny.”
For Flores, there's something selfish about performing comedy.
“Being on stage and getting laughs is the best thing in the world,” he says. “Especially when you're doing comedy. I get to hang out with people in the audience and it's very unpretentious. I love traveling around and having an experience when I'm directly talking to people.”
Flores will be joining fellow artist Mishka Shubaly in Albuquerque at O'Niell's on Tuesday, Feb. 12.
The pair have a fairly long history of friendship.
“Me and Mishka make for an interesting show,” he says. “I was a fan of his the first time I saw him opening for Doug Stanhope. I really liked his stuff and had been following him online. Years later, we performed together on some shows. We became fans and friends of each other. It's been a great friendship for the both of us.”
Flores says that, as a comic, he's constantly writing because everything has to be fresh for each show.
He says reading a room is also a skill he's picked up over the course of his career on stage.
“The biggest part of a show is that you're making a painstaking difficult effort to make it look easy,” he says of comedy. “I try not to get stuck in my ways and learn something new from each show.”
GREG'S COMEDY FRIENDSHIP

Publisher fails to pull ex-New York Times editor's book containing alleged plagiarism

Texto completo: Publishing house Simon & Schuster has not pulled a book by former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson, even though it contains errors and alleged instances of plagiarism. The book, Merchants of Truth , remains for sale on Amazon and in bookstores around the country.

Abramson acknowledged in a Thursday interview with NPR, "I fell short," admitting errors and attribution issues in the book, which tracks trends in news businesses.

“In several of these cases the language is too close for comfort," Abramson told NPR, saying, "I will do everything within my power to correct anything that is imperfect in my book.”

The publisher, as well as U.K. publishing imprint Bodley Head, did not respond to request for comment on the fate of already printed books.

Abramson's trouble began earlier this week, when Vice News reporter Michael Moynihan posted on Twitter a series of six side-by-side passages allegedly appropriated from other sources. Moynihan also alleged factual errors. Abramson has vowed to correct the book's errors and alleged instances of plagiarism.

Despite the uncorrected copies sitting on the shelves, Abramson will forge ahead with a national book tour.

Abramson confirmed to the Washington Examiner she will promote the book Wednesday at the Newseum, a Washington institution pilloried as "journalism's monument to itself." CNN media journalist Brian Stelter is scheduled to moderate.

Newseum spokesman Sonya Gavankar confirmed the event, which is free but requires registration, is “still on."

Abramson told the Washington Examiner her book tour includes “many” stops “to many cities." Her Simon & Schuster publicity agent did not immediately supply a complete list.

As the first female editor of the Times, Abramson led the newspaper from 2011-2014, before she was fired and replaced with Dean Baquet, whom she criticized in the book for presiding over a drift in editorial standards.

POST-GAZETTE ASKS COURT TO UNSEAL HANEY SHALE GAS CASE SETTLEMENT

Texto completo: The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is seeking to unseal the confidential settlement of a high-profile court case in which Stacey Haney and her neighbors allege their health was damaged by toxic spills, leaks and air pollutants from a Range Resources Appalachia LLC shale gas well site in Amwell, Washington County.
Attorney Frederick Frank, representing the Post-Gazette, filed an emergency petition Monday with Judge Michael J. Lucas in Washington County Common Pleas Court to intervene and unseal the settlement in that six-year-long case filed in 2012.
Following a brief hearing on the motion Thursday morning, Judge Lucas scheduled arguments for 1 p.m. Feb. 25 on both the newspaper's request to intervene and whether to unseal the settlement terms.
The case -which also alleged that Range and two commercial water-testing laboratories conspired to conceal the presence of hazardous contaminants in the water supplies of residents living near the company's Yeager well site -was settled, sealed and closed in September 2018.
Range attorney Kimberly Brown raised several procedural questions at Thursday's hearing, including that the Post-Gazette had not entered its objections to the sealed settlement in a timely manner, before the case was closed.
Mr. Frank noted that Range made an identical argument in an unsuccessful attempt to block the newspaper from accessing the 2011 confidential settlement in the Hallowich case. That settlement agreement, restored to the public record of the case in 2013, shows that the Hallowich family was paid $750,000 but was prohibited from living within two miles of any Marcellus Shale gas facility, barred from objecting to any drilling under any new property or residence they may own, and prevented from speaking disparagingly about gas industry operations.
"The Superior Court ruled in the Hallowich case the public has the right to intervene at any time to unseal the record," Mr. Frank said.
Mr. Frank argued in his 13-page brief to the court and at the hearing that the press, as a representative of the public, has an important role in protecting the openness of court proceedings. He also said that Range had not overcome the constitutional presumption that court proceedings and documents should be publicly accessible.
Ms. Haney has also filed a motion asking the Washington County court for a protective order seeking to unseal the settlement documents so she can reference them in a separate but related damage case she is pursuing in the Allegheny County Common Pleas Court. The hearing Thursday was originally scheduled to deal with her motion to strike a supplemental filing by Range opposing the protective order.
In the Allegheny County case, Ms. Haney alleges that the Washington County settlement was adversely affected by the unauthorized sharing of her health records in violation of the federal HIPAA law mandating confidentiality of such records.
The Post-Gazette learned of the settlement last week while reporting that state Attorney General Josh Shapiro has empaneled a grand jury to investigate potential "environmental crimes" committed by the oil and gas industry in Washington County. The attorney general sent a letter to attorneys representing Ms. Haney and Range that referenced the "Stacey Haney/Range Resources Investigation" and requested that the case record be preserved, under penalty of law.
The story of Ms. Haney and her family, including their health problems, was chronicled in a book, "Amity and Prosperity: One Family and the Fracturing of America," by Eliza Griswold, which was among The New York Times critics' top books of 2018.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette noted the successful bid to unseal filings in the Hallowich family's court case in its current bid to reveal the settlement agreement between the Haney family and Range Resources.

Manafort May Have Lied For Possibility of a Pardon

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Federal prosecutors told a judge this week that Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, might have lied to them about "an extremely sensitive issue" in hopes of increasing the chances that he would be pardoned for his crimes, according to a transcript of the hearing unsealed Thursday.
The heavily redacted document leaves unclear what issue Mr. Manafort was being questioned about. Prosecutors working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, are accusing Mr. Manafort of lying to them repeatedly last year after he agreed to cooperate with their investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race and the Trump campaign in exchange for a possibly lighter sentence.
The discussion of whether Mr. Manafort could have been angling for a presidential pardon came during a closed session Monday in Federal District Court in Washington before Judge Amy Berman Jackson. Judge Jackson is exploring the prosecution's claims that Mr. Manafort lied before she sentences Mr. Manafort for two felonies to which he pleaded guilty in her court.
During the hearing, the prosecutors also detailed how they believed Mr. Manafort deceived them about his contacts with Konstantin V. Kilimnik, a longtime business partner in Ukraine who prosecutors say has contacts with Russian intelligence.
One meeting between Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik in New York after Mr. Trump had won the Republican presidential nomination "goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the special counsel's office is investigating," said Andrew Weissmann, a prosecutor on Mr. Mueller's team.
The prosecution's statement about a potential pardon was misattributed in the transcript to a lawyer for Mr. Manafort, Richard Westling, but was actually made by Mr. Weissmann, according to a spokesman for the special counsel.
Mr. Weissmann said that Mr. Manafort could have been worried that if he spoke truthfully, it might have "negative consequences in terms of the other motive that Mr. Manafort could have, which is to at least augment his chances for a pardon."
Another prosecutor, Greg D. Andres, told the judge that the special counsel's office was concerned that Mr. Manafort was misleading them about his contacts with administration officials because at the same time Mr. Manafort was cooperating with the prosecutors, he was sharing information about the special counsel's investigation.
Under a joint defense agreement among a number of people being scrutinized in the Mueller inquiry, one of Mr. Manafort's lawyers, Kevin Downing, periodically briefed the president's legal team on Mr. Manafort's discussions with the prosecutors and F.B.I. agents.
"You see Mr. Manafort changing his story so as not to implicate" others, Mr. Andres told the judge. Mr. Weissmann said that in several instances, Mr. Manafort "went out of his way" to withhold evidence that could have been used against Mr. Kilimnik.
Mr. Manafort's lawyers have argued that Mr. Manafort never deliberately lied, but only inadvertently misstated certain facts. In at least one case, Judge Jackson seemed sympathetic to that argument. She pointed out that Mr. Manafort had corrected himself in the very same session, asking, "Why would this be something that we would characterize as the crime of making an intentionally false statement?"
But the judge seemed to consider other statements by Mr. Manafort to be more seriously misleading. And the prosecutors argued that Mr. Manafort's misstatements were not minor at all, but had bearing on continuing criminal investigations.
They said that Mr. Manafort had tried to obfuscate the truth about his use of $125,000 from a pro-Trump political action committee to pay his legal bills. At the time, he was facing criminal investigations that ultimately led to his conviction for 10 felonies, including tax fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy. Mr. Weissmann described that arrangement as "to put it charitably, a scheme," and that Mr. Manafort lied to hide knowledge of it.
He stressed that information about that element of the case, apparently involving suspected kickbacks from the political action committee, was being kept secret -- a hint that a criminal inquiry is continuing.
The prosecutors also suggested that they are continuing to look into Mr. Manafort's dealings with Mr. Kilimnik. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik maintained ties both during the five months that Mr. Manafort worked for Mr. Trump's campaign and after Mr. Manafort was fired as campaign chairman in August 2016, prosecutors said.
The special counsel's office is claiming that Mr. Manafort lied about the number of times that he and Mr. Kilimnik discussed a plan that apparently would have eased American-led sanctions against Russia in exchange for certain concessions that Russia would make regarding Ukraine. Russia's invasion of Ukraine provoked the imposition of sanctions that the Kremlin wants lifted.
In what appears to be a reference to the peace plan, the transcript states that Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik discussed the issue at least five times: in August 2016, in December 2016, during the inauguration week of January 2017, in February 2017 and during winter 2018. Mr. Downing told Judge Jackson that documents that prosecutors had produced detailing communications with Mr. Kilimnik were "nonsense" because whether or not Mr. Trump was elected, "the sanctions were going to continue against Russia."
But Mr. Weissmann said the Aug. 2, 2016, meeting was highly unusual given that Mr. Manafort was then busy running Mr. Trump's campaign. "That meeting and what happened at that meeting is of significance to the special counsel," he said.
Joining Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik that day at the Grand Havana club in Manhattan was Rick Gates, deputy chairman of the Trump campaign and Mr. Manafort's longtime right-hand man. The three men apparently considered the get-together to be sensitive. When the meeting broke up, prosecutors said, Mr. Manafort "took the precaution" of leaving with Mr. Gates through a separate door than Mr. Kilimnik.
The transcript makes clear that Mr. Gates, who pleaded guilty to two felonies and has been cooperating with prosecutors for a year, was a key source of information about Mr. Manafort, Mr. Kilimnik and other issues central to their inquiry.
For instance, it was apparently Mr. Gates who revealed to prosecutors that Mr. Manafort had ordered Trump campaign polling data to be sent to Mr. Kilimnik as Mr. Trump was clinching the Republican nomination in spring 2016. The New York Times has reported that Mr. Manafort wanted Mr. Kilimnik to pass the data to two oligarchs who had financed Ukrainian political parties aligned with Russia.
Prosecutors said Mr. Manafort lied about the data transfer even though he had access to reports of the F.B.I.'s interviews and was "very well aware of what Mr. Gates had said about sharing of polling data."
Mr. Downing suggested that the special counsel's office was not nearly skeptical enough of Mr. Gates, who is awaiting sentencing for conspiracy and lying to the federal authorities. If the judge decides that Mr. Manafort lied based on what Mr. Gates has said, Mr. Downing said, "We would really have grave concerns."
But Judge Jackson cited corroboration for Mr. Gates's statements about Mr. Manafort. She also said the fact that Mr. Gates had previously been caught lying did not mean that "not one word he said to the Office of Special Counsel was true."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: In 1957, The New York Times published a profile of President Dwight Eisenhower's first assistant for national security affairs, a position that would eventually become known as national security adviser. "No man in the Government, with the possible exception of the President, knows so many of the nation's strategic secrets," the Times declared of Robert "Bobby" Cutler. The paper then employed a mess of contradictions to describe this Massachusetts Republican. "A proper Bostonian" who is also a "Rabelaisian with a salty vocabulary," "an earnest Episcopalian" and "a man who can move so quickly from ribaldry to piety and back to ribaldry again," "a 'slave driver' who can force his staff to work as hard as he works himself" but also "a charming and generous friend," Cutler was "a bachelor's bachelor ... who has had a lifelong love affair" not with any person but with his hometown, Boston.
To add another paradox, barely hinted at by the Times: Cutler was a gay man who sat atop the national security bureaucracy at a time when people like him were being purged from government service.
This we know thanks to a new biography, "Ike's Mystery Man: The Secret Lives of Robert Cutler." Written by Cutler's great-nephew, Peter Shinkle, it is based largely upon a set of secret diaries that Cutler wrote during his time in the Eisenhower administration and that he never intended anyone, except the (human) object of his affection, to see. While the interests of America's historical record - long bereft of gay history, which is often elusive by nature - may be served by revealing the intimate details of Cutler's interior life, whether he merits a full-length biography is another matter.
Born into a Boston Brahmin family, Cutler was a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School. After working as a lawyer, banker and political fixer, he got to know Eisenhower personally as an aide on his 1952 national whistle-stop campaign train tour. As much as Cutler's bloodline made him a natural fit for the WASP aristocracy leading the new Eisenhower administration, his sexual orientation threatened his privileged position.
Shortly after swearing the oath of office, Eisenhower began weeding "subversives" out of the federal government. Elected amid the Red Scare, Ike had won the presidency partly because of a sense that the long-reigning Democrats were soft on communism, which in the public mind had become linked with homosexuality. A whisper campaign, abetted by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, tarred the recently divorced Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson, as a homosexual; Sen. Everett Dirksen, R-Ill., associated Stevenson with "the lavender lads of the State Department." Ike's campaign slogan, "Let's Clean House," alluded not only to corruption but sedition and sexual impropriety.
On Inauguration Day, Attorney General Herbert Brownell submitted a draft executive order to the new president mandating security background checks for all new federal employees. The following day, Cutler suggested a more sweeping policy, one that had been proposed by a government commission during the previous Truman administration but never implemented. Under the proposed regulations, sexual perversion" should be a factor in determining whether an employee posed a security risk, alongside the more conventional menace of communist sympathies. While "sexual perversion" was undefined, its intended target was obvious: homosexuals.
As a result of Executive Order 10450, signed by the president on April 27, 1953, thousands of patriotic gay men and women lost their jobs in what later became known as the "Lavender Scare," far more than would ever fall victim to the Red Scare. Shinkle's contribution to history is his revelation that a gay man played an important bureaucratic role in this tragedy by advocating a policy that lowered the threshold for dismissal from disloyalty to homosexuality.
There are not many more such previously undisclosed moments in this book, however, much of which treads familiar Cold War history. Cutler emerges as a bystander to far more significant figures like Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, CIA Director Allen Dulles and Hoover.
Following a leave of absence Cutler took during the "politically sensitive" period around the 1956 re-election campaign, which may have been prompted by rumormongering about his sexuality, Hoover wrote the returning administration official a letter. "Dear Bobbie," the FBI director - himself a bachelor dogged by gay rumors - began, conspicuously using the feminine form. Cutler, no less catty in his reply, used letterhead from the bank at which he was working, embellished with the image of a Puritan and the motto, "Worthy of Your Trust."
"Ike's Mystery Man" becomes a genuinely engrossing read in its final third, when Cutler develops a romantic interest in a National Security Council staffer half his age. Thus begins, by his own description, "the greatest adventure of my life," an adventure that is by turns pathetic and illuminating. Pathetic, as the romance is unrequited yet strung along by the younger man, who at most admits to platonic love for Cutler. Illuminating, because it resembles the experiences of countless men and women who, forced for so long to mask their true selves, appeared to the world as mysteries.
James Kirchick, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the author of "The End of Europe: Dictators, Demagogues and the Coming Dark Age." He is writing a history of gay Washington.

At prayer breakfast, Trump is likely to reassure religious conservatives

Texto completo: Cultural shifts have left many evangelicals feeling politically vulnerable
Since his campaign, President Trump has taken a page from President Ronald Reagan's playbook.
"I know you can't endorse me," Reagan famously told a room full of evangelicals in 1980. "But . . . I want you to know that I endorse you."
Whenever he takes the stage in front of conservative Christians, Trump uses those opportunities to remind them of his promises, such as appointing Supreme Court justices who could help overturn Roe v . Wade and making"Merry Christmas" a more common greeting during the holidays.
On Thursday, Trump will address the National Prayer Breakfast, where he will speak to leaders from around the globe, including clergy, diplomats and lobbyists. The annual event at the Washington Hilton especially attracts conservative evangelicals jockeying to rub shoulders with Washington's elite. Every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has attended the event that draws several thousand people. This year's event will be co-chaired by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.).
For the past two years, Trump has used his speech to reiterate that the promises he has made speak to a core concern among many conservative Christians: that their influence is waning and that their livelihoods could even come under attack.
Trump's promises usually have the same theme: He will keep them safe.
"Many evangelicals trust that the infusion of God people and some God talk will result in God-intentioned things," said Gerardo Marti, a sociologist at Davidson College who studies religion and recently published a journal article on evangelicals' affinity for Trump. "It's a nice platform for Trump to say, 'See, I'm with you.' "
As Trump's approval ratings took a hit after the shutdown of the federal government, he tweeted praise of states that have proposed introducing Bible literacy classes in public schools.
"My sense is that when Trump needs a boost, he routinely turns to those issues he knows will resonate with the significant minority of Americans who want to see Christianity privileged in the public sphere," said Andrew Whitehead, a sociologist at Clemson University who researches Christian nationalism - the idea that America is a distinctly Christian nation.
Jeff Hunt, a vice president at Colorado Christian University who has attended and ushered during numerous prayer breakfasts, said religious conservatives believe there has been a growing sentiment that their freedom is subservient to other rights, such as LGBT rights.
"I think there's a real movement, at least among people of faith, who feel like the Democrats think we're criminals," Hunt said. "They think that the way we want to practice our faith, the values we take seriously, are somehow in violation of the law."
Hunt pointed to examples of when lawmakers such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), then-Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and, most recently, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) have questioned the religious beliefs of potential judicial nominees. Many conservative Christians such as Hunt were disappointed by the scrutiny Karen Pence faced when she chose to teach at a Christian school that bars LGBT students and teachers.
"There's a lot of people that go, 'Gosh. They see our religious values, our beliefs, as almost criminal, something to be ushered out of the public square.' . . . Part of the reason I think evangelicals are so attracted to the president is he stood up for the importance of religious values in the public square."
Trump has consistently enjoyed higher favorability ratings among white evangelicals, who make up about a quarter of the country, than any other religious group. A June 2018 Pew survey asked Americans whether Trump has respect for various groups, as well as "people like you." Among religious groups, 74 percent of white evangelicals say Trump has a great deal or fair amount of respect for people like them, compared with 54 percent of white mainline Protestants. Fewer than half of Catholics (44 percent) say Trump has at least a fair amount of respect for people like them; just 34 percent of those with no religious affiliation and 18 percent of black Protestants say the same.
During his first prayer breakfast speech in 2017, Trump promised to help end the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits churches from endorsing or opposing political candidates.
Although attempts to repeal the law in Congress were unsuccessful, Trump issued an executive order directing the IRS not to penalize churches and then falsely claimed at a gathering of evangelical leaders at the White House in 2018 that he had "gotten rid" of the amendment. "They really have silenced you," he said, according to the New York Times. "But now you're not silenced anymore."
During last year's prayer breakfast, Trump spoke of a collective desire to "worship without fear," a nod to religious freedom concerns, an issue that resonates with evangelicals, who have been particularly concerned about their personal freedoms and the status of Christianity in society. These concerns often emerge during Supreme Court cases, including last year's case involving a baker who declined to make cakes for same-sex weddings.
"Our rights are not given to us by men; our rights are given to us from our creator," Trump said. "No matter what, no earthly force can take those rights away."
Trump was not initially the preferred candidate among white evangelical Republicans who attend church. Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) drew the most support during the campaign. In past decades, conservative Christian groups such as Moral Majority, which was active in the 1980s, aggressively attempted to promote and elect their preferred candidates on platforms that included topics such as school prayer and opposition to same-sex marriage, said George Yancey, a sociologist at the University of North Texas who has written on anti-Christian bias. Now many of them just want a leader who will keep them safe from policies that could threaten their livelihoods, he said.
"Some are still aggressive, but now there's a defensive mentality," Yancey said. "Now I think there's a sense of, 'I just want to be left alone.' "
Under President Barack Obama, conservative evangelicals were coming to terms with their apparent failure to win the culture wars, but they also began to fear they were losing the ability to live according to their own values, said Kristin Du Mez, a historian at Calvin College, who has a forthcoming book on evangelical masculinity and militarism. During Obama's tenure, many leaders began to sound the alarm that their personal freedoms were under attack. The legalization of same-sex marriage during the Obama administration ushered in questions over when LGBT rights and religious beliefs conflict. And many conservative Christian leaders were alarmed after the administration required that institutions provide certain kinds of birth control to employees.
Conservative evangelicals are used to seeing male leaders such as Trump who promise to protect them against malevolent outside forces, according to Du Mez. Men such as radio host James Dobson, the late Jerry Falwell Sr. and former megachurch pastor Mark Driscoll "built their own religious empires by provoking a sense of danger and embattlement, and then offering fearful followers their own brand of truth and 'protection.' "
So not only have some of these same evangelical leaders such as Dobson, Falwell and Driscoll stoked fears about feminists or non-Christians, "we also have them primed to look to a strong man who embodies a God-given militant masculinity to rescue them from these dangers," Du Mez said.
Dallas-based megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress, who will attend this year's prayer breakfast, hopes Trump will talk about late-term abortion like he did in his State of the Union address on Tuesday where he shows he cares about the issues that alarm conservative Christians. Jeffress said that Americans have shifted on attitudes on sexuality, and this and other cultural changes leave conservative Christians feeling politically vulnerable. Trump, he said, gives them a sense of relief.
"I think he gave voice to what many people felt: that Christianity was being marginalized in society. I've been with him now for three years. I've heard him talk about 'Merry Christmas.' Some people think that's very superficial, but to him, saying 'Merry Christmas' is really code for not marginalizing faith in America."

Texto completo: Who said you can't teach an old restaurant new tricks?
Clancey's on McGregor Boulevard in south Fort Myers — first opened in 1977 though the building has been around since the 1940s — may be a long-established dining spot, but it has some surprising new twists.
John Browning bought Clancey's in 2015. In fall 2017 he brought in cook and general manager Richard Smith and together they've revamped the old Clancey's menu. Smith has worked in a range of kitchens locally. He has a background in fine dining, though he's most recently known for opening the old Big Dro's Chicken and Waffles, a diner-style restaurant that served Deep South comfort foods.
In early 2018, Browning and Smith unveiled their new dishes. They included an homage to Clancey's Irish pub origins — shepherd's pie, bangers and mash, fish and chips — they also showcase Smith's soul-food background with dishes such as slow-braised oxtails and shrimp and grits.
"When you go into an Irish pub nowadays," Browning said, "they're serving a variety of things, from curry to pizza. We're not doing anything different than what the pubs in Ireland and England are doing, modernizing our menu along with the tastes of our customers."
With the new additions, Browning and Smith focused their efforts on quality food made in-house.
"When I took over last February, I was adamant about having a scratch kitchen," Smith said.
"I wanted to bring in high quality products that people can really taste once they dine here. That's always been my premise — to get the best food we possibly can."
The restaurant's favorite dishes have remained unchanged and, according to Browning, 90 percent of the items that have long been on the menu continue to be served at lunchtime.
"Although if somebody really wants one of those things at dinner," he said, "we will prepare it for them."
The inside of the dining room has also been dressed up in recent months. The most notable addition? White tablecloths on the tables. Browning credits Smith and his background in fine dining with that change.
"I asked John, affectionately, to stop me if I was going too far," Smith said with a laugh.
He also switched out the red tumblers for pint glasses and suggested they start wrapping the silverware in cloth napkins.
"It gives you a sense of being in a place that pays attention to detail," Smith said.
Clancey's is also paying attention to its community. Browning recently launched a charity program that gives back to two non-profits in Lee County: Community Cooperative, the Fort Myers-based soup kitchen, and the Heights Foundation, which promotes community development in the nearby Harlem Heights neighborhood.
Customers at Clancey's can let their servers know that they are dining for either the Heights Foundation or Community Cooperative, and half of their dinner check will be donated to those charities. The customer still pays the full price of the dinner, but only 50 percent of the money goes to Clancey's. At the end of each month, Browning said he totals the amounts and writes the two charities a check.
"It's a way of trying something completely outside the box," Browning said. "Something good and generous."
People often ask him, "Which month are you doing this?" and he replies, "I was planning on this being a permanent thing."
Between the new look, the new menu and the new charity projects, Clancey's is undertaking a series of forward-looking endeavors. This old restaurant has definitely learned a few new tricks.

Fact-checking is broken: The petty, pedantic, pointless picking at Trump's State of the Union

Texto completo: html> The fact check is dead.

President Trump delivered his State of the Union address Tuesday evening. Remarkably, it contained only a small portion of the incendiary, untethered, free-wheeling rhetoric we’ve come to expect from the current White House resident.

In fact, the president was surprisingly on message — restrained even. He still got some things wrong, which isn’t that surprising. But, his speech wasn’t exactly a smorgasbord of falsehoods either.

Perhaps that’s why members of the press, in their ongoing, desperate effort to make something — anything! — stick against the president, have be-clowned themselves in such fantastic fashion with ignorant and outright petty “fact checks” of the State of the Union speech.

FACT CHECK: Jews don't believe in heaven(?)

For example, Trump introduced one guest Tuesday evening with the following remarks:

"A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau concentration camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. “To me,” Joshua recalls, “the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky. They came down from heaven.”"

Mentioning heaven while introducing a Jewish guest? Not on New York Times White House correspondent Annie Karni’s watch!

“Trump just ad-libbed ‘they came down from heaven’ when quoting a Holocaust survivor watching American soldiers liberate Dachau,” she tweeted. “Jews don't believe in heaven.”

Yes, they do. This is about as funny as the time she asked unironically, “Jews believe in the concept of Hell?”

FACT CHECK: Only 31 percent female migrants were abused, not one-third.

Politico, meanwhile, assigned a “partly true” rating to Trump’s assertion that “One in three [female migrants] is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.”

Thirty-one percent of female migrants say they have been abused while traveling through Mexico, Politico noted, citing Doctors without Borders. Yes, Politico. One-in-three is 33 percent. Trump rounded up by 2.3 percentage points. Way to keep him in check. This is almost as embarrassing as the time the Toronto Star’s Daniel Dale struggled with the meaning of “historically low.”

FACT CHECK: Democratic women don't count as women, or something...

Trump also said Tuesday that “exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time.”

Not on National Public Radio’s watch!

“FACT CHECK: President Trump praised the record number of women in Congress, but that's almost entirely because of Democrats, not Trump’s party,” the group tweeted.

This is not a fact check. It’s just added context, and petty added context, at that.

FACT CHECK: *ACTUALLY* Afghanistan isn't in the Middle East, so our troops have been in the Middle East for ONLY 17-plus years.

Trump said Tuesday that our “brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years."

The Associated Press wasn’t having any of it.

“Trump exaggerated the length of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,” the news wire complained. “The war in Afghanistan began in October 2001, in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. The invasion of Iraq was in March 2003. The U.S. has been at war for a bit more than 17 years.”

The AP report adds, “Also, he refers to fighting in the Middle East. Iraq is in the Middle East, but Afghanistan is in south and central Asia.”

The New York Times fact check similarly included an attempt to correct Trump's remarks on the forever war in Afghanistan.

“ This is false,” the Times said in a since-deleted passage in its State of the Union post-game fact check. “American troops deployed to Afghanistan on Oct. 7, 2001, to begin Operation Enduring Freedom — the American military and NATO mission to rid Afghanistan of Al Qaeda. But Afghanistan is not technically considered part of the Middle East — it is in southwest Asia. The United States invaded Iraq, which is in the Middle East, in March 2003 — nearly 16 years ago.”

FACT CHECK: Our border situation isn't an "urgent national crisis," it's merely a "humanitarian crisis."

The Times also hit Trump for describing illegal border crossings as an “urgent national crisis.”

“This is false,” the paper declared. “The number of illegal border crossings have been declining for two decades. Customs and Border Protection arrested more than 50,000 people trying to illegally cross the southwestern border each month in October, November and December.”

Laughably, the Times adds, “While that is an uptick from the monthly average in the fiscal year that ended in September 2017, the numbers pale in comparison to early 2000s, when border arrests averaged about 100,000 per month.” Then it adds, “A record number of families have tried to cross the border in recent months, overwhelming officials at the border and creating a new kind of humanitarian crisis."

Uh, great? I feel much better about the not-urgent crisis at the border.

I wrote in September that journalists’ fact checks of Trump had gotten lazier and lazier, to the point where they were no longer looking to establish facts but to impress one another with terrific “burns.” After the president’s speech Tuesday, I think media fact checking has moved beyond just lazy. I think it’s dead.

IS THE NATIONAL PRESS BEING UNFAIR TO TRUMP?; EDITOR'S COLUMN

Texto completo: Scott Klug and I share similar backgrounds we're both 1950s-born baby boomers from Midwestern manufacturing towns with master's degrees in journalism and careers in media. His was in television in Seattle and Washington, D.C., before his time as a news anchor in Madison in the 1980s.
But brother, do we part ways in assessing today's media.
He suggested we meet face-to-face so he could emphatically disagree with views in my recent column about media neutrality.
"I am an old school guy and am on the other side of this issue," he emailed, and said we should have coffee or lunch and "arm wrestle."
In a nutshell, Klug asserts that during the Trump administration, leading national newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post have strayed toward anti-Trump advocacy in their news reporting, apparently to drive digital circulation and revenue. That move, he argues, will make it impossible to maintain momentum and regain an objective footing whenever it is that Trump is gone.
A self-described center-right Republican, Klug expresses no fondness for Trump, but thinks the national media, especially these national newspapers, have erred grievously.
Beyond his journalistic cred, of course, Klug was a successful politician he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990 from the Madison-dominated 2nd District, defeating Robert Kastenmeier, a liberal Democratic icon who held the seat for 32 years.
Klug served eight years and stepped away, succeeded by now U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. He left "undefeated and unindicted," he told me, smiling.
After leaving Congress, he went into business he has an MBA from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and today is director of public affairs in the Madison office of the Foley & Lardner law firm, the same office that employs former two-term Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle.
Klug was reacting to my column about journalistic neutrality, which was based on a book by Stephen J.A. Ward, who years back had been the first director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at UW-Madison.
Ward recommended that journalists abandon the belief that pure objectivity is possible, saying that rigid neutrality is outdated in this era of rampant distortion and disinformation, mostly by Trump. Current times, he argued, require journalists to be relentless in fact-checking at every turn and verifying assertions, especially with about one-third of the public apparently believing Trump and his Fox News enablers over the mainstream media. Klug contends that the Times and Post go too far, seldom producing straightforward news stories about Trump without injecting the Russia investigation or some other criticism that is peripheral to the main topic.
Klug said he shared this analysis with a fellow member of the board of advisers at Medill, the journalism school at Northwestern, his alma mater. He said they agreed the Times had "essentially gone hook, line and sinker to be anti-Trump champions." He added, "But what happens after Trump is gone?"
He continued: "What are you left with then, especially what happens if you end up with a progressive president? There's no reason to subscribe to what you do, and so the newspapers now I think have fallen into the same trap that cable news has. You know you've got Fox on one side and MSNBC on the other, and I can't watch either of them because 95 percent of it is opinion.
"I admire the New York Times, what it's been historically, but I can barely read the paper. I think what that does in the long run is undercut any sense of objectivity, and if you undercut the objectivity, people begin to question the credibility of it, and I think especially with the Times and the Post ... it's so over the top that I just have a hard time reading it as somebody who's a journalist."
He argued that it must be a conscious business decision. "I understand what's going on because you have to drive subscriptions, but it in many ways that makes the industry even more wounded than it is because you lose the rationale for why you read the press in the first place."
But, I counter, during the 2016 presidential campaign, many thought it was Hillary Clinton who was treated unfairly, that the national press inflated and excessively covered her issue with emails to offset the attention focused on Trump's lies and the recording about how he liked to grope women.
Once again, Klug disagreed. "No, I don't really see that. I mean if that would've been (the case), then they could have adjusted by now, and it's just been incessant.
"If you read the Times and the Post on a regular basis, the middle of every story has some reference to do with Trump and something other than the story they're covering."
Klug also disputes my view that Fox News is more a fiction-producing propaganda arm of Trump's GOP than any entity on the left. "I think MSNBC is in the same boat, and has no qualms about that," he said.
He also lamented the impact of social media channels, which he says contribute to the hysteria around modern politics. He added, "I'd actually argue that the internet can be the internet, but the press really needs to be much more balanced and much more nuanced."
Klug, who at various times advised former Gov. Scott Walker, does not think this criticism applies to the state press. "While the press had fights with Scott Walker, I didn't think (the negative coverage) was disproportionate."
No, his beef is national: "I understand the business challenges, so I don't look at that lightly. I just worry for the national tone setters (about) what it does in the long run, because you now put yourself in a position where everybody can question anything you say, which feeds into the whole false-news narrative."
He added: "So I guess I'm old school that way. I understand the argument that says, 'Well, we can't be deferential to this guy,' but the office holds some kind of deference, and so I just think it's out of balance, and once that genie is out, I don't know how you roll it back."
My thought? In the face of Trump's relentless even dangerous attacks on media integrity to undercut reporting on his record, I think the Times and Post exhibit professional restraint.
With that, the arm wrestling can continue.

Joe Ingles on trade deadline: 'It’s not good for anyone'

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — All the Jazz players can do now is sit and wait.
As Utah was using a dominant fourth quarter to finish off the Suns in its 116-88 win Wednesday at Vivint Arena, the more interesting NBA action was going on away from the court.
From the time Jazz players began to warm up to the game’s final buzzer, trade after trade was completed.
Otto Porter Jr. was sent from Washington to Chicago for Bobby Portis and Jabari Parker; former Jazzman Alec Burks was sent to Sacramento as part of a three-team deal; Harrison Barnes soon became Burks’ newest teammates after the Dallas Mavericks sent him to the Sacramento Kings; and Markief Morris was sent from Washington to New Orleans for Wesley Johnson.
With the trade deadline looming, it was as if Wednesday's game between the Jazz and the Suns was simply a distraction to the drama.
Utah has been linked to Memphis point guard Mike Conley with sources saying that the deal is mostly centered around expiring contracts (likely Ricky Rubio and Derrick Favors) and a first-round draft pick. And even that might not be enough for the Grizzlies — or they could change their minds before Thursday’s 1 p.m. MT deadline. Whatever the case, the players admit that the rumors and speculation have taken a toll.
The Jazz are notoriously secretive of their trade talks, but with Memphis making it so public that Conley is available, info has slipped out. And make no mistake, the players have seen it.
“It’s difficult,” Joe Ingles said. “I think at times you probably even noticed the way we played — it’s just kind of tiring. ... It just wears down on your team because it’s constant noise. I think we do a good job, We are always going to stick together.
“I love our group,” he continued. “I love who we got. But at times, it’s wearing. It’s not awkward, but you know it’s going. You are just kind of waiting for something to either happen or not. Which sucks because we have such a great group of guys that enjoy playing together. That enjoy being in Utah.”
On Wednesday afternoon, the New York Times’ Mark Stein and ESPN’s Brian Windhorst both reported that Conley didn’t want to play in Utah — preferring a move to the Eastern Conference. Ingles may or may not have heard those reports, but it almost appeared that he had a response to them.
“They love being here, they want to be here — which I think in the past has been difficult," Ingles said. "To have 15 guys that want to be here is special. We have a tight bond. We have a special group that genuinely enjoys playing together, which I think is hard to find.”
Ingles referred to the whole situation as “S---ty," and that he hopes the Jazz have the same group together after the deadline.
“It’s not good for anyone,” he said. “Especially when you got such a tight group of guys that want to be here, that enjoy being here, that play well together. We'll see what happens.”

Texto completo: LONDON – NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced Wednesday that the military alliance will hold a leaders' summit in London in December, a gathering that following NATO protocol would be expected to include President Donald Trump.
The White House has not confirmed Trump's attendance.
It falls during NATO’s 70th anniversary year. No exact date for the meeting was given.
Stoltenberg said the leaders will "address the security challenges we face now and in the future, and to ensure that NATO continues to adapt in order to keep its population of almost one billion people safe. "
When Trump attended a NATO summit in July last year he threatened to pull the U. S. out of the organization it helped found if allies did not increase spending on defense. He also accused Germany of being "a captive of Russia" in a series of tense interactions with allies that helped underscore how Trump intends to transform U. S. foreign policy.
More: What is NATO and why is President Trump slamming it?
NATO was founded in 1949 to help bring stability, and ensure peace, in a Europe that was reeling from the aftermath of World War II. A centerpiece of NATO is Article 5, a mutual security guarantee among its 29 members that requires each member-nation to come to the aid of their allies in the event of an attack. The provision has been invoked only once: on 9/11 when the U. S. was the target of terrorist attacks.
Trump has consistently railed against NATO allies for what he alleges are their failure to live up to spending commitments which amount to 2 per cent of GDP.
The U. S. spends about 3. 5 percent of GDP on defense, the highest NATO share.
"Many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money from many years back, where they're delinquent as far as I'm concerned, because the United States has had to pay for them. So if you go back 10 or 20 years, you'll just add it all up, it's massive amounts of money is owed," he said in July ahead the summit in Brussels, NATO's headquarters.
There is some justification for Trump's claim.
At a NATO summit in 2014, the alliance's members committed to spending at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense by 2024. At the time, only three countries could claim they were doing that. Stoltenberg said that eight members met this level in 2018: the US. . , Greece, the United Kingdom, Estonia, Romania and Poland.
Earlier this year it emerged in a report in The New York Times that Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to withdraw from NATO to senior White House aides because he did not see the point of the alliance that has been viewed as a critical bedrock against Soviet and Russian aggression for decades.
A weakened NATO is one of Putin's major geopolitical goals and fears of its eastward expansion is one of the reasons often cited for Russia's seizure of Ukraine's Crimea. In response to the report, the White House said that while Trump has publicly raised complaints about NATO, he seems satisfied with the way things stand now. It also pointed to statements that he made in July in Brussels in which he said NATO was "very important. "
Trump's visits to the U. K. have sparked mass protests, with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets of London to express disapproval over his personal behavior and divisive rhetoric on immigration, climate change and other geopolitical concerns.
When he last visited Britain, protesters unveiled a giant diaper-wearing blimp depicting an orange-colored Trump as a big baby. "Trump baby" flew outside Parliament. It has also shown up at the U. S. -Mexico border and at a G-20 summit in Argentina.

Texto completo: SAN JOSÉ, Costa Rica -- A psychiatrist and antinuclear activist has accused Óscar Arias Sánchez, the Nobel laureate and former Costa Rica president, of sexually assaulting her four years ago, bringing the #MeToo movement to one of Latin America's most revered statesmen.
Mr. Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for having brokered a plan to end civil wars in Central America. He remains the most powerful figure in Costa Rica, which he led twice and where he continues to run a foundation that promotes peace and democracy.
The sexual assault allegation could deliver a serious blow to his legacy.
The accuser, Alexandra Arce von Herold, filed a criminal complaint with federal prosecutors on Monday and gave a statement under penalty of perjury asking them to charge Mr. Arias with sexual assault. She provided a copy of the 10-page complaint to The New York Times, which shows she had met with prosecutors for nearly three hours. Dr. Arce did not seek civil damages.
A nuclear disarmament activist, Dr. Arce often met with the former president, who was an important supporter of the cause. She said she was at Mr. Arias' home in late 2014 to discuss an upcoming event in Vienna when he came up behind her, touched her breasts and shoved his hands up her skirt, penetrating her with his fingers.
She left, distraught, and told a number of people what had happened, at times in tears. Among them were colleagues and her brother, who said that for weeks afterward, "it was like she had PTSD. She didn't feel safe."
In a statement emailed by his lawyer, Rodolfo Brenes, Mr. Arias said he was innocent and would defend himself in court.
"I deny categorically the accusations made against me," he said. "I have never acted in a way that disrespected the will of any woman."
Mr. Arias is also facing unrelated accusations of criminal malfeasance in connection with his 2008 decision to approve a Canadian company's gold mining project in an ecological corridor before environmental studies had been completed. The case has been through a preliminary hearing and Mr. Arias is waiting for the court to determine whether he will stand trial.
"Politics today is a conspiracy of insinuations," Mr. Arias wrote in an op-ed column last month in response to the malfeasance charge.
Thinking back to the afternoon when she said Mr. Arias had grabbed her, Dr. Arce said she regretted not having fought back. She was in shock, she said. She had first met Mr. Arias through her mother, a former legislator in his party, and had visited his house with her mother in the past.
"I just froze, and I didn't know what to do," she said in an interview. "I was so much in shock. That had never happened to me before."
Dr. Arce said the only thing that occurred to her at the time was to cry out: "You're married!"
She said she made up an excuse about having an appointment at the National Assembly and hurried out. She was in such a panic, she said, that she actually went to the National Assembly, even though she had no meeting scheduled.
There, Dr. Arce met a member of Congress she knew and told her what had just happened, she said.
That legislator's aide, who did not want his name published because he did not wish to get entangled in a scandal involving such an influential person, confirmed the account to The Times. The aide said Dr. Arce had been teary-eyed and nervous.
That same day, Dr. Arce also called her boyfriend, who lives in France, and told him.
"I immediately trusted Alex," the boyfriend, Jean Marie Collin, said in an interview. "I never had a doubt about what she told me."
Dr. Arce also said she told her brother, her father, and several other people in the nuclear disarmament movement. Her complaint says she spoke to 15 people. One of those people, with whom Dr. Arce shared the story during the meeting in Vienna, told The Times that Dr. Arce had been in tears when she spoke about it.
"She didn't go into details about what exactly happened, and we didn't ask her," Dr. Arce's brother, Manuel Arce, said in an interview.
Her father died shortly afterward and she fell into a depression. Mr. Collin said Dr. Arce often did not want to be touched, even by him.
Dr. Arce said she did not go public earlier because, before the #metoo movement led to a period of reckoning in the United States, where famous men suddenly found themselves having to answer for allegations of sexual harassment and assaults that took place even decades earlier, the notion of making such a serious allegation against someone so powerful seemed unimaginable.
She said that seeing women accuse powerful men like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby of sexual harassment and sexual assault was inspiring. But it was watching the young gymnasts testify one after the other about sexual assault by a United States Olympic team doctor, Larry Nassar, that clinched her decision to come forward, she said.
"All the other women, that did, that helped me," said Dr. Arce, who works at a state hospital in San José, Costa Rica's capital. "So I thought maybe, maybe, I can help other people too."
One year ago, she wrote Facebook and Instagram posts detailing her accusation against Dr. Arias, she said, adding that a Costa Rican journalist who saw the posts encouraged her to delete them, saying they would have negative repercussions for her. She deleted the posts.
Trying to hold powerful men accountable is even more difficult in Latin America, because of "machismo, corruption and high levels of impunity," said Teresa Ulloa Ziaurriz, a women's rights activist in Mexico.
In a region where violence against women is escalating, activists often focus on more extreme gender-based violence. It is more common to see the hashtag #NiUnaMenos -- not one less -- than #metoo.
Montserrat Sagot Rodríguez, a women's studies specialist at the University of Costa Rica, said a law against sexual harassment was approved in 1995, but there have been few cases brought against powerful people -- and only one politician was ever forced out over such a complaint.
Despite the societal challenges, a number of women have made denunciations across the region. The Mexican actress, Karla Souza, told CNN en Español last year that she had been raped by a director early in her career.
Several actresses have come forward to accuse a fellow actor in Argentina of sexual assault and harassment. In Brazil, João Teixeira de Faria, a spiritual healer known as John of God -- made famous outside the country by an appearance on Oprah Winfrey's talk show -- was accused of sexual assault by more than 200 women. He was arrested in December.
The accusation against Mr. Arias is the highest-profile one in the region to date.
Dr. Arce said she had hesitated to come forward also out of fear of alienating Mr. Arias, an important contact in the disarmament crusade.
"The cause was more important than anything else," she said.
But she finally decided that other young activists who work with Mr. Arias could be at risk.
"It's the right thing to do," she said, "even if it destroys me."

Democrat Ilhan Omar, who spread anti-Semitic conspiracy, claims she has been 'fighting against anti-semitism'

Texto completo: In a classic diversionary tactic, Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has consistently peddled anti-Semitism along with her colleague, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, is now claiming that both of them, "have been fighting against Anti-semitism" and that "any effort to deny that is a smear."


This is the height of audacity.

Omar would like people to believe that her support for policies such as boycotting Israel are rooted in mere policy disagreements with the Jewish state. But her statements go much further. Omar has written, "Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel." This represents a classic anti-Semitic trope about Jews using their power to exert a mystical and nefarious influence on world affairs.

Just last week, she said, it made her "almost chuckle" when people describe Israel, a Jewish state, as a democracy, "because I know that if...we see that in any other society we would criticize it." She continued, "We do that to Iran, to any other place that sort of upholds its religion."

This is completely preposterous on so many levels. Setting aside the argument for why Jews, after thousands of years of persecution, would be justified in establishing a state in which they are in charge of guaranteeing their own security, the comparison to Iran makes no sense. Israel has a secular democratically elected government in free and fair elections. Iran is ruled by religious leaders, who hand pick candidates and control election outcomes.

Tlaib, Omar's "sister," has has also spent the last several months elevating anti-Semitic arguments. The Michigan Democrat, at a swearing in party, was photographed with a Palestinian activist who praised the terrorist group Hezbollah, said Israel did not have the right to exist, and has called for Israeli "Zionist terrorist" Jews to return to Poland, where roughly three million Jews were killed during the Holocaust.

Tlaib defended Marc Lamont Hill after CNN fired him for comments in which he called for the elimination of Israel and endorsed violent "resistance" against Jews. She also unleashed an anti-Semitic dual loyalty smear targeting those pushing anti-BDS legislation.

Omar's tweet is clearly not trying to convince any of her or Tlaib's doubters, but it serves two purposes.

The first is that by trying to portray all legitimate criticism of their bigoted statements as a "smear," she is playing the victim card to friendly outlets, leading to absurd headlines like this one from the New York Times: "From Celebrated to Vilified, House’s Muslim Women Absorb Blows Over Israel."

The second is to shame all liberals into embracing her hostile view toward Israel, "Our domestic policy values need to be aligned with our foreign policy values. No exceptions!" It's the kind of argument advanced by Linda Sarsour, one of the anti-Semitic founders of the Women's March, who argued that somebody cannot be a feminist and also a Zionist. This essentially boils down to, if you have liberal policy views, you can't make a special carve out to support Israel -- you have to be steadfast in opposition. Tlaib and Omar are fighting a battle for the younger generation of liberals in hopes of turning the Democratic Party away from support for Israel.

Relaxed abortion rules portend the dehumanization of us all

Texto completo: C.S. Lewis was only partly right when he wrote: The greatest evil ... is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice.
Lewis, perhaps, couldn’t have envisioned the day when a law allowing abortion up to the moment of birth would receive a standing ovation, as occurred last month with New York’s passage of the absurdly named "Reproductive Health Act."
Upon signing the bill, which also permits some health care professionals who are not doctors to perform the abortions, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered that One World Trade Center be illuminated in pink, hijacking the color associated with saving breast-cancer victims — and the birth of a baby girl.
What a weird, wicked world we live in.
Last Monday in Virginia, Del. Kathy Tran testified on behalf of a bill that would have simplified the process for having a late-term abortion. Currently, Virginia law requires three doctors’ approval for such a procedure. The bill, which was subsequently tabled, would’ve required only one’s.
This was hardly the stuff of "infanticide," a word that began tumbling from the lips of certain critics, but Gov. Ralph Northam wasn’t helpful. Two days before his yearbook scandal broke, he talked during a radio interview about making distressed newborns "comfortable" while the family decides whether to resuscitate.
Just maybe we’re not very good at talking about the unspeakable.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont and other blue states are busy hammering out their own legal concoctions, likely concerned that Roe v. Wade will be overturned by the now-predominantly conservative Supreme Court. I leave others to argue the validity of those concerns, but my sources in the pro-life movement, including several legal scholars, think upending the decision is unlikely given that, in 1992, the court not only reinforced Roe but actually made the ruling stronger.
Regardless, the pro-choice movement has been preparing for such a frontal assault on the few abortion restrictions left to states. In 1973, when Roe was issued, a baby’s viability was set at 24-28 weeks. Today, thanks to technology and our finer understanding of human development, viability occurs around 22 weeks.
In New York City, where about two in five pregnancies are terminated, there will no longer be any presumption of humanity for the baby at any stage of pregnancy, which goes far beyond abortion jurisprudence. Most Americans are fully against such extreme approaches to abortion. One survey puts the share who support abortion during the third trimester at just 13 percent.
Like many if not most Americans, I have been reasonably at ease with President Clinton’s 1996 call for making abortion "safe, legal and rare," but had hoped we’d seriously pursue that goal through better information and limit abortion to the first trimester. But the pro-choice side has resisted many attempts to educate. Activists have opposed laws requiring that pregnant women have the option of viewing a sonogram before their abortion. They’ve also thwarted attempts to make adoption resources available at abortion clinics.
What are they afraid of? That someone may change her mind?
While there are only four doctors in the U.S. that perform third-trimester abortions and, obviously, "no one gets an abortion on the delivery table," as New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg put it, the codification of late-term abortion should be discomfiting.
It is obvious, meanwhile, that these pro-abortion legislators’ new efforts are aimed at undoing, one by one, the state-level "victories" of their pro-life counterparts — even, apparently, if it means putting women’s lives at greater risk by allowing non-doctors to perform abortions.
But more concerning than a possible increase in late-term abortions (now at fewer than 2 percent of all pregnancy terminations) is the clinical way we’ve come to view and discuss human life. When we use language to disguise reality — whether the developing human baby is a "clump of cells," a "fetus," or, even, a "product of termination" — we move ever-closer to the dehumanization of us all.

Texto completo: Republicans question report critical of Trump hotel lease
WASHINGTON -- Leading congressional Republicans demanded Monday that an internal government watchdog who had issued a critical report related to President Donald Trump's luxury hotel in Washington produce reams of documents to support her conclusions.
The letter, to the General Services Administration's inspector general, was a clear signal that Trump's allies in Congress plan to aggressively defend his business dealings as his company comes under increasing scrutiny by House Democrats and others.
The letter was penned by Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee.
It centered on a Jan. 16 report by inspector general Carol Ochoa criticizing the government's decision-making that allowed Trump to keep the lease on the Trump International Hotel downtown, which is in a building owned by the GSA.
The report charged that the GSA "ignored" concerns that Trump's lease of a government-owned building might violate the Constitution's emoluments clause, which bars presidents from taking payments from foreign governments or individual U.S. states.
Johnson and Jordan suggested that Ochoa's office may have overstepped its bounds by studying whether the government had ignored the Constitution in reviewing Trump's lease.
They also questioned why Ochoa's office failed to cite Justice Department arguments on the matter.

Iraqi president hits back at Trump over U.S. army presence
BAGHDAD -- Iraq's president hit back at Donald Trump on Monday for saying U.S. troops should stay in Iraq to keep an eye on neighboring Iran, saying the U.S. leader did not ask for Iraq's permission to do so.
"We find these comments strange," said Barham Salih, speaking at a forum in Baghdad.
Trump has angered Iraqi politicians and Iranian-backed factions by arguing he would keep U.S. troops in Iraq and use it as a base to strike Islamic State group targets inside Syria as needed.
In an interview with CBS News' "Face the Nation," he said U.S. troops in Iraq were also needed to monitor Iran.
"He didn't ask Iraq about this," Salih said Monday. He said the Iraqi Constitution forbids the use of Iraq as a base to threaten the interests or security of neighboring countries.

Afghan government frozen out of peace talks with the Taliban
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Taliban representatives and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's political rivals plan to discuss the future of Afghanistan on Tuesday in Moscow, a move seen by some as a further blow to the authority of the country's current administration.
The two-day meeting brings key Afghan power brokers together with the insurgents to discuss ending the war that began in late 2001.
The Moscow talks follow a series of direct negotiations between Taliban members and U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad amid a renewed push by President Donald Trump to withdraw troops from Afghanistan.
Ghani's government was excluded from all of those meetings because of the Taliban's objection to an administration it regards as a U.S. puppet.

U.S. calls for repatriation of foreign fighters held in Syria
BEIRUT -- The United States on Monday called on other nations to repatriate and prosecute their citizens who traveled to Syria to fight with the Islamic State group and who are now being held by Washington's partners in the region.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces say they have detained more than 900 foreign fighters during their U.S.-backed campaign against the Islamic State group in northeastern Syria, where they are currently battling the extremists.
The question of what to do with the detained foreigners has grown increasingly thorny since President Donald Trump's surprise announcement in December that he intends to withdraw all American forces from the country.
Very few countries have expressed readiness to repatriate their citizens.

Prosecutors subpoena Trump inaugural papers
NEW YORK -- Federal prosecutors in New York have issued a subpoena seeking documents from Donald Trump's inaugural committee.
A spokeswoman says the committee intends to cooperate with the inquiry and was reviewing it.
The Wall Street Journal reported last year that federal prosecutors are investigating whether inaugural committee donors made contributions in exchange for political favors.
The newspaper said the inquiry also was focused on whether the inauguration misspent money it raised to stage inaugural events.
The New York Times reported recently that federal prosecutors are examining whether anyone from Qatar, Saudi Arabia or other Middle Eastern countries made illegal payments to the committee and a pro-Trump super political action committee.

Judge: Victims of shooting at church can sue gun retailer
SAN ANTONIO -- A judge has ruled that victims of a mass shooting at a Texas church can move forward with a lawsuit against a sporting goods chain where the gunman bought the weapon and ammunition used in the massacre.
The decision Monday by state District Judge Karen Pozza clears the way for families of the 2017 Sutherland Springs shooting to potentially bring their case against Academy Sport & Outdoors before a jury.
The retailer is where gunman Devin Kelley bought an assault-style rifle used in the church shooting that killed more than two dozen people.
Some families have also separately sued the U.S. Air Force over failing to report Kelley's past crimes to a federal database. Kelley was an Air Force veteran who was discharged in 2014 for bad conduct.
Nomination: President Donald Trump says he's nominating a Washington veteran with lobbying ties to U.S. energy companies to lead the Interior Department.
David Bernhardt, currently Interior's acting head, would replace Ryan Zinke -- who resigned in December -- if the Senate approves his nomination.
Manfort sentencing: Paul Manafort has a new sentencing date. A federal judge Monday set a March 13 sentencing for the former Trump campaign chairman on two felony charges stemming from witness tampering and crimes related to his Ukrainian work. Manafort faces up to five years in prison on each charge.

Resumen: Former President Barack Obama, speaking to a conference of mayors, has given himself credit for the surge in America's economy and strong employment we are seeing under President Trump. Sanders promoted emotionally appealing but unworkable "democratic socialism" to multitudes of young voters who apparently, along with newly-minted political pop star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have soaked it up like giddy, uncomprehending schoolchildren. While many who are sick of "political correctness" (properly defined, an Intimidation of free speech) find Trump's in-your-face style appealing, there are others who recognize the positive potential in his agenda and are very concerned he is squandering a real opportunity to actually solve at least some of the economic and social problems created by progressives over the past century.

Texto completo: Former President Barack Obama, speaking to a conference of mayors, has given himself credit for the surge in America's economy and strong employment we are seeing under President Trump. He congratulated himself with, "Thanks, Obama," which reminds us that Donald Trump isn't the only one with a penchant for stretching the truth or the first narcissist to occupy the White House.
Sorry, President Obama, but you didn't build that.
Mr. Obama can, however, take credit as a pioneer in the astute use of social media in political campaigning. Even though he was an articulate and appealing candidate, he owes much of his political success, first in his 2008 Democratic primary against Hillary Clinton and then beating Republican John McCain for the presidency, to outmaneuvering those opponents using the internet. He's credited with being one of the first politicians - and certainly the first to rise to the presidency - using social media to connect with American voters.
Mr. Obama's success led to - actually, required - copycatting by his Democratic political rivals and Republican opponents. In 2016, The New York Times dubbed Bernie Sanders "a king of social media," as millions were encouraged to "feel the Bern."
But no one holds a candle to President Trump in this regard.
It's been said that if Sanders was the king of social media, then Trump was, and is, its god.
Sanders promoted emotionally appealing but unworkable "democratic socialism" to multitudes of young voters who apparently, along with newly-minted political pop star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have soaked it up like giddy, uncomprehending schoolchildren.
Donald Trump, however, is the consummate Twitter troll, interspersing reasonable comments with tall tales, ad hominem
Attacks and provocative demagoguery. While many who are sick of "political correctness" (properly defined, an
Intimidation of free speech) find Trump's in-your-face style appealing, there are others who recognize the positive potential in his agenda and are very concerned he is squandering a real opportunity to actually solve at least some of the economic and social problems created by progressives over the past century.
This superficiality, sadly and ominously, continues to be the state of affairs in political discourse. Some voters apparently are so thinly engaged as to be swayed by emotional images and clever sound bites, never considering or looking into the substance of the issues before them.
In some ways, the increasing influence of social media isn't a lot different from the technological innovations of radio and then television in the past century. FDR used radio to skillfully broadcast benevolent messages directly into people's homes through his "fireside chats." The televised Kennedy-Nixon debates were seen as a major factor in the election of JFK in 1960, when TV images contrasted a young, handsome Kennedy with a clearly nervous and perspiring Nixon.
Prior to the internet, established media outlets (radio, television and print media) were the exclusive gatekeepers in determining what was news, how it was presented and what ideas or images were to be conveyed. Perhaps it's good that, given the decline in journalistic ethics - where "news" gets reported before it is verified and correspondents' biases find their way into news reporting - social media has diminished this media monopoly.
But social media simply feeds modern society's superficiality at a time when a deeper national debate is desperately needed. Instead of promoting a diversity of perspectives, social media algorithms tend to funnel news that reinforces what people already believe.
The future of America should not be left to the characters in a post or tweet.

One Way to Make College Meaningful

Texto completo: The phrase "vocational education" might conjure up an image of trade schools that train students to work in traditionally blue-collar jobs. There is a growing movement, however, found largely among private and religiously affiliated colleges and universities, to focus on vocation as it evolves from the Christian tradition, in the sense of a "calling."
What is interesting about this movement, at a time when higher education finds itself in crisis, is that the schools that are part of it are flourishing. This is despite the fact that most of them are not well-known institutions that can trade on their brand names -- "I had never heard of half these schools!" one administrator said of an early meeting of a group that is now called NetVUE, the Network for Vocation in Undergraduate Education.
What is even more interesting is that many of these schools are in the sector Moody's Investors Service has recently identified as increasingly at risk of closure, insofar as they are both small and private. It's the sector that contains Green Mountain College in Vermont, which recently announced it would close; Hampshire College in Massachusetts, whose financial woes were just featured in The Times; and Sweet Briar in Virginia, which made headlines as it narrowly avoided closing in 2015. But nearly 70 percent of schools that participated in the Program for the Theological Exploration of Vocation, a major initiative that ran from 2000 to 2009, saw their graduation rates increase, a significantly higher rate of growth than occurred in a random sample of peer institutions.
What exactly does it mean to explore "vocation" this way? In 2005, the Engineers Without Borders chapter at Hope College, a Christian liberal arts college in Holland, Mich., embarked on a project to bring water filtration systems to the community of Nkuv in Cameroon. The trip also included one student, Samantha Webbert, who was making a documentary film with her communication studies professor, Dr. Ji Hoon Park.
The Cameroon trips were brought into being in collaboration with Hope's project for the exploration of vocation, a campuswide effort to have students consider the meaning and purpose of their lives to a degree unusual even at this actively Christian institution.
According to the students' faculty adviser, Jeff Brown, when the film, sardonically titled "When the West Brings Civilization Back to Africa," appeared in 2008, "we had a group of students come over to my house and watch it, and it was difficult." Scenes showed students dismissing the villagers' anger that under the planned project only some of them would get access to clean water and seeming, as Ms. Webbert says in a voice-over, to "expect the locals to shut up, provide the support we need and be grateful for whatever we give them." The Michigan community watched them do so in local screenings and on the regional PBS affiliate.
Rather than reacting resentfully, however, Hope began to incorporate the film into its teaching about vocation -- and it is this kind of self-critical engagement that is crucial to the vocation movement. Engineers Without Borders used the documentary as a teaching tool, showing it to future groups of students traveling to Cameroon. (They also decided to continue their work until the whole community could have easy access to clean water.)
Professor Brown and others, including me, continue to use this film as a classroom tool. There's an uncomfortable moment when one student argues that the group had already "maximized our cost-benefit ratio" on "this continent," and should therefore leave Nkuv with the project only partly finished. But using the film, we can talk about whether a cost-benefit analysis is really the right ethical framework through which to examine the commitment the group had made to the Nkuv community.
Thinking about vocation often requires parts of a college that do not usually work together to think cohesively. Professors might spend time in discussion with the careers office, or the office of community service, in order to plan projects that extend beyond the classroom. At Grand View University in Iowa, such thinking has meant a class in which students use digital tools to create maps of common refugee routes, while they also undertake a service project with refugees in their community who have traveled these routes in order to arrive in Des Moines. At Wake Forest University, it has involved the creation of an Office of Personal and Career Development that is so thoroughly entwined with the curriculum that you can even take courses for credit in career exploration.
At Huntingdon College, where I teach, it involves, among other things, a class in which every student at the college relates philosophy and theology to the day-to-day business of their own lives -- their internships, their families and their plans for after graduation. One of my students had done internships in ministry and in physical therapy; he felt fulfilled by physical therapy, but worried that he ought to go into church work, which he enjoyed less, because working in a church would presumably be the more ethical option. At the end of the class he wrote a paper arguing that our reading of the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer and other ethicists had shown him that, properly understood, physical therapy could indeed be an ethical calling.
Why vocation, though, rather than the old model of learning for learning's sake? Why not, as the religious studies professor Ron Srigley has recently argued, return to the old, "beautiful goal" of the university, "to discover and then to tell the truth," disentangled from the mercenary arms of the offices of careers and student life? My answer would be that universities have always been hybrid creatures, serving many masters at once: social norms, the market, churches and the exacting standards of disciplinary research, to name four. But the fantasy of the university as a disinterested sphere of pure knowledge is just that. This is not so much to attack the liberal arts as it is to point out that to link them purposefully with life and career goals is not at all to alter the way they have long functioned.
Another criticism might be that talk of vocation blinds students to inequality. Aren't all these questions about purpose, as another student asked me, just first-world problems? Well, yes and no. Some popular strains of Christianity don't focus much on structural inequity. When I worried to other higher-ed vocation types online about this, some chided me for underestimating the capacity of the oppressed to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. God wouldn't put anything in your way that would prevent you from completing his plan for you, after all. Vocation talk can quickly morph into happy talk.
But scholars are also working hard on research and teaching that imagines vocation in a way that takes into account prejudice and inequity. My students read C.S. Lewis, but also Dorothy Day and Malcolm X. A 2018 NetVUE conference, focused on mentoring students of color, explicitly sought to contextualize the personal concept of vocation within the political structures of race and religion. Recent essays by scholars including the theologian William Cavanaugh, who describes himself as working on "the Church's encounter with social, political, and economic realities," squarely situate the issue of vocation in the long history of capitalism and exploitation. As an educational framework, vocation might focus on an individual's desires and choices, but it need not do so in a way that is blind to social ideologies and structural inequality.
In addition to lifting graduation rates, then, vocation programming can be more intellectually capacious than it might at first seem. Institutions of higher education will of course take many routes through the coming shake-up. Vocation will not be the only one that returns students to the question of what they should do with their lives. But it does offer a model of higher education that is already showing signs of success, which is not nothing.

Texto completo: When the abolitionist John Brown was hanged on Dec. 2, 1859, for murder and treason, a note found in his pocket read, "The ax is laid at the foot of the tree. When the first blow is struck, there will be more money to help." Officials most likely believed it was written by a wealthy Northerner who had helped fund Brown's attempt to incite, and arm, an enormous slave uprising by taking over an arsenal at Harpers Ferry in Virginia. No one suspected that the note was written by a black woman named Mary Ellen Pleasant.
In 1901, an elderly Pleasant dictated her autobiography to the journalist Sam Davis. As Lynn Hudson writes in the book "The Making of 'Mammy Pleasant': A Black Entrepreneur in Nineteenth-Century San Francisco," Pleasant told Davis, "Before I pass away, I wish to clear the identity of the party who furnished John Brown with most of his money to start the fight at Harpers Ferry and who signed the letter found on him when he was arrested." The sum she donated was $30,000 -- almost $900,000 in today's dollars.
As Hudson writes, the claim about Pleasant's role in the raid of Harpers Ferry, though widely repeated, is shrouded in "more mystery than evidence." This is not surprising. Pleasant lived her life between the lines of legitimacy and infamy, servitude and self-invention. She became known throughout San Francisco as Mammy Pleasant, because of the years she spent as a domestic servant. Yet she was also, incredibly, a former slave who became a millionaire. Add to that improbable pairing, a dedicated abolitionist, credited with being an important conductor of the Underground Railroad.
Comparing her to Harriet Tubman, W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in his 1924 book "The Gift of Black Folk" that Pleasant was "quite a different kind of woman and yet strangely effective and influential." He added: "Here was a colored woman who became one of the shrewdest business minds of the State. She anticipated the development in oil. She was the trusted confidante of many of the California pioneers such as Ralston, Mills and Booth, and for years was a power in San Francisco affairs." He said:"Throughout a life that was perhaps more than unconventional, she treasured a bitter hatred for slavery and a certain contempt for white people."
Mary Ellen Pleasant was born around 1814, some say on a Georgia plantation. In her autobiography, however, she stated that her mother was a "full-blooded Negress from Louisiana" and her father was Hawaiian, and she insisted she had been born in Philadelphia.
She was sent to Nantucket, Mass., at a young age to live with a family as a domestic servant. She learned quickly that the invisibility of service was something she could turn to her advantage. Burning with ambition, she saw servant work as temporary. She turned life in a wealthy New England home into a kind of finishing school. "I often wonder what I would have been with an education," Pleasant said in her autobiography. "I have let books alone and studied men and women a good deal. ... I have always noticed that when I have something to say, people listen. They never go to sleep on me."
Pleasant married twice. Her first husband, James Henry Smith, was either white or of mixed ancestry; historians aren't sure. He died sometime in the 1840s, leaving his young wife a considerable inheritance. Her second marriage was to a black man named John Pleasant, whom her biographers believed she met in New Bedford, Mass., a destination on the Underground Railroad.
In 1848, the California Gold Rush began and word soon spread that even blacks were free to seek their fortune on the West Coast. Pleasant heeded the call. She moved to San Francisco and found work as a cook, invisible and unimportant once again. She shrewdly eavesdropped on the wealthy people she served, and using the information, invested bits of her inheritance. "It's quite possible that the jobs she had as a domestic were a cover that she was using because she clearly made her money from investments," Hudson, the biographer, said in an interview.
Her portfolio grew to include shares in businesses that ranged from dairies and laundries to Wells Fargo Bank. She owned restaurants and boardinghouses, which locals whispered were actually brothels. In the 1890 census, she stated that she was a "capitalist" by profession.
"One of the reasons that she's not known to students of U.S. history and Americans is because a lot of the activities that she was involved in were either controversial or secret," Hudson said. "Her legacy is not the pure, selfless freedom fighter or heroine as how Harriet Tubman is described. Pleasant does not fit that mold."
The rest of Pleasant's life was a zigzag of fortune and power, infamy and blame. She formed a decades-long business partnership, possibly romantic, with a white man named Thomas Bell. After his death, it turned out that much of Pleasant's portfolio, including the mansion she designed and had built, were held in Bell's name. Historians believe that the pair used his name in many of the business dealings to facilitate what surely would have been more difficult for a woman, and especially for a black woman. Bell's widow sued Pleasant and won control of the Bell estate. In an instant, Pleasant's fortune was diminished.
She died in 1904. By the end of her life, she had become a famous figure in San Francisco. The local newspapers referred to her as Mammy Pleasant -- a name she abhorred. She told The San Francisco Call: "I don't like to be called mammy by everybody. Put that down. I am not mammy to everybody in California. I got a letter from a minister in Sacramento. It was addressed to Mammy Pleasant. I wrote back to him on his own paper that my name was Mrs. Mary E. Pleasant. I wouldn't waste any of my paper on him."
In San Francisco, there is a Mary Ellen Pleasant Day, and a Mary Ellen Pleasant Park where she is praised as the Mother of Civil Rights in California. She was the inspiration for Michelle Cliff's novel "Free Enterprise," and tours of the city often refer to the corner of Octavia and Bush Streets, where her mansion once stood.
Sixty years after her death, her gravestone was amended with a line that she had asked for on her deathbed: "A Friend of John Brown." As Pleasant herself once put it, "I'd rather be a corpse than a coward."

Texto completo: As someone who came of age in the midst of the Web's newborn modem squeals and all-nighter JPEG downloads, I'm also someone who grew up around bots.
From the early AOL chatbot distractions of SmarterChild (as for many others, my first AI buddy) to Siri and Alexa, I've had automaton friends for decades now, insofar as they appear on my friends list. 
I've written in the past about the approaching army of service-oriented bots that have since penetrated social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, as well as most major chat apps and customer service portals. And I did so with an anticipatory cheeriness that predated the revelations concerning the other army of bots that had already stormed various provinces of social media with far less helpful intentions.
Now, the term “bot" rings pejorative, and conjures up associations of large-scale operations of deception and fraud.  And our strained interactions with the “good" ones who can't even correctly take down my pizza toppings (“ANN! CHO! VEE!") do not help the frayed state of bot-human relations. 
Well, not to be that guy, but I'm here to say #notallbots deserve these attacks.
Right alongside the bots who manipulated us all into fights with each other like some shady Real Housewife and undid democracy in the process, there were some that stuck to their simple program of bringing delight to users. 
Some of my favorite bots on Twitter, for instance, manage to post better content than the living, breathing, quipping tweeters I follow just by executing simple processes. New New York Times (@NYT_first_said), for example, posts every time The New York Times prints a word it has never used before (this week we had “quizmaker," “unspherical," and “pillorizing") and offers a fascinating view of language as it graduates (or sneaks) past copy desks and into the discourse.
Equally helpful, the context-bot account @NYT_said_where replies to each post with a link to the article in which the new word appears; or, if you'd prefer new words that aren't actually real, there's the daily feed of computer-generated balderdash known as @fantasticvocab.
I also turn to bots for my literary fix on Twitter. An Allen Ginsberg bot I follow virtually recites “Howl" line by line as an endless procession of tweets that intersperse themselves between the grim headlines they still critique from decades of distance. I consume guppy-size bites of Melville and Joyce through @MobyDickatSea and @finnegansreader, respectively, and otherwise break up the inartful noise of my feed with bot-driven bits of Dickinson and Sappho.
But I also like the accidental and experimental sources of literature on Twitter, like the Pentametron — which hunts down any instances of iambic pentameter in the wild and posts them as couplets (hence finding a kind of underlying beauty beneath the muddy currents of Twitter discourse). Or @JustToSay, which uses generated text to remix William Carlos Williams's famous treatise on plum theft into new forms.
Or the MIT-spawned collaborative AI horror-bot Shelley, which slashes out a new horror story every hour (and will even write one with you). Or (if you can't find your copy of Italo Calvino's “Invisible Cities") the @BrandNewPlanet bot, which voyages deep into its artificial imagination with visions of new worlds every day.
Other of Twitter's best bots are just born entertainers. Like @I_Luv_Recipes, a bot programmed to emulate “like every recipe commenter ever" by posting various recipes and making random and often horrible substitutions (e.g. “Amaretto Olive Oil Cake: I replaced the almonds with herring eggs. Hubby loved it!").
(While it was put down permanently in 2017, I'd be remiss not to mention the old gray mare of automated absurdist generative text-spam poetry, @horse_ebooks, which still makes for better reading than 95 percent of Twitter.)
And still other bots prove the most useful for simply changing the fundamental functions of Twitter by tweaking the tone. It's hard to get in an argument with @grow_slow, which daily charts the growth of a fiddle-leaf fig in the corner of a room.
And with its gentle daily reminders to make yourself a happier, healthier person (“please remember to breathe," “listen to a song you enjoy please," “please take a sip of water") @tinycarebot is an automated confidant that's grown essential to me amid the roiling toxic wasteland of Twitter. Now someone just needs to teach it to order pizza.

Widening the Lens on Black History

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Lots of questions come to mind when studying a 1977 image of the runner Miki Gorman powering through the streets of New York City.
What was she thinking about, with that determined look, her lips slightly pursed and her eyes almost closed in meditation?
Could she have imagined that her marathon win that day would be a title no other American woman would take until after her death in 2015?
Also, why didn't she get an obituary in The New York Times?
Gorman isn't the only woman whose life -- and death -- I have contemplated in the one year that I have been the editor of Overlooked, a history project that tells the stories of remarkable women who were left out of The Times's obits pages.
In the past year I have published obits for more than 50 women, many of whose contributions have influenced my own life.
I'm thankful, for instance, that Mary Outerbridge helped introduce tennis to America and I can watch my favorite players at the United States Open. When I go for a run over the Brooklyn Bridge, I think about how it would not even be there if Emily Roebling hadn't finished it when her husband, the chief engineer, became ill.
As a journalist, I'm grateful that in investigating lynchings of black men, Ida B. Wells pioneered reporting techniques that remain central tenets of modern journalism.
I'm inspired by people like the singer Sissieretta Jones and the sculptor Edmonia Lewis, who challenged racial stereotypes and fought for their opportunities to take center stage.
And every morning in my kitchen when I'm making a cup of joe, I'm grateful that Melitta Bentz invented the paper coffee filter so I don't get grounds in my teeth.
There is no shortage of fascinating people to write about, only limited time and space.
Fortunately, Overlooked is continuing in 2019, and in the year ahead, I plan to widen its lens, starting with a special issue online now and in print this Sunday. In it you'll find obits for a dozen prominent black men and women whose deaths were not noted by The Times.
You'll read about Scott Joplin, the pianist and ragtime master who wrote "The Entertainer"; Gladys Bentley, the gender-bending blues singer who became 1920s Harlem royalty; Elizabeth Jennings, who stood up for civil rights when she sat down on a whites-only streetcar; and Major Taylor, the first black man to win a world championship in cycling.
Many of them were a generation removed from slavery. To carve a name for themselves, they sometimes had to make myth out of a painful history, misrepresenting their past to gain a better footing in their future. They were ambitious and creative, becoming painters and composers, filmmakers and actors. Others used their imaginations to invent and innovate. Often they felt an unspoken greater mission to break the constraints society placed on their race.
Some managed to achieve success in their lifetimes, only to die penniless, buried in paupers' graves. Almost all of them reached deep within themselves to push back against harsh circumstances, the likes of which are unimaginable for many of us today.
This special issue was created in partnership with Past Tense, a new team at The Times that is delving into our archives to bring to life compelling stories from our past.
Overlooked has been driven by our readers; thousands of you have suggested who we should write about, and your ideas have yielded some of the most-read obituaries, including one on the resilient Emma Gatewood, who survived 30 years of domestic abuse to discover hiking, at age 67. She became the first person to hike the Appalachian Trail in its entirety three times.
Another reader suggested we write about Bessie Blount Griffin, a nurse and inventor who patented an early version of the feeding tube to help World War II amputees become self-sufficient. Her obit is among many more that will be published in the months to come.
I hope you'll continue reading the series, and telling us who else we've missed.
Follow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.

Texto completo: Meg Medina won this year's John Newbery Medal for the most outstanding contribution to children's literature for her novel "Merci Suarez Changes Gears," the story of an 11-year-old girl who navigates her home life with a Cuban-American extended family and her experiences as a scholarship student at a private school. Medina is the second Latinx writer to win the award -- Matt de la Pena won in 2016 for the picture book "Last Stop on Market Street," illustrated by Christian Robinson -- and the first to win for a novel.
Sophie Blackall won the Randolph Caldecott Medal, which is awarded to an illustrator for the year's most distinguished American picture book, for "Hello, Lighthouse," a chronicle of working and living in a remote lighthouse that pays tribute to the difficult job lighthouse keepers performed for centuries. Blackall, who also won the award in 2016 for "Finding Winnie: The True Story of the World's Most Famous Bear," becomes the ninth illustrator to win the award multiple times since it was first given in 1938.
The Newbery and the Caldecott awards are the most anticipated of the annual prizes given out by the American Library Association for young adult and children's literature. They were announced Monday at the association's midwinter conference in Seattle. Considered among the most prestigious prizes given for children's literature, the awards are known to drive sales and spur librarian and teacher recommendations.
Two Newbery Honor Books were also named: "The Night Diary," by Veera Hiranandani, and "The Book of Boy," by Catherine Gilbert Murdock. Caldecott Honors went to "Alma and How She Got Her Name," by Juana Martinez-Neal; "A Big Mooncake for Little Star," by Grace Lin; "The Rough Patch," by Brian Lies; and "Thank You, Omu!" by Oge Mora.
"The Poet X," written by Elizabeth Acevedo, took the Michael L. Printz Award for excellence in literature written for young adults. The novel in verse, about a Dominican-American girl living in Harlem who finds her voice through slam poetry, was also the winner of the 2018 National Book Award for Young People's Literature.
At Monday's awards, "The Poet X" also won the Pura Belpre Author Award honoring a Latinx writer whose children's books best portray, affirm and celebrate the Latinx cultural experience. The Pura Belpre Illustrator Award went to Yuyi Morales for "Dreamers," her picture book recounting the journey she took with her young son as an immigant from Mexico.
The Coretta Scott King Book Awards, recognizing outstanding African-American authors and illustrators, went to the author Claire Hatfield for "A Few Red Drops: The Chicago Race Riot of 1919," and the illustrator Ekua Holmes for "The Stuff of Stars," written by Marion Dane Bauer.
The Theodor Seuss Geisel Award for the most distinguished beginning reader book went to "Fox the Tiger," written and illustrated by Corey R. Tabor.
The young adult author Walter Dean Myers, who died in 2014, was honored with the Children's Literature Legacy Award, given to an author or illustrator whose books have made a significant and lasting contribution to children's literature. Previously called the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, the prize was renamed last June in recognition of the racial insensitivity in Wilder's work.
This year marked the first time the winners of the Sydney Taylor Award, given since 1968 to outstanding books for children and teens that authentically portray the Jewish experience, were announced at the meeting, with Emily Jenkins's and Paul O. Zelinsky's "All-of-a-Kind Family Hanukkah," Jonathan Auxier's "Sweep" and Vesper Stamper's "What the Night Sings" receiving the award. For the first time, as well, the winners of the Asian/Pacific American Awards for Literature, begun in 2001, were announced at the meeting, with the picture book "Drawn Together," written by Minh Le and illustrated by Dan Santat, and the novels "Front Desk" by Kelly Yang and "Darius the Great Is Not Okay" being honored. The organization announced that beginning in 2020, the meeting will also feature the announcement of an award honoring the "very best writing and illustrations by and about American Indians" given out in even-numbered years.

Trump pushes for US companies to be used for federal infrastructure projects

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order Thursday that will push for federal dollars spent on infrastructure projects to be put toward US companies and bolster workers who his top trade adviser described as “blue-collar Trump people" the administration has focused on helping.
That description, given to reporters by Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, was a glimpse at how the administration has sought to carry out the president's “America First" policy.
The executive order is meant to be an economic shot-in-the-arm for workers held up as symbols of the president's tough-on-trade stance, even as some have faced shaky economic prospects over the administration's decisions to impose high tariffs on imported goods and to start several global disputes, including a damaging trade war with China.
Navarro later changed his comment about the administration's policies benefiting “Trump people."
He said “every American is a Trump person" but added that the bulk of manufacturing jobs go to people without college degrees and “exactly the type of people that the Trump administration has so much focus on: American men and women who work with their hands."
Trump said the reasoning behind the order was that “we don't get treated great by many countries in terms of our trade deals." The president added he wanted infrastructure projects to be built with “American steel," “American iron," and “American hands."
The executive order, “Strengthening Buy-American Preferences for Infrastructure Projects," will recommend but not outright require that what the administration said was $700 billion in federal financial assistance doled out by some 30 agencies each year go toward US-manufactured products. The order will also seek to tamp down on waivers that agencies have used to bypass US products in favor of foreign-made ones.
The order is a continuation of the “Buy American" strategy Trump unveiled within his first few months in office. In April 2017, the president signed an executive order that would favor US companies for federal contracts and reform the H-1B visa program for foreign technical workers, a move that led Democrats to say the administration would curb the hiring of qualified foreign workers.

Sanders wants to lower estate tax threshold
Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a potential Democratic presidential candidate known for far-left stances on issues of economic inequality, introduced legislation on Thursday that would increase the number of wealthy Americans subject to the estate tax.
With the bill, Sanders joins a growing chorus of liberal politicians calling for new ways to tax the rich. Last week, Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who has announced her 2020 candidacy, introduced a plan for a so-called ultramillionaire tax on households with a net worth of $50 million or more. And Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York recently proposed a 70 percent top rate on income over $10 million a year, intensifying the conversation within the Democratic Party about tax policies aimed at addressing income inequality.
In his plan, Sanders proposed applying an estate tax when someone leaves assets worth more than $3.5 million to his or her heirs, the same level as in 2009. The plan significantly lowers the threshold under the current tax law, passed in late 2017, which raised the amount an individual is allowed to transfer before facing any estate tax to roughly $11 million; couples can pass on twice that much.
The tax-the-rich proposals, including the one introduced by Sanders, are designed to increase revenue to pay for expanded social programs like “Medicare for all."
Though Sanders, 77, has not yet announced he is running for president, he appears to be actively moving toward a 2020 campaign.
Republicans have repeatedly tried to thwart efforts to broaden the estate tax, which they call the “death tax." President Trump has described the estate tax as “crushing," “horrible," and “unfair," and on Monday, three Republican senators including Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, introduced legislation to permanently repeal the estate tax. Trump and other opponents of the estate tax have positioned a repeal as a way to help farmers, ranchers, and small business owners.
Sanders's estate tax plan, which he said would affect the wealthiest 0.2 percent of Americans, is similar to one he introduced during his 2016 presidential campaign, when he finished second to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary race. Sanders also supports the idea of a wealth tax, which he outlined in a list of financing options for “Medicare for all."

No food service for MAGA hat wearers
Patrons won't be served at a Silicon Valley restaurant if they wear a "Make America Great Again" baseball cap.
J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, a chef-partner of the Wursthall restaurant in San Mateo, Calif., said in a tweet last weekend that he views the hats as symbols of intolerance and hate.
"It hasn't happened yet, but if you come to my restaurant wearing a MAGA cap, you aren't getting served, same as if you come in wearing a swastika, white hood, or any other symbol of intolerance and hate," the San Francisco Chronicle reported Thursday.
The tweet was no longer available Thursday but the newspaper reported it had more than 2,100 likes and more than 200 retweets as of Wednesday afternoon.
The red hats, which are sold on President Trump's campaign website, have become polarizing. The hats were worn by some Kentucky high school students involved in a Jan. 18 confrontation with a Native American elder near the Lincoln Memorial.

'Like white hoods except stupider': California chef says he won't serve diners wearing 'MAGA' hats

Texto completo: A San Francisco Bay Area chef doesn't want to serve anyone at his restaurant wearing the President Donald Trump-inspired "Make America Great Again" hats.
In a since-deleted tweet, J. Kenji López-Alt said, "It hasn’t happened yet, but if you come to my restaurant wearing a MAGA cap, you aren’t getting served, same as if you come in wearing a swastika, white hood, or any other symbol of intolerance and hate. "
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the tweet from Sunday had more than 2,000 likes by Wednesday afternoon.
In another apparently deleted tweet from Sunday, López-Alt said, "MAGA hats are like white hoods except stupider because you can see exactly who is wearing them," per the Chronicle.
Other tweets replying to users remained on López-Alt's profile on Thursday. "If you’re comfortable sitting next to a MAGA wearer I’m probably not interested in serving you either," the chef said.
López-Alt is a chef and partner at Wursthall in San Mateo, less than 20 miles from downtown San Francisco. He's also written a New York Times bestseller, "The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science. "
USA TODAY's calls to the restaurant Thursday evening were not answered. The chef told the Chronicle the Wursthall had received threats via email since the tweet, but declined to comment further.
Restaurant goers told the Chronicle that they understood López-Alt's sentiment but disagreed with a ban.
"I see where he's coming from, but I don't think you should just keep people out because of a hat," San Mateo resident Jamie Hwang, 42, told the newspaper inside the restaurant. "I get that idea, that maybe that hat could mean the person wearing it is just looking for a fight, but just cutting off dialogue, not giving a chance to get to know someone – I just don't know if that’s something I would do. "
"I don't think it matters to me about the rule, but the hat doesn't just tell you all about the person," Bryan Agbayani, 30, also told the newspaper while dining. "All people are different. It's just weird, to me, at least, that he would make it part of this business. "
Since Trump's presidential campaign, red "MAGA" caps have become a divisive symbol in the United States. Those who wear them often say they do so to show patriotism and outward support for the president. Others say the hats promote the hate and racism that they believe Trump fosters.
The hats, sold for $25 on Trump's campaign website, sparked widespread conversation earlier this month after an incident involving an indigenous marcher and a group of high school boys donning the caps in Washington, D. C.
In the wake of the incident, actress Alyssa Milano tweeted, "The red MAGA hat is the new white hood," and later said she wouldn't apologize for the remark.

Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro says any US invasion would be worse than 'Vietnam'

Texto completo: One week after President Donald Trump's administration recognized an opposition leader as Venezuela's interim president, the Latin American nation's disputed leader Nicolas Maduro warned Wednesday that the United States was in danger of turning his country into another Vietnam War.
"People from #USA, I ask for your support in order to reject the interference of Donald Trump's administration which intends to turn my Homeland into a 'Vietnam war' in Latin America. Don't allow it!" Maduro posted on his Twitter account, in English.
In a video published in Spanish on his Facebook account, Maduro said if "the U. S. intends to invade us, they will have a Vietnam worse than they can imagine. "
Maduro has accused the U. S. of attempting to stage a coup against his government. Speculation that Trump may be preparing to send troops to Venezuela was fueled this week after National Security Adviser John Bolton was seen holding a notepad that read: "5,000 troops to Colombia. " Colombia borders Venezuela.

More than 58,000 Americans and 4 million Vietnamese were killed in the Vietnam War. The second longest war in American history was an expensive and divisive conflict the U. S. entered incrementally from 1955 to 1973 on the side of South Vietnam against Communist North Vietnam. The longest U. S. war is in Afghanistan.
Maduro's comments on social media came as thousands of Venezuelans marched late Wednesday in opposition to his regime and in support of Juan Guaido, a charismatic 35-year-old who heads the opposition. Guaido is an industrial engineer by training and has little governance experience but he has won the backing of many Venezuelans, and Trump and some U. S. allies, for his stated commitment to fighting corruption and revitalizing the oil-rich country's troubled six-decade-old relationship with democracy.
Guaido has vowed to end the "usurpation," a reference to moves by Maduro to accumulate executive power that has weakened Venezuela's courts, undermined its legislative assembly and brought allegations of gross human-rights abuses.
Trump spoke with Guaido by phone Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. They "agreed to maintain regular communication to support Venezuela’s path back to stability, and to rebuild the bilateral relationship between the United States and Venezuela," Sanders said. It was an allusion to Maduro but also to the diplomatic tensions that began under his predecessor Hugo Chávez.
The socialist leader assailed U. S. influence in Latin America in his campaign against capitalism and democratic freedoms. It was under Chávez that Venezuela's economic woes intensified. Chavez impoverished Venezuela by expropriating the country's private wealth, especially its oil money, and attempting to redistribute it to the poor. But Chávez's populist policies were staggeringly mismanaged.

Venezuela now has the highest annual inflation rate in the world – more than 100,000 percent – and it is plagued by shortages of essential medicines and food.
In Venezuela's latest presidential election, a controversial vote which he won in May last year, Maduro barred most opposition candidates from running.
The Venezuelan Program for Education-Action in Human Rights, a humanitarian group, alleges that at least 40 people have been killed by paramilitary groups linked to Maduro's government since protests started this month. The U. S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela's state-run oil company, PVDSA, on Monday, and Bolton has said that as far as Washington is concerned "all options are on the table" to resolve the crisis.
About 20 countries have joined the U. S. in recognizing Guaido's leadership, although the European Union, a 28-nation political bloc, has held out. Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the EU "will take further actions" if Maduro does not hold a presidential election in the next few days. These actions would likely be sanctions.
China, Russia and Turkey have stood by Maduro.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected in Miami on Friday to meet with members of the Venezuelan exile community and to give a speech backing Guaido.
Still, Carlos Vecchio, a Venezuelan envoy to the U. S. who works with Guaido, told reporters in Washington that his transitional government has not spoken with anyone from the Trump administration about military intervention. And in an article published in The New York Times, Guaido said that he has held secret meetings with members of Venezuela's own military to discuss the possibility of ousting Maduro.
Continuing support from Venezuela's security forces may be key to Maduro's survival.
"The military's withdrawal of support from Mr Maduro is crucial to enabling a change in government, and the majority of those in service agree that the country's recent travails are untenable," Guaido wrote in The Times opinion piece published Wednesday.
Guaido said Thursday that Venezuelan police showed up at his apartment in Caracas to intimidate hid wife. He said his 20-month-old daughter was in the apartment at the time. The police left shortly after neighbors started banging posts and pans, he said.

Liking them apples
Liberty Ciderworks has won a prestigious Good Food Award for its Heirloom Series McIntosh.
The Spokane cidery was one of 13 nationwide winners in this year's cider category.
Its Heirloom Series McIntosh is made exclusively from McIntosh apples grown at Bishops' Orchard in Garfield and the wild yeast found on the apples themselves.
That particular cider was poured as the exclusive pre-event beverage at the Jan. 11 awards ceremony, held at the San Francisco Performing Arts Center. Alice Waters was the gala's honorary host.
The awards, in their ninth year, are part of the Good Food Foundation, which - according to its website - "exists to celebrate, connect, empower and leverage the passionate and engaged, yet often overlooked, players in the food system who are driving towards tasty, authentic and responsible food in order to humanize and reform our American food culture."
This year, there were more than 2,000 entries in 16 categories. Three food crafters from each of the five regions - north, south, east, west and central - are usually selected as winners from a pool of finalists. Finalists this year represented 401 products from 40 states.
In all, Washington state had 19 winners this year - from Finnriver Farm and Cidery in Chimacum and Bow Hill Blueberries in Bow to Fran's Chocolates in Seattle and, of course, Liberty Ciderworks in Spokane.
"We're excited and honored to be part of Spokane's emerging food and beverage scene, and to help elevate our region's reputation as a place where some of the world's finest wines, beers, distilled products and ciders are made," said Rick Hastings, who co-owns Liberty Ciderworks with Austin Dickey.
Liberty Ciderworks, established in 2013, is at 164 S. Washington St., Suite 300. Call (509) 321-1893. On the web: http://libertycider.com/.

Cheney rancher appears in New York Times photo essay
Beth Robinette, a fourth-generation owner and operator of Lazy R Ranch in Cheney, is quoted in a recent New York Times photo essay.
The project, posted Jan. 11, was written by Amy Chozick and photographed by Amanda Lucier. It's titled: "Female Ranchers Are Reclaiming the American West."
The subhead reads: "As men leave animal agriculture for less gritty work, more ranches are being led by women - with new ideas about technology, ecology and the land."
Robinette, co-founder of Local Inland Northwest Cooperative - or LINC - Foods, runs a five-day New Cowgirl Camp which trains women in ranch management. She's described in the Times piece this way: "Ms. Robinette recoils at the gaudy, country-pop version of the overly feminized cowgirl, and calls her program a 'rhinestone-free zone.' "
She's also quoted in the project. "Our current generation of land managers is aging out of that role," she told the New York Times. "You could look at that as a disaster, or you could really look at that as an opportunity to change the paradigm."

Texto completo: But media's bias - one of many - is revealed in their focus on mostly liberal women with barely a mention, if they are mentioned at all, of women who are conservative. Reporters, commentators and hosts on major networks, and including some cable outlets, speak of "women's issues," as if all women think, or should think, alike.
Worse, they never examine whether ideas floated by liberal women are anything new or whether they have worked in the past or are working presently. Many liberal pronouncements seem to be taken at face value, with little pushback to explain how they plan to make their proposals work, especially those that have been tried and failed before (consider programs to wipe out poverty, along with increased spending to improve public education, as just two of many examples).
Another example: the presidential candidacy announcement by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). Harris has been in the Senate for only two years but already she hears "Hail to the Chief" playing for her? Who does she think she is, Barack Obama?
In predictable liberal fashion, Harris wants to impose a $3 trillion tax plan on the country at a time when, according to Investor's Business Daily, "President Trump's $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could kick economic growth into high gear." Harris also tracks with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in promoting Medicare for all that is projected to cost $30 trillion. With a national debt at nearly $22 trillion and soaring, the idea that we could absorb additional debt is a recipe for bankruptcy, especially when one considers that many initial cost estimates for past government programs have far exceeded projections.
Federal tax revenues have already hit record highs. The obvious problem is not insufficient revenue; rather, it is lack of spending discipline and the desire to give people whatever they want, hoping a growing addiction to government will produce more votes for the politicians dispensing "free" goodies.
Back to media's fixation: Why do major media outlets trumpet the causes of women, gays, African Americans, Hispanics and other groups who are liberal? Why do the ideas of conservative women never seem to receive that same level of attention? If you have to ask the question, you haven't been paying attention.
It seems the major media long ago abandoned fairness, balance, even accuracy. Especially in the Trump era, they have displayed naked ideological cheerleading for liberals and their proposals. Any fair examination of major newspapers - from the front page, to the editorial and op-ed pages - proves the point.
It has become much easier to speed read the Washington Post and the New York Times, because every day they contain little else but a steady drumbeat of anti-Trump stories, editorials and columns. The conservative Media Research Center has calculated that 90 percent of TV coverage of the first two years of the Trump administration has been negative.
Whatever one's views, this is not healthy for the credibility and stability of journalism, the political parties or the country.
Yes, there are far fewer Republican women in Congress than female Democrats, but that is not an invitation to focus solely on the Democrats while ignoring Republican and especially conservative Republican women. Their ideas and proposals deserve at least equal consideration and examination.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- Negotiators for the U.S. and the Taliban insurgents have reached "agreements in principle" on key issues for a peace deal that would end 17 years of war in Afghanistan, the top U.S. envoy said Monday.

The statement by U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad followed six days of talks last week with the Taliban in Qatar, where he urged the Islamic insurgent group to enter into direct negotiations with the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.

Ghani on Monday assured Afghans that their rights will not be compromised in the name of peace with the Taliban, who have been staging near-daily attacks against Afghan forces, causing scores of casualties every week. Their offensive has not let up despite the severe Afghan winter and the insurgents now hold sway over nearly half of the country.

Khalilzad said in an interview with The New York Times that an agreement in principle was reached with the Taliban on the framework of a peace deal "which still has to be fleshed out" that will see the insurgents commit to guaranteeing that Afghan territory is not used as a "platform for international terrorist groups or individuals."

He said the deal could lead to a full pullout of U.S. troops in return for a cease-fire and Taliban talks with the Afghan government.

In his statement released by the U.S. Embassy, Khalilzad said, "We made progress on vital issues in our discussions and agreed to agreements in principle on a couple of very important issues.

"There is a lot more work to be done before we can say we have succeeded in our efforts but I believe for the first time I can say that we have made significant progress," he said.

Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said he has been briefed on the talks and described them as encouraging, but he also told reporters that the department has not been directed to prepare for a full withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Speaking before a meeting at the Pentagon with Shanahan, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said any discussion about the withdrawal of NATO forces from Afghanistan would be premature. He said Khalilzad had briefed NATO allies on the talks weeks ago.

"We are in Afghanistan to create the conditions for a peaceful negotiated solution," Stoltenberg said. "We will not stay longer than necessary, but we will not leave before we have a situation that enables us to leave or reduce the number of troops without jeopardizing the main goal of our presence and that is to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for international terrorists once again."

He added that he believes it's too soon to speculate on withdrawal because "what we have to do now is to support the efforts to try to find a peaceful solution. We strongly support those efforts."

Ghani sought to assure Afghans that no deals would be made without Kabul's awareness and full participation.

"Our commitment is to provide peace and to prevent any possible disaster," Ghani said in an address to the nation. "There are values that are not disputable, such as national unity, national sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Ghani's office said he and Khalilzad met late Sunday in Kabul to discuss details from the talks.

Khalilzad's statement emphasized the inclusion of the Afghan government in the talks.

"There is a false narrative that Afghans are not included. That is not true. The Afghan voice is there," he said. "We are working together to get to a comprehensive cease-fire. We are working with the Afghan government, with international partners, to find implementing mechanisms to reach these goals."

Khalilzad has met with the Taliban on a number of occasions in recent months in the latest bid to end America's longest war. The U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to topple the Taliban, who were harboring Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida.

The statement from Ghani's office also claimed that the Taliban demanded from Khalilzad the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan, but that there was also no agreement on that issue.

The statement added that Khalilzad has no authority to discuss issues such as a future Afghan administration but that his goal is to facilitate an intra-Afghan dialogue, meaning direct talks between the Taliban and Kabul.

Khalilzad had tweeted Saturday about progress in the talks in Qatar, where the insurgents have a political office, saying: "Meetings here were more productive than they have been in the past."

"We made significant progress on vital issues," he tweeted, without offering details.

Abdul Hakim Mujahid, a former Taliban official and currently a member of the High Peace Council, an independent body of clerics and respected Afghan figures, said he believes the Qatar talks resulted in a "good understanding between both sides" but that more discussions are needed in the coming weeks or months.

"Afghanistan's problem is not so simple that it can be solved in a day, week or month, it needs more time and more discussions," Mujahid told The Associated Press.

The Taliban have in the past refused to negotiate directly with Kabul -- a standing that does not appear to have changed. They have maintained that they are prepared to talk with U.S. officials only and only about the pullout of foreign forces from Afghanistan.

Afghan political analyst Waheed Muzhda says he believes that Khalilzad and the Taliban have reached agreement on both the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and a cease-fire deal, but that neither side is prepared to say so at this point.

"But peace talks are not possible unless both sides first agree on a cease-fire," Muzhda said.

In Monday's address to the nation, Ghani also stressed that U.S. and other foreign forces are in Afghanistan because they are needed here and that if there is to be any downsizing or pullout, the Kabul government will have to play a role in the talks.

Ghani also reiterated his call on the Taliban to engage "in direct talks with the Afghan government."

THE COMING DEMOCRATIC COFFEE KLATCH

Texto completo: Barring unforeseen circumstances - such as a nuclear war, an intergalactic invasion or a Mueller report that exonerates Donald Trump - the Democrats will retake the White House with electoral votes to spare next year. Still, we all should be mindful that predicting the outcome of a presidential election more than a year out, especially after the Black Swan debacle of 2016 that resulted in Mr. Trump's presidency, is an act of hubris.
History has not been kind to glib predictions. When it comes to American elections , voters often make it a point to be unpredictable - not to mention the forces in social media attempting to subvert and influence their outcomes .
Putting aside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's masterful shutdown shellacking of Mr. Trump last week, it is not beyond the capacity of the Democrats to engage in ruinous self-sabotage, as they have in the past.
If, after a long and hopefully not-too-contentious primary season, the Democrats nominate someone along the lines of anti-Trump bulldog Michael Avenatti, a charismatic lawyer who lacks practical political experience, then a second Trump term would be likely.
Fortunately, Mr. Avenatti has dropped out. The government shutdown reminded us that the hard work of national governance is too important to be left to partisan amateurs.
Still, there probably isn't a politician or business tycoon in the country who doesn't believe he or she couldn't become president after the political tsunami of 2016 that swept a failed businessman and reality TV star into office. The calculation is clear and irresistible - win the Democratic nomination and you're likely to win the presidency. Cue the mic drop.
Donald Trump is politically vulnerable and eminently beatable. This is heartening, but it could become terrifying if it leads to overconfidence.
While any Democrat would be preferable to Mr. Trump, we all know there are Democrats (and an Independent or two) who have no business even glancing toward 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
Former Starbucks chairman and CEO Howard Schultz seems a compassionate and socially conscience billionaire, but his recent interview on "60 Minutes," in which he mulled the possibility of running for president as an Independent, left a lot of folks cold. He's not exactly riveting, and he has no bold policy initiatives. His vague promise to weigh liberal, conservative and libertarian ideas equally when devising policy is a nonstarter. Voting for the candidate who doesn't have a discernible ideology or bedrock political values doesn't seem like a smart move after Donald Trump.
Mr. Schultz has to know that he'd likely draw just enough wayward Democratic votes to make it possible for Mr. Trump to secure a second term. For him to be at peace with such a possibility is reason enough to question his political acumen.
Mr. Schultz also hasn't come off well in recent years during two controversies - a disastrous "conversation about race" that put his baristas on the front lines of America's awkward racial mush-mouthing and an apology tour after the arrest of two black men in Philly last year for waiting for a friend at a Starbucks while black.
In other words, Americans might drink Mr. Schultz's coffee, but that doesn't mean he has any chance of being elected. I like Mr. Schultz and agree that America needs more than two parties, but 2020 is not the year to risk re-electing Mr. Trump or electing Mike Pence by making a third-party run. Billionaires like Mr. Schultz and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who also is mulling a doomed presidential run as either an Independent or a Democrat, should understand that the party's rank-and-file aren't interested in entertaining a candidate's weird bouts of noblesse oblige.
Hillary Clinton is rumored to be seriously considering a rematch against Mr. Trump, but this would be too dangerous for Democrats in 2020. Yes, her resume is deep and she got 3 million more votes than Mr. Trump did in 2016, but she's also the party's most divisive figure by a factor of 10.
Even if Mrs. Clinton campaigned in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida and Ohio every day until the polls close, there's no guarantee the results wouldn't be the same. Demoralized Republicans would turn out in record numbers just to shout "lock her up" one more time before voting against her. The irrational hatred her very existence stirs up within the Republican base borders on the supernatural.
Personally, I would love to see a ticket headed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Still, my gut tells me that the ticket most likely to win with the most electoral and popular votes would be the impossibly American duo of Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and California Sen. Kamala Harris. They look like a two-term White House couple if ever there was one. They balance out each other's deficits and complement each other's strengths.
No, I'm not on the Beto, Booker, Biden or Bernie trains this time around, though they're infinitely preferable to the incumbent. I look forward to seeing dark horses Pete Buttigieg and Julian Castro on the debate stage, but I think Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard have burned too many bridges with fellow Democrats to be viable next year. Meanwhile, what happens if Andrew Gillum or Stacey Abrams joins the fray?
Remember when the conventional wisdom was that Democrats had a weak bench of potential presidential candidates? Seems like a silly observation now as we lurch through the third year of Mr. Trump's term, which seems almost sure to be his last.

Hired-gun CEO was unabashed proponent of downsizing, accused of fraud

Texto completo: Wherever Albert J. Dunlap went, success seemed to follow. A hired-gun CEO, he presided over nearly a dozen corporations, including a disposable-cup company, plastic ketchup bottle manufacturer and toilet-paper giant, and grew profits while firing thousands of employees in the name of efficiency and cutting costs.
An unabashed proponent of downsizing, he became known as "Chainsaw Al," "the Shredder" and "Rambo in Pinstripes," while his own name entered the corporate lexicon as a verb - "to dunlap" - for turning a wayward company into a highflying success.
Yet Mr. Dunlap, who was 81 when he died Jan. 25 at his home in Ocala, Fla., went on to face allegations of smoke-and-mirrors accounting that led to his 1998 ouster from Sunbeam, a small-appliance company, and to news reports that unearthed similar fraud allegations earlier in his career.
He never faced criminal charges. But in 2002, he agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $500,000 to settle the Sunbeam allegations and was barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.
"In all my years of reporting, I had never come across an executive as manipulative, ruthless, and destructive as Al Dunlap," journalist John A. Byrne, author of the 1999 Dunlap biography "Chainsaw," later wrote in Fast Company magazine. Mr. Dunlap, he added, "sucked the very life and soul out of companies and people. He stole dignity, purpose, and sense out of organizations and replaced those ideals with fear and intimidation."
Mr. Dunlap denied wrongdoing and insisted that he was nothing less than a corporate doctor, saving "dying" companies that were overburdened by debt. While he generally disdained charitable giving as an executive, canceling $3 million in charity pledges while running Scott Paper, he refashioned himself in recent years as a leading Florida philanthropist, donating more than $40 million to Florida State University.
Still, his reputation as a cutthroat corporate leader proved hard to shake. Since being ousted from Sunbeam, he was cited in articles such as a Time magazine list of "Top 10 Worst Bosses" and a Fast Company story headlined "Is Your Boss a Psychopath?" For a 2015 GQ feature - "Your Boss Actually Is a Psycho" - writer Jon Ronson visited Mr. Dunlap's estate in Florida, asking him whether he might not be a psychopath. Ronson based his questions on a list of traits assembled by psychologist Robert D. Hare.
Mr. Dunlap, he wrote, redefined certain psychopathic traits (impulsivity, manipulative behavior) as "leadership positives" and wrote off his Sunbeam years as "a footnote" in his career.
As Mr. Dunlap told it, in frequent interviews and a best-selling 1996 manifesto, "Mean Business," his was an all-American success story, in which "a nothing kid from the slums of Hoboken, N.J.," rose to graduate from the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., and claw his way to the heights of American business.
That image of heroic, self-made success was undermined by accounts from his sister, Denise Dunlap, who told Businessweek that she and her brother had "a very comfortable childhood," and from divorce filings in which his first wife, Gwyn Donnelly, alleged he had threatened her with guns and a Bowie knife. According to "Chainsaw," Mr. Dunlap could also be cruel to co-workers; on one occasion, he threw a chair at Sunbeam's human resources chief.
On Wall Street, however, Mr. Dunlap was long viewed as a hero who could do no wrong. Under his leadership in the 1980s, the cup-maker Lily-Tulip increased its stock price by more than 900 percent, from $1.77 to $18.55, according to "Mean Business." He was later credited with tripling the stock price of Scott Paper, which was struggling with $2.5 billion in debt when he was named chief executive in 1994.
In both cases, the growth was fueled by massive cuts. Mr. Dunlap eliminated about half the staff of Lily-Tulip and about 11,000 jobs, or one-third of the workforce, at Scott Paper.
When Scott Paper was sold to Kimberly-Clark in 1995 for $9.4 billion, Mr. Dunlap received a $100 million payout. "Most CEOs are ridiculously overpaid," he wrote, "but I deserved the $100 million." Indeed, two days after Mr. Dunlap joined Sunbeam, in July 1996, he told analysts in a conference call, "I love every dollar like a brother," and declared that he "would have hung" the previous management team for incompetency.
Mr. Dunlap's rise was halted suddenly in 1998, amid news reports that he had inflated sales figures through tactics such as buy and hold, in which products such as outdoor grills were "sold" in the winter but not paid for until spring.
When Mr. Dunlap was confronted by a skeptical financial analyst at an investors' meeting that May, according to one Businessweek account, he responded by grabbing the man by his shoulder, placing a hand over his mouth and saying: "You son of a bitch. If you want to come after me, I'll come after you twice as hard."
The Sunbeam board fired Mr. Dunlap that June, declaring that he had misled investors. In 2001, the company filed for bankruptcy, struggling under $2 billion in debt; the SEC charged Mr. Dunlap with accounting fraud that same year, saying he "orchestrated a fraudulent scheme to create the illusion of a successful restructuring of Sunbeam and facilitate the sale of the company at an inflated price."
In addition to the SEC settlement, Mr. Dunlap paid $15 million to resolve a shareholder suit. Sunbeam's accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, which was later charged in the Enron scandal, settled a separate shareholder lawsuit for $110 million, after signing off on an audit that allegedly included false profits.
Mr. Dunlap effectively retired from business after his ouster at Sunbeam, although he continued to maintain he had done nothing wrong, and embarked on an international speaking tour with Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The subject was leadership.
"The harsh reality of business life is that what works today won't even be satisfactory tomorrow," he had written in "Mean Business." "The predators are out there, circling, trying to stare you down, waiting for any sign of weakness, ready to pounce and make you their next meal."
Albert John Dunlap was born in Hoboken on July 26, 1937. Mr. Dunlap said that his mother was a dime-store clerk and his father was a dockworker; his sister said their mother was a homemaker and their father was a successful boilermaker for United Engineers.
After graduating from West Point in 1960, Mr. Dunlap served as a paratrooper and was stationed at a nuclear missile site. He joined Kimberly-Clark in 1963 and went on to serve as a senior vice president at American Can before becoming chief executive of Lily-Tulip in 1983.
His success attracted the attention of British French financier James Goldsmith, who named him the head of Diamond International and Crown Zellerbach, a pair of forest products companies. He also restructured parts of Consolidated Press Holdings, controlled by Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer, before joining Scott Paper.
Amid the SEC inquiry into his work at Sunbeam, the New York Times reported on fraud allegations that stemmed from Mr. Dunlap's previously overlooked tenure at Nitec Paper in Upstate New York. He had been fired there in 1976, although the job had been scrubbed from his employment records, and was accused by Nitec of acting fraudulently, reporting multimillion-dollar profits while the company was suffering a $5.5 million loss.
Lawsuits between Mr. Dunlap and Nitec dragged on for years and were dropped or settled out of court after the company filed for bankruptcy in 1982. Mr. Dunlap maintained his innocence even as the company's financial vice president testified that Mr. Dunlap had ordered him to cook the books.
Mr. Dunlap died of prostate cancer, said Eric Carr, a family representative. He had a son, Troy, from his marriage to Donnelly. In 1968, he married Judith Stringer. They had no children, Carr said, but for several decades considered several pairs of German shepherds part of the family, naming each dog Brit or Cadet, in the way of school mascots whose names persist through multiple generations.
The dogs had often served as a punchline of sorts for Mr. Dunlap, who told Forbes in 1995, "If you want somebody to like you, get a dog.
"I've got two," he added. "I hedged."

Texto completo: Whether you're an avid cable news watcher or an unwitting fish, you're liable to get hooked by Rachel Maddow .
The MSNBC host took time away from the hustle and bustle of New York City for some ice fishing near her home in West Cummington, Mass., over the weekend.
“Icefishing at the Ashfield LakeHouse in Western Mass, the greatest place on earth," Maddow wrote on Twitter, posting a photo of herself out on the ice with a red folding chair and a Vexilar ice fishing rig.
Maddow has sung the praises of ice fishing and Ashfield Lake House before, citing the bar and grill's Sloppy Joes as perfect ice fishing fuel in a January 2018 tweet.
According to a 2005 Globe article, Maddow's now-partner Suzy Mikula bought their West Cummington home in December 1998 and met Maddow four months later, when she was searching for someone to help her manage upkeep of the creaky 1865 home and the land surrounding it.
In a 2014 New York Times interview, Maddow said she typically arrived at the house at 2 a.m. on Saturday morning during a weekend away from New York. She said the place has no television, but it does have a fishing pole.
“A very old friend of mine gave me a fishing pole," Maddow told the Times. “I'd done a little fishing as a kid. Now, I have started fishing in the rivers around my house. I have my Massachusetts fishing license in my wallet and my pole in the shed."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--The Treasury Department on Sunday removed Russian aluminum company Rusal from its sanctions list after a blacklisted billionaire and close ally of President Vladimir Putin, Oleg Deripaska, delivered on a promised plan to divest his majority ownership stake, the office said.
The issue had become a political controversy amid concerns the Trump administration was going easy on Russia, but many former Treasury officials and other sanctions experts said the move was made following longstanding policies under which the office does its work.
The delisting will likely reassure aluminum markets concerned that the world's second-largest producer would cut off a critical source of the metal, especially for the European companies to which Rusal sells.
Under a deal Treasury agreed with the board of Rusal's holding company, EN+ Group Plc, Mr. Deripaska cut his shares to below the 50% threshold designated in Treasury's sanctions guidelines. Another firm controlled by EN+, energy company JSC EuroSibEnergo, also was removed from the blacklist as part of the deal. None of the companies were accused of conduct that would give rise to sanctions; they were targeted because of Mr. Deripaska's ownership .
"The action ensures that the majority of directors on the EN+ and Rusal boards will be independent directors--including U.S. and European persons--who have no business, professional, or family ties to Deripaska or any other" blacklisted entity, Treasury said in a statement.
"The companies have also agreed to unprecedented transparency for Treasury into their operations by undertaking extensive, ongoing auditing, certification, and reporting requirements."
The sanctions on the companies were never fully implemented, as the U.S. repeatedly issued licenses allowing certain business activity while the two sides tried to work out a deal. The final licenses were set to expire Monday.
Mr. Deripaska, however, remains under sanctions; he was added to the blacklist in April as part of a broader package targeting Russian meddling in U.S. elections , cyberattacks and other provocations.
Democratic-led efforts in Congress to block the move delisting the companies failed earlier this month after they couldn't secure enough Republicans in the Senate to join the effort. The House of Representatives passed a resolution disapproving of the deal.
Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who has played a leading role in pushing back against the Treasury's deal, said the department ignored the House's vote. "This represents just one more step in undermining the sanctions law, which President Trump has obstructed at every opportunity, while Russian aggression remains unabated," he said in an emailed statement.
Under the deal, Mr. Deripaska's stake in EN+ drops to 44.95%, down from 70%. He can only vote 35% of those shares. EN+ also is required to replace its board with members approved by the U.S. Treasury and to allow the U.S. to see internal company documents, including earnings reports and board minutes.
EN+ and Rusal announced several governance and investment changes following the sanctions removals, including the departure, at the Treasury's request, of Jean-Pierre Thomas as Rusal's chairman.
Another Rusal director stepped down, as did seven board members of EN+. Among the seven new directors announced by EN+ are Christopher B. Burnham, chairman and chief executive of private investment firm Cambridge Global Capital LLC; and Nicholas Jordan, who once was co-chief of the Russian units of Goldman Sachs and of UBS AG.
EN+ Chairman Lord Barker said the sanctions removals mark a turning point for the company, calling the moves "a clear victory for muscular corporate governance."
The broad contours of the deal were released to the public in a letter to Congress. But Treasury didn't release the full agreement, and a department spokesman said last week that it generally doesn't do so because "they can contain proprietary information or be otherwise privileged."
A recent New York Times article raised questions about the deal, citing the full agreement, including the allegation that Mr. Deripaska will retain control of the company by combining his stake with investments held by his allies, including members of his family.
The Treasury spokesman said there is no truth to the assertion, threatening sanctions designations on any shareholder who might knowingly facilitate significant transactions for Mr. Deripaska, or on his behalf.
"Furthermore, in instances where there could be a perception that a shareholder may not be independent of [Mr.] Deripaska, Treasury required that shareholder to assign their voting rights to an independent third party," he said. "In a large publicly traded company, it is the shareholder voting rights through which the shareholder exerts control and influence."

Texto completo: Harris Wofford — a Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, university president and lifelong crusader for civil rights — died Monday at a hospital in Washington. He was 92. The cause was complications from a fall, said his son, Daniel Wofford.
The scion of a wealthy business family, Wofford became one of the first white students to graduate from the historically black Howard University law school in Washington. He was an early supporter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and marched alongside him in the civil and voting rights flashpoint of Selma, Alabama.
He went on to a wide-ranging career, serving as President John F. Kennedy’s special assistant for civil rights, helping Kennedy in-law Sargent Shriver launch the Peace Corps and heading two colleges, including Bryn Mawr women’s college in Pennsylvania.
In 1991, he defeated a giant of Pennsylvania politics — former Republican Gov. and U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh — to become the state’s first Democratic senator in more than 20 years.
In 2016, Wofford described the merging of his personal and political ideals in an essay published in The New York Times, "Finding Love Again, This Time With a Man."
Wofford, by then a widower, described how he met Matthew Charlton, an interior designer 50 years his junior, and the two became a couple. The essay ended with Mr. Wofford’s announcement that he and Charlton would soon exchange marriage vows. They wed that year.

Kettles piloted his helicopter into the Song Tra Cau riverbed four times that day to deliver reinforcements to the outnumbered members of the 101st Airborne Division and to evacuate the wounded and the dead. He made the final trip alone after learning that eight men remained behind, having been unable to board helicopters in the previous round. "If we left them for 10 minutes," Kettles later said, "they’d be POWs or dead."
Kettles received the Distinguished Service Cross, the military’s second-highest award for valor, for his actions. In 2016, the award was upgraded to the Medal of Honor.
* The Hungarian-American film producer who worked on several "Rambo" movies with Sylvester Stallone, "Total Recall" with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Madonna’s "Evita" died Jan. 20 at his Budapest home after a long illness. Andy Vajna was 74.

Vaccine hesitancy must be overcome for public health

Texto completo: The World Health Organization has ranked vaccine hesitancy – the growing resistance to widely available lifesaving vaccines – as one of the top 10 health threats in the world for 2019.
That news will not come as a surprise in New York City, where the worst measles outbreak in decades is now underway. Nor in California or Minnesota, where similar outbreaks unfolded in 2014 and 2017, respectively.
Leading global health threats typically are caused by the plagues and perils of low-income countries – but vaccine hesitancy is as American as can be. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of children who are unvaccinated has quadrupled since 2001.
The consequences of this disparity are substantial: a surge in outbreaks of measles, mumps, pertussis and other diseases; an increase in influenza deaths; and dismal rates of HPV vaccination, which doctors say could effectively wipe out cervical cancer. But infectious disease experts warn that things could get much worse. Trust in vaccines is being so thoroughly eroded, they say, that these prevention tools are in danger of becoming useless. The next major disease outbreak "will not be due to a lack of preventive technologies," Heidi Larson, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, writes in the journal Nature, but to an "emotional contagion, digitally enabled."
Thwarting this danger will require a campaign as bold and aggressive as the one being waged by the anti-vaccination contingent. Here's how to get started.
Get tough. After the 2014 California measles outbreak, the state eliminated nonmedical exemptions for mandatory vaccinations. After a similar outbreak in Michigan, health officials there began requiring individuals to formally consult with their local health departments before opting out of otherwise-mandatory shots.Other states ought to follow this lead, and the federal government should consider tightening restrictions around how much leeway states can grant families that want to skip essential vaccines.
Be savvy. The Vaccine Confidence Project is a London-based academic endeavor that monitors anti-vaccine websites for rumors and conspiracies and addresses them. It also puts out a vaccine confidence index. Federal health officials would do well to implement a similar program and pair it with an aggressive social media campaign.
Vaccines, to some extent, are victims of their own success. In the United States especially, they've beaten so many infectious foes into oblivion that hardly any practicing doctors, let alone new parents, remember how terrible those diseases once were. An effective pro-vaccine campaign needs to remind us: Vaccines prevent two million to three million deaths globally each year.
Enlist the right support. Some doctors and scientists have referred to ""uneventful vaccination" as "The Greatest Story Never Told." Though they may not spread on the internet like the stories of terrible mishaps that anti-vaxxers traffic in, these far more common tales of inoculation without incident can be a powerful elixir for a nervous new parent. The best ambassadors of these stories are likely to be parents themselves. If health officials corralled these families and trained them in the basics of vaccine science, they might succeed where official voices sometimes fail.

But the media's bias - one of many - is revealed in their focus on mostly liberal women with barely a mention, if they are mentioned at all, of women who are conservative. Reporters, commentators and hosts on major networks, and including some cable outlets, speak of "women's issues," as if all women think, or should think, alike.
Worse, they never examine whether ideas floated by liberal women are anything new or whether they have worked in the past or are working presently. Many liberal pronouncements seem to be taken at face value, with little pushback to explain how they plan to make their proposals work, especially those that have been tried and failed before (consider programs to wipe out poverty, along with increased spending to improve public education, as just two of many examples).
Another example: the presidential candidacy announcement by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.
Harris has been in the Senate for only two years but already she hears "Hail to the Chief" playing for her? Who does she think she is, Barack Obama?
In predictable liberal fashion, Harris wants to impose a $3 trillion tax plan on the country at a time when, according to Investor's Business Daily, "President Trump's $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could kick economic growth into high gear."
Harris also tracks with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in promoting Medicare for all that is projected to cost $30 trillion. With a national debt at nearly $22 trillion and soaring, the idea that we could absorb additional debt is a recipe for bankruptcy, especially when one considers that many initial cost estimates for past government programs have far exceeded projections.
Federal tax revenues have already hit record highs. The obvious problem is not insufficient revenue; rather, it is lack of spending discipline and the desire to give people whatever they want, hoping a growing addiction to government will produce more votes for the politicians dispensing "free" goodies.
Back to media's fixation: Why do major media outlets trumpet the causes of women, gays, African-Americans, Hispanics and other groups who are liberal?
Why do the ideas of conservative women never seem to receive that same level of attention? If you have to ask the question you haven't been paying attention.
It seems the major media long ago abandoned fairness, balance, even accuracy.
Especially in the Trump era, they have displayed naked ideological cheerleading for liberals and their proposals. Any fair examination of major newspapers - from the front page, to the editorial and op-ed pages - proves the point. It has become much easier to speed read The Washington Post and The New York Times, because every day they contain little else but a steady drumbeat of anti-Trump stories, editorials and columns.
The conservative Media Research Center has calculated that 90 percent of TV coverage of the first two years of the Trump administration has been negative.
Whatever one's views, this is not healthy for the credibility and stability of journalism, the political parties or the country.
Yes, there are far fewer Republican women in Congress than female Democrats, but that is not an invitation to focus solely on the Democrats while ignoring Republican - and especially conservative Republican - women.
Their ideas and proposals deserve at least equal consideration and examination.

Texto completo: A live production of "Rent" airs on Fox. And awards season blazes on, at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.
What's on TV
RENT 8 p.m. on Fox. Fans who have only seen high school productions (or middle school, or elementary school, or all three) of Jonathan Larson's 1996 musical riff on "La Bohème" have at least one major reason be excited about this live television adaptation: Michael Greif, who directed the original production at the New York Theater Workshop and a more recent Off Broadway production, is working with Alex Rudzinski (who in recent years directed "Grease: Live!" and John Legend as Jesus in "Jesus Christ Superstar" live in concert) to bring the musical to TV. That's about the most qualified team one could hope for, and the cast is delightfully varied: Vanessa Hudgens (of "High School Musical" and "Grease: Live!"), the pop singer Tinashe, Brandon Victor Dixon (Leslie Odom Jr.'s replacement as Aaron Burr in "Hamilton") and Valentina ("RuPaul's Drag Race") are all featured. The story concerns a group of New York artists living in the shadow of the AIDS epidemic -- though it's not all gloomy. "Puccini's ravishingly melancholy work seemed, like many operas of its time, to romance death," Ben Brantley wrote in his 1996 review for The New York Times. "Mr. Larson's spirited score and lyrics defy it."
25TH ANNUAL SCREEN ACTORS GUILD AWARDS 8 p.m. on TBS and TNT. With awards season in full swing, the SAG awards arrive Sunday night to add fuel to an already roaring conversation about who stood out onscreen in 2018. Anyone who watched the Golden Globes a few weeks ago or read the list of Oscar nominees released this week will find much that's familiar. (Lady Gaga? Glenn Close? Rami Malek? Richard E. Grant? Olivia Colman? They're all here.) But with the SAG ceremony, those performances are more or less isolated from the movies they came from; more even than usual, the actors themselves get center stage. This year, the ceremony will be hosted by Megan Mullally.
THREE IDENTICAL STRANGERS (2018) 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. on CNN. The director Tim Wardle weaves -- and then tightens -- the strands of a hard-to-believe true sibling story in this documentary, which tells the story of Edward Galland, David Kellman and Robert Shafran, triplets separated at birth. It's "best watched knowing as little as possible about its specifics," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. She called it a "fine documentary."
What's Streaming
DO THE RIGHT THING (1989) Stream on Starz; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In 1989, Spike Lee "was pretty much on his own as a voice of black racial reality," Wesley Morris wrote in an article for The Times this week. Lee's pressure cooker of a movie centers on racial animus at a local pizza joint. Nearly 40 years later, with Lee having just gotten his first Academy Award nomination for directing, it's ripe for revisiting.

Texto completo: We've been talking about the youth of America recently, after the Covington Catholic High School incident at the Lincoln Memorial last week. On Feb. 7, an HBO documentary will be checking in on another group of kids who've been in the news — the ones from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. Almost a year ago, on Feb. 14, 2018, 17 of their classmates and teachers were shot to death by a teenage gunman.
The name of the documentary is “Song of Parkland," and it focuses in on teacher Melody Herzfeld and her theater students as they return to school and resolve to continue with their annual musical production. She tells the kids, “This is the most important show you're going to do, ever." As they rehearse, many of the Parkland students, including some in Herzfeld's department, start a movement to end gun violence.
Directed and produced by Amy Schatz, whose resume includes “The Number on Great-Grandpa's Arm," “An Apology to Elephants," and the “Classical Baby" series, the film will include original songs written by the students about their experience.

Loans? Unpaid Workers Balk at the Idea

Texto completo: The latest advice the Trump administration is giving government employees who are missing their paychecks: Just borrow some money.
Eric Pfeifer, a furloughed United States Forest Service employee, is not really sure how that would work. He is already carrying a mortgage from a new house he closed on in mid-December and had to barter away his furniture when the shutdown meant the government was suddenly unable to reimburse him for moving costs.
"I'm very much in a state of transition that started before the shutdown," Mr. Pfeifer, 38, said on Thursday. "Getting any credit would be complicated, to say the least."
But that was the suggestion of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday, who said he did not understand why federal workers who will miss a paycheck for a second time this month on Friday would turn to services like food banks.
"The obligations that they would undertake -- say borrowing from a bank or credit union -- are in effect federally guaranteed," Mr. Ross told Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times on CNBC. Credit unions serving public employees are offering "very, very low-interest-rate loans" and banks are also willing to lend, he said.
"True, the people might have to pay a little bit of interest, but the idea that it's paycheck or zero is not a really valid idea," Mr. Ross said.
The terms available to the 800,000 unpaid workers can vary greatly: Some credit unions are offering straightforward interest-free loans that will be repaid automatically when workers receive back pay. But the nation's four biggest banks -- Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo -- don't offer personal loans at all, meaning workers who keep their accounts there would need to look elsewhere.
And credit unions that serve public workers cannot necessarily be counted on for low-interest help: The credit union affiliated with Mr. Ross's department -- the Department of Commerce Federal Credit Union -- is offering shutdown loans of up to $5,000 with an interest rate of 8.99 percent. A credit union representative confirmed the rate listed on its website, but suggested a caller speak with a loan specialist to see if the rate could be reduced according to a borrower's circumstances.
A rate of nearly 9 percent is higher than some commercially available loans not pegged to the shutdown. Goldman Sachs, which is making personal loans through its Marcus division, is offering rates as low as 6.99 percent.
The American Bankers Association has a list of more than 100 banks offering special help to furloughed workers, but each institution's offer is different. SunTrust is offering a loan with no interest or payments for 90 days. Alpine Bank in Colorado is offering a no-interest loan up to $8,500 with no payments due until six months after the shutdown ends. Others, like US Bank and USAA, are offering low-rate loans.
Credit unions are typically more generous: Navy Federal Credit Union, for example, will allow workers who have direct deposit to take interest-free loans of up to $6,000 that will be automatically repaid when the shutdown ends. But that offer is open only to existing members who have already set up direct deposit.
The idea of a loan is hard to swallow for some employees. Interest or no, it is an obligation they would take on while uncertain when they could pay it back.
"A loan, even a zero-interest loan, is taking on additional debt based on a hope that someday the furlough will end," said Moses Milazzo, a furloughed employee of the United States Geological Survey whose wife is also a federal employee. "What good is a loan going to do us if we can't make the first payment next month because we are still not receiving a paycheck?"
Some workers said they worried that back pay would not be included in their eventual paychecks, despite Mr. Ross's assurances.
"One or the both of us has been affected by every furlough since the 1995-1996 furloughs," Mr. Milazzo said. "This is the first time we've been uncertain that the government will live up to its promise of offering stability and reliability."
Mr. Pfeifer, who wanted to be clear that he was not speaking on behalf of the Forest Service, moved with his wife this month across the state of Washington, from Walla Walla to Republic. They immediately faced new expenses while still paying down credit card debt: His wife needed to buy school supplies before starting a new teaching job, and her car needed winter tires for the mountain town's heavy snows.
If the shutdown uses up the rest of his savings, he said he planned to "pull out the credit card."
Alecia Lane, a management analyst at the Food and Drug Administration who has been furloughed since Dec. 27, said she budgeted her expenses carefully and did not know how loan payments would fit into them once her paychecks returned.
"That's another bill added that people might not be able to afford," she said.
Ms. Lane preferred a crowdsourced solution: She set up a GoFundMe account. The page, which went up Friday, asks for $5,000 -- the amount she has missed over two pay periods. As of late Thursday, she had raised over $3,000.
Demand for loan programs can only increase as the shutdown drags on. Navy Federal Credit Union said about 100,000 of its 8.1 million members were affected by the shutdown. More than 19,000 had enrolled in its loan program, and the number was rising.
Tynika Wilson, senior vice president for debit cards and funds services, said the credit union had decided to extend its program for a second pay period, but was "re-evaluating and reassessing as things are unfolding."
If the shutdown persists, some of these institutions could end up needing loans themselves.
The U.S. Employees Credit Union, based in Chicago, is offering interest-free loans to the federal workers who make up the vast majority of its 8,000 members.
The credit union has $85 million in assets under management, but as of two weeks ago, the total dollar amount of direct deposits it received had dropped nearly 30 percent.
"We have enough capital to survive like this for another four or five pay periods without having to do some serious borrowing," said Eric W. Stiegel, the credit union's president and chief executive. "We are hoping that doesn't happen."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

New York Times gives friendlier coverage to actual hate group than 'MAGA'-teens

Texto completo: The New York Times must have been jealous that NBC News clinched first place this week for the worst, most egregious reporting on the Covington Catholic fiasco. Because the paper upped its game Wednesday, publishing a cushy profile of the black nationalist cult that helped spark the confrontation last weekend between the Covington teens and Nathan Phillips, a Native American protester.

“Hebrew Israelites See Divine Intervention in Lincoln Memorial Confrontation,” reads the Times’ headline.

The story opens with these paragraphs:

"They are sidewalk ministers who use confrontation as their gospel.
Hebrew Israelites practice a theology that says God’s chosen ones — black, Hispanic and Native American people — have strayed and need to be led back to righteousness.
So they post up on street corners in big cities, usually in predominantly black communities, wearing flashy garb — purple shirts or black robes, for instance. They shout, use blunt and sometimes offensive language, and gamely engage in arguments aimed at drawing listeners near.
“Gamely engage”? "Blunt and sometimes offensive"? Anyone who has been unfortunate enough to have had a run-in with this fringe group knows full well that their version “drawing listeners near” involves hurling racial epithets and other obscenities. They’re real-life Internet trolls, patrolling streets in major cities for victims to harass.

But if you think the Times’ choice of euphemisms for “harassment” is bad, just wait until you read its description of what happened last week between the Black Hebrew Israelites, the Covington Catholic High School students, and Phillips:
The attention-grabbing tactics of five of their followers at the Lincoln Memorial on Friday resulted in spectacular consequences. The fringe theology landed in the national spotlight after a viral video surfaced of a group of black Hebrew Israelites profanely clashing with dozens of mostly white Catholic schoolboys wearing “Make America Great Again” caps. That video emerged only after shorter clips posted online showing a confrontation between the students and a Native American elder initially led to heavy criticism of the students.
“Attention-grabbing tactics,” “profanely clashing” — the Times really doesn’t want to document what was said by the Black Hebrew Israelites last weekend, does it? For the record, members of the black nationalist cult were captured on video calling the Covington students "crackers," "faggots," and accusing them of being pedophiles.

The Black Hebrew Israelites accused the teens of “giving faggots rights.” They threatened the Covington students with violence. They even targeted a black Covington student, calling him a “n-----r” and telling him his classmates were going to murder him and harvest his organs.

The Times report continues: "Ordinarily, those approached by the group quickly rush by. Though they have been name-checked by Kendrick Lamar in a rap called 'Yah,' they have also been denounced by others as a hate group. Provocation is their outreach method of choice. And provoke they did." Oh, they’ve been name-checked by a famous rapper? Why didn’t you say so!

At times, the paper comes close to recognizing the Black Hebrew Israelites for what they are — a bizarre, hateful fringe group – but pulls back just in time to let the cult off the hook.

“If their interaction with the Catholic students seemed like an expression of bigotry toward white people, some of their most vile language is reserved for black people in the communities where they preach,” the report notes.

But then, the Times goes out of its way to include a not-so-subtle defense of the group’s “attention-grabbing tactics,” writing: “That, in part, is because they are trying to get through to them … [One of the men involved in Saturday’s altercation] described it like tough love — calling out black people to try to get them to turn their lives around. ‘Spare nobody’s feelings,’ is a biblical passage he falls back on.”

I see. Calling high school teenagers “faggots” is just some “tough love.”

The Times report also cites the wildly unreliable and hyperpartisan Southern Poverty Law Center, which, amazingly enough, is actually correct when it calls the Black Israelites a fringe “hate group.”

But even after quoting SPLC officials, the Times falls back to its original position of downplaying the reality of the Black Hebrew Israelites, making careful to note that the fringe group is not known to be violent. The Times article concludes with these final lines, which, unsurprisingly, give the game away by revealing the true target of the paper's reporting:
To many black people, Hebrew Israelites are a harmless part of their communities, said Todd Boyd, a professor of race and pop culture at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, one of many cities where the group can be seen working the streets. More alarming to many African Americans, he said, is “seeing a white guy in a ‘Make America Great Again’ hat.”
It’s as if to say: Sure, the Black Hebrew Israelites are widely considered to be a toxic and obnoxious hate group, but these kids were wearing "MAGA" hats. “MAGA” hats! Surely, we all know who’s the real threat here.

You know which other supposed religious group has “attention-grabbing tactics," uses "blunt and sometimes offensive" language, and uses the word "faggot" a lot? The Westboro Baptist Church.

If the Westboros manage to get name-checked by a famous rapper, perhaps they, too, will get a cushy profile in the Times.

Texto completo: Is it true President Trump’s bad habits are contagious? Is it true that his Democratic opponents and, even more, his critics in the press are increasingly given to terminological inexactitudes, if not downright lies?

It sure looks like it. Last week, large parts of the press — we’re looking at you, CNN and MSNBC — were gleefully reporting and commenting on the BuzzFeed story that Trump had ordered his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress.

There were lots of smiles and (if we can use the word to describe liberals) smirks on their faces as they contemplated the ramifications. Some did note perfunctorily that the story was only noteworthy “if true.” Others pointed out, accurately, that several conservative commentators opined that the charge would justify Trump’s impeachment and removal from office.

The fun stopped suddenly last Friday afternoon when a spokesman for Mueller’s office released a statement: “BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel’s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s Congressional testimony are not accurate.”

Time to reprise all those 40-year-old Emily Litella riffs from "Saturday Night Live." In this case, the “never mind” moment came from CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. “The larger message a lot of people are going to take from this story,” he said to two glum panel members, “is that the news media are a bunch of leftist liars who are dying to get the president, and they’re willing to lie to do it.

“I don’t think this is true,” he added, but “I just think this is a bad day for us,” he went on. “It reinforces every bad stereotype about the news media.”

Yup. So does the media reaction the next day to a snippet of video, taken near the Lincoln Memorial after the March for Life, showing Kentucky school students from Covington Catholic High School. They were wearing red MAGA, or "Make America Great Again," hats, facing Omaha Native American elder Nathan Phillips. Multiple members of the media, including some notable conservatives, accused the students of behaving in a bigoted, disrespectful and threatening manner. There were calls for them to be expelled from school and "doxxing" attacks launched against their families. Student Nick Sandmann was mocked for his nervous smile (“smirk”) as Phillips banged his drum just short of his face.

More extensive video, covering as much as two hours at the Lincoln Memorial, told a different story — the opposite story, in fact. (The best accounts to date are two articles by Robby Soave of Reason.) The video made it clear that the Covington Catholic students were pummeled for an hour by vicious and racist comments from four black men calling themselves the Black Hebrew Israelites. And then, amid the hubbub, as the students sang school chants to drown out the hate, it was Phillips who, rather than being surrounded by the students, approached them himself, banging loudly on a drum while making chants of his own. There is no evidence at all, despite multiple videos of the incident, for Phillips’s claim that students chanted the words, “Build the wall!”

Apologies came in from many, including conservatives but also some liberals, who had contributed to the tweetstorm wrongly castigating the students. Many deleted their negative tweets. Others continued to insist that they were bigoted oppressors.

The media responded too, whether out of a desire to report accurately or to avoid a libel action. “Fuller Picture Emerges of Viral Video of Native American Man and Catholic Students,” read the headline on a Sunday New York Times story.

American libel law requires actual malice or reckless disregard of facts by the media before a public figure can collect. But the students of Covington Catholic were not public figures when they gathered at the Lincoln Memorial to meet their bus. And the ready availability of exonerating video suggests that the first accusatory stories were rushed into print, in reckless disregard of available facts.

I sure wouldn’t want to defend such comments before a Kentucky jury.

Anyone reading through the tweetstorms, especially of those who continue to vilify the Covington Catholic students, cannot help but be struck by the visceral and seething hatred of so many in the press for adolescents whose behavior was, at worst, a bit discourteous, but who are guilty of the offenses of being white, male, Catholic, pro-life, and supportive of the current president.

Is this the behavior of a press that deserves to be respected and believed?

Gary Abernathy column: BuzzFeed's travails highlight self-destructive habits of modern journalism

Texto completo: Few consumers learned of the BuzzFeed story from BuzzFeed itself. Instead, they heard or read about it from virtually every other outlet - many of which used the launching pad of "if true" to engage in hour upon hour and story upon story of speculation about what such a development would mean, with many sentences ending with "impeachment."
The reporters who wrote the BuzzFeed story had enough history and credibility that their "bombshell" certainly should not have been ignored. But BuzzFeed is neither The Washington Post nor The New York Times, and its report relied on just two unnamed sources. Until other news organizations could verify the story, it deserved a brief mention on cable news at the top of the hour instead of the breathless analysis and speculation that it received. Using the caveat "if true" did not justify the runaway train that careened down the pseudo-journalism track.
Good reporters are essential for good journalism, but they are only one part of the equation. Good editors - plural - and adherence to entrenched journalistic standards are just as crucial. I doubt that BuzzFeed and many other similar online outlets are able to employ the same level of editorial filters as The Post, The Times or other legacy outlets, either print or television. The solid Watergate journalism of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein was made great by editors such as Ben Bradlee putting the brakes on the zeal of their young and eager reporters, making sure they had what they thought they had before the presses rolled.
Too often, Trump delights in the missteps of the media, but, just as often, the media accommodates him. The BuzzFeed debacle offers an opportunity for the kind of self-reflection and recalibration that has long been needed in the age of Trump - more dedication to fairness and less haphazard, thinly sourced reporting that seems to hope for the worst.
If the BuzzFeed episode does not provide a watershed moment in curtailing journalistic irresponsibility across the board in all things Trump, it is difficult to imagine what would.
Thomas Jefferson famously wrote, "Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter." The biggest danger to Jefferson's preference is not Donald Trump. It is the self-destructive habits of modern journalism itself. That it is better to be right than to be first is a concept that, in the internet age, seems as quaint as Jefferson's quill pen.
All who aspire to be part of the Fourth Estate, by whatever platform their product is delivered, should cherish - cherish - the responsibility it entails. That means fairness over bias, caution over immediacy and trustworthiness over clickbait. It means slowing down and getting it right - something completely at odds with the age in which we live but essential to regaining the public's trust.

South African President Vows to Clean Up Graft

Texto completo: LONDON -- South Africa's president said Wednesday that his corruption-ridden party, the African National Congress, had lost its founding values and now faced a "Damascus moment" in trying to regain the people's confidence and support.
"We have said to ourselves: 'We cannot carry on like this. We have deviated from the values and the principles that have always defined the A.N.C.,"' President Cyril Ramaphosa said in an interview with The New York Times in Davos, Switzerland, where he was attending the World Economic Forum.
"People have lost confidence in us," said Mr. Ramaphosa, who will lead his party in national elections that will most likely be held in May.
Repeating the message he was pushing at the forum, Mr. Ramaphosa said efforts to clean up the African National Congress were already underway. And he pledged to return the party of Nelson Mandela to its past glory.
Revelations from a continuing high-level inquiry into corruption during the tenure of Mr. Ramaphosa's predecessor, the scandal-tainted Jacob Zuma, have led his country to a "cathartic moment," the South African leader said.
"That sort of moment -- Damascus moment for us -- has actually enabled us to get to grip with what needs to be done," he said. He added, "We will be able to turn a new chapter on the life of our country, rid of corruption."
Seeking investments to give a jolt to South Africa's sluggish economy, Mr. Ramaphosa attempted to repair the reputation of his party at the gathering of world leaders and investors in Davos.
Since becoming president last February, Mr. Ramaphosa has been unable to fulfill his promises to deliver growth and more jobs, with his country's economy hobbled by endemic corruption in the government and state-owned enterprises.
In Davos on Wednesday, Mr. Ramaphosa repeated some of the same messages he has been delivering at home in the past year. But the issue is still whether he can deliver on his promises.
Mr. Ramaphosa has started to clean out certain ministries, agencies and state enterprises, removing key allies of Mr. Zuma under whom corruption flourished.
But Mr. Ramaphosa's support inside the A.N.C. remains uncertain, and with just months left before the elections, he has struggled to unite the party behind him.
Though the A.N.C. is expected to win the most votes, it is far from clear whether Mr. Ramaphosa will get a big enough victory to claim a mandate and aggressively root out corruption, as his allies say he wants to do.
For now, several political allies of Mr. Zuma who have long been accused of corruption serve in his cabinet or at the highest levels of the party. And Mr. Ramaphosa's own government has been tainted by allegations of the same sort of self-dealing that led to the ouster of Mr. Zuma.
Most prominently, his deputy, David Mabuza, was a longtime leader of a small province where corruption was endemic. Mr. Mabuza has been accused of siphoning money meant for education and other services to finance his meteoric rise in national politics -- and deliver the votes that gave Mr. Ramaphosa a slim victory in party elections in December 2017.
When an article detailing Mr. Mabuza's rise was published in The Times last August, the deputy president was questioned in Parliament by opposition lawmakers and even criticized by members of his own party in the news media. Mr. Ramaphosa did not comment on Mr. Mabuza then.
Asked about his deputy in the interview Wednesday, Mr. Ramaphosa defended him, though not forcefully.
"None of the issues that have been alleged against him has, as far as I know, been brought to either the police or the criminal justice system," Mr. Ramaphosa said. The country's prosecutors, he said, would act "without fear, prejudice or favor" should such evidence emerge.
"As a leader, if allegations like that are made against you, you want them to be proven," Mr. Ramaphosa said.
But the national prosecuting authority is one of the government institutions that were weakened during Mr. Zuma's presidency. Despite a series of scandals that have rocked the country, few have been held to account for large-scale corruption that has put South Africa's future in question.
At a news conference in Davos, Mr. Ramaphosa said he had "taken steps to strengthen the prosecuting authority."
In recent years, the A.N.C., which once inspired people across Africa and the world, has come to symbolize deep-rooted corruption.
Party leaders have stolen tens of billions of dollars meant to lift up poor black South Africans. They have gutted key government institutions like the tax agency, to gain better access to government accounts. They have even taken to eliminating rivals, in Mafia-like assassinations.
Mr. Ramaphosa acknowledged the slow pace of progress, saying that "things like corruption become a way of life." But he underlined his commitment to deal with the issue ahead of the elections.
"This time we're not just saying it, we're living it," he said, adding, "because if we don't do so, we're going to be punished at the polls."

Texto completo: Jackson Lee denies retaliating against aide who alleged sexual assault
A senior Democratic congresswoman is stepping down as chair of a House subcommittee and the nonprofit arm of the Congressional Black Caucus amid claims that she fired an aide who planned to sue the nonprofit after she reported a sexual assault, lawmakers said Wednesday.
The move, by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.), comes amid a growing backlash after an unnamed woman claimed in a lawsuit that she was sexually assaulted by an employee of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and that Jackson Lee dismissed her when she said she planned to take legal action against the group. The 13-term congresswoman led the foundation at the time.
Jackson Lee has denied through her office that she retaliated against the woman, who was identified as "Jane Doe" in court papers. The congresswoman declined to comment personally when approached by The Washington Post on Wednesday, saying her office would put out a statement.
Colleagues rallied behind Jackson Lee on Wednesday, alternately praising her decision to step down from her leadership roles and declining to discuss the situation with reporters.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) confirmed that Jackson Lee would cede the panel's crime subcommittee gavel "voluntarily and temporarily" and said it did not reflect any culpability on her part.
"I am also pleased that Rep. Karen Bass has agreed to serve as interim Chair of the Crime Subcommittee until the matter is resolved and Representative Jackson Lee can resume the role of Chair," Nadler said in a statement.
Former Congressional Black Caucus chair Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.) said Jackson Lee told colleagues separately about her plan to step down as chair of the CBC Foundation, which she had led since 2017. The decisions were first reported by BuzzFeed and the New York Times.
"I think Sheila made that decision," Richmond told reporters. "The only thing I know is that she made that decision."
The Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, founded in 1976, is a policy organization that works to "advance the global black community by developing leaders, informing policy, and educating the public," according to its mission statement. The group is known for its internship program, which awards semester-long placements in congressional offices to college students and recent graduates.
The Jane Doe lawsuit alleges that the woman was sexually assaulted by the foundation's internship coordinator while she participated in the program in fall 2015. Later hired to work in Jackson Lee's congressional office, the woman claims she was dismissed after four months because she told a supervisor that she planned to sue the foundation over the alleged assault. Jackson Lee had become chair of the foundation's board in 2017 and remained in the position at the time of the woman's dismissal, stated the lawsuit, which seeks damages "exceeding $75,000."
Through her attorney, the woman declined to comment Wednesday on Jackson Lee's decision to step down as board chair.
Pressure started building on the congresswoman this week as women's groups backed the unidentified woman and withdrew support for Jackson Lee as the leader of a push to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.
"While Rep. Jackson Lee has been critical in shepherding VAWA reauthorization during the 115th Congress, The Hotline can no longer continue to support her leading VAWA reauthorization at this time," read a statement Wednesday from the National Domestic Violence Hotline.
Nadler said Jackson Lee would still play a role in efforts to reauthorize the 1994 law, stating, "Collectively, I as Chairman, Representative Jackson Lee, and Representative Bass will continue working together to strengthen VAWA and to reform our criminal justice system."
Jackson Lee had faced no public calls to cede her leadership roles.
Earlier in the day, House Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said he trusted that she would make the right decision but declined to comment further.
"I haven't had the opportunity to talk to Representative Lee or be briefed on the lawsuit, but I'm confident that she will do the right thing," said Jeffries, a member of the CBC.
Requests for comment from Bass (D-Calif.), who is the CBC's current chair, and interim foundation president and chief executive Elsie Scott were not immediately answered.
Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), a CBC member, praised Jackson Lee's decision as courageous and said she could resume her leadership of the foundation board and the House Judiciary subcommittee "once everything is resolved."
"Oftentimes, allegations that are made end up not being truthful in fact," he said. "So I look forward to her having her day in court. We should give her a presumption of innocence. . . . They are simply allegations."
Other members of the group circled the wagons Wednesday, declining to confirm or discuss the news.
"I don't have any comment at this time. We haven't had our board meeting yet," said Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), a member of the CBC Foundation's board.
"I'm not in a position to know much," said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.), another board member, who blamed his busy schedule over the Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend. "I was just telling one of my colleagues that I'm kind of out of things."
Richmond said when asked about the case: "I really haven't looked at it all yet. I've looked at it a little bit."
Rep. Dwight Evans (D-Pa.), a third board member, said that before news of Jackson Lee's decision broke, he had hoped that the process would be "open and transparent," but he said he would need to study the issue further before commenting.
"Let me do my deep dive, and then I'd be more than happy to have that discussion," Evans said.
A day earlier, The Post sought comment from two dozen lawmakers who are former CBC chairs or have sat on the foundation's board. Three replied, all declining to comment.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, is stepping down from her two most powerful roles within congressional and House Democratic circles.
The 13-term congresswoman will no longer serve as the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's board chairwoman and will temporarily step aside from her position as chair on the Judiciary Committee's crime, terrorism, homeland security and investigations subcommittee, according to the New York Times.
At issue is her spring 2018 termination of a staffer known in court filings as "Jane Doe," who alleged that a supervising CBCF staffer raped her in 2015 when she was an intern for the foundation. Doe later went to work for Jackson Lee and claims that she informed the congresswoman's chief of staff that she planned to pursue legal action against the CBCF staffer and was fired several weeks later, according to BuzzFeed News — which first reported last week that the woman was suing Jackson Lee's office and the CBCF over the matter.
The report threw Jackson Lee's status within the House Democratic world into doubt, and several reports have since surfaced stating that CBCF officials pushed to remove her from that post.
The CBCF is a leadership program for young African-Americans that offers fellowships and scholarships. It is closely tied to the powerful Congressional Black Caucus. Elsie L. Scott, interim president and CEO of the CBCF, thanked Jackson Lee in a statement Wednesday.
“We are grateful for Rep. Jackson Lee’s unswerving commitment to the Foundation, and her efforts to help shape and elevate our programming for the last two years as chair, and a number of years as a board member,” said Scott. “The congresswoman values the Foundation’s ideals and does not want to be a distraction during the legal proceedings of the suit filed against the CBCF.”

Texto completo: Veteran journalist Errol Louis is known for his keen interview skills and ability to navigate the often choppy waters of local and national politics as an on-air commentator and anchor of Spectrum News NY1's "Inside City Hall."
But Louis discovered there were also plenty of interesting conversations taking place after the cameras stopped rolling. That was part of the inspiration for his new weekly podcast "You Decide with Errol Louis," which kicks off Wednesday on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, PocketCasts and Google Play.
Louis, who lives in Brooklyn, spoke with amNewYork about what he has in store for his new venture and how he hopes everyone will join in the conversation.
Why did you decide to start a podcast? How will this differ from the interviews you conduct on NY1?
It's going to be unusual discussions with some of the usual characters and then some new characters that people maybe haven't come across who are all involved in the world of politics, policy, arts, culture. ... It's a pretty wide net that I'm going to be casting.
How will these discussions be unusual?
The first conversation is going to be with Maggie Haberman of The New York Times and we are going to talk about a lot of different things, like the fact she lived with her father in Tokyo when he was the Tokyo Bureau Chief for the Times, the way she used to be a City Hall reporter and got assigned to a candidate that she was mad about because no one thought he was going to win, a guy named Mike Bloomberg. Frankly, the same thing happened with Donald Trump. Most of the news organizations thought he wasn't a serious candidate, but you needed to cover him a little bit so they just grabbed some people who happened to be based in New York and she was one of them and now she's the White House correspondent.
Who else do you have lined up?
Patrick Gaspard, who was the White House political director for [President Barack] Obama, the former executive director of the Democratic National Committee, is somebody I met when we were both painfully low level staffers to [former Mayor] David Dinkins back in 1989. We kind of pick of the thread there and talk about the path from there to here. He's got a really interesting story apart from what people normally see in the headlines.
Will the podcast format give you more freedom for discussions beyond the news of the day?
There's such an interesting back story to a lot of the conversations, substantially and even politically. There's a lineage to both the people and the ideas and the policies that we are talking about. ... What I'm trying to do is create a space where we can actually explore some of that stuff. What will typically happen is, depending on the guest, at times I'll have a perfectly good, very interesting timely, newsworthy 12- or 15-minute conversation on the air and then we'll go sit for half an hour and talk about some really interesting stuff that happened, that didn't fit the needs of that particular broadcast. Rather than kind of leave all of that out there, I wanted to be able to capture some of it, put it together and show it to the audience.
You've said you want listeners to become part of the conversation. How can they do that?
People can call and leave observations, questions, their own commentary on a 24-hour line 212-379-3440. ... While it's coming from Spectrum News NY1, it's not limited to subscribers. Anybody can hear it, anybody can forward it, anybody can tweet about it and we want people to do that.

Giuliani Calls Comments On Trump 'Hypothetical'

Texto completo: President Trump's personal lawyer on Monday walked back the timeline he had offered a day earlier on when negotiations ended with Russian officials about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow, calling his comments "hypothetical" and not intended to convey facts.
The latest statement from the lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was described as a clarification of remarks he made to The New York Times in an interview on Sunday, as well as other remarks he made in interviews on Sunday television news shows.
Mr. Giuliani originally quoted Mr. Trump as telling him the negotiations over a Moscow skyscraper continued through "the day I won." He also said that the president recalled "fleeting conversations" about the deal after the Trump Organization signed a letter of intent to pursue it.
The confusion centers on how long Mr. Trump may have known of -- or was apprised of -- discussions about the Moscow tower proposal, which were led by his former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen.
The timeline of negotiations for the skyscraper is important because it shows that Mr. Trump's company was involved in talks with an American adversary for a business deal through the general election, as he was demanding that President Barack Obama lift sanctions against Russia and urging its government to reveal emails from Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee.
Even before the uproar over his comments, Mr. Giuliani told The Times that there were no call logs or annotations about conversations on the Moscow project that would provide accurate dates, and he described the president's legal team as at Mr. Cohen's "mercy." As a result, he said, there could have been discussions to emerge later that Mr. Trump did not immediately recall.
On Sunday, Mr. Giuliani told The Times that Mr. Trump had said the discussions around the proposed tower were "going on from the day I announced to the day I won." In television interviews the same day, he said that discussions about the tower might have continued up until November 2016 -- the month Mr. Trump was elected president.
But on Monday, Mr. Giuliani, in a widely issued statement, said that he was making hypothetical remarks.
"My recent statements about discussions during the 2016 campaign between Michael Cohen and then-candidate Donald Trump about a potential Trump Moscow 'project' were hypothetical and not based on conversations I had with the president," Mr. Giuliani said.
"My comments did not represent the actual timing or circumstances of any such discussions," he added. "The point is that the proposal was in the earliest stage and did not advance beyond a free nonbinding letter of intent."
Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty late last year to lying to Congress about the duration of the Moscow proposal; he had indicated initially that it stopped in January 2016.
It was not the first time Mr. Giuliani has reversed himself in his comments about issues related to the investigation of Russian election interference that is being led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
Last week, Mr. Giuliani backtracked from another surprising assertion that left open the possibility that Trump campaign aides might have coordinated with Russia in its election interference in 2016.
"There was no collusion by President Trump in any way, shape or form," Mr. Giuliani said in a statement on Thursday, reiterating the president's longstanding defense against accusations that his campaign secretly coordinated with Moscow to help swing the election. "Likewise, I have no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign."
He added, referring to discredited conspiracy theories that the president and his allies have long cited, "The only knowledge I have in this regard is the collusion of the Clinton campaign with Russia, which has so far been ignored."
A day earlier, Mr. Giuliani stopped short of defending Trump campaign aides, drawing speculation that he might have inside knowledge of possible coordination with Russia.
"I never said there was no collusion between the campaign or between people in the campaign," he told CNN. He added: "I said the president of the United States. There is not a single bit of evidence the president of the United States committed the only crime you could commit here, conspired with the Russians to hack" the Democratic National Committee.
When Mr. Giuliani was hired last April as the public face of Mr. Trump's legal team, it was part of a strategy to be more aggressive in fighting back against Mr. Mueller. Some of the president's closest allies believe that Mr. Giuliani was effective in helping change public opinion about the special counsel investigation -- at least to some extent.
Since then, however, Mr. Giuliani's statements have included criticisms of the federal prosecutor's office in Manhattan that he once led. That office, in the Justice Department's Southern District of New York, last year secured guilty pleas by Mr. Cohen to a series of crimes, including a campaign finance-related charge that implicated Mr. Trump.
Several people close to Mr. Trump have grown exasperated with Mr. Giuliani's public appearances. They also expressed concern that he is increasing prosecutors' anger with the president and potentially creating a misimpression about the Trump Tower project in Moscow.
Mr. Giuliani's appearances on the Sunday news shows followed an article on the website Buzzfeed last Friday, which reported that Mr. Mueller had amassed evidence that Mr. Trump "personally directed" Mr. Cohen to lie to Congress about the amount of time that the Moscow proposal was active.
The special counsel's office made the rare move of issuing a public statement about the article after it was published, calling it "inaccurate."
A person familiar with the discussions said that Mr. Trump's lawyers sent a letter to the special counsel earlier in the day on Friday asking for a clarification. By then, several Democrats had discussed the prospect of moving ahead with impeachment proceedings if the article was true, creating a heightened degree of pressure on Mr. Mueller's team.
Democrats in Congress are preparing for the possibility of an impeachment case against Mr. Trump once Mr. Mueller completes his work. In the meantime, Mr. Cohen is scheduled to testify before Congress in an open hearing on Feb. 7.
Since that date was announced, Mr. Trump has repeatedly urged prosecutors and the media to investigate Mr. Cohen's family. Lanny Davis, a spokesman for Mr. Cohen, has said his client fears for his safety and the safety of his family amid those threats.

Anthony to Join Bulls, and May Move Again

Texto completo: Carmelo Anthony will finally secure his escape from the Houston Rockets on Tuesday when the Rockets complete a trade that sends the former All-Star to the Chicago Bulls, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.
The Bulls have no intention of playing Anthony but could elect to keep him until the Feb. 7 trade deadline and use him in another potential deal, according to the person, who was not authorized to discuss the trade publicly.
The trade with Chicago, which is also expected to include some minor draft compensation, could not be executed Monday because the league office was closed in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. But the Rockets, as first reported by ESPN, offered an undisclosed amount of cash to convince the Bulls to take on the remainder of Anthony's $2.4 million salary for this season, which will result in a luxury-tax savings of $2.6 million for Houston.
Anthony, 34, has been in search of a new team since Nov. 11, when The New York Times first reported that the former Knick's time with the Rockets was coming to an end after just 10 games together.
Houston formally announced on Nov. 15 that the sides were "parting ways" but has kept Anthony on the roster for the past two months in hopes of trading him rather than outright releasing him, thus avoiding the luxury-tax hit.
Whether Anthony stays on Chicago's roster until Feb. 7 or becomes a free agent sooner than that, his challenge remains finding a team willing to give him another shot after failed stints with Houston and the Oklahoma City Thunder. Concerns about Anthony's defense and his ability to shed his ball-dominant ways of the past and adapt to a catch-and-shoot role have resulted in scant interest in him despite his accomplished résumé.
The Times reported last month that the Los Angeles Lakers, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Charlotte Hornets are among the teams that have weighed but ultimately resisted pursuing Anthony since the Rockets sent him away from the team.
The Rockets spent the weekend trying to find a new home for Anthony via trade to create a roster spot for the veteran big man Kenneth Faried, who signed with Houston on Monday after securing a contract buyout from the Nets on Friday.
Trades can happen on weekends and holidays but only if the league office is given notice that a deal is in the works by 6 p.m. on the most recent business day. As a result, Houston was forced to release the swingman James Nunnally to create the roster room to add Faried.
The Rockets are hoping Faried can help fill the void created by a thumb injury to starting center Clint Capela, who is expected to be sidelined for at least a month after undergoing surgery last week.

Texto completo: On Martin Luther King Jr. Day each year, the nation honors a man who gave his life in seeking justice.
The loss of King -- who would have turned 90 last week -- still reverberates. His assassination in 1968 left us without a towering leader who, using the path of nonviolence and the power of his oratory, turned the nation's attention to racism, bigotry and injustice.
King reminded us that the work of the United States -- the establishment of a nation where "all men are created equal" -- remained undone. The great Civil War had resulted in freedom for the slaves, but progress toward racial equality was stuck in prejudice and backward attitudes.
In many parts of midcentury America, black men and women had to ride in the back of the bus. They could not always vote without fear of violence. They lived in segregated neighborhoods and attended segregated schools. All men and women might have been created equal, but they were not treated equally.
The Civil Rights movement, led by King, sought to change the status quo -- but to do it peacefully no matter the provocation.
In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, a law gained by brave protesters who were beaten and bloodied, one designed to ensure that all people would be treated equally at work and in life. The Voting Rights Act followed in 1965, written to protect all citizens' right to vote. It was still in place until a misguided Supreme Court gutted its protections in 2013.
Fast-forward to 2019 when, in many ways, the United States has fulfilled so many of King's dreams. From 2008-16, the country had its first black president, Barack Obama. Mixed-race families are common. Diversity is prized and encouraged. The country just elected its most diverse House of Representatives. We continue to progress.
Yet, it is difficult not to be discouraged. President Donald Trump has no difficulty defending white supremacists, as he did after their violent march in Charlottesville, Va., back in 2017, saying there "were very fine people, on both sides." His rhetoric about the border wall is clearly designed to turn immigrants into the "other," to be feared and pushed out. He turns Pocahontas, a Native heroine, into an ethnic slur. And he is hardly alone in such statements.
Last week, GOP U.S. Rep. Steve King of Iowa faced consequences -- finally -- for his years of disquieting statements about race. The breaking point came in an interview earlier this month with the New York Times, in which Steve King said, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?" He has been stripped of his committee assignments and could even be pushed out of Congress.
The resurgence of white identity politics and the resulting unease in the land surely would have disappointed Martin Luther King Jr. We can only trust that setbacks are temporary, stumbling blocks in our country's march toward equal justice for all.
On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, do not be disheartened. Remember King's continual call to service. This is a "day on, not a day off," a time to help our neighbors even as we remember his legacy. President Obama, when he was in office and then as a private citizen, always took time with his wife, Michelle, and children to help out. Service at the local level is a positive way to feel better in these unsettling times.
And should you still feel dispirited, find a quotation from King. His words still matter today, especially when followed by action.
Here is one of our favorites, to take you through this day of service: "Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that." Today, and every day, strive to be the light."

Texto completo: Last month, I bought myself a big new computer screen, thinking that if I stopped crouching over my laptop like a turtle, my lower back would stop hurting. It worked great -- for about 48 hours. Then I started getting searing pains in my neck, which prevented me from turning my head to the right, which then almost got me into a car accident. All because, I eventually figured out, I'd positioned my new screen about two inches too high.
The United States spends $1 billion a week dealing with entirely preventable work-related musculoskeletal injuries, many of which are caused by small flaws in body positioning. You can do a surprising amount of damage to your body if you hold parts of it in strange positions for hours at a time, five days a week. But some research suggests that you can also prevent and even reverse damage by engineering your office work environment properly. I talked to experts to find out how.
If possible, invest in ergonomic office furniture.
A healthy workstation is one that allows you to work in a neutral, relaxed position. That setup "requires the least force, the least strength, the least effort," said Alan Hedge, director of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Research Group at Cornell University, "and that means you're putting the least amount of strain on your body."
To get there, you'll want furniture that can be adjusted to your body size and shape -- basically, "the more adjustability, the better," said Justin Young, an industrial and operations engineer at Kettering University in Michigan.
Your chair is especially important. Ideally, you want one with adjustable height and lumbar support, that easily reclines and that also supports your upper and middle back. The seat pan should be at least one inch wider than your hips and thighs on either side, and not so long that you can't sit all the way back without the edge hitting you behind the knees.
Very few people sit back when they work, but they should, Hedge said, because when you recline, more of your body weight is supported by your chair, rather than supported by (and also compressing) your spine. Chair arms aren't essential, but they can support you as you stand up and sit down. If you need a great office chair, check out this guide from Wirecutter, the New York Times company that tests and reviews products.
Desks can be tricky if you're a computer user, because most desks are built at the correct height for writing, not typing. You don't want to have to hunch up your shoulders to type, for example, nor do you want your wrists bending up or down -- an ideal keyboard height is about two inches above your knees.
If your desk is too high, one solution is to get a keyboard tray that slides out from under the desk and slopes downward, or has what's called a "negative slope," because that slope keeps your wrists in a vertically neutral position. A split keyboard, like one of these ergonomic models, can keep wrists in a horizontally neutral position, as well.
As for sitting versus standing desks: the research is mixed on terms of what's better, so it really depends on what feels good to you, Dr. Young said. Sit-stand desks, on the other hand, have the distinct advantage of encouraging you to change positions regularly, which is good for your body.
If the furniture you have doesn't allow you to work in a neutral position, make tweaks with what you have -- create lumbar support with a pillow or pad, for instance. Then ask your employer for an upgrade. The best commercial office chairs are ones that exceed standards set by the American National Standards Institute (A.N.S.I.) and the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (B.I.F.M.A.), and products that do usually say so in their product descriptions. If your boss scoffs at the idea, point out that ergonomic investments yield as much as a 10-to-1 return on investment.
When employees work safely and comfortably, they are less likely to get injured and miss work and they are also more motivated and productive.
Position your gear properly and use smartphones carefully.
Once you've adjusted your work space, don't overlook the tools you use to do your job. The goal is, again, to keep your body as neutral as possible, so adjust your equipment to make that happen.
Is your mouse way off to the side? Bring it closer to your body so you don't have to reach so far. Your keyboard should be set so that the "B" or "H" key is at your midline, and your monitor should be straight in front of you and a height such that you don't have to tilt your neck down or up to see it. (That was my downfall.)
If you frequently look at papers, consider getting a document holder and keeping it close to your monitor so you don't have to move your head as much. Adjust your chair so that your feet are flat on the floor, that your legs are bent at a right angle and that you can work in a reclined position.
Here's a free online workplace ergonomics checklist that can help you get everything right, and Wirecutter has a step-by-step animated guide to properly adjust your office chair.
Smartphones present unique problems. For one thing, they increase the risk for "texting thumb," or de Quervain syndrome, an irritation of the tendon or tendon sheath on the outside of the thumb. Hedge suggests downloading a swipe-to-type keyboard app, which uses predictive text and finger swiping and is much easier on the thumbs. Even better, dictate your texts. And if you talk on your phone a lot, invest in a handset so you don't have to hold it up to your ear.
When you're looking at your phone, don't hold it down near your chest or your waist, because then you have to look down to see it, which strains your neck muscles.
"When you tilt your head down, you increase the effective weight of your head six times, from about 10 pounds to about 60 pounds," Dr. Hedge said. If you have armrests on your chair, prop your elbows on them and hold your phone up near eye-level. If you don't have armrests, prop your elbow against your stomach while holding your phone.
Take breaks and make changes if you're in pain.
Perhaps the most important tip is one we have the hardest time with: take frequent breaks and change your position regularly.
"We say, 'your next position is your best position," said Michelle Robertson, a lecturer at Northeastern University and the director of the Office Ergonomics Research Committee, a group of companies that fund ergonomic research. Sitting for a long time in the same position restricts blood flow and isn't good for your muscles, she explained. You also need to focus your eyes on new objects and distances every 20 minutes or so to prevent eyestrain.
If you start feeling pain at your desk or while working and don't know what to do, consider hiring a Certified Professional Ergonomist to evaluate your workstation (even better, hire one before you experience pain). Talk to your company's human resources department -- they may already have someone they work with.
Also, check out this helpful Cornell guide, "Where It Hurts," which identifies common causes of workplace-related pain. Don't just work through the aches, because -- and I say this from experience -- it will only get worse if you do. But the good news is that small adjustments can make a really big difference.

The I-word leaps from margins to mainstream

Texto completo: Not too long ago, Jeffrey Goldberg, the top editor of the Atlantic, thought that beginning an impeachment investigation of President Trump would be "a formula for chaos - the sort of chaos no fractured nation needs."
But last Wednesday night, the magazine published an issue whose cover was dominated by a single word in huge red letters (roughly 370-point type): "IMPEACH."
A smaller sub-headline previewed the historically rooted 8,000-word argument within, written by Yoni Appelbaum: "It's time for Congress to judge the president's fitness to serve."
With that notable media moment, the I-word seemed to leap across an invisible divide.
The Atlantic article was not the first to make the argument, but its depth and dramatic presentation set it apart.
And suddenly, what was a long time coming had arrived with a bang. The talk of impeachment, all-but-taboo in Big Media's coverage of Trump, had moved from the margins into the mainstream - across the journalism spectrum.
Chris Wallace, on his Sunday show this week on Fox News, was kicking it around with former House speaker (and pro-Trump Republican) Newt Gingrich.
A controversial BuzzFeed News article gave rocket fuel to the discussion - even after special counsel Robert Mueller's office asserted that some aspects of it were inaccurate. BuzzFeed is standing by the story, which says that Trump had directed Michael Cohen, his longtime lawyer and fixer, to deceive Congress about plans to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow.
The subject of impeachment, undeniably, is now on the table in a way it had not been just weeks ago.
Appelbaum certainly wasn't the first prominent journalist to mount the argument.
Early this month, New York Times columnist David Leonhardt made a well-reasoned case in his piece titled "The People vs. Donald Trump."
What are we waiting for, he argued, given Trump's clear unfitness to lead? Waiting for the voters to toss Trump out in 2020, he wrote, is "too dangerous" because of all the damage that is likely to happen in the meantime.
Yes, Leonhardt wrote, one possible cost of impeachment and conviction might be national trauma, but "the cost of removing a president from office is smaller than the cost of allowing this president to remain."
A week or so later, also in the Times, Daily Beast columnist Michael Tomasky seemed to answer Leonhardt, opposing the idea of impeachment because a far better way to "dump Trump" (as the headline had it) is for a Democratic challenger to defeat him in 2020.
In The Washington Post, former CIA director Michael Hayden and former acting U.S. solicitor general Neal Katyal added their joint opinion: that the House of Representatives should begin an investigation into whether impeachment is appropriate, though they "fervently hope and pray that an impeachment investigation would come back with no evidence of crimes or conspiracy."
The Post's political reporter Dave Weigel, meanwhile, tried to do a bit of remedial civics education.
"We went through an impeachment and trial 21 years ago," he tweeted, "but if you asked 100 people I bet a majority still thinks impeach = remove the president. It doesn't! Impeached presidents are 2-0 on not being removed."
No matter what happens next, the Atlantic cover story is likely to get an entry on any timeline of the Trump presidency. Its impact was that memorable.
"There's something to be said for saying a thing plainly," Goldberg told me by phone on Friday, while noting that the piece does not represent the magazine's official stance or endorsement.
Rather, like many a prominently displayed piece (and like Leonhardt's column, which dominated the Sunday opinion section of the Times), it's an argument made by one writer.
Still, Goldberg put the force of the magazine's cover behind it. He wrote in an editor's note that he had come around to the belief that the very process of an impeachment investigation "is actually an antidote to chaos."
"Yoni's view is that we should take the debate over President Donald Trump's fitness out of the court of public opinion and place it where it belongs: in Congress," Goldberg wrote.
Commenters on the right, naturally, saw the Atlantic piece as simply more of the same shameful media behavior, but with a bigger headline - the latest in a years-long journalistic juggernaut against America's duly elected president.
Brian Flood of Fox News, for example, wrote that the mainstream media "continues to lead the charge to impeach President Trump."
That characterization is misleading. It makes no distinction between commentary and news coverage, between discussion and exhortation, between one columnist's view and that of, say, the New York Times editorial board.
It will be important to keep those differences in mind as impeachment discussion and coverage grows.
And grow it will.
Because one thing is clear: As of January 2019, the I-word has moved off the sidelines and onto the field. And it's not going away anytime soon.

5 THINGSNOT TO SAY WHEN YOU’RE BUYING A CAR

Texto completo: Youre test-driving a new car and you really, really like it. The car salesperson senses your excitement and casually asks, So, what do you think? The words I love it! are forming in your mind, but 

If you say this, or a number of other things, youre unwittingly revealing information about yourself. Car salespeople are trained to quickly evaluate you, your taste in cars and your economic profile, industry experts caution. And, as the saying goes, what you say can and will be used against you once you reach the bargaining table.

Eliminating the following statements when you buy a car can help you negotiate a better deal.

Saying this to a car salesperson would give them a hand up when it comes time to close the sale, says Scot Hall, a former car salesman and now executive vice president of operations for Swapalease, which matches leaseholders with car shoppers looking to take over a lease. In any negotiation, you want to be careful of what you say and how you say it.

As a salesperson, youre always looking for a commitment, says Robert Crow, who sold Infinitis for over five years before becoming a real estate agent. Saying you love the car tells them youre committed to buying.

Instead of pledging your devotion, play it cool. Act noncommittal or indecisive when asked for your opinion. After all, you want the dealer to think you can take it or leave it. The ability to walk away from a deal will make you a better negotiator.

This tops Halls list of forbidden phrases. Turning a customer into a monthly-payment buyer is the favorite weapon of car salespeople, he says.

There isnt a dealership out there that wouldnt say yes to any number you name, Hall says  and youll wind up paying more in interest that way. Negotiating on the monthly payment takes the focus away from the price of the car.

A smart finance manager can simply extend the length of the loan until the monthly payment amount is what you want it to be, Hall says. The best protection against this, he adds, is to come in with a preapproved loan. That essentially turns you into a cash buyer at the dealership, allowing you to take dealer financing only if its a better deal.

Telegraphing that your cars lease is ending signals desperation and gives a salesperson reason to ratchet up the pressure, Crow says. Its like saying, I need new wheels or Ill be walking pretty soon, he says.

Furthermore, he adds, it reveals a lot about you: You favor leasing (which dealerships like) and you probably have good credit. It also opens the door for more probing questions designed to tease out even more information  which can provide valuable ammunition to a good salesperson.

The problem with this is that the dealership might be willing to make a better offer. By speaking first, youve lost. Let the person youre negotiating with throw out the numbers first, Hall says. Thats Negotiating 101.

Before you go to the dealership, research the trade-in value of your car using an online pricing guide like Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book or TrueCar. These are only estimates  every car lots trade-in prices vary based on local tastes and demand  but youll have an acceptable figure in mind. Then, when the haggling starts, Hall recommends saying, You guys can go ahead and appraise my trade. Tell me what you think its worth.

Color is huge, Crows says. So if a customer has found a rare color on your lot, as a salesperson you know they have to buy from you  and pay the price you name.

Instead, Crow recommends that buyers try to be flexible and go to the car lot with two color choices in mind. Better yet, look at a dealerships inventory online to verify that they have a car in the color you want before you get there. Then, if youre up for it, Crow says, for fun, let them think theyre selling you on this car by initially seeming neutral about the color.

Negotiating a good deal is all about gathering information and using it to your advantage, Crow says. This is known by negotiating experts as creating leverage you can use to pry a good deal out of the sellers hands. With this in mind, you definitely dont want to go in there and lay all your cards out on the table, he says.

Software is now available that uses artificial intelligence to seamlessly graft publicly available photos onto videos to make it appear that a person is engaged in some activity chosen by the software user. And this technology is so advanced, it's increasingly difficult to spot a fake.
On the political side, we saw it earlier this year when video of Parkland High School shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez tearing up the Constitution went viral. In fact, Gonzalez was ripping paper targets from a shooting range. The Constitution was superimposed.
But on the darker side, any number of pornographic videos are now available with photos of unsuspecting people – famous and not famous – superimposed on actors' bodies, thus giving the appearance that the person in the photo is a willing participant in the film. For celebrities and non-celebrities, the false presentations pose potential career consequences, not to mention embarrassment and humiliation. So is there a remedy for the victims?
The Post article suggests that the First Amendment could protect the deepfake videos, on the theory that the creation of the video is protected speech. But I'm not so sure about that. While the First Amendment offers substantial speech protection, it doesn't protect knowingly false speech, at least when that speech is used to harm another person. That is the fundamental holding underlying the New York Times v. Sullivan case. Public figures can't sue someone for mistakenly publishing false information, but they most certainly can when the material is published with "actual malice" – which by definition occurs when someone publishes material they know is false.
This means that the term "deepfake" in itself should get the victim over the First Amendment hurdle. "Fake" means "false." And the fact that the producer has to use AI technology to generate the video means the producer knows it's false. So the First Amendment isn't on the radar. Which means the victims can proceed on a number of fronts.
There is defamation – does a person's reputation suffer from being portrayed in a porn video? Seems like it would. What about infliction of emotional distress? A person harmed by another's outrageous conduct typically has a civil remedy for the emotional harm caused by that conduct. So is it outrageous to use AI to put a person's face on a porn actor's body? Seems like it to me.
And it is true that getting to the actual producer may be a difficult chore. It's called the dark web for a reason. But assuming a court imposes a judgment – even one against an absent defendant – search engines would likely block the video. And of course there is the prospect of criminal legislation, which could survive a legal challenge if carefully drafted.
Marvin Gaye famously advised in "Heard it Through the Grapevine" – to "believe half of what you see." Given the availability of deepfake videos, we may need to revise that percentage.

Texto completo: The new year is a time for self-improvement. Even if you're a newspaper.
So beginning on Monday, you'll notice some improvements to the print edition of The Columbian. We're also revamping our website; you'll see that rollout later in the year.
The new look for The Columbian has been a newsroom-wide project led by our news editor, Merridee Hanson. It began almost three years ago when she started looking at modern designs for newspapers, such as The Spokesman-Review in Spokane. She formed committees to look at various aspects of design, and these groups met throughout 2018. By the fourth quarter, she had mock-ups for everyone to look at and critique. After a few more changes, she's spent many, many hours developing all of the style libraries and other things needed to carry out the plan. I really hope you will like what you see; I think it looks terrific. It's cleaner and more modern, but without making too many changes that might confuse readers.
In fact, if you like the way things are now, don't worry. Here are some of the things that are not changing: The content. The typeface or type size used for stories. The size of the page. The number of sections and pages we publish. The same commitment to bringing you the local news every day of the year.
Here are some of the things that are changing: The design of the front page, section fronts and the editorial page will look fresher and less dense. Some of the photos, particularly the lead photos, will be displayed larger. We are going to try to get more of the story onto the cover before it jumps to an inside page.
We're getting rid of the blue boxes at the tops of section fronts, and those beige boxes that we sometimes use. You'll often see blue type used in labels, so that you can pick out regular features quickly and easily. Photos of columnists will be oval, like their heads, and not rectangular.
Perhaps our best and biggest change will be to page A3, which we've dubbed “In the Know.” It will contain the biggest regional, national and international stories of the day, the kind that are sometimes crowded into the back of the A section or onto Page C2. Readers tell us they value Washington state and Northwest news, and this display space will make this content easier to locate.
To accommodate the changes a few things are moving. The New York Times crossword puzzle and the People column that now appear in the A section will be moved to Page D2. This gives us more room in the A section for national and international news. Merridee moved the D5 puzzles and TV grid to D4 so that you and your spouse can still work both puzzles at the same time. Comics move from D4 to D5.
To give readers more advance notice of events, our local Life stories will appear a day earlier. Here's the updated weekday Life section lineup: Monday, health; Tuesday, home and garden plus science on the back page; Wednesday, food; Thursday, local life and music; Friday, local life and pets; Saturday, community and religion. (Community was formerly called Neighbors. The content will remain the same, but we think the new name will be less confusing.) Sunday Life content will stay the same, with a local cover story and regular features including an historical photo.
Be sure to drop us a line to let us know what you think: news-comments@columbian.com or 360-735-4448.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Despite internal power struggles, including accusations of anti-Semitism, tens of thousands of activists braved cold temperatures Saturday at the third Women's March to show opposition to President Donald Trump, demand an end to violence against women and push for equality.
Protesters also turned out at "sister rallies" in hundreds of other U. S. cities.
While spirits remained high and marchers displayed determination to fight for women's issues, this year's march paled in numbers to the hundreds of thousands who roared onto the political scene in 2017 in the nation's capital after Trump's presidential election.
The original plans to gather at the National Mall were scrapped because the National Park Service, in shutdown mode, was not able to plow in the event of snow. In the end, organizers shifted the march route to begin at Freedom Plaza, a few blocks from the White House, and head down Pennsylvania Avenue past the Trump International Hotel.
At the rally, participants found their voice on a wide range of topics.
Amid chants of “the people united will never be defeated,” Women’s March co-president Tamika Mallory called on Congress not to pass budget funding for a U. S. -Mexico border wall when she addressed the crowd in Washington.
“I want to tell members of Congress to listen to me very carefully. You will not negotiate on the backs of immigrants, on the backs of people of color,” Mallory said. “We don’t care what you got to offer because our answer to a wall is absolutely not. No questions asked. ”
Nationwide, the 2017 march drew 3. 3 million to 5. 2 million nationwide – making it likely the largest demonstration in U. S. history.
This year, organizers of the Washington March estimated the turnout at 60,000, considerably below an estimated 500,000 to one million two years ago.
Marches kicked off across the country, from Boston, to Los Angeles, to Dallas, Houston, Nashville, and in smaller cities like Burlington, Vermont, and Grand Junction, Colorado.
♦In Montpelier, Vt. , hundreds of marchers turned out on the steps of the state capital, despite 7-degree temperatures, to listen, chant and find common ground for political action on environmental, health and civil rights issues.
Alexis Dubief, of Essex Junction, says Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court was a big reason she’s attending the march. “I’m not over it yet,” she said.
♦In New York, because of internal disputes between organizers, rival marches turned out, one along Fifth Avenue and the other some 50 blocks away in Foley Square.
"Last year we brought the power to the polls, and this year we need to make sure that we translate that power into policy," Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told marchers
♦In Phoenix, where this year's theme is "Rising Together," thousands of people marched in a one miles loop that began at the Capitol. Among the chants: "Tell me what democracy looks like: This is what democracy looks like," "My body, my choice," and "Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go. "
Rallies were also held in almost a dozen foreign cities, including Berlin, Rome and Kabul.
Unlike the first Women’s March in 2017, protesters battled harsh winter weather this year, turning out in scarves and gloves. The cold did not dampen the mood, however, as protesters marched and chanted “this is what democracy looks like” and “women’s rights are human rights. ”
Many also sported the pink “pussy hats” made popular by the first march through the nation's capital.
Winnie Wong, an organizer with the Women’s March, told USA TODAY that the march represents issues ranging from racial justice to healthcare. She cited the women’s agenda, a new platform released by march officials that details their calls for civil rights and liberties, reproductive rights, violence against women and femmes and other issues.
“We will be fighting not just to protect our care, but to move towards universal healthcare, to move towards Medicare for all,” Wong said. “We state very clearly in our agenda that we demand an end to war. We demand an end to imperialism. We demand the ERA be added to the constitution. We have a lot of demands. ”
Stephanie Helton, 52, attended the march with her husband, Joe Helton, 53, from Port Huron, Michigan. She decided to show up immediately after Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation amid sexual assault allegations.
Helton said the energy at the march has been “wonderful. ”
“We’ve been worried about the direction of the country for a really long time, the assault on access to healthcare for millions and millions of Americans, the fact that we have a government that focuses on the issues that degrade members of our society and culture,” Helton said. “So, it’s great to be out here. We have lots of friends at home who told us ‘represent us! Represent us!’”
The Bugnitz family flew from Columbus, Ohio, to attend the march after Sadie, 10, Chris and Kristin’s daughter, learned about the gathering from a teacher.
“It’s really important to our family that girls and boys are all treated equally and we can listen to all voices,” Kristin Bugnitz said.
“A lot of people like Trump are being rude and sexist and trying to make sure that men only have the rights to do stuff,” Oliver Bugnitz, 7, said. “It’s not fair. ”
Noe Torres, came to the march with a group from Los Angeles. He wanted to attend to stand with the women in his life.
“Some of the strongest people in my life are the women in my life: my mom, my sister and my girlfriend,” Torres said. “I want to do my part in helping to undo the systemic oppression that’s keeping these amazing people from flourishing and thriving and doing something for this world. ”
The march also brought out a small group of counter protesters who did attend the march, opposing the event’s stances on civil rights and abortion.
Evangeline Dunn protested at the event for the anti-abortion group Created Equal.
“It’s important to have a presence of the victims at the women’s march, the most pro-abortion event of the year,” Dunn said. “We’ve been engaging with people. The most important thing today is to represent the victims, and we know with this kind of crowd we’re not going to have much dialogue. ”
The movement that galvanized the nation's capital has morphed from a show of force on the streets and sidewalks, into a mobilizing force at the polls.
As the movement has grown into a political powerhouse, it has also run into headwinds in the form of a splintered leadership and accusations of anti-semitism against some of the original organizers.
The controversy, which prompted the Democratic National Committee and other groups to distance themselves from the Washington event, threatens to erode the movement’s gains, or at least slow its progress.
Without the motivation of Trump’s election or the midterms, the marches this year face such obstacles as travel inconveniences from the federal shutdown as well as harsh weather Saturday from the Midwest to New England.
“This is the heaviest lift they’re going to have,’’ said University of Maryland sociology professor Dana Fisher, author of the upcoming book “American Resistance. ’’
“In general, getting people to march in the winter is tough. It’s a hard ask, and right now there’s not an obvious goal, except for perhaps 2020 (the general election). I know Women’s March Inc. says they’re trying to use this as a pivot to start talking about doing more policy-based work, but I think that’s not a good mobilizer. ’’
In some ways, the movement is a victim of its own successes, the power of women at the ballot box — a direct result of the strong showing in the 2018 midterms that sent a record number of women into politics and into Congress.
Women, especially those in the suburbs, helped drive the Democrats’ 40-seat gain in the House of Representatives, flipping control of that chamber. A record 102 women – 89 of them Democrats – were voted into the House in November.
“You can draw a direct line from the 5 million who marched that day and our effort after that to impact elections to the makeup of the current Congress as the most diverse Congress that’s ever been elected,’’ said Vanessa Wruble, one of the leading organizers of the first march. “Already you see the movement shifting from reactive to proactive. ’’
However, with the growth has come distrust and division.
Much of the controversy stems from Women's March co-president Mallory's refusal to condemn Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a proponent of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories who recently described Jews as "termites. "
A detailed story by the Jewish online magazine Tablet said Women’s March board members Mallory and Carmen Perez – whom Wruble recruited to add diversity to the original organizing group of four – confronted her about the role Jews had in oppressing minorities.
Wruble, who is Jewish, was asked to leave the group shortly after the first march, and she told The New York Times her religion was a factor. She later co-founded March On, an organization that provides support and guidance to women-led groups throughout the country, and estimates 50 percent of Saturday’s "sister marches" will have gotten help from the group.
Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-Fla. ), who attended the Women's March in 2017, published an op-ed in USA TODAY on Friday saying that she is "walking away" from the Women's March.
"I cannot associate with the national march’s leaders and principles, which refuse to completely repudiate anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry," Wasserman-Schultz wrote. "I cannot walk shoulder to shoulder with leaders who lock arms with outspoken peddlers of hate. "
Carmen Perez Jordan, a Women’s March organizer, addressed the allegations of anti-Semitism during her remarks to the Washington, D. C. , crowd.
“Over the last year, my sisters in Women’s March and I have faced accusations that have hurt my soul, charges of anti-Semitism and neglecting our LGBTQIA family,” she said. “I want to be unequivocal in affirming that Women’s March and I and my sisters condemn anti-Semitism and homophobia and transphobia in all forms. There is no excuse of bigotry. ”
Fisher said the controversy is taking a toll.
“Women’s March Inc. does not own the women’s movement, and it certainly does not own this march, which has been so much a combination of all of these locally distributed efforts across the country,’’ she said. “It’s a shame all of the bad press is having this effect. ’’
While Women's March Inc. has repeatedly denied charges of anti-Semitism, the issue was further inflamed when Mallory, a Women’s March co-president, appeared on ABC’s “The View’’ on Monday and declined to denounce the frequent anti-Semitic statements by Farrakhan, whom she has publicly lauded.
Women's March Inc. provided a statement about the "sister marches" Saturday, most of which are not affiliated with the group.
“Women's March is an organic movement, made of the fierce energy and power of millions of women and those who support them,’’ the statement said. “We're thrilled to see hundreds of marches sprout up in small towns, suburbs, and cities across America and around the globe. In 2017, we marched. In 2018, we took our power to the polls. In 2019, we're coming with an agenda created by women and for the people. ’’
In addition to addressing violence against women, that agenda includes items such as reproductive rights, racial justice and immigrant rights. The objectives are worthwhile enough for sponsors like the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood to remain on board.
A coalition of more than 100 supporters of the Jewish Women of Color signed a letter standing firm with the Women’s March.
On the other hand, the Jewish Democratic Council of America issued a statement joining the DNC and other groups pulling away from the Women’s March organization, though not the cause itself.

Project Blue Book: The Air Force's covert UFO investigation is brought to TV

Texto completo: In the words of X-Files-assigned FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder: "I want to believe."
Once upon a time, maybe the U.S. Air Force wanted to as well.
In the early days of the Cold War, the skies over the continental U.S. were flush with sightings of objects that led many Americans to look to the stars for answers. The Air Force's own answer was more bureaucratic.
The service began Project Blue Book in 1952 as a systematic study of unidentified flying object sightings. The project was charged with scientifically analyzing UFO data to determine whether UFOs were a national security threat.
Although it was officially terminated in December 1969, the project has captured the imagination of science fiction fans ever since its findings were publicly disclosed. Now, a new generation of UFO researchers may be spawned with the airing of the History Channel's new TV series "Project Blue Book."
The series premiered Jan. 8, and will run for ten episodes in the first season. History Channel described the new show as being "based on the true, top-secret investigations into [UFOs] and related phenomena conducted by the United States Air Force."
In the show, as well as real life, University of Chicago-trained astronomer Dr. Joseph Allen Hynek is recruited from his college professorship to serve as the scientific adviser to the clandestine Project Blue Book.
Hynek also consulted for the Air Force on two earlier UFO investigations known as Project Sign and Project Grudge, which both began and ended prior to Blue Book. In the show, he and his partner, Air Force Capt. Michael Quinn, are summoned to investigate UFO sightings across the country.
The duo quickly find, though, that some encounters cannot be easily dismissed.
The series diverges from historical fact when Hynek begins to suspect that he has been duped by the government into a conspiracy to cover up the truth.
The show is set against the backdrop of the Cold War and the rise of atomic weapons. Each episode in the series draws from the source material of actual Project Blue Book case files, "blending UFO theories with authentic historical events from one of the most mysterious eras in United States history," according to the History Channel.
Still, there is some basis for Hynek's mistrust of the Air Force.
In his 1977 book titled "The UFO Experience," Hynek chronicled a personal shift away from his role as a UFO debunker, the role which he said the Air Force expected him to perform.
Over time, Hynek came to believe that while a great many UFO sightings could be explained as normal phenomena misidentified by untrained eyes, some cases could not be reconciled with known scientific knowledge.
Before the service shut the project down, he reported that he believed UFO sightings deserved more rigorous scrutiny, and that the surplus of reliable witnesses, including pilots and high-ranking military personnel, indicated that there was more than what meets the eye when it came to UFOs.
Regardless of his later beliefs, Project Blue Book officially concluded on a more skeptical note.
Thousands of UFO reports were filed and studied as part of the project. In its final report on Blue Book, the Air Force summarized its findings as follows:
No UFO reported, investigated and evaluated by the Air Force was ever an indication of threat to our national security;
There was no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as "unidentified" represented technological developments or principles beyond the range of modern scientific knowledge; and
There was no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as "unidentified" were extraterrestrial vehicles.
All Air Force documentation pertaining to Project Blue Book was eventually transferred to the Modern Military Branch, National Archives and Records Service, and is available for public analysis.
"Since the termination of Project Blue Book, nothing has occurred that would support a resumption of UFO investigations by the Air Force," the service said in an archived fact sheet on the report from July 2012. "Given the current environment of steadily decreasing defense budgets, it is unlikely the Air Force would become involved in such a costly project in the foreseeable future."
Funny enough, though, the U.S. Defense Department's intelligence arm was actually involved in UFO research at that time.
In December 2017, the Pentagon acknowledged for the first time that a program was established in 2007 to investigate service members' reports of unidentified flying objects. That project didn't end until 2012, though some officials speculated that it is ongoing, according to the New York Times.
The project, called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, had the backing of then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as well as former Sens. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii.
"I'm not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry I got this thing going," Reid said after the project became public in 2017. "I think it's one of the good things I did in my congressional service. I've done something that no one has done before."
One of the most famous of the publicly disclosed videos from Reid's pet UFO project involved footage taken by U.S. Navy fighter jets as they tracked an unknown object maneuvering in inexplicable ways off the coast of southern California in 2004.
The existence of these programs doesn't necessarily mean that UFOs are extraterrestrial in nature. But they do show that the government takes unidentified aerial objects seriously, perhaps worried about the ever-growing capabilities of near peer adversaries — or far.
"Project Blue Book," a TV show based on the infamous U.S. Air Force investigation of the same name, premiered last week.

Texto completo: Each week, the USA Today Network — Florida will provide you with details on some of the hottest acts in the state.
This new feature, called The Hot Ticket, offers the latest on upcoming concerts, shows or ticket sale information from South Florida to Pensacola and places in-between.
We want to inform you about a favorite musician, comedian, play or other entertainer scheduled to perform this coming week with information such as when tickets go on sale for a show and where to find tickets already available.
If you want to find out about a show not listed or when tickets go on sale for performance, email dave.osborn@naplesnews.com or reach out to him on Twitter @Ndn_dosborn.
Cher tops the list for the week with three remaining shows Florida through Jan. 23. The first of four in the state took place Thursday in sold-out Hertz Arena in Estero.
The 72-year-old singer brings her "Here We Go Again" tour to Sunrise on Saturday before heading north to Orlando and Jacksonville next week.
Tickets remain for the South Florida show at the BB&T Center, some for as low as around $100. The main floor near-the-stage seats are going for more than $1,000 each.
She also performs Monday at the Amway Center in Orlando with tickets remaining starting at around $100. And her final Sunshine State show is Jan. 23 at Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, with some tickets for as little as about $40.
Comedian Trevor Noah — known for hosting "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central — brings his stand-up to the Yuengling Center in Tampa at 8 p.m. Sunday.
The 34-year-old South African native also wrote a New York Times best-selling memoir titled "Born A Crime." Tickets start at $31.25 (excluding fees) remain.
If you miss him this month, Noah returns to Florida for a 7:30 p.m. show March 16 at the St. Augustine Amphitheatre. Tickets start around $73.
Tony Orlando — known for a 1970s mega-hit — brings his music and showmanship to the Lyric Theater in Stuart on Jan. 23.
"Tie a Yellow Round The Ole Oak Tree" by Orlando and Dawn dropped in 1973 and became one of the more popular tunes of the decade. Billboard magazine in 2008 ranked it the 37th biggest song of all time.
He also hosted "Tony Orlando and Dawn" from 1974 to 1976 on CBS and guests included Johnny Cash, Charo, Andy Griffith, baseball legend Hank Aaron and many more.
"That was the fun of my life," Orlando, now 74, said in a 2016 Naples Daily News interview of the TV show. "It was very hard. The days would start at 4 in the morning and end at midnight. Every day.
"But such wonderful times. It was like going to a party every day for us. All of our heroes, we had a chance to work with."
Another '70s music star, Gladys Knight, performs in Fort Lauderdale on Jan. 24. She sang hits with her backup singers, The Pips, on tunes including "Midnight Train To Georgia," its version of "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" and "Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)."
Tickets for Knight's 8 p.m. show at Au-rene Theater at the Broward Center start at $34.50.
In Clearwater, the Boston-based Lake Street Dive performs at Capitol Theatre today. The band has a loyal following for its mellow sound, with hits such as "Bad Self Portraits" released about five years ago.
The group has appeared on national shows including "The Colbert Report," "The Late Show with David Letterman," "Conan" and "The Ellen DeGeneres Show."
If you can't make tonight's concert, Lake Street Dive visits Fort Lauderdale's Culture Room on Saturday and Pensacola's Vinyl Music Hall on Monday.
The talented and fun band — named for the many dive bars on a street in one band member's hometown of Minneapolis — also is known for videos it has uploaded to YouTube every Halloween of cover songs from ABBA, Fleetwood Mac and other groups.
Trevor Noah brings his stand-up to Tampa on Sunday.

Texto completo: 86 percent. That's how much the western monarch butterfly population declined between 2017 and 2018, according to an annual census by the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. That puts the population at an historic low. Pair that with a 97 percent decline in the total population since the 1980s, and you're talking about a “potentially catastrophic" situation, biologist Emma Pelton tells The New York Times. Monarchs rely on milkweed, which has been in decline because of pesticide use and urbanization. Harsh droughts have played a role, too. Pelton says the western monarch, famous for its orange and black coloring, could face extinction if nothing is done to preserve its habitat.

Resumen: Kevin O'Brien, who had served as de Blasio's acting chief of staff in 2017 and was then a senior adviser, was found by the Law Department to have harassed two coworkers - but was able to quietly resign in early 2018 and land a consulting job, with his pervy behavior remaining under wraps until now. The lascivious behavior came to light Thursday with the release of a Law Department report that found the complaints substantiated. O'Brien - who had been paid $220,652 a year as one of the most senior officials in the mayor's office - admitted he'd gotten out-of-hand at an after-work-event.

Texto completo: A top aide to Mayor de Blasio who sexually harassed two women landed a cushy spot at a politically connected firm after he was quietly push out of City Hall , the mayor admitted Thursday - nearly a year after the top lieutenant's ouster.
Kevin O'Brien, who had served as de Blasio's acting chief of staff in 2017 and was then a senior adviser, was found by the Law Department to have harassed two coworkers - but was able to quietly resign in early 2018 and land a consulting job, with his pervy behavior remaining under wraps until now.
"The misconduct in this case literally makes me sick to my stomach. Angry does not describe my view. I am livid, I am disgusted by what happened. I am deeply disappointed in this individual," de Blasio said.
But the mayor said nothing about the misconduct for nearly a year - during which O'Brien was hired by Hilltop Public Solutions, a consulting firm with deep ties to de Blasio and whose founder, Nick Baldick, was a close enough adviser to be deemed one of his so-called "agents of the city."
The lascivious behavior came to light Thursday with the release of a Law Department report that found the complaints substantiated. The report was first reported by The New York Times.
"I know today must be a difficult one for the women who came forward and reported this harassment. I want to thank them and commend them for their courage," de Blasio said. "And let me say to them that I am deeply sorry. I am deeply sorry this happened on our team."
The heavily redacted report, dated February 13, 2018, does not disclose the nature of the harassment, but does say that the equal opportunity office believed the two women, but not O'Brien.
"EEO finds the respondent's statement to not be credible," the report, authored by First Assistant Corporation Counsel Georgia Pestana, said. "After investigation, the allegations of sexual harassment are substantiated," the report reads. "Recommendation: It is recommended that the respondent be terminated from employment at the Mayor's Office."
But O'Brien was not fired - he asked to resign, and was allowed to collect months worth of pay in the form of accrued vacation time.
But the quiet departure also meant O'Brien's bad behavior was unknown to his future employers, who Pestana said never called City Hall.
O'Brien - who had been paid $220,652 a year as one of the most senior officials in the mayor's office - admitted he'd gotten out-of-hand at an after-work-event.
"There's no excuse for what I've done - I'm embarrassed and ashamed," he said. "At an after-work event, I drank too much and acted inappropriately. No one deserves to be treated that way. I've apologized to the people I've hurt and will continue to do so because I am truly sorry."
He said he was seeking professional help. "My use of alcohol has led me to make horrible decisions. I'm working every day to be a better person and getting the professional help I need to live a healthier life," he said.
O'Brien was hired by Hilltop in April 2018, the firm said - but is no longer an employee.
"Our firm had no knowledge of Kevin's behavior when he was hired in April of 2018. We only learned about it recently as a result of the Times reporting. Kevin is no longer with Hilltop Public Solutions," Hilltop Public Solutions said in a statement.

Christie abandons Iowa 'friend' King

Texto completo: It was a question that jumped out at me as I read the itinerary for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's trip to Iowa in October 2014.
Why on earth would Christie, who was laying the groundwork for a 2016 presidential campaign as an establishment candidate, headline a fundraiser for Republican Rep. Steve King, an unapologetic extremist who had a knack of grabbing national headlines with his incendiary taunts of minority groups?
It didn't seem like the company that a careful political operative like Christie would keep. After all, Christie's disciplined courtship of Hispanic voters a year earlier contributed to his reelection landslide.
It was a question that gnawed at me enough to take a 41/2-hour ride from Des Moines with another New Jersey reporter to the rural Hole in the Wall hunting lodge in the northwestern corner of the state near the South Dakota border.
As the two politicians stepped onto the porch, I asked Christie if he was concerned that all his hard work cultivating Hispanic support back home might be jeopardized by his supporting the inflammatory King. A year earlier, King made headlines with his demeaning depiction of Mexican teens who developed "calves the size of cantaloupes" from hauling heavy loads of marijuana into the country.
King, dressed in boots and camouflage hunting gear, sharply interrupted my questioning by asking me if I had proof or a tape of his comments. I didn't have them with me, but they had been widely reported. King's tactic succeeded in putting me momentarily on my heels. Christie, meanwhile, refused to put any distance between himself and King.
"No, he's a friend. I don't back away from that for an inch, nor should I, nor has he given me any reason to," Christie replied. "I will be a supporter of Steve King for as long as he continues to be in public life."
Christie apparently had a dramatic change of heart Wednesday, joining a growing national chorus of condemnation over King's most recent inflammatory remarks in The New York Times, in which he said: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
The House overwhelmingly passed a resolution Tuesday condemning King's remarks, a symbolic but rare reprimand. House Republicans also stripped him of his committee assignments, which will leave him little room to wield power in Congress.
Republicans from across the ideological divide — ranging from moderates like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney to New Jersey's conservative state Sen. Joe Pennacchio, R-Morris — have condemned King's remarks this past week. The drumbeat calling on King to resign has intensified, but Christie didn't go that far.
The public outrage from Christie and the rest of the GOP is hypocrisy. King's white nationalist tendencies and race-baiting remarks had been well-documented long before that New York Times interview and certainly known to Christie that day at the hunting lodge.
The GOP was willing to look the other way as long as King was useful. Christie was not the only Republican contender who sought his blessing in the 2016 Iowa caucus. Even Iowa's U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley described him as an "ally" during his reelection race last year.
So why the sudden about-face?
For one thing, the shellacking that Republicans endured in the 2018 midterms has stirred panic in the GOP ranks. Women and moderates in vote-rich suburbs abandoned the party in droves, revolted by President Donald Trump's embrace of white nationalism and harsh, anti-immigrant rhetoric. Even King, who had racked up hefty victory margins since entering Congress in 2003, squeaked by with a 3-point victory over his Democratic challenger last year.
Republicans fear that Trump's brand will permanently become the party's brand. Yet many are in a bind: While they know Trump is the problem, few are willing to publicly confront him. They fear that Trump will retaliate in a nasty Twitter storm, and set his hard-core loyalists against them in a primary.
As a result, King serves as a convenient stand-in, somebody for worried Republicans to criticize without fear of antagonizing Trump — who, by the way, has refused to defend King even though King's early advocacy of a wall on the southern border with Mexico served as an inspiration to Trump.
"This has nothing to do with Steven King," said Larry Sabato, the University of Virginia political scientist, referring to the GOP outrage. "They are using King as a vehicle to send a message to Donald Trump."
Christie's relationship with King was fueled by political expediency and loyalty. The alliance with King began in June 2009, when Christie, a candidate for governor, came under scrutiny for awarding lucrative contracts to private lawyers to oversee court settlements during his seven-year stint as the U.S. attorney for New Jersey.
Some of the work had gone to politically connected allies, including a deal worth as much as $52 million to former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, Christie's onetime boss at the Justice Department. A House committee investigating these so-called monitor contracts summoned Christie to testify.
Christie did not return a call seeking comment. He does have a tell-all book coming out this month. It will be interesting to see if he devotes any discussion to his relationship with his outspoken — and now former — friend from Iowa.

Study: LI's attractions not well known

Texto completo: Most U.S. tourists and business travelers have heard of Long Island, but few know what it has to offer, reducing the chances that they will visit or move to the region, according to a new study.
Long Island had "universal name recognition" among the 1,250 U.S. adults surveyed last fall by the research firm Longwoods International in Toronto. However, only 29 percent of those polled said they "know a lot" about the Island despite 42 percent of them having visited in the past.
The 158-page study, commissioned by the tourism bureau Discover Long Island, was released Wednesday at an event in Hauppauge. The study is based on responses from 200 residents each of Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, along with 250 Long Islanders. About 480 are business travelers.
The researchers found that when tourists and business travelers are told about the Island's beaches and parks, museums, restaurants and other attractions, the likelihood they will visit rose to 65 percent compared with 47 percent when they knew little about the region.
Similarly, the number of people who said they might live in Nassau and Suffolk counties increased 9 percentage points to 43 percent after they found out about the amenities.
Long Island "is an unknown quantity for a lot of people," said Michael Erdman, senior vice president of research at Longwoods. "Once they come here, they have a better opinion of you, a hugely different opinion of you."
Among six communities in the study, Long Island tied with Westchester County as the third most desirable place to visit or live. San Diego was No. 1, followed by Charleston, South Carolina. Rounding out the list were Hartford, Connecticut, and Trenton, New Jersey.
Discover Long Island CEO Kristen Jarnagin said the agency commissioned the study because "tourism is a catalyst for economic development. The quality of life and what people think about Long Island plays into every aspect of business development," she told the audience of about 80 people at the Hauppauge entertainment venue Simplay.
In recent years, well-known employers such as CA Technologies and Arrow Electronics have moved their headquarters from Long Island because the CEO said they didn't want to live here.
Erdman said Wednesday his study shows that executives "are not going to consider coming here, living here and bringing their business here if they won't consider you as a vacation destination."
Responding to the study, Discover Long Island debuted two virtual-reality videos that give close-up views of Old Westbury Gardens, an East End winery, the Long Beach boardwalk, and surfing in that city and in Montauk.
The videos, produced by MacGillivray Freeman Films in California for $75,000, will be used to promote the Island at domestic and international travel shows and at local events. They will be available at the New York Times Travel Show on Jan. 25-27 at the Javits Convention Center in Manhattan and the Newsday AAA Travel Expo on Feb. 23 at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. 
Besides Discover Long Island, the $40,000 study was paid for by the manufacturers' group Ignite Long Island, National Grid, Long Island University, Long Island MacArthur Airport and HIA-LI, formerly called the Hauppauge Industrial Association.

Texto completo: As November and its slight autumnal chill — along with whipping Santa Ana winds, and huge wildfires in the north and the south — descends upon California every year, a state legislator’s mind turns to … well, naturally, to the Hawaiian island of Maui.
That’s where 10 members of the California Assembly and two state senators gathered this past November along with some of the state’s top power company officials at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort. It was four days of mai tais, long walks on the beach and casual conversation about just how much responsibility the utilities deserve for the destruction wrought by the fires that look to have been sparked in several cases by their company equipment.
Dan Howle, executive director and chairman of the California Independent Voter Project, said that no lobbying was permitted and that no specific legislation had been discussed, according to a report in The New York Times.
Uh huh. Perhaps by some formal definition, such as the names of specific numbered bills not being spoken out loud, there might have been no “lobbying” underneath the palm trees. But of course the utilities are trying to influence the politicians. Consumer Watchdog reports that the annual event’s sponsors included Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric, utilities that contributed to the campaigns of between 80 percent and 90 percent of state legislators over the last two years.
Yes, this luau goes on every year and yes, we have criticized its untoward appearance in the past. We understand that the parties that attend the, well, party, who fork out $8,000 apiece to attend, “pay their own way” to do so. For the politicians, that means wealthy campaign donors foot the bill. Donors such as Edison and PG&E.
But as the latter goes into bankruptcy and all of the investor-owned utilities hit the panic button over their current and future wildfire-stoked liabilities, this looks worse than ever. Californians were running for their lives in Malibu and Paradise, and a dozen of their representatives in Sacramento were schmoozing with utility execs, buffeted by gentle trade winds.
The attendees were Assembly members Frank Bigelow, Bill Brough, Ian Calderon, Jim Cooper, Tom Daly, Heath Flora, Jim Frazier, Reggie Jones-Sawyer, Freddie Rodriguez and Blanca Rubio, along with state Sens. Ben Hueso and Cathleen Galgiani.
Defenders of the yearly bash say that, yes, it’s in a nice corner of the world, but that it’s important for lawmakers to be able to visit with utility execs about the issues that concern the hard-pressed industry.
Here’s what Jack Pitney, the former Republican National Committee staffer and current Claremont McKenna College political science professor says: “Going to Maui for a public-policy conference is perfectly appropriate if, say, you work for the Maui County Department of Environmental Management. It does not make sense if your portfolio is in California. . . . There are plenty of conference centers throughout the state. If you wanted to get actual work done, you’d meet in Glendale, where there aren’t many distractions.”
And it’s not just the optics that concern us. The situation could not be more fraught with danger for California taxpayers as the utilities scramble for their financial lives. After the 2017 Maui confab, legislators put forward and approved a bill that allowed PG&E to issue billions of dollars in bonds that would help pay for wildfire damages earlier that year. Former Gov. Jerry Brown signed that bill and then allowed the company to pass those costs on to its ratepayers.
Who knows what utility-backed legislation will blow in from the tropics this legislative session?

Texto completo: You're really sick.
But do you take a sick day?
There are many reasons not to call in sick. Coughing, hacking and filling your cubical with used Kleenex are great ways to show your managers that you put your job ahead of your health.
It's also a great way to contaminate your dear co-workers. When they start dropping like flies, the company will realize how much they need you.
If you do decide to ask for a sick day, how does your boss react? Is the response sympathetic or skeptical? Are you told that management trusts you completely, but just for fun, send in a blood test, an x-ray and a letter from the emergency room team at the Mayo Clinic?
According to Steven Kurutz in his recent article in The New York Times, we are experiencing "The Death of the Sick Day."
It isn't only that bosses have become less sympathetic and more heartless, though, of course, they have. As Kurutz explains, "The shifting definition and expanding mobility of the office -- thanks to remote work and the rise of contractors in the gig economy -- is also making the sick day somewhat passe."
Email, the internet and the smartphone deserve the blame. These techno-tools have untethered you from your desk. Now that you can work everywhere, it's difficult to claim that you can't work anywhere.
"Even if you take a sick day, you're emailing in the morning, checking in later in the day," says Kit Warchol, a market executive at an online coding school, Skillcrush. "It's become more of a norm to write to your colleagues and tell them you're working from home."
The home part of working from home is terrific. You're in your jam-jams. You're binge-watching "The Proposal." You've got a Red Baron Thin & Crispy Pepperoni Pizza in the microwave.
It's the working part that stinks.
As Kurutz rightly points out, your company has certain expectations of a sick person, including "being available to check and respond to email, hop on a conference call and generally be productive, even if you feel lousy."
Even a gung-ho employee like Warchol can run afoul of the working from home option. When she came down with a cold, a few weeks after starting her job, she was "writing in the morning, when I was fully awake and had just taken Dayquil. Then, in the afternoon, I would let my team know ... I was going dark for a bit."
(Clear out the medicine chest if you declare yourself working from home. For you to produce any work while sick will require Dayquil, Nyquil, Lunchquil, Afternoonquil and IDon'tWantToMissEllenquil.)
Of course, your real problem in being productive when you are sick is the fact that you aren't very productive when you are healthy. Announcing that you will be working from home will only bring more managerial attention on how little you do -- at home or at the office.
Fortunately, in more forward-thinking companies, the sick day is being replaced by the "Personal Emergency Day."
With a PED policy in force, you don't have to sell your managers on the severity of your stubbed toe. According to Mark J. Marsen, the HR director for Allies for Health & Well-Being, a personal emergency day means "you're not able to work today because of some circumstance."
"Some circumstance" could be a bad cold or a sick child. It could also be an indefinable feeling of ennui over the bottomless insignificance of your life.
If your managers balk at the idea of using a personal day for personal reasons, explain that disconnecting from your job even for a day will leave you refreshed and recharged, a concept that is held by many workplace experts [well, me.]
Warchol appreciates the privilege "in not having to take sick days because you can work from your bed." In a previous position as a barista, "working from home wasn't an option."
To which I can only respond -- why not?
Replace your clock radio with an espresso machine. If you decide to call in sick, stay in bed and start making triple goat's milk lattes. Drink as many as you need to firm up your decision to stay home -- five or six should motivate you to your mountain bike so you can hit the trails, or to your couch so you can hit the remote.
Above all -- stay healthy.
Being healthy is the best way I know to really appreciate a sick day.

Aide to New York Mayor Quit After Sexual-Harassment Accusations; Kevin O'Brien was allowed to resign last year after two people accused him of harassment; city investigation substantiated their accounts

Texto completo: A former aide to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio resigned from his role last year after he was accused of sexual harassment, then moved quickly to a public-relations firm with ties to the mayor, the city said.
Kevin O'Brien was hired as a deputy chief of staff to the mayor in January 2016 and was later promoted to a role as senior adviser, working on initiatives throughout City Hall.
Two people made sexual-harassment complaints against him in February 2018, according to a city Law Department document obtained through a Freedom of Information Law request.
An investigation by the Law Department substantiated the accusers' accounts, the document says. The Law Department found that Mr. O'Brien's account of the incident was unsubstantiated, according to the document. The document was heavily redacted and didn't identify the two accusers.
Mr. O'Brien, 36 years old, said in a statement Thursday that he drank too much at an after-work event and acted inappropriately.
"There's no excuse for what I've done--I'm embarrassed and ashamed," he said. "No one deserves to be treated that way. I've apologized to the people I've hurt and will continue to do so because I am truly sorry."
The mayor's office revealed the circumstances surrounding Mr. O'Brien's departure Thursday after they were reported by the New York Times.
Last year, Mr. O'Brien was told he would be terminated, according to Georgia Pestana, the first assistant corporation counsel at the city's Law Department, who was in charge of the investigation.
Mr. O'Brien asked if he could quit and the Law Department decided to let him resign in lieu of termination, Ms. Pestana said at a press conference Thursday. She said allowing him to resign prevented him from challenging the firing, which could have resulted in a possible hearing that could identify his victims.
"You need to balance the fact that women would be deterred from coming forward if we did not honor their request for confidentiality," she said. "The privacy interest for these women was paramount."
The mayor said the misconduct sickened him and apologized on behalf of the city for his former staffer's actions.
"I am livid, I'm disgusted by what happened, I am deeply disappointed in this individual," Mr. de Blasio said. "The standards for people in public service should be higher than anywhere else and we have no tolerance for people who abuse their positions."
After resigning in February 2018, Mr. O'Brien was hired in April 2018 by Hilltop Public Solutions, a PR firm founded by Nicholas Baldick, an ally of Mr. de Blasio.
Mr. O'Brien is no longer with the company after taking a leave, Hilltop said Thursday. "Our firm had no knowledge of Kevin's behavior when he was hired," the company said.
Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Pestana said the firm didn't ask for a reference check when hiring Mr. O'Brien; his resignation circumstances would have raised a red flag, they said.
The mayor and Hilltop have long had a close relationship. Some of the firm's staffers previously worked for the mayor, and Mr. Baldick was an "agent of the city," a term Mr. de Blasio coined in 2016 to describe a close group of nongovernmental allies who worked with him.
Mr. O'Brien was allowed to resign with his accrued annual leave pay as part of a city executive order dating to 1988, according to Ms. Pestana. City records show Mr. O'Brien made $220,000 annually.
Taking that benefit away would have required a hearing that could have exposed the women, she said.

How to Sift Through a Cornucopia of TV Shows

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Aisha Harris, assistant TV editor for The Times, discussed the tech she's using.
What's your setup for watching the TV shows or movies you review? What could be better about it?
Much of my TV and movie consumption for work involves screeners, which are sent out to the press ahead of release. For TV, these screeners are almost always in digital form, via the network's press site or a link sent by email, so I usually watch those on my laptop. On the rare occasion I'm not feeling too lazy -- or if it's a show, like "Homecoming," that really rewards viewing on a bigger screen -- I'll hook up my laptop to my TV. If I'm unable to attend a press screening in person for a movie I'm reviewing, I'll review the DVD at home on my TV.
My fiancé and I recently upgraded our home entertainment setup, with a 50-inch 4K Amazon Fire TV. We also own a Sonos soundbar and a two-room Sonos Play:1 wireless speaker set that sounds incredible.
The only downside is that the wireless speakers have been cutting in and out for some time when paired with our TV. Troubleshooting on our own thus far hasn't yielded great results, and the tech support hours coincide with when we're at work. It's a fairly common problem, according to the multiple message boards I've stumbled upon, so I'm hoping someone can help us find a quick, easy solution soon.
How has your setup for watching TV and movies changed over time?
When I moved to New York in my early 20s for graduate school, my roommates and I had a common area with a TV, but I rarely used it. I was the millennial who saw no need for cable anymore once I could stream almost everything I wanted, and I was content viewing primarily on my laptop. With rare exception, I never had time for or cared enough to watch shows while they aired live, so finding it online later was my go-to.
I still don't have cable, but I do have pretty much every major streaming service there is -- Netflix, Hulu Live (which is basically cable), HBO, Showtime, Amazon and, once upon a time, FilmStruck (R.I.P.).
Streaming services like Netflix and Hulu give you tons of options for programs to watch. The downside is that it feels impossible to decide what to watch. How do you pick a program to watch?
The short answer: I keep a running list of movies and shows I want to eventually see on my Notes app (it's very long and never-ending), and when I'm able to watch something that isn't directly work related, I consult the app and choose whatever fits my mood.
The long answer is that often none of the titles on said list fit my mood in the moment. This conundrum is almost as maddening to me as having a case of severe writer's block. To put it bluntly: There have been times when, after flipping through the various services and perusing the latest "new to streaming" articles online, I suddenly look at the clock and realize that 90 minutes have passed. I've watched nothing! I could have had a brand-new movie viewing experience in that time. Or binged approximately four episodes of "30 Rock."
Actually -- almost as embarrassing as wasting so much time merely trying to decide what to watch is the fact that I usually wind up just rewatching something I've already seen a million times, like "30 Rock" or "The Twilight Zone."
Related: How do you determine which shows or movies are worth writing about?
The "worthiness" of a show or a movie when it comes to coverage can be baked in: the names involved, the subject matter (Is it adapted from a wildly popular book series? Are our writers and critics excited about it?), the network or platform it's appearing on. Social media plays a part, too, however -- if something not initially on my radar is getting a lot of buzz on Twitter, I'll at minimum check it out and see what it's all about.
In the past, cord-cutting was an impractical option because people missed out on live sports or broadcast news. What's the situation today?
I have zero interest in live sports or broadcast news -- I get most of my news from online and via my daily RSS feed. (I've been using Feedly for years.) But it seems absolutely possible to not have cable and still be a sports fan and news junkie, especially because of Hulu Live or digital media players like Amazon Fire and Roku. Of course, you just wind up substituting one cord for a bunch of separate cords in this case -- I'm probably paying nearly the same amount I would be if I had a cable bundle.
Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?
A recent addition to my home is the Eufy RoboVac 30C. We have hardwood floors and a dog that sheds, which has made keeping the floor relatively clean a nearly impossible task. But this has done a good job reducing the amount of dust I find on the bottom of my socks.
I'm fairly certain it's listening in on our conversations, and my dog scampers to the other side of the room or jumps on our bed when it passes near her, but I love it.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- Even when Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, is not attacked by suicide bombers, it is often gripped by gun-toting crime syndicates that receive protection from the country's elite.
If the national government cannot prevent chaos in the seat of its power, many are left wondering, how can it stand against an insurgency in far-flung and remote corners of the country?
"The people's concerns in society, particularly in big cities, also stem from thuggish groups who talk of force, who break the law, who have irresponsible armed militias," Lt. Gen. Sayed Mohammad Roshandil, the Kabul police chief, said in an interview with The New York Times.
Under a new interior minister, Amrullah Saleh, and an earlier influx of new security commanders, including General Roshandil, the authorities have begun a concerted effort to restore order in Kabul and to reinforce police forces that have been crushed by record casualties and weakened by a reputation for corruption, abuse and acting as the extended arm of warlords as well as the elite.
Last fall, police and intelligence forces began a major push against Islamic State and Taliban cells in and around Kabul. The campaign has been credited by American and Afghan officials with reducing the number of attacks, though insurgents still manage to sneak in large amounts of explosives for truck bombs and daring raids.
Now, the police forces are focused on dismantling what they call a "pyramid of crime" in the capital.
Officials say they have identified about 1,500 people in the city who are suspected of criminal activity, and who are thought to own a total of nearly 30,000 illegal arms. And they have begun dismantling the pyramid from the bottom, making their way toward the powerful few at the top.
"This pyramid of crime that exists, we are hitting its base so those at the top crumble with it," General Roshandil said. "The people no longer have patience for this."
A new nationwide order bans anyone but military, interior or intelligence officials from being trailed on the roads by pickup trucks filled with highly visible armed guards, as powerful people in the capital and beyond have long done.
The local police have said that they will use whatever force is necessary to fight the crime syndicates and that special forces are ready to assist. In the first days after the order took effect, police officers seized vehicles belonging to one of the country's vice presidents as well as to powerful members of Parliament -- moves that would have been unthinkable until recently.
Such initiatives have created a rare sense of optimism in Kabul, leading some to hope that a police force many had given up on may somehow be reinvigorated and armed to stand up to the local mafia as much as to insurgents.
General Roshandil, a 14-year veteran of the country's special forces, was appointed to lead the Kabul police in September, when deadly attacks were frequent and the city had been turned into a front line of the country's long war. Aided by a new intelligence chief for the city who had similar counterterrorism experience, and with the support of American advisers, local forces carried out raids to disrupt terrorist cells in Kabul and surrounding areas.
Much of the recent optimism also stems from the appointment last month of Mr. Saleh as interior minister, and from his immediate push to bolster and uplift a national police force that lost about 19,000 men across the country in the past four years alone. A former intelligence chief, Mr. Saleh has vowed to minimize the influence of warlords and local elites over the police and to drive out corruption among its forces.
While the measures he has introduced have been widely welcomed in Kabul, many observers and residents say that combating the rot will require far deeper changes.
"Since last week, public opinion has changed. People are optimistic, and they believe that it is possible to change the situation," said Wazhma Frogh, the executive director of the Women and Peace Studies Organization.
But if the crackdown is not sustained and criminals weather a brief wave of pressure, she warned, they could emerge further emboldened.
Mohammad Zahir, 26, a baker in Kabul City, said of the new interior minister: "When you are new in a position, you are energetic and excited, but time will show whether he was showing off or he was serious. But in one or two weeks, the situation is a bit changed in Kabul. Criminals are afraid of him because some powerful men were arrested."
Among those who have been apprehended in the past week are a militia commander accused of having 100 illegal weapons, a parliamentary candidate accused of building illegal high rises by force, and a Parliament member's brother who is accused of extortion.
But it hasn't been all smooth. One suspect, Abdul Hamid Khurasani, confronted the police when they sought to arrest him at the offices of his political group, bringing the northern Kabul neighborhood to a standstill, and then managed to flee with support from elements inside the police and local strongmen who came to his aid.
Since then, videos have emerged of Mr. Khurasani casting himself as a fighter for justice who is being victimized by Mr. Saleh, whom he accuses of being a spy for the C.I.A.
In photos recently circulated, Mr. Khurasani is posing in fatigues with a copy of a book called "Introduction to the Science of Politics," his Kalashnikov and military radio next to him. Large posters of the late dictators Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya are behind him. The Interior Ministry says that Mr. Khurasani is being pursued and has been placed on a no-fly list, and that his accounts, if he has any, will be frozen.
Mr. Saleh has told his staff members that he wants to set new standards of professionalism that will hold police forces accountable in the future.
At the same time, he has vowed to protect them from members of the elite, such as lawmakers and warlords, who have long wielded influence over police promotions and demotions as a blanket of impunity for their crimes.
In Kabul, Mr. Saleh has released the names of suspects in batches, moving from the lowest layer of the crime pyramid toward the top, giving suspects ultimatums to surrender and answer the accusations against them. Special commandos have been put on alert, ready to provide support if police officers face resistance in their work.
"The same police that wouldn't stand up to the thugs yesterday, or would move aside under the slightest pressure, they are standing up now, without any new increase in numbers, without any new training," General Roshandil said. "They are creating the hope."
"The expectations that have been created for the people -- we want to turn that into a belief," he said. "And we want to do it with the same police force that wasn't counted on until yesterday."

More Are Deemed 'Essential' to Get Parts of Government Moving Again

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- As the government shutdown stretches into its fourth week, the Trump administration is reinterpreting longstanding rules to open the federal government piece by piece, forcing thousands of workers to report to work without pay, many of them in sectors that could minimize damage to the president's base.
Federal farm service offices will open to help farmers and ranchers. With tax season underway, the Internal Revenue Service is calling more than half of its 80,000 employees back to work. Thousands of furloughed safety inspectors have been told to report to airports and runways. And dozens of Interior Department employees will head to the country's coastline to sell oil and gas leases.
"It's time for the Democrats to negotiate," Russell T. Vought, the acting director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget who helped lead the effort to recall I.R.S. employees, recently said. "In the meantime, we will make this shutdown as painless as possible, consistent with the law."
That last phrase -- consistent with the law -- has proved crucial for a team of 12 lawyers working under Mr. Vought. In past shutdowns, only workers deemed "essential" to protecting life and property -- a category that would include people like Secret Service agents -- were allowed to work.
But the budget office is now focused on Justice Department guidance, issued by previous administrations, that would broaden who is considered essential, using lesser known exceptions to call back thousands of employees to perform duties like preparing taxes or opening mail.
A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said lawyers were relying on guidance issued during past shutdowns, including a Clinton-era contingency plan that allows exceptions for workers whose duties do not rely on yearly appropriations.
After using this rationale to bring back tax workers, lawyers at the budget office are now reviewing requests to reopen parts of the government agency by agency, according to Trump administration officials. That would essentially reverse how previous administrations interpreted the rules as lawyers look to minimize the effect of a protracted shutdown that the president has no plans to end, the officials said.
Critics said the Trump administration was building a specious legal case that interprets an exception to the law in the broadest possible terms. Its actions have already drawn at least five lawsuits from labor groups representing thousands of federal employees, including the I.R.S. and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
Gregory O'Duden, the general counsel of the National Treasury Employees Union, which has sued the administration on behalf of 70,000 of the I.R.S.'s work force of 80,000, accused administration officials of manipulating laws to keep Americans happy and score political points.
"A law that was intended to be a narrow exception they're treating as a wide open path for them to run through," Mr. O'Duden said. The White House, he said, "has concocted what we think is an untenable rationale that will require tens of thousands of employees to come back and not be paid."
Former administration officials who have examined the same sets of rules in previous shutdowns -- and landed on different interpretations -- are puzzled by the White House's actions.
John A. Koskinen, who retired as I.R.S. commissioner in 2017, questioned whether the efforts violated the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits the government from spending money for any reason that Congress has not appropriated. He suggested that the Office of Management and Budget was using a loose interpretation of government regulations that say unfunded government operations could only continue during a shutdown if needed to "protect life and property."
"What they're doing is trying to eliminate as much of the backlash against the shutdown as they can," said Mr. Koskinen, who was the point person at the budget office during the 1995 shutdown. "There's nothing wrong with that, theoretically, as long as you're doing it according to what is legal."
Mr. Koskinen said that it was possible the administration would argue that tax refunds were a "continuing appropriation," but that it would be hard to make the case that taxpayers face real hardship if their refunds are delayed, as they are with Social Security payments.
That is exactly the comparison Trump administration officials say they are trying to make in enforcing their own contingency plan.
In some cases, the administration has said that essential duties can now include opening mail: On Wednesday, the Agriculture Department said that it would reopen Farm Service Agency offices for three days to provide "limited services" to farmers and ranchers who needed assistance processing farm loans. The 2,500 workers will also help open mail to identify important items. (They will not have to work on Martin Luther King's Birthday, according to the agency.)
The I.R.S. remains the most prominent example, as the Treasury Department updated its shutdown contingency plans this week and recalled more than 40,000 employees to process refunds at the tax collection agency. The I.R.S., which is already understaffed, is three months away from Tax Day, when millions of American will be grappling with how to file under the new tax law.
This maneuver directly reverses actions taken during previous administrations. A letter sent by the Treasury Department to lawmakers on Capitol Hill and reviewed by The New York Times pointed out that the Obama administration had been told by budget office lawyers that such a step could not be taken.
"Although in 2011 the Office of Management and Budget directed the I.R.S. not to pay funds during a lapse," the letter read, "O.M.B. has reviewed the relevant law at Treasury's request and concluded that the I.R.S. may pay tax refunds during a lapse."
The Trump administration has also faced criticism for recalling clerks to the I.R.S. to process tax transcripts that home buyers need to verify their income. The decision came after an intense lobbying campaign by the mortgage lending industry.
Former government officials said the actions seemed politically motivated, as the administration tries to prevent Americans who rely on the federal government from feeling the shutdown's pain.
"This is going on so long that the political pressure and the hardships are really starting to mount and rather than sticking to the rules, they are clearly relaxing them for political purposes," said G. William Hoagland, a former Republican staff director on the Senate Budget Committee.
And efforts to mitigate the effect of the shutdown could actually serve to extend it by reducing the political costs of inaction.
Alice Rivlin, who served as the budget director under President Bill Clinton, noted that President Trump was taking the opposite tack than the one that her administration had during the shutdown of 1995 and 1996 that was incited by a fight over which economic forecasts would be used for budgeting.
"We wanted people to notice that they weren't getting government services to put pressure on Congress to get something done," Ms. Rivlin said. "This seems to be a different approach -- letting it be as easy as possible so there won't be much protest."
A federal judge on Tuesday denied a request to issue an injunction or temporary restraining order to stop the Trump administration from calling back workers whose jobs are not related to the health and safety of Americans, but said that he would hear arguments at the end of the month.
In the meantime, the president signed legislation on Wednesday promising that workers would be repaid.
Shortly after, in a list of talking points the White House circulated to supporters, officials wrote that the administration was "expanding the use of funds not appropriated through annual appropriations" to provide services to farmers, and framed the I.R.S. recall as a success compared with the Obama administration.
"Unlike the 2013 shutdown," according to the email, which was reviewed by The Times, "the Trump administration will still process tax refunds."
In that email, the White House made no mention of the people who will be doing the work.

Texto completo: John Falsey the co-creator of multiple acclaimed television shows including "Northern Exposure" and "St. Elsewhere" and a University of Iowa Writers' Workshop graduate, died earlier this month in Iowa City.
Falsey died at 4:56 p.m. Jan. 3 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, according to Johnson County Medical Examiner's office administrative director Clayton Schuneman. He died of blunt force trauma to the head, and his death was ruled an accident. He was 67.
Falsey's brother James told The New York Times last weekend that he died due to injuries sustained during a fall at his Iowa City house. They reported that Falsey had been living in town for the past five years and was writing short stories and a novella.
He was also set to executive produce a new revival of his beloved comedy drama "Northern Exposure," as reported by Variety last November.
Through his work creating, writing and producing television in the 1980s and 1990s, Falsey's shows were praised for mixing eccentric wit and characters with stirring drama that proved to be both critically acclaimed as well as popular.
Along with his creative partner Joshua Brand, Falsey won three Emmy Awards. In 1992, he won for Outstanding Drama Series as a producer of "Northern Exposure," along with Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries or Special for "I'll Fly Away." He and Brand also won an Emmy for Outstanding Miniseries for "A Year in the Life" in 1987.
Falsey graduated from the Iowa Writer's Workshop in 1978, during an era of the workshop that featured the likes of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jane Smiley, science fiction master Joe Haldeman and other Iowa literary luminaries.
Soon after, he started a writing job for "The White Shadow," the Emmy-winning drama starring Ken Howard as a white, former professional basketball player coaching a mostly black city high school.
After "The White Shadow" ended, Falsey and Brand created the medical drama "St. Elsewhere." The show, one of the most acclaimed television dramas of the 20th century, would go on to win 13 Emmy Awards, launched the careers of actors like Denzel Washington and Mark Harmon and showcased one of the most talked-about, and controversial, series finale endings in television history.
The series ended with the titular hospital being shown inside of a snow globe.
TV and film critic Matt Zoller Seitz wrote last year on the 30th anniversary of the "St. Elsewhere's" finale that the show "wove in commentary on the process of writing, producing and airing a television show, and sometimes characters would round a corner and come face-to-face with a metaphor for the creative process." The show ran from 1982 to 1988.
In 1990, Falsey and Brand created "Northern Exposure," a seven-time Emmy Award-winning comedy and drama show centering on a recently graduated doctor who set up his practice in the small fictional town of Cicely, Alaska. The show ran from 1990 to 1995.
Both "I'll Fly Away" and "Northern Exposure" were co-produced by David Chase. Four years after the Alaska-set show ended, Chase created HBO's defining drama "The Sopranos." Fellow UI graduates Robin Green and Mitchell Burgess would go on to win numerous Emmy awards for their work on the hit mafia drama.
Falsey later co-created and produced the Steven Spielberg-backed anthology show "Amazing Stories." The last show Falsey produced was "Providence," a family drama that ran from 1999 to 2004.
Falsey was born in New Haven, Connecticut and graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1975.

Texto completo: If you had 72 days and $100 million to throw a party, how would you spend it?
It might sound like a daunting task, but President Donald Trump's inaugural committee pulled it off. And a new report from The New York Times lays out how they did it.
Overall, donors shelled out $107 million for Trump to ascend to the presidency in style, and his party planning committee put all of it to use, according to the Times.
The bulk of it went to vendors like hotel chains and to payroll. But here is a rundown of some of the spending highlights from the Times' report:
$5 million to charity, which organizers told the Times was a new record
$10,000 on makeup for 20 aides
$30,000 per diem payments to dozens of staff members
$1. 5 million to Trump International Hotel for use of a ballroom and other spaces
$6. 5 million to book hotel room blocks, only half of which were used
$1. 6 million to Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a friend of Melania Trump's, for a supervisory fee
Wolkoff joined Jonathan Reynaga, another friend of the Trumps, to form WIS Media Partners, which handled the inaugural broadcast rights and the production of a documentary about the inaugural that was never completed, the Times reported.
WIS Media Partners ended up helping to oversee much of the event planning. The group was paid a total of $26 million, which mostly went to subcontractors and other vendors.
Steve Kerrigan, the chief of staff for former President Barack Obama’s first inaugural committee, told the Times that the $1. 6 million "supervisory fee" paid to Wolkoff was "outrageous. "
"I have never heard anybody getting that kind of fee associated with any inaugural, ever," Greg Jenkins, who was the executive director for former President George W. Bush's second inaugural, told the Times.
Federal prosecutors are reportedly looking into the money raised by the inaugural committee. Although the spending does not appear to be at issue, according to the Times, the source of the donations is being scrutinized, particularly for foreign contributions, which would be illegal under U. S. law.
Multiple media reports said the probe into the inaugural funds was spurred, at least in part, by a conversation Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen taped between himself and Wolkoff in which she expressed concerns about the money.
The inaugural committee has said it acted in "full compliance with all applicable laws" and that all the donors were all vetted.

'I NEVER WORKED FOR RUSSIA'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Monday asserted that he "never worked for Russia" and called FBI officials who reportedly opened a counterintelligence investigation into his relationship with Moscow "dirty cops."
"I never worked for Russia," Trump told reporters at the White House before departing for New Orleans to speak at the Farm Bureau Federation's annual convention. "Not only did I never work for Russia, I think it's a disgrace that you even asked that question because it's a whole big fat hoax."
Trump was responding to questions about a New York Times article published Friday that indicated the FBI opened a probe in 2017 to examine whether the president was beholden to the Kremlin or working on behalf of Russia against American interests. 
The counterintelligence investigation was launched following Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey, and was meant to explore in part whether Trump's actions amounted to obstruction of justice or a national security threat. The investigation has since been taken over by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as part of his broader probe into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
On Saturday, Trump deflected when asked whether he worked on behalf of Russia during a televised phone interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked," Trump told Pirro, without flatly denying his involvement with Russia.
Facing scrutiny over his initial response, Trump pushed back against the Times report on Monday, telling reporters his firing of Comey was "a great service for our country," and describing those who launched the investigation as "dirty cops" and "scoundrels."
The president also dismissed  as "fake news" a Washington Post article published on Saturday that detailed his efforts to conceal his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump, according to the Post, demanded his interpreter hand over her notes and told the interpreter not to share what was discussed with other administration officials.
Asked if he would be willing to share his interpreter's notes - which is routinely done among administration officials following such high-stake meetings with foreign leaders - Trump did not answer the question directly, instead describing his meetings with Putin as "very successful."
"I have those meetings one-on-one with all leaders including the president of China, including prime minister of Japan," Trump said. "We have those meetings all the time. No big deal."
Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee told CNN on Monday that the committee "may have no choice" but to subpoena the interpreter's notes. 
Engel said in the coming months, the committee "will be holding hearings on the mysteries swirling around Trump's bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies, and how those dark dealings affect our national security."

Pompeo presses Saudi prince on slaying; Secretary of State seeks accountability in the Khashoggi case.

Texto completo: Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo on Monday pressed the Saudi crown prince to hold accountable "every single person" involved in the killing of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but he reported no progress in the case that has strained U.S. relations with the desert kingdom.
"Our expectations have been clear from early on," Pompeo said. The Saudi leadership reiterated its commitment to punishing the killers, Pompeo said, but still has to "work through a fact process."
More than 100 days have passed since Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, and many critics, journalist advocates and human rights activists have accused Riyadh of designating a handful of scapegoats but avoiding blaming the masterminds. The U.S. intelligence community concluded that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, probably ordered the killing.

But the Trump administration has made clear that it values the U.S.-Saudi relationship, including lucrative arms deals, over an individual human rights case.
Pompeo met with Mohammed, much of it one on one, for about 45 minutes in the ornate royal palace, his second such sit-down since Khashoggi's death. After the first meeting, Pompeo was widely criticized for laughing and appearing overly chummy with the prince, who is also largely responsible for the disastrous war in Yemen. This time, Pompeo smiled politely but appeared more subdued and serious.
Speaking later to reporters at Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport, Pompeo downplayed the harm caused to U.S.-Saudi relations by the Khashoggi case. "Our relationship is with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia," he said. "That is the strategic partnership."
A bipartisan bloc of congressional members has demanded the administration suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia over its abysmal human rights record and the Saudi-led, U.S.-backed war in Yemen that has killed tens of thousands of civilians and plunged the country into famine and a humanitarian crisis.
Pompeo did make a rare mention of female activists in Saudi Arabia whom the government has arrested and allegedly tortured. The sister of one of the women, Loujain Hathloul, published a dramatic op-ed piece in the New York Times this week, pleading that Pompeo take up her case.
Pompeo ended his multinational swing through the Middle East on Monday, cutting it short by one day and one country because of a family death.
Over seven days, he managed to touch down in eight capitals: Amman, Jordan; Baghdad; Cairo; Manama, Bahrain; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Doha, Qatar; Riyadh; and finally Muscat, Oman.
His overarching goal has been to shore up an anti-Iran coalition, especially after President Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw American troops from Syria sowed confusion and doubt about the administration's commitment.
Pompeo's centerpiece event was a speech in Cairo, which his staff portrayed as a major policy address on the Middle East. Reaction to the hard-line speech, however, was mixed and, for some regional leaders, tone-deaf.
The belligerently anti-Iran stance plays well in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but less so in other parts of the region.
"Egypt, for example, fears Turkey more than it does Iran," said Oraib Rantawi, director of the Amman-based Al Quds Center think tank. "Jordan has other concerns, like the Palestinian peace process."
In Iraq, Pompeo's words also brought new fears, because the country has depended so heavily on both the United States and Iran in its fight to oust Islamic State militants from the country.
"Iraq can never be part of an anti-Iran coalition," said Raed Fahmi, secretary of Iraq's Communist Party and a former minister for science and technology. "The dependency is there."
A week after Pompeo landed in Baghdad and Irbil, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, followed the exact same itinerary.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it encourages a glass of red wine every now and then.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: [Video: Eighth Grade | Official Trailer HD | A24 Watch on YouTube.]
Stream a dramedy about a nerve-racking week in the life of an eighth grader. Or watch the new fantasy drama series "The Passage."
What's Streaming
EIGHTH GRADE (2018) stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. Possibly the most awkward, anxiety-inducing time in a teenager's life is examined with a delightful blend of humor and sensitivity in this debut feature by Bo Burnham. Elsie Fisher earned a Golden Globe nomination for her lead role as Kayla, a shy eighth grader navigating the final week of middle school. At school, Kayla keeps to herself and wins an award for "most quiet." At home, she records affirmational self-help videos for her vlog and tries to maintain some sort of social life through Instagram. What makes the movie so relatable is its portrayal of everyday interactions -- talking to a crush, striking up a conversation with the cool kids -- through the eyes of a self-doubting teenager. "Eighth Grade," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review in The New York Times, "is a simple story of an unremarkable girl, tenderly and movingly told."
What's on TV
THE PASSAGE 9 p.m. on Fox. This new series, based on Justin Cronin's fantasy trilogy of the same name, begins with the federal agent Brad Wolgast (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) being sent out to retrieve a girl (Saniyya Sidney) who has been chosen as a subject in a medical test for a virus that could lead to the rise or fall of the human race. The show carries some weight thanks to its strong source material and writer, Liz Heldens, who was a writer and supervising producer on "Friday Night Lights."
HAPPY TOGETHER 8:30 p.m. on CBS. The first season of this sitcom about Jake (Damon Wayans Jr.) and Claire (Amber Stevens West), who host a pop star (Felix Mallard) in their suburban home, wraps up with an intimate concert that gives the couple of homebodies a reason to enjoy a night out. Writing in The Times, Mike Hale called the premise "this season's most artificial situation." "It's not a bad idea," he said, "but the writing tends toward the bland and sentimental."
DAUGHTERS OF THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE DALLAS COWBOYS CHEERLEADERS (2018) 9 p.m. on Starz. The documentarian Dana Adam Shapiro charts the creation of the new-and-improved Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader squad that made its debut in 1972. Original members look back at their time on the sidelines with nostalgia, while the squad's former director, Suzanne Mitchell, recalls the high-stakes nature of her job. The movie suggests that the cheerleaders' highly sexualized and demanding roles may have, at once, liberated and exploited them during a time when American women were increasingly demanding control of their bodies.
LAST CALL 9 p.m. on Bounce TV. After his manager drains his bank account, a former N.F.L. player (Charles Malik Whitfield) opens a comedy club in the back room of his last remaining asset: a bar in his hometown called Last Call.

Kevin McCarthy to meet with Steve King to discuss 'his future and role in this Republican Party'

Texto completo: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Sunday he will meet with Rep. Steve King to discuss the Iowa Republican's future in the party after King publicly questioned why talking about white supremacy and white nationalism was so controversial.

"That language has no place in America. That is not the America I know and it's most definitely not the party of Lincoln," the California Republican said during an interview on CBS News' "Face the Nation." "I have a scheduled meeting with him on Monday and I will tell you this: I have watched on the other side that they don't take action when their members say something like this. Action will be taken. I am having a serious conversation with Congressman Steve King on his future and role in this Republican Party."

McCarthy, however, did not provide details when pressed on what steps would be taken against King, who narrowly won a ninth term in Congress in November and last week drew a primary opponent, GOP state Sen. Randy Feenstra, ahead of his 2020 re-election bid.

"I will not stand back as a leader of this party, believing in this nation that all are created equal, that that stands or continues to stand, and has any role with us," McCarthy said.

In a recent interview with the New York Times, King questioned why words such as "white nationalist" are considered racist. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?” King said to the newspaper.

The remarks earned King a wave of sharp rebukes from fellow Republicans, including former Republican Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, GOP Conference Chairwoman Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.

This isn't King's first brush with controversy regarding comments made about race. Shortly before his 2018 re-election victory, he refused to delete a retweeted Twitter post about "Satan" George Soros, which critics took as anti-Semitic, especially after last year's fatal shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.

In seeking to clarify what he told the New York Times, King condemned the paper on Thursday for suggesting he was an advocate for an "evil and bigoted ideology."

"It's true that like the Founding Fathers I am an advocate for Western Civilization's values, and that I profoundly believe that America is the greatest tangible expression of these ideals the World has ever seen," he wrote in a statement. "Under any fair political definition, I am simply a Nationalist. America's values are expressed in our founding documents, they are attainable by everyone and we take pride that people of all races, religions, and creeds from around the globe aspire to achieve them. I am dedicated to keeping America this way."

King said Friday that he didn’t expect blowback from Republican leaders in Washington or Iowa after he claimed to have initiated a conversation with House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., to discuss the matter and update leadership on how he planned to handle the controversy. On the same day King also delivered a floor speech defending his record on race and immigration.

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump reacted sharply to a New York Times report published Friday that said after he fired FBI Director James Comey, the bureau began to investigate whether Trump was "knowingly working for Russia or had unwittingly fallen under Moscow’s influence. "
"Are you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?" Fox News host – and vocal Trump supporter – Jeanine Pirro asked Trump during a phone interview Saturday night.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked," Trump replied. "I think it's the most insulting article I’ve ever had written. And if you read the article, you'd see that they found absolutely nothing. "
The article said, "No evidence has emerged publicly that Mr. Trump was secretly in contact with or took direction from Russian government officials. " But Trump felt the Times' headline was unfair and attacked the "disaster of a newspaper," which is a frequent target of his criticisms.
Report: President Trump went to 'extraordinary lengths' to hide details of Putin meetings
More: Trump blasts Comey as 'total sleaze' in response to FBI probe reports
"It was a great insult," Trump said of the Times article. "It's a very horrible thing they said, and they've gone so far that people that weren't necessarily believers are now big believers because they said that was a step too far. "
The Times reported that FBI officials first became suspicious of Trump's relationship with Russia during the 2016 campaign but did not initially act, "in part because they were uncertain how to proceed with an inquiry of such sensitivity and magnitude. "
"But the president’s activities before and after Mr. Comey’s firing in May 2017, particularly two instances in which Mr. Trump tied the Comey dismissal to the Russia investigation, helped prompt the counterintelligence aspect of the inquiry," the Times said, citing unnamed law enforcement officials.
Several critics noted that for all his outrage at the report, the president never answered "no" when Pirro asked if he was working for Russia.
Trump asserted that "I’ve been tougher on Russia than anybody else – probably any other president period," citing increased U. S. oil production, "which is, obviously, not great for them, because that's where they get their money for the most part. But many other things. "
While Trump and his supporters tend to see the report as confirmation of a strong anti-Trump bias within elements of the FBI, Democrats say it shows how deep the concerns about the president's Russian ties run. They assert it underscores the importance of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling.
House Minority Whip Steve Scalise argued Trump's foreign policy record belies theories he is doing the bidding of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"President Trump has taken more steps to stand up against Russia than anybody we’ve seen in a long time," the Louisiana Republican said Sunday on ABC's "This Week. " "You’ve seen time and time again with sanctions, with other things, President Trump standing up against Russia.
"Look at what he’s done with the Ukraine. Russia was running through Ukraine when Barack Obama was president," and Trump approved the sale of "tank-busting missiles," which Obama had denied, Scalise said.
Scalise echoed the president's claim that he was a victim of a "witch hunt. "
"They’ve put no facts on the table to show there’s collusion," he said.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation" that "the notion that President Trump is a threat to American national security is absolutely ludicrous. "
But Democrats said there were many reasons to be concerned about Trump's behavior toward Russia.
Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking minority member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, pointed to Trump's behavior during the campaign when "you had Vladimir Putin policies almost being parroted by Donald Trump. "
"You had Trump say only nice things about Putin. He never spoke ill about Russia. The Republican campaign doctrines softened on Russia and decreased their willingness to defend Ukraine," the Virginia Democrat said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union. "
"I think we all remember when Trump, in his bluster, basically said to the Russians, if you have got more emails, bring them on," he said. "These are not actions of a traditional president of the United States. "
The Virginia Democrat also cited a July 2018 meeting in Helsinki between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he called a "frankly, pathetic, embarrassing encounter where Trump was kowtowing on the world stage. "
Warner added that he was troubled by the news that Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort shared polling data with a Russian agent and that Trump wants to lift sanctions on a Russian oligarch who is close to Putin.
"Why is he so chummy with Vladimir Putin?" asked Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. "This man, who is a former KGB agent, never been a friend to the United States, invaded our allies, threatens us around the world, and tries his damnedest to undermine our elections, why is this President Trump's best buddy? I don't get it. "
Durbin and Warner both pointed to a Washington Post report that Trump tried to conceal details from his meetings with Putin.
"When he takes the interpreters' notes and wants to destroy them so no one can see what was said in written transcript, you know it raises serious questions about the relationship between this president and Putin," Durbin said.

Presidential bid is likely for Gillibrand

Texto completo: ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand appears all but certain to launch a 2020 presidential campaign soon.
Gillibrand, a Democrat, has keyed in on the Rensselaer County city of Troy as a potential headquarters for a 2020 campaign, not far from her home in Brunswick, The Associated Press reported Thursday.
Next weekend, Politico reports Gillibrand is planning on traveling to Iowa, whose presidential caucuses are a key first step in the primary season.
And she has been staffing up for a potential bid, selecting a campaign manager, communications directors and other key positions for the coming campaign, according to various reports.
A spokesman for Gillibrand did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
Gillibrand has been publicly mulling a presidential run since cruising to re-election in November.
She is expected to formally announce her run in the coming days or weeks.
Long rumored to have aspirations for higher office, she first publicly confirmed she was considering a 2020 bid on Nov. 8, two days after she winning re-election in New York.
"I believe right now that every one of us should figure out how we can do whatever we can with our time, with our talents to restore that moral decency, that moral compass and that truth of who we are as Americans, so I will promise you I will give it a long, hard thought of consideration," Gillibrand said then on CBS' "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert."
Gillibrand, 52, has been New York's junior senator since 2009, when she was selected by then-Gov. David Paterson to succeed Hillary Clinton, who had become secretary of state.
She's been easily re-elected three times since then — in 2010, 2012 and 2018.
Prior to that, she was a congresswoman representing an Albany-area district from 2007 until she was appointed senator.
Gillibrand's apparent run comes despite repeatedly pledging to serve a full six-year term in the Senate, which would run through 2024.
Her most public pledge came during an October 2018 debate.
"I will serve my six-year term," she said then.
That led to a quick rebuttal from Republican opponent Chele Farley: "Honestly, I don't believe that."
The New York Times reported Friday that Gillibrand had hired Meredith Kelly, a former spokeswoman for Sen. Charles Schumer and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, as her 2020 communications director.
Her campaign staff will be run by Jess Fassler, her chief of staff in the Senate, and Dan McNally, who worked for Senate Democrats, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Both reports cited unnamed people who were familiar with the hirings.

Report: Mulvaney reportedly considered replacing Pastides as USC president

Texto completo: The presidential search is still in the "embryo stage, and we are gearing up to start identifying potential candidates," Mark Buyck, a USC trustee emeritus and member of the presidential search committee, said. It's unclear, however, who has applied for the position and whether there are any front-runners. At least one potential candidate, USC Provost Joan Gabel, was ruled out early after she accepted the job as president at the University of Minnesota.
President Donald Trump's acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney reportedly considered a job as the president of the University of South Carolina, according to a report in The New York Times.
Mulvaney "initiated a discussion with a senior official at the university late last year about the position," according to the Times, which cited four unnamed sources who were "familiar with the discussions."
USC has been searching for a president to replace Harris Pastides since he announced his retirement in October. Pastides' last day is set to be July 31, 2019.
Mark Buyck, a USC trustee emeritus and member of the presidential search committee, told The State he was not aware of The New York Times story or Mulvaney's reported interested in being president of USC.
"I know he's a mighty capable individual," Buyck said of Mulvaney.
The presidential search is still in the "embryo stage, and we are gearing up to start identifying potential candidates," Buyck said. It's unclear, however, who has applied for the position and whether there are any front-runners. At least one potential candidate, USC Provost Joan Gabel, was ruled out early after she accepted the job as president at the University of Minnesota.
Before serving as Trump's budget manager, Mulvaney was a South Carolina congressman from the 5th District for six years.
Mulvaney is a temporary replacement for Gen. John Kelly, who retired as chief of staff late last year.
The White House has denied the report, according to the Times.
"Mick Mulvaney is focused on faithfully executing the job the president has asked him to do, and as such he is not interested in any other positions," White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told the Times.
Mulvaney represented the state's 5th Congressional District, which includes all of Cherokee, Chester, Fairfield, Kershaw, Lancaster, Lee, Union and York counties, and part of Newberry, Spartanburg and Sumter counties.
That seat is currently held by Republican Ralph Norman of Rock Hill, who defeated Archie Parnell in November's election in a landslide.
Some top officials in S.C. are also considering Andrew Card, President George W. Bush's former chief of staff, for president of USC, the Times reported. Card, a USC alumnus, was also considered a contender for USC presidency in 2008, alongside Pastides.
Mulvaney did not respond to a call or text seeking comment from The State.

Comfort at the bottom of a bowl: Portland's best Asian soups Steamy, starchy, funky, fiery - and just what you need to take the edge off winter's chill.

Texto completo: During my final flight back to the U.S. after half a decade in the U.K., I tore a sheet from the SkyMall catalog and started a list. On it were all the foods I couldn't wait to eat when I landed, dishes I had no chance of finding in the historic, yet frustratingly insular small English city where I had been studying.
Crusty, boat-shaped khachapuri stuffed with melted cheese and a still-runny egg were on the docket, as were swollen tapioca pearls suspended in lurid purple taro milk tea slush, not to mention wobbly galaktoboureko custard served with tiny cups of Greek coffee as assertive as an air horn. But at the very top of my list - the thing I planned to order on the taxi ride from the airport - was soup.
Soondubu jjigae, to be specific. 30,000 feet in the air, all I could imagine about eating that evening was a stone pot full of oniony, pork-belly broth, bobbing with soft tofu and red pepper flakes.
A few weeks ago, when I visited Portland's Yobo restaurant on a snowy weekday, I was feeling both frozen from the inside out and a little nostalgic, so I ordered their version of this Korean classic. It got me thinking about the almost supernatural power of steaming broth, funky umami and a little spice. Together, this magical trio animates many Asian soups, giving them the ability to make January feel like June, at least as long as steam keeps rising from the bowl.
So as we slide into the nippiest part of the year, I've been compiling another list. This one I'm sharing with you: a brief guide to some of Portland's best Asian soups. Here's hoping it helps you track down something soothing and restorative when you're feeling bulldozed by the winter chill.
Chinese
Sichuan Kitchen's spicy sour soup noodles (suan la tang mian, $10) is the hottest dish on this list. A distant cousin to ramen, made not with bouncy, alkaline noodles, but with angel-hair vermicelli, this Chengdu classic gets its distinct personality from the Sichuan peppercorns, white pepper and red chili oil that power its galloping heat. Don't let the promise of numb lips put you off: Through a compensatory dose of Chinese black vinegar, Sichuan Kitchen's suan la tang mian always tastes balanced. Better still, ginger-spiced ground pork and baby bok choi build substance and structure into this soup, making it an ideal lunch for someone under the (frigid) weather.
Bonus: Every Wednesday this winter, Sichuan Kitchen will be hosting a reservation-only Sichuan hotpot night ($30 per person, or $25 for a vegetarian option).

Korean
Yobo's kimchi tofu hotpot ($15) is an updated take on soondubu jjigae, the soup I dreamed about on that flight many years ago. Served roiling and bubbling violently in its black stone bowl, Chef Sunny Chang's anchovy-based broth is full of all the usual suspects: hot pepper flakes, onion, cubes of daikon radish, and a freshly cracked egg that continues cooking as you slurp. But Yobo's soondubu goes a step further than most, with the inclusion of chewy tteok, cylindrical rice noodles the size and shape of a short roll of dimes. The starchy tteok eliminate the need for cooked white rice - soondubu's traditional accompaniment - and transform the fiery soup into a full-fledged, single-dish meal.

Japanese
If you're getting hungry picturing open pots of boiling broth, the choose-your-own-adventure-style of Japanese hot pot (nabemono) at Ginza Town might be just what you require. Five broths, five varieties of noodle, nine meats and dozens of other options mean that every nabemono you enjoy will be at least slightly different from the last. Best to start with either the miso stock or the spicy house special broth, add fish cakes, shiitake mushrooms, lettuce and brisket. While you're at it, ask for the salmon jaw. It might sound crazy, but as it simmers with the other ingredients, it adds a rich, sweet-savory backdrop to the soup ($35 for three people, $40 for four).
For those less inclined toward DIY dinners, Pai Men Miyake's generous portions of ramen offer another good option. Without making much of a fuss about it - and undoubtedly due to new competition from other ramen shops like the recently shuttered Suzuki-ya - the quality of Pai Men's signature dish has improved significantly over the past two years. Maybe it's the kombu-thickened broth dotted with pinpricks of red chili oil, or the intertwining of acid and smoke from fermented bamboo shoots and charred cabbage, but either way, the springy Shojin (vegetarian) ramen at Pai Men Miyake ($13) is finally one of Portland's best noodle soups.

Vietnamese
While banh mi sandwiches gain in popularity across the country, pho still remains Vietnam's most famous culinary export, and with good reason. It is hard to top the patchwork quilt of flavors from torn fresh cilantro and holy basil floating on the surface of beef bone-broth, slow-brewed from charred onions and ginger, fish sauce, star anise and cinnamon. And that's just the stock. Add in supple rice noodles, a squirt of hoisin and fresh red chile sauce, and maybe shavings of sirloin (tai) and bouncy meatballs (bo vien), and you have one of the best hedges against the winter blahs.
Huong's version of pho tai bo vien ($7.95) is the area's gold standard, with marble-smooth, halved bo vien that squeak satisfyingly as you chew them. Upstairs at the Portland Public Market, Pho Co ($8.50) makes a version that is nearly its rival, with rougher, more savory meatballs, and a brighter, floral broth.
On the lighter side of pho, Cong Tu Bot's chicken-based pho ga ($14) - lavish with flat rice noodles, shreds of poached chicken meat and schmaltz - is also fantastic.

Thai
As if to prove the point that a phenomenal winter soup does not require noodles, Thai Esaan has introduced creamy, peppery broken rice soup (khao tom) to its specials board ($8). Call to place an order, and Chef Siwaporn Roberts will ask if you want yours with a lightly beaten egg mixed in for an extra dollar (you do). Her congee-like soup appears simple, but it cleverly layers nearly a dozen flavors and textures, from ginger to lemongrass, ground chicken to pungent fish sauce.
I'm not ashamed to admit that, after a brutal bout with a seasonal cold this autumn, I ate khao tom for lunch five days in a row, fogging my glasses as I leaned over the bowl to breathe in the steam from the broth. Now that I've recovered, I'm back to once a week. But I've still got Esaan on my speed-dial, just in case.

Texto completo: Happy new year; now let's talk about endings. A number of high-profile TV series will be departing forever in 2019 — although forever doesn't always mean forever anymore when it comes to TV, which has been reviving old shows with a vengeance lately.
The departures will leave fans bereft; we do tend to get attached to our favorite series, as they come into our homes sometimes for years and years. You were 11 years younger when “The Big Bang Theory" first appeared, and if you're 20 now, you grew up with it, in the way previous generations grew up with “Full House" or “The Brady Bunch."
So here are some of the shows leaving. And may I say I'm sorry for your TV losses.
“Game of Thrones"
Winter is here, and the HBO epic blockbuster will return in April for its eighth and final season. The drama based on George R.R. Martin's books has been HBO's biggest sensation since “The Sopranos," and its end game is, of course, top secret. The last season will include only six episodes, but each one will be supersized. By the way, an HBO prequel set thousands of years before “Game of Thrones" is already in the works from Jane Goldman and Martin, and it will star Naomi Watts.

“The Big Bang Theory"
Now it's time to say goodbye to Sheldon and the gang . . . Actually, it will end in May. Chuck Lorre's CBS megahit turned geek culture into a craze, and it helped Jim Parsons take home not only about $1 million per episode but also four Emmys. With 12 seasons, it is the longest-running multi-camera series in TV history, and no doubt we will be seeing syndicated reruns of it for eternity. It has already spawned a spinoff, “Young Sheldon."
“Veep"
After its seventh term as the funniest show on TV, Julia Louis-Dreyfus's dark political comedy will be stepping down. The HBO show went on hiatus due to Louis-Dreyfus's breast cancer treatment, and it will finally return with seven new episodes at some still-unannounced point this year. Some say “Veep" has lost its edge during the Trump administration, as reality undermines the satire; others, like me, still savor every scene. So far, Louis-Dreyfus has won six Emmys for her work as Selina Meyer, and the show has won three for best comedy.
“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"
The Netflix comedy, from the sharp team of Tina Fey and Robert Carlock, has lasted for four seasons, getting more laughs and cultural humor than you might have expected out of a woman's escape from an underground bunker. The second, final half of season four is due on Jan. 25.
“The Affair"
The Showtime drama told an old story — an extramarital affair and the resulting destruction of two marriages — in a new way, with segments shown from specific characters' points of view. The 10-episode fifth season will give us the end of the reverberations of the affair, but without two of the four leads, Ruth Wilson and Joshua Jackson. Instead, the action will jump ahead a few decades and feature Anna Paquin as the adult daughter of Wilson's Alison and Jackson's Cole.
“Homeland"
The first season of Showtime's terrorism drama was its best, as we tried to figure out if Damian Lewis's Brody was a terrorist or not. Since then, the explosive drama has been wildly uneven, alternately breathtaking and absurd. Later this year, the 12-episode eighth season will end the story of Claire Danes's Carrie Mathison with a return to an overseas setting and a big time jump. Also, showrunner Alex Gansa promises that the plot will not be some kind of allegory for the Trump administration.
“Orange Is the New Black"
So long, Litchfield Penitentiary. Along with already finished “House of Cards," Jenji Kohan's prison dramedy helped Netflix enter the original series market with a bang. Since its premiere, the series has been both a breath of fresh air — featuring a remarkably diverse cast and dozens of finely wrought individual stories — and a bit of a slog. The seventh season, due later this year, will be the last one.
“Transparent"
After the Jeffrey Tambor sexual misconduct scandal, Jill Soloway decided to end the Amazon series later this year with the fifth season — without Tambor's Maura Pfefferman. The show has been groundbreaking in its portrait of a 70-year-old trans woman and her complicated family. Now the focus will presumably turn to her ex-wife and adult children. All we know for certain is that the show — which has included a number of significant musical sequences, will conclude with a two-hour musical. “It will hopefully feel like 'Jesus Christ Superstar' mixed with 'La La Land' mixed with 'Flight of the Conchords' with something more Jewish thrown in," Soloway told the New York Times. “A little 'Yentl.' "
“Broad City"
This Comedy Central gem from Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson has been a little bit of New York City heaven, as two kooky, loving friends living there find their way through their 20s. The fifth season, which begins on Jan. 24, will be the last — which is just right. Good shows that overstay and degrade are the real enemy of the people.
“You're the Worst"
The fifth and final season of this endearing FX series is currently airing, and it appears to be building up to a wedding. Are our favorite cynics actually going to be so uncool as to tie the knot? This anti-romantic comedy managed to be romantic, and moving, too, as Aya Cash's Gretchen dealt with serious depression.
Also on the way out:
“Gotham": Fox's Batman origin story ends with the current season five.
“Jane the Virgin": The twisty CW show ends with its fifth season, due in March.
“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend": The CW's musical comedy wraps with the current season four.
“Mr. Robot": The murky USA drama will return for its fourth and final season later this year.
“The Deuce": HBO's look at the porn industry ends with season three, expected later in the year.
“Elementary": The reimagining of Sherlock Holmes ends late this year after the 13-episode season seven.

Washington state ditches 'Mile 420' and 'Mile 69' signs after repeated thefts

Texto completo: Washington state’s Department of Transportation is replacing mile markers “69” and “420” after repeated thefts of the signs, according to a report.

Mile markers featuring the two numbers on the state’s various highway routes have been moved back one-tenth of a mile — to become Mile 68.9 and Mile 419.9. But the solution has not always deterred theft, according to the New York Times. In 2011, a kelly-green sign marking Mile 68.9 on the state’s Route 231 was stolen — just two years after it was first installed. Replacements were also stolen in 2014 and 2016.

While the department has been facing an increasing number of thefts of metal materials placed on state highways, thieves “will typically go and take those more than anything,” Trevor McCain, a Transportation Department official told the Times of the two signs.

“They have special meanings to some people,” McCain said. The number “69” alludes to a sexual act and “420” serves as popular shorthand for smoking marijuana.

This is not the first time a state has adopted such measures to curb the thefts of the popular numeric signs. In 2014, Colorado officials moved a Mile 420 sign on Interstate 70 to have it read “Mile 419.99.” Fox News reports that they also relocated a “Mile 69” sign in Larimer County to “Mile 68.5” in an attempt to curb thefts.

Pegan diet could be next big trend

Texto completo: There's a new trendy diet in town, folks – the pegan diet.
The word pegan has seen a 337 percent increase in searches on Pinterest over the past year, with a steady climb in searches within the last six months.
It was born when Dr. Mark Hyman, New York Times best-selling author, coined the term – a mashup of paleo and vegan – in a blog post that detailed his own diet.
What is a pegan diet? In short, a pegan diet incorporates pieces of the paleo and vegan diets.
A person on a vegan diet refrains from eating all animal products or byproducts – no meat, eggs, cheese, yogurt and sometimes gelatin. A paleo diet is a nutritional plan that mimics how people used to eat in the Paleolithic era 2.5 million years ago. So dieters eat unprocessed foods consisting mostly of vegetables, fruits, nuts, grass-fed meats and fish.
How does pegan differ? Although vegan and paleo diets may seem like they're at odds – one advocates for removing dairy, meat and fish while the other encourages eating meat and fish – the root of both of those lifestyles is ultimately the same: eating whole foods and plants.
The purpose of the pegan diet is to get people to eat whole foods that are fresh and organic and increase their vegetable intake.
There's also an emphasis on the quality of foods you're eating – the pegan diet encourages participants to eat organic products.
What are you supposed to eat? Plants. Basically most of your diet will be made up of vegetables, good fats and nuts and seeds.
The physician explained that 75 percent of the diet should be fruits and vegetables while avoiding dairy and gluten.
But if you must eat dairy, the diet advises reaching for sheep- or goat-based dairy products. Maria Marlowe, a nutrition health coach and author who operates her own nutrition health coaching practice in New York City, said this is because goat and sheep's milk are easier to digest than cow's milk, but it's preferable to avoid all dairy.
Hyman said that meat is not necessarily harmful and has good health benefits. It just depends on how much you're eating and what kind you're eating. The doctor, who is also director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, suggests eating meat sparingly and eating only grass-fed and sustainably raised meat.
Basically, eat meat as a side dish, not the main course.
Those on a pegan diet should also eat healthy fats like those found in nuts, avocados, coconut oil and even saturated fat from organic meat products.
And, as with most diets, sugar should be avoided or eaten only as a treat.
Is the pegan diet safe? Desiree Nielsen, a registered dietitian who runs her own nutrition consulting practice and hosts "The Urban Vegetarian," a Canadian cooking show, doesn't recommend the pegan diet because of how restrictive it is – she actually advises against all diets that are restrictive. However, she does believe that the pegan diet is a great way to transition into a healthier and more plant-based lifestyle.
"There isn't one right way to eat," said Nielsen. "I think it's a wonderful diet to be inspired by. Eat more plants; eat more whole foods – those are wonderful messages to incorporate, but I think for many of us, living by a restrictive rule-focused diet may not be healthy for our body or our minds."
What are the benefits? Although the pegan diet may not be right for everyone, it has helped some.
"I grew up eating a standard American diet, which led to a slew of health problems," said Marlowe. "Eating the pegan way helped me lose 20 pounds, get rid of digestive issues, have more energy and overall improve my health."
Nielsen said that as a vegan, trying out the pegan diet left her hungry, and she suffered from low blood pressure and headaches. She said the pegan diet doesn't advocate for a lot of legumes, the source of most of the protein for plant-based eaters, and it relies some on animal protein, which vegans can't eat.
"It's a great transition towards a more plant-based diet for meat eaters," advised Nielsen. "It will increase intake of valuable phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables that help you fight inflammation. It will also help you move away from a hyper-processed and packaged eating pattern."
Liz Josefsberg, a certified personal trainer and nutrition exercise specialist, tried the pegan diet for 30 days and said that though she struggled a bit in the beginning, she enjoyed the journey and the results, including losing six pounds with little effort.
"My stomach? Noticeably flatter. My skin? Bright and clear. My cravings for cheese – and even my desire to have a glass of wine – diminished," wrote Josefsberg in a blog post. "I also noticed I had a real clarity of mind and much more energy than usual."
Dietitians recommend sheep or goat dairy products on the diet because they're easier to digest than milk from cows.

A man usually tells you to walk, not a woman, because of frequency not sexism

Texto completo: Q. Where I live they have been changing the crosswalk buttons to these fancy new ones that beep, flash and talk to you. Why are all of the voices men’s voices? Isn’t this the age of equality?
– Patrick Shane, North Tustin
A. Patrick lives in unincorporated county territory, near the city of Tustin. After getting some specifics on the traffic signals, he and Honk agreed the city would be best to ask, as at least some of these new-school devices are in Tustin.
Krys Saldivar , the manager of the Tustin’s Public Works Department, said the city is upgrading all of its pedestrian push buttons tied to traffic signals, with about 40 percent having these newer devices.
“Those who are blind will be able to hear where they are crossing and when to cross, and those who are deaf will feel the vibration when it is safe to cross,” she told Honk in an email. “The first ones that have been installed in the city were actually programmed by the manufacturer.”
That would be Polara, a Texas-based company.
Its president, John McGaffey , said if a city asks, Polara can provide a female voice; it has done so before. But it generally uses a male voice.
“In controlled studies using … accessible pedestrian signals, the majority of the visually impaired participants said they were able to hear a male voice better because it has greater low-range frequencies (under 800 Hz), which people can tend to hear, even with some hearing loss. We also try to keep the voice consistent so the messages sound similar, no matter where you are in the United States.”
Q. My license expires on my birthday in June. Should I go ahead and make an appointment with the Department of Motor Vehicles now because of the crowded DMV offices, with the popularity of the REAL ID? Or should I wait until they send me a notice? It’s very confusing! Thank you!
– Linda Wells, Mission Viejo
A. DMV officials and Honk readers have told the wise one, that would be Honk, that wait times have gone way down since the mess in the summer.
Still, appointments are the way to go if you must go into an office to renew your license (Typically every 15 years until you hit age 70, then every five years).
“She can make an appointment before she receives her renewal notice,” Marty Greenstein , a DMV spokesman up in Sacramento, said via email. “In fact, that’s something we encourage. If you know your license is going to expire in a few months, go ahead and make your appointment. We started sending out renewal notices 90 days in advance this summer (up from 60) to give people more time.”
The DMV takes appointments for several months out. Linda noticed that the two DMV offices near her home were completely booked. What about that?
“Appointment availability can change on a daily basis as offices perform daily assessments, or spots open when an appointment is canceled,” Greenstein said.
So keep trying, Linda.
But don’t go too early to a DMV office to renew, or you will be required to take what used to be called a “written” test and is now a “knowledge” test (it is usually done on a touchscreen these days) even if you weren’t scheduled for one. The DMV reasons that if you renew real early, then you are shortening up the time it has to monitor your track record out there on the roads, so the test is meant to ensure you are a safe motorist.
“In instances when a knowledge test is not required, coming in at any time during that 90-day window before your license expires should not trigger that requirement,” Greenstein added.
Honkin’ cool: A dad didn’t want his daughter to be alone on Christmas, so Hal Vaughan took six flights over three days to be with her. Pierce Vaughan is a rookie flight attendant for Delta Air Lines, and Dad shadowed her, able to jump on standby for free, a perk of his daughter’s job. A passenger heard about the journey, put it on Facebook and the cute story went viral. The trip: New Orleans; Detroit; Fort Myers, Fla.; Detroit; Hartford, Conn.; Atlanta; and back to New Orleans (Source: The New York Times).

Texto completo: On Thursday, the New York Times ran a headline that said, “Colorado’s got a gay governor. Who cares?”
The writer’s point was that Jared Polis’ sexual orientation was a nonfactor in the governor’s campaign and election, accepted in our state as a matter of unremarkable course.
That Polis is gay was “interestingly uninteresting to voters,” as the conservative columnist George F. Will wrote. “What we found,” Polis told Will, “was that the voters don’t really care.”
In spite of the nonnewsiness of this news, and putting aside political affiliations for a moment, I still couldn’t help but feel a twinge of pride that I lived in the first state in the country to elect an openly gay governor. Seems to me this was destined to happen in a Western state, where Polis’ election can be seen as a liberal landmark and a libertarian one.
Sure, Colorado experienced a blue wave this November, but I think the West’s live and let live mentality, it’s leave-me-alone tolerance for individuality, played a part as well.
“Right now, our nation is experiencing a period of growing divisiveness and rising tribalism,” Polis said in his inaugural speech, delivered on the steps of the state Capitol in Denver. “But here in Colorado, we choose a different path. Here, we have come so far, we have climbed so high, we have done so much, not just to say but to show that we reject the negative and divisive brand of politics.”
Polis added that the state has “decided to celebrate our differences.”
The vote made me think of other firsts that have happened in the West, where, perhaps, the minds are a trifle more inclined to mimic the wide-open spaces around them.
In 1869, the territory of Wyoming — hardly a bastion of progressivism then or now — became the first to grant women the right to vote, 50 years before the rest of the country. Colorado was next in 1893, and then Utah and Idaho passed suffrage laws in 1896. The country as a whole didn’t get around to it until 1920.
The first woman elected governor of a state was Nellie Tayloe Ross, a Democrat, in 1925 in Wyoming, She succeeded her deceased husband.
I love this one the most: Montana elected the first woman to the U.S. House of Representatives, Jeannette Rankin, in 1916, four years before women could vote! The eldest of seven children, Rankin performed farm chores and maintained farm equipment side by side with men on the Western frontier, and those men thought that, hell, if she could do all that she could handle Congress, no problem.
Argonia, Kansas, elected the first female mayor in 1887.
Colorado elected the first three female state legislators in 1894.
It’s as if we pride ourselves on our contrariness here in the middle West.
Of course, not all the firsts are without controversy. Colorado was also first in the country to legalize marijuana, an experiment that is still very much a work in progress.
But let’s not forget that Apple, Amazon, and Google all sprang from the Western part of the country as well, a tribute to the fertile ground for innovation here in the Western climes.
Why might a preponderance of these firsts take place out here, in the rawboned wilds of the country?
I like to think there’s an intrepid explorer spirit behind that willingness to flaunt norms and dive headlong into the future. Perhaps we’re not as bound up by history and convention and the way it’s always been out here beyond the 100th meridian. It’s not all done and decided for us in the West, which is a land and society still very much in the making. We are believers in our ability to reinvent ourselves, that our narrative is still very much being spun.
As a result, Colorado and the West have shown a propensity to break new ground, to boldly go where the rest of the country hasn’t yet.
I like to think some of that has to do with our peerless geography. It’s impossible to look up at Pikes Peak and not think of the boundlessness of our potential. There’s just more room for self-invention and prickly individualism out here. We’re all still half-wild, still forming, willing to try new ways of doing things. That boundlessness is closer to the essence of what is best about America, I would argue.
Some think of us as a little less sophisticated, even backward out here, because of our inability to conform too much to trends on the left or right coasts, our desire to be left alone by our government, our obsession with self-reliance and consequent disdain for handouts and taxes.
Let me ask the Thoreau of the West, Edward Abbey, to weigh in on that:
“I have been called a curmudgeon, which my obsolescent dictionary defines as a ‘surly, ill-mannered, bad-tempered fellow.’ Nowadays, curmudgeon is likely to refer to anyone who hates hypocrisy, cant, sham, dogmatic ideologies, and has the nerve to point out unpleasant facts and takes the trouble to impale these sins on the skewer of humor and roast them over the fires of fact, common sense, and native intelligence. In this nation of bleating sheep and braying jackasses, it then becomes an honor to be labeled curmudgeon.”
Hear, hear.
Let’s take a moment in this new year then to give ourselves a pat on the back for our orneriness, for not doing things the way the rest of the country does them. For being first up the mountain, no matter if you agree with that mountain or not.
“May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous,” Abbey once wished a passel of Westerners, “leading to the most amazing view.”

N.J. governor wants to expand voting access

Texto completo: Ballots disqualified for dubious reasons. Hourslong wait times. Onerous identification requirements. Broken polling stations.
The frustrations millions of people experienced during November's midterm election have made voting rights a polarizing issue, thrusting it to the top of statehouse agendas across the country. While some states are wrestling with expanding voter access, others are seeking to further restrict access to the ballot under the guise of combating voter fraud, which is extremely rare.
Now, in New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, is pursuing a series of bills that would significantly expand access to the ballot for hundreds of thousands of voters.
The bills call for changes across the electoral spectrum: allowing online voter registration and early voting up to 30 days before an election; same-day voter registration; permitting those on parole and probation to vote; and making 17-year-olds who turn 18 by the general election eligible to vote in party primaries.
The package, which would have to be passed by the Democrat-controlled state Legislature, does not include proposals that would result in a first-in-the-nation approach to expanding voting access. But the changes - combined with those approved in 2018 that expanded automatic voter registration and made it simpler to vote by mail - would make New Jersey one of the easiest states to cast a vote.
Murphy's campaign comes as Democratic lawmakers nationwide pursue voting reform as a way to enfranchise minorities and low-income Americans who have often been the victims of strict voting requirements.
Murphy overcame a contentious relationship with two legislative leaders - Senate President Stephen M. Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin - to pass last year's voting bills. One law, which automatically renewed mail ballots for people who had voted by mail in the 2016 election, resulted in more than 400,000 votes being cast by mail during the 2018 midterms, by far the most for any election, including presidential elections, in state history.
The changes in voting laws followed efforts that date to 2015 when Democratic lawmakers passed an act that contained versions of the proposals Murphy is now promoting, as well as new proposals like language accessibility, which would require ballots to be printed in more languages if populations were represented in significant numbers in election districts. Murphy's predecessor, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, vetoed the bill, which has been reintroduced in the Assembly.
More recently, Democratic lawmakers have found themselves the target of intense criticism from voting rights activists over a controversial effort to change the way New Jersey draws its legislative districts. The proposal called for enshrining a formula into the state Constitution that would have tipped the playing field to favor Democrats.
Sweeney was a sponsor of the bill. Murphy, progressive Democratic groups and Republicans all opposed the effort; Sweeney eventually announced that he would not bring the measure for a final Senate vote.
Sweeney declined to say whether he would support Murphy's electoral package, while Coughlin said he believed in expansive voting reforms.
The redistricting fight, Murphy said, is part of what is motivating him to push for the new voting reforms.
Still, while the package of proposals is ambitious for New Jersey, parts of the plan play catch-up with other states.
More than a third of states allow 17-year-olds to vote in party primaries. More than a dozen states allow ex-felons to vote immediately after they are released from prison, and over two-thirds allow online voter registration.
Many states offer in-person early voting, but the 30-day window proposed in New Jersey would be among the widest in the country. (Georgia is the leader with a 45-day early voting period.) New Jersey would also require polling locations to be open seven days a week.
Whatever support Murphy has been able to gain has not included Republicans.
"This, in my judgment, is a political maneuver to continue to increase the number of votes in a Democratic state to ensure victory for the party that has the majority of the registration," said Assemblyman Jon Bramnick, the Republican minority leader. There are 900,000 more registered Democrats in New Jersey than Republicans. "I don't think there's any reason not to have some responsibility in order to be a voter," he added.
The push to expand voting rights comes as 55 percent of eligible ballots in New Jersey were cast in the 2018 midterms, a nearly 20 percent increase from 2014, and slightly above the 47 percent national turnout rate during the midterm election.

Here's a look at how the effects of the shutdown go beyond federal workers

Texto completo: Federal workers, some 800,000 of them, won't get their paychecks Friday. They're feeling the pinch, for sure. But the partial government shutdown is affecting other American citizens, too. Here's a sampling of them and the problems that they are seeing:
Home buyers Michael Thallheimer, 58, was going to get a US Department of Agriculture loan to buy a three-bedroom house in Rio Dell, Calif. That's on hold. The government's mortgage program for low- and middle-income Americans in rural areas is currently not issuing any new funds, CNBC reports.
Real estate refinance applications are booming because of a recent drop in mortgage rates. But anyone looking to buy or refinance might have a harder time reaching federal agencies to verify their income taxes or get loan information from the closed Federal Housing Administration, NPR reports.
More than 20 percent of Realtors said they had either a current or prospective client affected by the shutdown. “The shutdown is causing tangible harm to potential buyers, the real estate market and economic growth," Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the association, told CNBC.
People who need federal help to fix up their homes Stacey Gray's water heater broke in her RV in Louisville, Ky. She applied for a renovation loan through a Housing and Urban Development program, but the agency is closed, CNBC reports.
“I don't have hot water if I want to take a bath," Gray, 39, told the network. In the meantime, she's using public restrooms to brush her teeth and wash up. “It's broken me," she said.
Domestic-violence victims People calling into a domestic-violence hotline in Chicago soon might not get anyone to pick up. The Illinois Domestic Violence Hotline, which refers abuse victims to shelters, counseling centers, legal advocates, and other resources, relies on a Victims of Crime Act grant, administered by US Department of Justice employees. The funds are on hold, the Chicago Tribune reports. The hotline has had to dip into its reserves, and they will run dry in less than a month.
Air travelers The Transportation Security Administration plans to begin closing a handful of security checkpoints at airports around the country as soon as this weekend in response to staffing shortages, Bloomberg News reports. Miami International Airport expects to shut one of its concourses for several days, the Miami Herald reports.
Concerns have also been raised by unions representing air traffic controllers and aviation safety inspectors that the safety of the air travel system could be affected, the New York Times reports. “Without a fully functioning FAA, a layer of safety is missing," said Mike Perrone, national president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, which represents safety inspectors who are furloughed.
People who live near Superfund sites Environmental cleanups at Superfund pollution sites around the nation have been suspended except for cases where the administration deems "there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property," The Associated Press reports.
People who live near various industrial sites Inspections of chemical factories, power plants, oil refineries, water treatment plants, and thousands of other industrial sites have stopped because the Environmental Protection Agency had to furlough most of the employees involved, the New York Times reports.
People who eat seafood, fruits, and vegetables The Food and Drug Administration has stopped routine food safety inspections of seafood, fruits, vegetables, and many other foods at high risk of contamination, The New York Times reports.
Beer drinkers A division of the Treasury Department has been idled that regulates manufacturers of craft beer, dealing a blow to a booming industry and disappointing brew fanatics, the Times reports.
Farmers Michelle Aavang, a longtime farmer in Illinois's McHenry County, said she'll do OK for the next few months, but she's worried about the effect on younger farmers of a holdup in government payments from the Market Facilitation Program. That's the program intended to help farmers offset losses from tariffs imposed by China because of President Trump's trade war. World supply-and-demand reports, which Aavang relies on to market her crops and plan for the future, have also been delayed, she told the Chicago Tribune.
Farmers also cannot get federally backed operating loans to buy seed for spring planting or feed for livestock, among other hardships caused by the shutdown, The New York Times reports.
A farm bill passed in December included programs to help dairy farmers through swings in the market, and provided services for farmers struggling with stress and depression, but the programs cannot be implemented because of the shutdown, Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, told the Times.
National park visitors Many national parks are closed. Some are open with limited staffing or with the help of states. At some parks, volunteers have stepped in to help with cleanup. Questions have also been raised about visitor safety, the New York Times reports.
Anyone who does business with a federal employee or agency Farida Abou Draa, looking out from her food truck on an empty sidewalk in Washington, D.C., said she felt like crying and worried for the future.
Abou Draa told Reuters. “I can't pay my rent. I can't pay [for] my food. I can't pay my employees."
Food truck owners in Washington are just an example of businesses nationwide that rely on federal workers' spending. Federal paychecks boost local economies in many communities. They're bracing for an economic body blow, The Washington Post reports.

Texto completo: BY ELANA SCHOR
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday apologized to women who have shared experiences of harassment by male supervisors while working on his 2016 presidential campaign, a controversy that has raised fresh questions about his potential second run in 2020.
The Vermont independent said on Capitol Hill that the alleged misconduct by male aides "was absolutely unacceptable and certainly not what a progressive campaign or any campaign should be about." He said that rhetoric about "ending sexism and ending all forms of discrimination ... cannot just be words."
"To women in our campaign who were harassed or mistreated, I apologize," Sanders said.
Politico reported Wednesday that a former Sanders adviser, Robert Becker, had forcibly kissed a female subordinate in mid-2016. Becker denies the allegation.
Sanders said he was unaware of the alleged misconduct by Becker, who has recently taken unofficial travel in a bid to bolster a possible 2020 presidential campaign by the senator. Sanders also said he wasn't aware of a reported $30,000 settlement to resolve a discrimination claim against his 2016 campaign.
The New York Times also has reported on multiple claims of mistreatment against female Sanders campaign aides by senior male officials.
In his initial response this month to female campaign aides who had come forward about their harassment, Sanders told CNN he didn't know about the allegations in 2016 because "I was little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case." He projected more contrition on Thursday, saying that "our standards, our procedures, our safeguards, were clearly inadequate." Sanders said his 2018 Senate re-election campaign instituted "some of the strongest sexual harassment policies in the country."
A 2020 campaign could pit the 77-year-old senator against a half-dozen or more of his congressional colleagues in a hotly contested Democratic primary for the nomination to take on President Donald Trump.

Obama-Era War on Executive Power Foreshadowed Trump's Wall Fight; Republicans said Obama was abusing his office with executive actions on health care, immigration

Texto completo: Angered by what they saw as presidential overreach, lawmakers said the president was acting like a king.
The president at the time was Democrat Barack Obama, and the lawmakers warning of an imperial presidency were Republicans, who protested Mr. Obama's moves to implement the Affordable Care Act and extend protections for young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.
The Obama-era fights over executive power foreshadowed in some ways the current standoff over President Trump's insistence on building a wall on the southern border. Mr. Trump is considering whether to invoke national-emergency powers to bypass Congress to build a wall he says is crucial to U.S. border security.
Democrats warn that such a move would amount to an abuse of power--echoing arguments made by GOP lawmakers during Mr. Obama's presidency--and an illegal encroachment on Congress's power to set federal spending.
As with Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama vowed he wouldn't let his agenda stall. He said he would use his "pen" and "phone" to make headway where possible, refusing to wait for a consensus between his administration and the Republican-controlled Congress to take shape.
In a 2013 interview with the New York Times, he said that "where Congress is unwilling to act, I will take whatever administrative steps that I can in order to do right by the American people." At issue at the time was his decision to delay a provision of the Affordable Care Act.
Mr. Obama's actions prompted this response on Twitter from Mr. Trump, then a television reality-show star: "If ObamaCare is such a wonderful law then why does Obama summarily change the law before an election?"
Mr. Obama didn't make use of a national emergency declaration in implementing the Affordable Care Act or providing legal safeguards for Dreamers
The Republican-controlled House in 2014 sued the president over his management of the health law, charging he had overstepped his authority. The case wound through the court system for three years before a settlement was reached in December 2017. The ACA remains the subject of litigation today.
Mr. Obama faced similar attacks after Congress foiled his plans for legalizing the status of the young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children and he took executive action to ensure they weren't deported. Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, said in 2014 that Mr. Obama was once again "taking brazen, unilateral action."
Now that Mr. Trump is in power, the dynamic has changed. Democrats are the ones warning of presidential abuses, while some Republicans cheer on a president who is stymied by Congress.
Tweeting Thursday night, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) wrote that Mr. Trump should "use emergency powers to build Wall/Barrier. I hope it works."

Texto completo: There is not much that doesn't fit under San Francisco Sketchfest's big tent, with an ever-expanding lineup of 200-plus shows on the schedule. Here are some of our picks for the best the fest has to offer. Note that some key events, such as the "Best in Show" reunion and "Schitt's Creek: Up Close and Personal," are sold out. All venues are in San Francisco.

Details: 7:30 p.m. today; Marines' Memorial Theatre; $25-$35.
SF Sketchfest at The Speakeasy >> An immersive comedy experience featuring Janeane Garofalo with Jen Kirkman and Sabrina Jalees.

Salute to Bill Plympton >> Tagged as the King of Indie Animation, the Oscar-nominated Plympton is the first person to hand draw an entire animated feature film (1992's "The Tune"). Regularly featured on MTV's "Liquid Television" in the early '90s, Plympton won the Cannes Palme d'Or in 1991 and has illustrated for The New York Times, National Lampoon and Screw.

Carol Burnett, in conversation with Wendie Malick >> Though she was beloved for her work with Julie Andrews in the '60s and as Mrs. Hannigan in "Annie" in 1982, Burnett is best known for her comedy show that from 1967-78 introduced a new generation to sketch comedy. Details: 8 p.m. Monday; Castro Theatre, $55-$75.

Texto completo: The United States is quickly becoming divided into the globalists and the patriots. They are at total war against each other. Since they are ideologically incomparable only one side can win. In time all will support one side or the other side. Readers already are, whether they are fully aware of what they support or not.
The globalists, often called the establishment or the deep state, prefer world-wide open borders, the eventual transfer of all political power to international levels, and eventually world government. National sovereignty is their enemy. The patriots prefer freedom from excessive government, independence from any governing entity other than Congress, patriotism, and today, the Constitution as written. The choice is uncannily similar to the choice given Americans in 1776.
The globalists, deeply imbedded in our parties and establishment medias, hated the following address and consequently minimized coverage of it in their print outlets like the New York Times and Washington Post, and network medias. If followed it would shut down their New World Order and world governance aspirations. It would spell a different foreign policy than practiced since World War II but far more in harmony with that of the Founding Fathers.
Chances are very good that readers missed important parts of what President Donald Trump told the United Nations September 25, 2018. It could be summarized in 12 words from it. "We reject the ideology of globalism and accept the doctrine of patriotism." Adding, "America is governed by Americans." Directed squarely at the globalists in the room, he effectively said, "We will keep our sovereignty and expect other nations to keep theirs as well."
He told them. "We are standing up for America and for the American people. And we are also standing up for the world. That is why America will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control, and domination. I honor the right of every nation in this room to pursue its own customs, beliefs, and traditions." Then amazingly, in total contrast with every president since World War II, "The United States will not tell you how to live or work or worship. We only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return."
Trump rejected one international organization in particular, created by the globalists to undermine our sovereignty, "The United States will provide no support in recognition to the International Criminal Court. As far as America is concerned, the ICC has no jurisdiction, no legitimacy, and no authority. The ICC claims near-universal jurisdiction over the citizens of every country, violating all principles of justice, fairness, and due process." He then added what most patriots wanted their government to say to the United Nations since its inception. "We will never surrender America's sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy." He encouraged other nations to protect their sovereignty as well, "Around the world, responsible nations must defend against threats to sovereignty not just from global governance, but also from other, new forms of coercion and domination."
Imagine what the globalists in the room thought. The United States had been the lead founder and funder. Moreover, David Rockefeller donated the property to house the infant world government organization that since increasingly absorbs control over all nations of the earth. The United States is the principle reason the United Nations exists. All presidents have supported it. No president has spoken this way. Ronald Reagan alone opposed its growing power over the sovereignty of nations. He reduced US funding for it from 33% to 25%. Patriots cheered the Reagan move but now want more, which Trump seems ready to give. Most want removal from the organization altogether.
Trump turned to illegal immigration and human trafficking as threats to sovereignty also. "The United States is also working with partners in Latin America to confront threats to sovereignty from uncontrolled migration. Tolerance for human struggling and human smuggling and trafficking is not humane. It's a horrible thing that's going on, at levels that nobody has ever seen before. It's very, very cruel."
He addressed why the United States refused to participate in the new UN Global Compact on Migration. "We recognize the right of every nation in this room to set its own immigration policy in accordance with its national interests, just as we ask other countries to respect our own right to do the same - which we are doing. That is one reason the United States will not participate in the new Global Compact on Migration. Migration should not be governed by an international body unaccountable to our own citizens."
Finally he spoke of the foundation of freedom as being national sovereignty, which must be preserved . "To unleash this incredible potential in our people, we must defend the foundations that make it all possible. Sovereign and independent nations are the only vehicle where freedom has ever survived, democracy has ever endured, or peace has ever prospered. And so we must protect our sovereignty and our cherished independence above all."
Trump ended, "So together, let us choose a future of patriotism, prosperity, and pride. Let us choose peace and freedom over domination and defeat. And let us come here to this place to stand for our people and their nations, forever strong, forever sovereign...."
The UN, the heart of world government and globalism, never had an address delivered like this; certainly the most important address of 2018.

Texto completo: Happy new year; now let's talk about endings. A number of high-profile TV series will be departing forever in 2019 — although forever doesn't always mean forever anymore when it comes to TV, which has been reviving old shows with a vengeance lately.
The departures will leave fans bereft; we do tend to get attached to our favorite series, as they come into our homes sometimes for years and years. You were 11 years younger when “The Big Bang Theory" first appeared, and if you're 20 now, you grew up with it, in the way previous generations grew up with “Full House" or “The Brady Bunch."
So here are some of the shows leaving. And may I say I'm sorry for your TV losses.
“Game of Thrones"
Winter is here, and the HBO epic blockbuster will return in April for its eighth and final season. The drama based on George R.R. Martin's books has been HBO's biggest sensation since “The Sopranos," and its end game is, of course, top secret. The last season will include only six episodes, but each one will be supersized. By the way, an HBO prequel set thousands of years before “Game of Thrones" is already in the works from Jane Goldman and Martin, and it will star Naomi Watts.

“The Big Bang Theory"
Now it's time to say goodbye to Sheldon and the gang . . . Actually, it will end in May. Chuck Lorre's CBS megahit turned geek culture into a craze, and it helped Jim Parsons take home not only about $1 million per episode but also four Emmys. With 12 seasons, it is the longest-running multi-camera series in TV history, and no doubt we will be seeing syndicated reruns of it for eternity. It has already spawned a spinoff, “Young Sheldon."
“Veep"
After its seventh term as the funniest show on TV, Julia Louis-Dreyfus's dark political comedy will be stepping down. The HBO show went on hiatus due to Louis-Dreyfus's breast cancer treatment, and it will finally return with seven new episodes at some still-unannounced point this year. Some say “Veep" has lost its edge during the Trump administration, as reality undermines the satire; others, like me, still savor every scene. So far, Louis-Dreyfus has won six Emmys for her work as Selina Meyer, and the show has won three for best comedy.
“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"
The Netflix comedy, from the sharp team of Tina Fey and Robert Carlock, has lasted for four seasons, getting more laughs and cultural humor than you might have expected out of a woman's escape from an underground bunker. The second, final half of season four is due on Jan. 25.
“The Affair"
The Showtime drama told an old story — an extramarital affair and the resulting destruction of two marriages — in a new way, with segments shown from specific characters' points of view. The 10-episode fifth season will give us the end of the reverberations of the affair, but without two of the four leads, Ruth Wilson and Joshua Jackson. Instead, the action will jump ahead a few decades and feature Anna Paquin as the adult daughter of Wilson's Alison and Jackson's Cole.
“Homeland"
The first season of Showtime's terrorism drama was its best, as we tried to figure out if Damian Lewis's Brody was a terrorist or not. Since then, the explosive drama has been wildly uneven, alternately breathtaking and absurd. Later this year, the 12-episode eighth season will end the story of Claire Danes's Carrie Mathison with a return to an overseas setting and a big time jump. Also, showrunner Alex Gansa promises that the plot will not be some kind of allegory for the Trump administration.
“Orange Is the New Black"
So long, Litchfield Penitentiary. Along with already finished “House of Cards," Jenji Kohan's prison dramedy helped Netflix enter the original series market with a bang. Since its premiere, the series has been both a breath of fresh air — featuring a remarkably diverse cast and dozens of finely wrought individual stories — and a bit of a slog. The seventh season, due later this year, will be the last one.
“Transparent"
After the Jeffrey Tambor sexual misconduct scandal, Jill Soloway decided to end the Amazon series later this year with the fifth season — without Tambor's Maura Pfefferman. The show has been groundbreaking in its portrait of a 70-year-old trans woman and her complicated family. Now the focus will presumably turn to her ex-wife and adult children. All we know for certain is that the show — which has included a number of significant musical sequences, will conclude with a two-hour musical. “It will hopefully feel like 'Jesus Christ Superstar' mixed with 'La La Land' mixed with 'Flight of the Conchords' with something more Jewish thrown in," Soloway told the New York Times. “A little 'Yentl.' "
“Broad City"
This Comedy Central gem from Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson has been a little bit of New York City heaven, as two kooky, loving friends living there find their way through their 20s. The fifth season, which begins on Jan. 24, will be the last — which is just right. Good shows that overstay and degrade are the real enemy of the people.
“You're the Worst"
The fifth and final season of this endearing FX series is currently airing, and it appears to be building up to a wedding. Are our favorite cynics actually going to be so uncool as to tie the knot? This anti-romantic comedy managed to be romantic, and moving, too, as Aya Cash's Gretchen dealt with serious depression.
Also on the way out:
“Gotham": Fox's Batman origin story ends with the current season five.
“Jane the Virgin": The twisty CW show ends with its fifth season, due in March.
“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend": The CW's musical comedy wraps with the current season four.
“Mr. Robot": The murky USA drama will return for its fourth and final season later this year.
“The Deuce": HBO's look at the porn industry ends with season three, expected later in the year.
“Elementary": The reimagining of Sherlock Holmes ends late this year after the 13-episode season seven.

Texto completo: A Norwegian Air jet diverted into Shiraz, Iran, last month because of a technical issue, but the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft hasn't been able to leave the country since.
The 186 passengers left Dubai and were heading to Oslo, Norway, when the incident occurred. Another aircraft was able to pick up the passengers and all made it to Oslo a day later. The original plane, however, still hasn't moved.
Norwegian hadn't ever flow to Iran and has no base there, according to The New York Times. The plane apparently is stuck due to U. S. sanctions in Tehran's nuclear program that blocks civilian aircraft sales and restricts service and replacement parts.
"There is no getting around the U. S. sanctions," a Germany-based trade issues lawyer told The New York Times regarding the issue. "Let’s assume they need a spare part and that spare part contains more 10 percent U. S. -origin goods, or technology − that would require a U. S. license. "
"We had a technical issue on the aircraft (a Boeing 737-8 MAX) from Dubai towards Oslo on (Dec. 14), and we made a diversion into Shiraz, Iran, where the plane landed safely," Norwegian Air told USA TODAY in a statement.
"Unfortunately the paperwork necessary to service the plane has taken longer than usual, partly due to fact that we have had to familiarize ourselves with Iranian regulations," the airline continued. "At this moment, we don't have a fixed timeline but we are hoping for it to be as soon as possible so we can get the aircraft back in the air. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

New SC bill could change the way you raise your kids

Texto completo: Parents in South Carolina can get in trouble with the law if they leave their kids in a parked car or let them play in a park by themselves. But a new bill in the state senate wants to change that, clarifying the rules to say kids who are old enough and mature enough don't always have to have adult supervision.
Utah made national headlines when lawmakers approved its "free range parenting" law last year, the New York Times reports. The Utah law, like the proposal for South Carolina, says kids who are mature enough can walk to school or a park, or wait in a car while parents run errands, according to the Times.
The bill up for debate in Columbia would change the state's child abuse and neglect statutes, clarifying the rules for law enforcement and the state Department of Social Services, according to the Free Times.
"This is not saying you can treat your children badly," state Sen. Vincent Sheheen, D-Camden, the author of the legislation, told the newspaper. "But allowing some freedom for your children before they're adults is not neglect."
Sheheen said parents can use common sense to give children more freedom and independence, according to the Free Times. "Clearly you shouldn't leave a kid in a car that's 100 degrees, but if your kid is 12 and you run into the store and it's 50 or 60 degrees outside — I mean, my parents did that," Sheheen told the paper.
The change to the law states, "'Child abuse or neglect' or 'harm' does not occur if the parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's welfare permits the child, whose basic needs are met and who is of sufficient age and maturity to avoid harm or unreasonable risk of harm, to engage in independent activities."
Those activities include walking to school, a nearby store or a park, playing outside, waiting in the car or staying at home alone.
Sheheen told the Free Times the changes would give a "clearer guideline for authorities" on what constitutes child neglect when kids are left alone, the newspaper explains.
"Parents should be free to raise children in ways that they see fit without fear of someone looking over their shoulder as long as they're not harming their child," Sheheen told the Post and Courier.
"We encouraged our children's independence as much as possible," he told the newspaper. "I felt it was very important for us not to micromanage or 'helicopter' their lives."
New York columnist Lenore Skenazy is credited with bringing the "free range parenting" movement to the national stage after she wrote about letting her 9-year-old son ride the New York City subway alone, according to the New York Times.
"Skenazy was roundly criticized – some called her the worst mother in the United States – after she left her son in the department store with $20 and instructions on how to use public transit to get home," according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Utah is the only state to pass a "free range parenting" law, the AJC reports. A similar bill was introduced in Arkansas but did not pass the state house in 2017, according to the newspaper, and several other states have discussed making these types of changes.

Texto completo: Milan Simonich's recent column criticizing Mayor Alan Webber's attempts to ameliorate the very difficult problem of retaining officers for our city is, to be generous, unreasonable ("Mayor's bonus plan doesn't add up," Ringside Seat, Jan. 7). While it's true that the police officers' union president, Tony Trujillo, was hyperbolic in calling the mayor's offer of a stopgap bonus a "slap in the face" and an "insult," it was obviously an opening gambit for negotiations. But Simonich slams Webber for wasting taxpayers' money on his plan for curing the situation. We want the most effective and best educated cops, the most modern tools at their disposal, yet we treat them (and all essential services) as blue collar "assembly line" workers.
Mayor Webber is working extraordinarily hard and transparently to right our city government, and to provide excellent municipal services. It takes time. It takes imagination. Showing good faith to the police force with this bonus offer is a start. Perhaps Simonich should go on some "ride-alongs" with the cops to see what they deal with. It's easy to sit safely in an office at a keyboard and be a curmudgeon.

Santa Fe
Doing the math
Wow. The median home price in Santa Fe is now $412,000 ("S.F. home prices balloon," Jan. 4). Is that good news? Maybe for Realtors and builders, but certainly not for our children. According to salary.com, the average annual gross salary for a Santa Fe Public Schools teacher is $53,276 per year. After taxes and benefits, most teachers here bring home less than $3,000 a month. Perhaps some of our advanced math students can figure out why there is a teacher shortage (and overcrowded classrooms) in Santa Fe. I sure hope that this year our legislators and leaders can "do the math."

Great care
My family and friends and I were in Santa Fe celebrating Christmas, enjoying caroling and hospitality and friendliness extended by the many art gallery and shop owners along Canyon Road. We had just reached the road's end and were crossing the street to go back to our cars, when I misjudged a step and tripped over a curb, falling and badly bruising my face. Santa Fe emergency medical services were there within seconds, helping me to my feet and checking me out.
They provided advice and care, as well as a ride back to our car. I appreciate them being available to help people in need on Christmas Eve. We did take their advice and drove to the hospital to have a CT scan. ER staffers at the hospital were also helpful and professional. I am grateful for the medical professionals who served me, cared for me and rendered assistance. Santa Fe is truly a wonderful place to spend Christmas!

Texto completo: A Michigan Uber driver accused of killing six people and wounding two others in a 2016 shooting spree pleaded guilty to murder Monday just before his trial was set to begin.
The driver, Jason B. Dalton, terrorized the Kalamazoo area on Feb. 20, 2016, when he drove wildly through the city and its suburbs, shooting people outside a car dealership, a Cracker Barrel restaurant and a townhouse complex.
Over a period of hours, he gave Uber customers rides between the seemingly random shootings. The gunfire rattled Western Michigan and raised questions about Uber's screening of its drivers at a time when the ride-hailing service was expanding into smaller cities.
"It helps with community healing, some closure," said Mayor Bobby Hopewell of Kalamazoo. "It's a heinous incident."
Dalton, who was arrested the night of the shootings, initially pleaded not guilty and appeared to be headed to trial until his last-minute plea. Last year, Dalton won a case in the Michigan Court of Appeals that barred prosecutors from using incriminating statements made to police officers. Dalton had spoken to officers shortly after the shootings.
Jury questioning in the case was to begin Monday, with the trial expected to last two weeks. But, with families of the shooting victims gathered in the gallery on Monday morning, Dalton changed course.
His lawyer, Eusebio Solis, withdrew plans to use an insanity defense, and Dalton, shackled around his waist and wearing a dress shirt with an unbuttoned collar, stood at the front of the courtroom and pleaded guilty to every charge, including six counts of murder.
Some people in the courtroom gallery wept as officials read the names of the victims, and Dalton answered "yes" to questions about killing each of them.
"I've wanted this for quite a while," Dalton told the judge when asked whether he understood his pleas.
Dalton will face a mandatory term of life in prison without the possibility of parole on the murder charges when he is sentenced next month. Solis said he had advised his client against pleading guilty.
Solis said plea discussions had been ongoing for months, but that prosecutors dropped no charges and showed no support for a lighter sentence.
Dalton's plea left many questions unanswered about his motive in the rampage. His victims included a retired English teacher, a former state worker, a father and son shopping for cars and a teenage girl who was pronounced dead but ended up surviving.
Hopewell said the shootings had faded from daily conversation in Kalamazoo over the years, but remained imprinted on the city's consciousness. He said people still remembered the fears during the manhunt, "Wondering what's going to happen next? Where is this person?"
The attack, which drew national news attention to Kalamazoo, was denounced by then-President Barack Obama as another instance of largescale gun violence. "I've got to assume all of you are just as tired as I am of seeing this stuff happen in your states," Obama said.
The shooting also brought unflattering attention to Uber, whose officials at the time defended their background check process. Dalton, who had been an Uber driver for only days or weeks, had no serious criminal record.
"No background check process would have made a difference in this case because this person didn't have a criminal history," said Joe Sullivan, the company's chief security officer, in 2016.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump will take his case for a border wall directly to the American people in a presidential address Tuesday night, as the government shutdown continues.
Should you even watch Trump's address?
By Bill Goodykoontz
President Donald Trump wants to address the nation from the Oval Office on Tuesday night to talk about immigration — specifically his desire to build a wall — and, presumably, the shutdown of the federal government.
Broadcast networks are giving the president a slot in prime time to make his case. Cable news outlets will, too. Pundits, armchair and otherwise, have taken to social media to debate whether the networks should have granted Trump the time.
Just what we need, division concerning division.
Should they have? I think, probably, yes.
Although that comes with a major caveat: It is essential that all the networks fact-check Trump in real time, as he's speaking. They have the technology, and they need to use it.
Talker: 'Dreamers' might be the key to ending the government shutdown
Sign-up for Today's Talker newsletter here
There's no requirement that networks air this or any other presidential address. And prime time is expensive real estate. But, typically, if it's something of national importance, they will air a presidential address.
Though not always. They didn't broadcast President Barack Obama's immigration speech in 2014, so there's precedent for not doing so.
The argument for not airing the speech runs something like this: Trump has repeatedly lied about immigration, about the shutdown, about the causes and effects. Plus, he has a history of trashing the news media. So why give him free air time to keep it up, particularly when you can’t challenge misstatements and lies in real time? Why let him mislead even more people on a bigger stage?
The argument for airing it seems simpler: He's the president. But it’s really more complex than that. Again, there's no guarantee of free air time — the government doesn't run the networks. But this president has been different from the start. The regular rules don't apply, no matter what the issue.
But even if you believe Trump won’t be truthful or forthcoming, you can argue that it’s important to get him on the record, in front of the nation, taking about immigration. Then you have the facts of what he said (although for his supporters, that hasn't mattered so far).
Plus, there's a news hook to this address that others have lacked: the shutdown. There are no signs of an agreement any time soon, and it's affecting hundreds of thousands of federal employees. People want answers, and they want responsibility. An address aired on broadcast networks could — could — help provide that.
Of course, there are no guarantees. But if Trump does lie, the networks must point it out AS IT HAPPENS. At this point, it's hard to imagine a win-win situation with any of this, but that might be the best option, at least.

What others are saying
Jonathan Bernstein, Bloomberg: "Going public — the strategy of trying to win support from the people at large, in the hopes that they’ll pressure their representatives to follow the president — mostly didn’t work for Ronald Reagan, didn’t work for Bill Clinton, and didn’t work for Barack Obama. It’s even less likely to work for President Donald Trump, who is less popular now than those presidents were for most of their time in office, and who is trying to sell a policy that consistently polls badly. . . . Overall, speeches of this kind — addresses intended to sway public opinion about an already announced policy — just aren’t very important, even though the context here, the government shutdown and immigration policy, certainly is. "
David Leonhardt, The New York Times: "I’ll confess to being torn about the major television networks’ decision to air President Trump’s speech Tuesday night on the border wall. On the one hand, the networks said no to President Obama when he asked for air time to give a speech on immigration in 2014. They said it was too political to deserve a free prime-time spot — and Trump’s speech is clearly political, as well. But if they had said no to Trump, the decision would have dominated the political conversation for at least a couple of days. . . . I do hope the networks fact-check Trump as soon as the speech is over. It’s likely to be filled with his usual array of false claims. "
Sally Kohn, USA TODAY: "Trump will speak to the American people about his demands for a southern border wall, which have led him to shut down the government. He will, undoubtedly, gin up fear about a 'crisis' mounting at the U. S. -Mexico border. . . . Americans don’t support Trump’s wall because they know the truth — that we have a tough immigration and border enforcement system already working, and way bigger problems to focus on fixing in our nation. "
What our readers are saying
Unfortunately, President Donald Trump will be preaching to the choir with his address. The Trump haters will still hate Trump after the speech. Immediately following the speech, MSNBC and CNN will quickly take to the air and refute everything that Trump said, and who do you think the liberals will believe?
— Robert Johnson
Democrats have voted for border security in the past. They're just opposed to Trump and his wall. Once again, Democrats prioritize liberal politics over the safety of American citizens. To Democrats, U. S. citizens are acceptable collateral damage now.
— Mira Dean
"Fake news" are desperate to stop anything that counters their globalist agenda. Trump doesn't attack the free press; he attacks fake news.
— Cara Claudel
Stop the call to censor our president! Let people watch his address and decide what to believe.
— Angela Harrell Montgomery

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump vowed a "prudent" withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, embracing a new, more cautious timeline on Monday while appearing to deny that he had ever ordered an immediate troop departure in the first place.
"We will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!" Trump said in a morning tweet. That was "no different from my original statements," he said, accusing the news media of inaccurately reporting "my intentions on Syria."
Last month, Trump declared the Islamic State group defeated in Syria and said troops would be "coming back now." Since then, senior officials have issued a series of statements that have cast doubt on his promise of a quick departure.
The president's endorsement of a flexible departure, conditioned on the still-to-come defeat of the Islamic State, was the latest indication of his administration's zigzagging foreign policy, in which decisions are often made by dramatic presidential tweets and followed by more circumspect policies reflecting top advisers' views.
The initial plan for a quick withdrawal, which would require turning over the U.S.-supported effort against remaining militants to NATO ally Turkey, was met with dismay among officials and lawmakers who feared the Islamic State could return in force. A day after Trump's announcement, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest.
Trump's new remarks appeared to endorse a revised proposal, floated by National Security Adviser John Bolton a day earlier, that would allow U.S. troops and their local allies to extinguish a small but stubborn militant force before they depart. It would also require Turkey to refrain from attacking Syrian Kurdish troops who are the chief U.S. partner on the ground.
The evolving plans came as Bolton traveled Monday to Ankara, Turkey's capital, for talks with Turkish officials on the U.S. withdrawal, including protection of the American-allied Syrian Democratic Forces, which Turkey has vowed to expel from northeast Syria.
Officials across the government have scrambled in recent days to keep up with shifting statements from administration leaders, even as they continued to make plans for a near-term military exit that they cautioned could squander the fruits of a four-year military effort. There are more than 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria.
While Trump initially demanded a 30-day departure, officials said the administration later settled on an exit within 120 days to give the military more time to break down bases and safely remove equipment and personnel. The latest comments from Trump and Bolton intensified uncertainty about what would occur.
Trump's pullout plan fueled concerns among allied nations, including France and Britain, who have sent their own troops to Syria. It also drew criticism from his own party, including from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who on Sunday said Trump had "made a mistake" with his initial pronouncement but was now "slowing down."
On Monday, the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee accused Trump of "changing course like a drunken sailor."
"It shows that our president literally doesn't know what he is doing. He is making it up as he goes," Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., told CNN. "The way he is going about it is disastrous."
But Trump and his top advisers were defiant Monday as they denied that their Syria plans had changed.
"The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria," Trump said in the same tweet, referring to articles on Sunday from numerous publications, including the Times and The Washington Post, that noted the shifting accounts of the military exit. "No different from my original statements."

Here’s how the federal government shutdown is affecting Texas

Texto completo: Monday marked day 17 of the federal government’s partial shutdown, the long-running result of a stalemate between President Donald Trump and Congress over Trump’s promised border wall. In its third week, the shutdown is now the longest since December 1995, when the federal government stayed closed 21 full days.
Not everything is closed. Law enforcement and mail workers are still on the job; about 75 percent of the government is funded. But operations have been impacted at nine sprawling federal departments, and some 800,000 of the country’s 2.1 million federal workers are not being paid.
What does all that mean for Texas?
Work, but no pay
Thousands of federal workers in Texas are among those nationwide who have been compelled to work without pay as the government remains partially shut down.
Thousands of Transportation Security Administration workers staffing airport security screenings are expected to continue working. But hundreds have been calling in sick, according to a Friday report from CNN — including two to three times more workers missing work than usual at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
"This problem of call-outs is really going to explode over the next week or two when employees miss their first paycheck," a DFW union official told CNN. "TSA officers are telling the union they will find another way to make money. That means calling out to work other jobs."
For some federal workers in Texas, there may be good news: According to Lisa Givens, a spokeswoman for the Texas Workforce Commission, federal workers who are furloughed or working without a paycheck may be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. As of Monday, the commission has received more than 1,800 initial claims associated with the shutdown, Givens said.
Immigration and border security
As workers considered “essential,” Border Patrol agents remain on duty — but it’s not clear when they will be paid.
Immigration courts, which are contained within the Department of Justice, have seen major delays amid the shutdown. Most are closed, with the exception of courts hearing cases of migrants who are currently detained. There is already an enormous backlog: There are more than 800,000 pending immigration cases nationwide, including about 119,000 in Texas. Immigration court dates that fall during the shutdown may be postponed for as long as three or four years, The New York Times reported.
Justice delayed
The shutdown has thrust much of the federal court system into chaos, with furloughs at the Department of Justice and funding running out for federal district courts. Federal courts, operating on “limited funds,” aim to sustain paid operations through next Friday.
Attorneys for the federal government asked for a pause in proceedings of a Texas-led challenge to the Affordable Care Act, which a federal judge declared unconstitutional last month. Justice Department lawyers are prohibited from working “except in very limited circumstances,” attorneys wrote in the case filing. That restriction could delay already slow-running civil cases.
National parks are open… sort of.
The shutdown has reached Texas’ 14 national parks. Sites across the country remain open, but there are no visitor services being provided — that’s everything from trash collection to road maintenance. That marks a departure from practice in previous extended government shutdowns, when the service blocked public access to many sites in order to decrease risks of injury to visitors or damage to the sites. The Washington Post reported that three people have died in accidents at National Parks Service sites since the shutdown began last month.
The Post also reported Sunday that the Interior Department will begin paying for expanded operations at some popular sites using entrance fees — what one top official called an “extraordinary step.” But officials have not yet made clear which sites might restart operations, according to Politico.
The Internal Revenue Service is among the agencies affected, slowing down financial transactions for some lenders and home buyers. Many lenders (for mortgages, student loans or other borrowing) require official income verification from the IRS — and those transcripts are not being sent as the IRS remains largely shuttered. Tax refunds could also be delayed, especially if the shutdown persists.

Texto completo: Man, that ended badly.
December limped to an ugly conclusion as nearly everyone from Wall Street to Main Street took a year-end pounding not seen in three generations. Pick an investment sector (stocks, bonds, commodities); a nation state (the U.S., China, or the European Union); or a political system (a democratic republic, parliamentary, or single-party rule), and almost every one of them finished 2018 underwater, under siege, or under a cloud.
The connective tissue to all is as old and bowlegged as Father Time himself  bitter, stalemated politics. When national and international leaders fail to solve regional problems (Brexit, anyone?) or go out of their way to fuel new, global problems (cue tariffs), then investors from New York to Tokyo take their money and run.
Run where?
Out the door. Any door. Every door.
That anywhere-but-here behavior is in direct contrast to the past 10 years where the safest place to run was Wall Street. From its post-recession low of 7,365 in February 2009, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to 26,828 on Oct. 3, 2018. Since that lofty high, however, the Dow has lost one-sixth of its value mostly because difficult-but-solvable economic problems  implementation of Brexit, for example, or the year-ending U.S. budget standoff  ran smack into political hackery and demagogy.
And thats just not the case in Washington or London, but also in Paris, Brussels, Warsaw, New Delhi, Budapest, Brasilia, Mexico City, and elsewhere.
Washington, once a beacon for freedom and free markets, now leads this parade of retreat. After using 2017 to tear up treaties, betray friendships, and shred hard-won, post-war norms, the U.S. spent most of last year confirming that its an erratic trader, unreliable ally, and geopolitical cipher.
As such, 2019 begins with much of the world thinking America has lost its political bearing and collective marbles. It's right.
For proof, consider where New Years Day found the nation.
One-fourth of the U.S government, including the Department of Agriculture, was closed for the 11th straight day over a piddling $3.5 billion, literally a microscopic grain of sand in the miles of beach that is our federal spending.
Even more incredible, the number of active investigations of alleged corruption within the Trump administration now stands at 17. Thats a staggering total made even more so in that it occurred under a Republican-led government.
Equally worrisome, the White House is becoming an empty island: 65 percent of all senior White House aides, according to the Dec. 31 New York Times, have departed since inauguration day. Even more remarkable, 10 of these now-gone officials were members of the Trump cabinet.
And for those of us whose last civics lesson was decades ago, there are 15 Cabinet posts; 16, if you include the vice president. By either measure, losing two-thirds of your departmental leaders in less than two years is historical, debilitating, and just plain nuts.
Arguably, the only numbers worse than the White House unemployment rate are numbers that detail the U.S. economy.
One year after Republicans in Congress bullied through a $1.9 trillion tax cut, their outrageous (and they knew it) prediction of 5 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth has given way to  and fingers crossed at that  a much more realistic estimate of two percent growth.
That downward GDP revision means their supply-side, voodoo tax cut, however, is certain to increase one thing: the federal deficit. Before the cut, the 2018 deficit was projected to be $500 billion. This past October  at, not coincidentally, the same time the stock market began stumbling toward its worst December since 1931  the deficit weighed in at a fat $779 billion.
The 2019 federal deficit will be even higher; current estimates place it north of $1 trillion. Worse, the overall national debt is forecast to climb by $16 trillion over the next decade, due mostly to the 2017 tax cut and increased spending pushed by the White House and Congress.
So, Happy New Year and lets pray 2019s rough start isnt a precursor of the year ahead.
But dont count on it.

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

Expect to hear howling this year

Texto completo: In Willa Cather's novel "My Antonia," there are two kind Russian farmers named Peter and Pavel who have settled on the Nebraska prairie. On his deathbed, Pavel tells the story of how they came to emigrate there.
Many years before, back in Russia, the two young men had been the groomsmen at a friend's wedding. The party went on well after midnight and eventually a caravan of seven sledges carried the families through the snow, back to where they were staying. As they rode, faint streaks of shadow - hundreds of them - could be seen dashing through the trees along the trail. Suddenly, the howling of wolves erupted from all directions.
The horses took off and the wolves attacked. The rear sledge hit a clump and overturned. The shrieks were horrific as the wolves pounced on their human prey. Another sledge tipped and then another, and the swarms of wolves descended on the families.
Pavel and Peter were in the lead sledge, carrying the bride and groom. They were careening at top speed, but one of their horses was now near death with exhaustion. Pavel turned to the groom. They would have to lighten their load. He pointed to the bride. The groom refused to let her be tossed over. Pavel fought with him and tried to rip her away. In the scuffle he threw them both out and to the wolves.
Peter and Pavel survived - but lived in infamy. They were the monsters who had thrown a bride to the wolves. They were forced to flee to the New World.
The story reminds us how thin the crust of civilization really is. It reminds us of what otherwise good people are capable at moments of severe stress and crisis, when fear is up and when conflict - red in tooth and claw - takes control.
It's an especially good story to tell as we enter 2019, because this looks to be the year of the wolves - the year when savage and previously unimaginable things might happen.
It will be a year of divided government and unprecedented partisan conflict. It will be a year in which Donald Trump is isolated and unrestrained as never before. And it will be in this atmosphere that indictments will fall, provoking not just a political crisis but a constitutional one.
There are now over a dozen investigations into Trump's various scandals. If we lived in a healthy society, the ensuing indictments would be handled in a serious way - somber congressional hearings, dispassionate court proceedings. Everybody would step back and be sobered by the fact that our very system of law is at stake.
But we don't live in a healthy society and we don't have a healthy president.
Trump doesn't recognize, understand or respect institutional authority. He only understands personal power. He sees every conflict as a personal conflict in which he destroys or gets destroyed.
When the indictments come down, Trump won't play by the rules. He'll seek to delegitimize those rules. He'll seek to delegitimize our legal institutions. He'll personalize every indictment, slander every prosecutor. He'll seek to destroy the edifice of law in order to save himself.
We know the language he'll use. It will be the anti-establishment, anti-institutional language that has been coursing through the left and right for the past few decades: The establishment is corrupt, the game is rigged, the elites are out to get you.
At that point congressional leaders will face the defining choice of their careers: Where does their ultimate loyalty lie, to the Constitution or to their party?
If their loyalty is to the Constitution, they will step back and figure out, in a bipartisan way, how to hold the sort of hearings that Congress held during the Watergate scandal - hearings that inspired trust in the system. They will step back and find men and women of integrity - the modern versions of Archibald Cox, Elliot Richardson and Judge John Sirica - who would work to restore decency amid the moral rot.
On the other hand, if they put party above nation, they will see this crisis as just another episode in our long-running political circus. They'll fall back in partisan lines. They'll hurl abuse. Their primary concern will be: How can this help me in 2020?
If that happens, then the roughly 40 percent of Americans who support Trump will see serious evidence that he committed felonies, but they won't care! They'll conclude that this is not about law or integrity. It's just a political show trial. They'll see there is no higher authority that all Americans are accountable to. It's just power and popularity straight through.
If that happens, we'll have to face the fact that our Constitution and system of law were not strong enough to withstand the partisan furies that now define our politics. We'll have to face the fact that America has become another fragile state - a kakistocracy, where laws are passed and broken without consequence, where good people lay low and where wolves are left free to prey on the weak.

Trump workers: They're illegal

Texto completo: A former kitchen employee at one of President Donald Trump's golf clubs in New Jersey said her superiors kept her name and those of other undocumented workers off a list of people to be vetted by the Secret Service before a Trump visit to the club in 2016.
Emma Torres, 43, an immigrant from Ecuador, said she informed a human resources official at the club that she did not have papers to live legally in the United States when she was asked to submit her information for a clearance check. She said the names of undocumented workers were then excised from a list turned over to the Secret Service.
Torres could not recall the name of the person who modified the list or the exact date of the incident.
But she said she continued in her job at the club and was later working in the kitchen when Trump visited the club under Secret Service protection.
Torres' account, first reported by The New York Times, suggests that the presence of undocumented workers at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., was known by at least some managers. Last month, several women went public to say that they worked at the club without legal immigration status.
Trump Organization officials and White House officials declined to comment.
The presence of undocumented workers at one of the president's signature golf clubs stands in sharp juxtaposition to his rhetoric against illegal immigration.
Since launching his White House bid, Trump has vowed to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out migrants, accusing them of bringing drugs and crime into the country. His demand for more than $5 billion to build the wall has led to the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.
During his presidential campaign, Trump touted his company's hiring practices. In fall 2016, when he opened a new Trump hotel in Washington, he told the assembled audience: "We didn't have one illegal immigrant on the job. Everybody knows it."
Anibal Romero, a Newark-based immigration attorney, said he now represents five immigrants who say they had worked at Trump's Bedminster club without legal status in recent years.
Investigators with the FBI and the New Jersey attorney general's office have collected employment documents on his clients in recent months, he said, an indication that the agencies may be scrutinizing the hiring practices of the president's club.
Torres' experience and that of another worker suggest that the Secret Service may not have had a full picture of who was in proximity to Trump and his guests when they visited the Bedminster club.
Victorina Morales, 45, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala who said she worked as a housekeeper in a different part of the club, cleaning Trump's villa, said Secret Service agents gave her a pin to wear every time Trump visited.
"I had to wear the pin to get into the golf club," Morales said in an interview Thursday. Morales said she recalls one pin having an American flag and another with a design that she did not recall.
Secret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan said a Secret Service pin bearing the U.S. flag is a novelty item and "is not used by the Secret Service as a means of identification, verification or access control."
She declined to discuss what kind of pins agents may have provided Morales.
Official pins indicating that someone has permission to enter secure areas have other designs; they are provided to venue staffers by the Secret Service only after a background check, according to former officials.
It is unclear whether Morales received such a screening. She said she did not recall being asked to submit her information in advance but said she assumed her supervisor provided it.
Milhoan said the agency "does not comment on our protective operations, including the administration of our name-check program." She declined to say whether officials ever screened Morales or Torres for a Trump visit to the Bedminster club.
The revelations about undocumented workers at Bedminster surfaced publicly last month, when Morales and Sandra Diaz, a 46-year-old Costa Rican native, said they were hired by the New Jersey club despite their lack of legal immigration status.
Morales said Thursday that she told a Bedminster supervisor when she applied for the housekeeping job in 2013 that she did not have proper immigration papers to work legally in the United States. She recalled being told: "It's no problem here. You don't need papers."
"They knew I didn't have good papers," said Morales, who worked at the club until last month. Romero, her attorney, provided The Washington Post with payroll and tax documents from recent years that list her employment at the Bedminster golf course.
Trump Organization officials have repeatedly declined to address the specific allegations by the workers.
Last month, spokeswoman Amanda Miller said in a statement: "We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices. If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately."
A person close to the organization said an internal investigation of claims made by former workers at Bedminster produced no credible information to support a range of allegations they made, including that managers were aware of employees without legal status.
Torres said she began working at the club in early 2015, doing housekeeping, then she moved to the kitchen staff, first as a dishwasher and later in food preparation, earning $14.50 per hour.
She said she got the job with a fake Social Security number.
Morales said she worked with Torres in housekeeping and said she recalled her transferring to the kitchen staff.
Trump visited Bedminster at least six times during the 2016 campaign, according to news coverage of his travel.
Around the time he became the Republican nominee, Torres said, security got tighter at the golf club, particularly when he was visiting.
Torres said she was later working at the club on occasions when Trump visited.
At times, Secret Service agents who accompanied him were Hispanic, Torres said, and the kitchen staffers would chat with them in Spanish.
Torres said she left her job in Bedminster in 2017 because she felt uncomfortable as a woman in a mostly male kitchen.
She also said she did not like Trump's comments about immigrants.

Texto completo: Yeah, it's just comedy.
Unfunny comedy. Sour grapes comedy, bitter and self-pitying. Banal routines about visiting the doctor and rude teenage daughters mixed up with shock-jock tactics like harshing on the Parkland kids and punching down on trans people.
Yes, Louis C.K. is back on the comedy-club hustings, and we're supposed to let him know all is forgiven. Is it out of line to point out that his routines are getting meaner, angrier, more shrill? That “speaking the unspeakable" sometimes translates into catering to the worst impulses and most reactionary portions of your audience?
Some can forgive C.K. — some already have. In the 48-minute audiotape of an unannounced Dec. 16 gig at a club in Levittown, N.Y., that surfaced on YouTube last Sunday. The audience roars with laughter at the disgraced comedian's observations and one-liners, some of which land and a lot of which don't. You had to be there, I guess. You certainly can't hear the people who aren't laughing, You can definitely hear the guy sitting in the audience near the microphone who howls in delight at most of the jokes, especially the ones that dump on women. It's not a good look.
It's been a little over a year since the career of Louis C.K. seemingly vanished overnight after revelations that he had habitually masturbated in front of unwilling or clearly uncomfortable women. Stories about this misbehavior had been circulating in and outside comedy circles for years, but a New York Times story made it fully public. Networks like FX and HBO and Netflix dropped him in response; the release of C.K.'s film “I Love You, Daddy," was scrapped.
Louis C.K. remains toxic in the larger entertainment industry and culture, but the male-oriented world of stand-up has never really left him. After less than a year in exile, C.K. resurfaced in comedy clubs in August, doing spot gigs, always unannounced — hoping, I guess, that by continuing to Not Go Away, audiences would let him back in. And, truth to tell, it's working. To a point,
Whenever a fresh C.K. appearance is reported, the public conversation turns heated. Say many: How dare he show himself onstage as if he hadn't done something seamy and despicable — as if, given enough time, pleasuring himself as a kind of weird date move was something we could just forget about? His supporters respond, well, don't pay to see him, then — just don't listen. Which is a moot point when you've gone to a comedy club expecting not to see Louis C.K., and there he is. When maybe you used to think the guy was funny, maybe even a genius, but now all that fellow feeling has been wiped out by the image of a powerful entertainer getting off by showing his penis to women with less clout than he has.
And, right, it's comedy, say the fans — meaning it's only comedy, so don't take it so seriously, or it's sacrosanct-free-speech comedy, so back off, man. And it's true: Louis C.K. has the right to climb onstage and say whatever he wants. And people have a right to laugh at his jokes without thinking too much about the matter, while other people have the right to say, no, you're not funny, Louis, you're disgusting or sad. You're not as sympathetic as you think when you complain about losing money or about a bad year that's “like having diarrhea that keeps going." You're not being truthful enough about what you did and who it affected and why you might feel compelled in the first place to whip out your junk in front of various and sundry women. I supposed that's a discussion for you and your therapist, which I hope for your sake is happening.
The fans of Louis C.K. — I admit, I used to be one — want to position him as some brave defender of the unspeakable, a pushback against the hypocrisy of prudish society. Like he's Lenny Bruce. But Louis C.K. isn't Lenny Bruce. Honestly, Lenny Bruce wasn't Lenny Bruce, which you probably know if you've taken the time to listen to his routines.
You know who was Lenny Bruce? George Carlin. In the sense that Carlin knocked down boundaries, took heat for it, and was profoundly funny in the bargain. Good lord, I miss that man, not least for what he'd have to say to some of the people offended by Louis C.K., to some of the people defending Louis C.K., and to Louis C.K. himself. Carlin was an equal-opportunity excoriator, and his rants were grounded by a moralism that had nothing to do with conventional morality. Above all, I think Carlin understood that it was possible to be politically incorrect without being intolerant — that “political correctness" is in fact what people call empathy who are too scared, ignorant, or angry to practice it.
Another person Louis C.K. doesn't sound much like is Richard Pryor, who looked deep into his screwed-up actions and addictions and took full responsibility for them on a stand-up stage. Who made you ache with laughter and sorrow at the ways in which a man can blind himself. No, what Louis C.K. really sounds like on that Dec. 16 club tape is an old man, one who can't understand why he lost his perch at the top and who blames everybody but himself. Whose comedy once walked a fascinating line between seeming to practice intolerance and simultaneously calling attention to it and who now just finds solace in the first part of the equation.
There are a lot of get-off-my-lawn moments on that recent club appearance that say more about Louis C.K. than he may realize. The routine about the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., is the one, about halfway in, that finally made me bail: “They testify in front of Congress, these kids. What are you doing? You're young, you should be crazy, you should be unhinged! Not sitting there in a suit saying, 'I'm here to tell you. . .' [Expletive] you. You're not interesting because you went to a high school where kids got shot. You didn't get shot! You pushed some fat kid in the way and now I've got to listen to you talking?"
Yep, Louis C.K. has the right to say such things. And you have the right to think he's a hopeless jackass and to pity an audience who thinks he's some kind of hero.

Texto completo: On Sunday night, Kyle Buchanan, The Times's new Carpetbagger columnist, will cover the Golden Globes. For most, Hollywood awards shows like the Academy Awards or the Golden Globes are one-night-only, celebrity-packed television events, with sparkling gowns and scripted speeches. But for Mr. Buchanan, awards season starts in September and spans most of the winter.
He sees more than 200 movies a year and spends his days filing stories and his nights attending the parties, concerts and dinners -- which are carefully planned to campaign to the voting bodies who give out the awards.
During this time, Hollywood's whole ecosystem is on display, and for a pop-culture critic like Mr. Buchanan, the image can be telling. "If the Oscar nominations provide a snapshot of that year in Hollywood," Mr. Buchanan recently wrote in his column, "and Hollywood helps shape the way we see ourselves, then examining them can tell us not only where the industry is headed but also where our cultural blind spots still lie."
In an interview, Mr. Buchanan discussed the film beat and the publicity machine, and shared what he's learned about movie stars after covering Hollywood for nearly a decade. His answers have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.
I've heard the Oscar season feels like a political campaign. Has that been your experience?
Yeah, it's a political campaign with better fashion, I would say. There's a whole lot of shaking hands and kissing babies, for sure. And a lot of selfie taking.
Why is it like that?
There are a lot of different reasons. There are smaller movies that have to rely on award-season attention, if they hope to stand out. There's so much content out there, so much pop culture, and if you're in the Oscar conversation, it can be the difference between getting lost and having everybody know the name of your movie.
Also, for many people in Hollywood, winning an Oscar is something that they've been rehearsing in a mirror since they were likely very young. So it provides them a critical canonization that maybe they've long desired or wanted.
What can you learn from watching the publicity machine at work?
There are a lot of things you can parse. The more you do it, the more you can tell how confident a studio is in their campaign by simply looking at the restaurants they book or the stars or directors they get to co-host the party.
How do you think growing up in Southern California has impacted how you look at Hollywood?
I grew up just outside Los Angeles, which probably helps give me the right amount of distance but kept me close enough to understand how this system works.
I could hear something from my waiter in a restaurant or from somebody who's standing in line for the bathroom at a party that can crack open an idea or give me a tip about a major story that I could end up writing.
What do you think readers don't understand about awards season?
That when it is at its peak, you could probably go from one event to another event all day. You might go to a breakfast honoring somebody, to a talk that they're giving at 11, to a lunch celebrating a different movie, to an afternoon screening hosted by a friend of the filmmaker who's won an Oscar already, to a dinner that's in honor of a big popular hit that they're trying to re-contextualize, to drinks, to a concert, and then an after party at the Chateau Marmont.
Do you still get star-struck?
Fortunately, no, I don't. I think that's the thing about doing a lot of interviews with people is it really makes you realize that these are just people.
These are working actors, not just superstars.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Experts ponder scope of Shanahan's interim role

Texto completo: The Trump administration's contention that acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan can stay in his new role "indefinitely" without being nominated as the permanent Pentagon chief could face constitutional challenges, according to legal experts, who were split on whether those protests would go anywhere.
Shanahan took over the job Tuesday following the resignation of Jim Mattis, and he has held the role of deputy defense secretary since July 2017. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Friday that Shanahan could serve in an acting capacity indefinitely at Trump's discretion.
Trump claimed in late December that "everybody and his uncle" and "everybody and his aunt" has interest in becoming defense secretary. He added that Shanahan "could be there for a long time" but did not say whether he meant in an acting capacity.
Other possible candidates floated in White House discussions include Jim Webb, who served as secretary of the Navy and an assistant secretary of defense under the Reagan administration before swapping parties and serving one term as a Democratic senator from Virginia. Three people familiar with the administration's reasoning, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, confirmed the discussions had taken place. The New York Times first reported the administration was considering Webb.
Webb, who launched a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2015, shares Trump's disdain for lengthy military interventions abroad and served in Vietnam as a Marine officer, earning a Navy Cross.
However, in a tweet on Friday, Trump denied Webb is being considered. "I'm sure he is a fine man, but I don't know Jim, and never met him. Patrick Shanahan, who is Acting Secretary of Defense, is doing a great job!"
Speculation about Shanahan's future comes as the Pentagon attempts to project an air of normalcy following the departure of Mattis, a widely respected retired Marine general. In his Dec. 20 resignation letter, Mattis offered to stay in office through Feb. 28 to ensure a smooth transition, but Trump abruptly installed Shanahan three days later.
The administration's determination that Shanahan could hold the job on a temporary basis in perpetuity is likely based, in part, on the Goldwater-Nichols Act, which outlines the principles for civilian control of the military.
Arnold L. Punaro, a retired two-star Marine general who assisted in the act's creation, said there is no limit under the law on how long a confirmed deputy defense secretary can stay in the role.
However, the law's framers never intended to have someone carry out those duties indefinitely, he said.
Still, Shanahan's indefinite stay could face legal challenges.
Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said there is no legal dispute over whether Shanahan can serve as acting defense secretary for a short period because he was already confirmed as deputy defense secretary.
"The harder question is whether the Constitution allows him to serve in that role indefinitely," Vladeck said. "The longer he continues to hold that position, the more likely that someone will seek to litigate that issue in court."
A challenge, Vladeck said, could come under the appointments clause of the Constitution, which states that the president shall nominate Cabinet officials "by and with the advice and consent of the Senate."
Legal expert Anne Joseph O'Connell of Stanford Law School agreed that there was no time limit on a deputy secretary serving as an acting secretary, "but the Constitution may impose some limits on acting in the very top jobs." She said no legal decisions directly address the point but that she believes the courts will allow acting officials only on a temporary basis.
Martin S. Lederman, a visiting associate professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said Trump should nominate a new defense secretary as soon as possible. However, he said it would not violate the appointments clause to leave Shanahan in place because the Senate had already confirmed him as deputy defense secretary.
The situation is not the same with the attorney general, Lederman said. Trump's decision to fire Jeff Sessions and appoint former federal prosecutor Matthew G. Whitaker in an acting role without a confirmation hearing for any post "truly is a legal problem."
In that case, Trump bypassed Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to do so.
Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, Shanahan can carry out defense secretary duties for 210 days, said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School. That limit can be extended if Trump nominates someone else to hold the job permanently.
The greatest obstacle for those who would seek to prevent Shanahan from holding the job temporarily for a sustained period is timing, Turley said.
Trump will probably have a nominee within 210 days, and any litigation would probably take longer to address, he said.
"There is roughly two years left to the administration," Turley said. "Critics are running out of runway for such challenges as we get into 2019."

Expect to hear howling this year

Texto completo: In Willa Cather's novel "My Antonia," there are two kind Russian farmers named Peter and Pavel who have settled on the Nebraska prairie. On his deathbed, Pavel tells the story of how they came to emigrate there.
Many years before, back in Russia, the two young men had been the groomsmen at a friend's wedding. The party went on well after midnight and eventually a caravan of seven sledges carried the families through the snow, back to where they were staying. As they rode, faint streaks of shadow - hundreds of them - could be seen dashing through the trees along the trail. Suddenly, the howling of wolves erupted from all directions.
The horses took off and the wolves attacked. The rear sledge hit a clump and overturned. The shrieks were horrific as the wolves pounced on their human prey. Another sledge tipped and then another, and the swarms of wolves descended on the families.
Pavel and Peter were in the lead sledge, carrying the bride and groom. They were careening at top speed, but one of their horses was now near death with exhaustion. Pavel turned to the groom. They would have to lighten their load. He pointed to the bride. The groom refused to let her be tossed over. Pavel fought with him and tried to rip her away. In the scuffle he threw them both out and to the wolves.
Peter and Pavel survived - but lived in infamy. They were the monsters who had thrown a bride to the wolves. They were forced to flee to the New World.
The story reminds us how thin the crust of civilization really is. It reminds us of what otherwise good people are capable at moments of severe stress and crisis, when fear is up and when conflict - red in tooth and claw - takes control.
It's an especially good story to tell as we enter 2019, because this looks to be the year of the wolves - the year when savage and previously unimaginable things might happen.
It will be a year of divided government and unprecedented partisan conflict. It will be a year in which Donald Trump is isolated and unrestrained as never before. And it will be in this atmosphere that indictments will fall, provoking not just a political crisis but a constitutional one.
There are now over a dozen investigations into Trump's various scandals. If we lived in a healthy society, the ensuing indictments would be handled in a serious way - somber congressional hearings, dispassionate court proceedings. Everybody would step back and be sobered by the fact that our very system of law is at stake.
But we don't live in a healthy society and we don't have a healthy president.
Trump doesn't recognize, understand or respect institutional authority. He only understands personal power. He sees every conflict as a personal conflict in which he destroys or gets destroyed.
When the indictments come down, Trump won't play by the rules. He'll seek to delegitimize those rules. He'll seek to delegitimize our legal institutions. He'll personalize every indictment, slander every prosecutor. He'll seek to destroy the edifice of law in order to save himself.
We know the language he'll use. It will be the anti-establishment, anti-institutional language that has been coursing through the left and right for the past few decades: The establishment is corrupt, the game is rigged, the elites are out to get you.
At that point congressional leaders will face the defining choice of their careers: Where does their ultimate loyalty lie, to the Constitution or to their party?
If their loyalty is to the Constitution, they will step back and figure out, in a bipartisan way, how to hold the sort of hearings that Congress held during the Watergate scandal - hearings that inspired trust in the system. They will step back and find men and women of integrity - the modern versions of Archibald Cox, Elliot Richardson and Judge John Sirica - who would work to restore decency amid the moral rot.
On the other hand, if they put party above nation, they will see this crisis as just another episode in our long-running political circus. They'll fall back in partisan lines. They'll hurl abuse. Their primary concern will be: How can this help me in 2020?
If that happens, then the roughly 40 percent of Americans who support Trump will see serious evidence that he committed felonies, but they won't care! They'll conclude that this is not about law or integrity. It's just a political show trial. They'll see there is no higher authority that all Americans are accountable to. It's just power and popularity straight through.
If that happens, we'll have to face the fact that our Constitution and system of law were not strong enough to withstand the partisan furies that now define our politics. We'll have to face the fact that America has become another fragile state - a kakistocracy, where laws are passed and broken without consequence, where good people lay low and where wolves are left free to prey on the weak.

Texto completo: In the 2018 election, America's shrinking segment of white evangelicals mobilized strongly for the Republican Party - but the rising cohort of nonreligious Americans failed to exert their full political power.
As secularism grows relentlessly, white evangelicals have declined to a mere 15 percent of the U.S. population (down from 20 percent in 2012). But they're so ardent for conservative causes that they constituted 26 percent among the 113 million voters who cast ballots on Nov. 6. And they gave three-fourths of their votes to GOP candidates, according to exit polls.
In contrast, Americans who say their religion is "none have climbed to one-fourth of the population, but they were only 17 percent of voters this year. Skeptic-agnostic-disinterested folks apparently shun politics along with church worship.
I think it's a shame that "nones mostly shrug while white evangelicals throw themselves into elections. Nonreligious Americans tend to hold liberal, compassionate, progressive views, and if their full potential could be realized, the nation's values would improve.
Prodding "nones to become politically active - to show them the importance of democracy involvement - should be a top goal of the secular movement.
On the other side, prodding is fierce among white evangelicals. A New York Times report titled "God's Red Army outlined a massive fundamentalist blitz designed to generate born-again votes for Republicans on Election Day.
For example, Ralph Reed's Faith & Freedom Coalition budgeted $18 million "to micro-target around 125 million social conservative voters across 19 different states through door-to-door interactions, digital ads, phone calls and mailers, The Christian Post reported. A total of 28 million digital ads were emailed to smartphones and laptops on the weekend before balloting.
Further, the Family Research Council sent 36-page "values voter guides to 28,000 far-right pastors before the election, and also sent "values buses to key congressional districts as mobile get-out-the-vote units.
In addition, Watchmen on the Wall held "pastor briefings in various states to help ministers mobilize their congregations for Republicans.
Technically, preachers are forbidden to endorse political parties or candidates - but the electioneering blitz left no doubt that the "pro-life party is the GOP, which also champions "religious freedom, meaning the right to hate gays, Muslims and other "enemies.
As the pre-election operation went ballistic, longtime American Atheists leader Ed Buckner wished sarcastically that the Rapture would whisk all the fundamentalists to heaven before they could vote. Organizing beats snark every time, Ed.
After the election, Ralph Reed boasted at a news conference at the National Press Club:
"We had an astonishing level of evangelical voters cast their ballots. This is the most ambitious and the most effective voter-education, get-out-the-vote program directed at the faith-based vote in a midterm election in modern political history.
He said the fundamentalist turnout prevented a Democratic "blue wave from inflicting much worse damage on Republicans.
I wish that the booming secular movement could find ways to motivate nonreligious voters, to offset such born-again blitzes.
Until that happens, I simply hope that the steady retreat of religion in America will reduce white evangelicals to an ever-smaller fringe, a petty clique unable to sway elections.

Year's best, trendiest diets revealed

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.
Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.
Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets of the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle.
U.S. News and World Report has released its annual rankings of the Best Diets for 2019, revealing the Mediterranean diet was the best overall choice.
Each diet description below is a rating of its effectiveness, based on U.S. News and World Report rankings. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease."
Here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions this year.
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet. Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So, instead, it burns fat. The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that aren't always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.1/5 Weight Loss | 1.5/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago. Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.7/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat? The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally. However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 3.0/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.4/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.9/5 on Healthy
A healthy diet doesn't require a complete life change. Instead, make smarter choices more often when shopping, cooking and eating.

Must we be hopelessly devoted to CO2?

Texto completo: Yes, let's be more pragmatic, but that doesn't mean more pipelines
The Globe makes a valid point about the need for more clear-eyed pragmatism in combating global warming in its Dec. 31 editorial “Mass. needs to break old habits on climate change." We are rapidly approaching an era of climate triage, in which we must accept some local risks to the environment to avoid global devastation.
However, the argument for expanding natural gas infrastructure is shortsighted. Yes, more pipeline capacity will make methane cheaper. But carbon taxes are inevitable, and natural gas is still a fossil fuel. The pipelines will soon become an expensive sunk cost for both utilities and customers.
To be serious, impose a moratorium on pipelines, and on natural gas in new construction. Prioritize plugging gas leaks. Accept what would effectively amount to a partial carbon tax, and counter with fuel subsidies to residents, while incentivizing conversion to electric, solar, and the newer, cheaper geothermal technologies that will soon enter the market.
To ease use of a transitional fuel, we must not now be investing in an all-too-permanent infrastructure.

Consider the real carbon impact of nuclear reactors, just for starters
Contrary to the Boston Globe, nuclear reactors are not carbon-free. While reactors themselves are not major emitters of greenhouse gases, the nuclear fuel chain produces significant greenhouse emissions. Besides reactor operation, the chain includes uranium mining, milling, processing, enrichment, fuel fabrication, and long-term radioactive waste storage, all of which are essential components of nuclear power. At each of these steps, transport, construction, and operation of nuclear facilities results in greenhouse gas emissions. Taken together, the fuel chain greenhouse emissions are more than double solar power emissions and some six times higher than wind power, not to mention emissions-free energy efficiency technologies.
The Globe overlooked practical considerations. Too many reactors would be required to put a dent in carbon reduction, and it would take too much time to build them. Major studies agree that about 1,500 to 2,000 new nuclear reactors would have to be built worldwide for nuclear power to make any meaningful dent in greenhouse emissions (fewer than 400 reactors now operate globally).
Construction of 1,500 new reactors would cost trillions of dollars and would mean opening a new reactor about once every two weeks for the next 60 years.
In addition, the Globe failed to mention the production of nuclear waste that will be toxic for thousands of years and for which there are no repositories to store it. Also ignored: the risk of catastrophic accidents and the ever-present threat of terrorism to vulnerable reactors.

Kickstart the process of putting a fee on carbon
In your Dec. 31 editorial on Massachusetts and climate change, you failed to mention the most obvious and, according to economists, most effective way to reduce our CO2 output: putting a fee or tax on carbon.
The political resistance to raising the price of fossil fuels can be overcome by rebating the tax to consumers and businesses, as has been done successfully in British Columbia. There the process was kickstarted by rebating users the estimated amount of the tax at the start of the year. People could pay for the increased cost of, say, heating oil, without having to wait for their rebate check at the end of the year.
The effect is that consumers and businesses are left overall in the same economic position: They pay more for oil and gasoline, and therefore have an incentive to use less, and have more money to spend on other things.

Trump's bid to ease mercury rules would have far-reaching impact
The Trump administration's plan to roll back mercury regulations has important regional implications; it is not some faraway issue affecting states where coal is burned (“Trump seeks laxer mercury emission rule," Dec. 29). Talk to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Public Health.
Most people probably do not know that fish in virtually all of the freshwater lakes, rivers, and streams in Massachusetts are too contaminated with mercury to eat. The source of the mercury is coal-fired power plants in the Midwest.
The federal Environmental Protection Agency is the agency that can deal with this interstate pollution; it cannot be dealt with only at the state level.
Rolling back this rule would be a blow to the long-fought efforts of Northeastern states to work toward fishable waters.

Someone tell the EPA its approach could be deadly
Ralph Nader's 1966 bestseller “Unsafe at Any Speed" revealed the auto industry's terrifying inattention to safety at the time. It was thought to be cheaper to settle wrongful-death lawsuits than redesign safety flaws in vehicles. This book changed the auto industry and led to consumer protection standards.
Imagine my horror when reading the newly released EPA statement about relaxing mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, in which the agency said that the cost of cutting mercury from power plants “dwarfs" the monetary benefits.
So, I guess the new EPA position is that cancer, cognitive disorders in children, and poisoned rivers and streams are all acceptable alternatives because the coal industry will save so much money. This trickle-down we can do without.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - She had been arrested twice before, charged with providing illegal silicone injections in the Bronx to women who wanted to enhance their figures.
One client had texted Whalesca Castillo after a procedure, complaining of leaking blood and liquid from her buttocks and legs, court documents said. Castillo replied by suggesting her favorite method for stanching a wound: "Buy some crazy glue and put it on."
Castillo pleaded guilty in September 2011 to charges related to operating a fly-bynight plastic surgery clinic without a medical license, and served a year in federal prison. Released on probation, she was caught doing silicone enhancement procedures again in March 2014 and was sent back to prison for nine months.
On Wednesday morning, detectives arrested Castillo again, this time on a state charge of manslaughter linked to the death of Lesbia Ayala of Philadelphia.
Ayala, 48, died June 17 of an embolism after the police say Castillo pumped silicone into her buttocks and thighs. Ayala had traveled from her home in Philadelphia to Castillo's apartment on Seward Avenue for the illegal procedure.
Castillo, 44, could not be reached for comment Wednesday because she was being held in jail pending an arraignment. Her lawyer, Robert Osuna, said he had not yet read the criminal complaint and could not comment on it. "We'll have to see what the charges allege," he said.
Buttock enhancement surgery, known as a "Brazilian butt lift," has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years, driven in part by the allure of famously curvy pop-culture figures like Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj, plastic surgeons say.

How the US Gov. shutdown impacts Native Americans in Utah

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — Federal government shutdowns cut Indian Country deep in the U.S. The current shutdown, now entering its third week, has had a significant impact on the Native American populations in Utah.
Josh Loftin, the public information officer for the Utah Division of Indian Affairs, said, “The potential impacts are actually pretty large, just because there are so many essential services that are given to the tribes through the Bureau of Indian Affairs.”
Multiple generations ago, Native American tribes created treaties with the United States government which guaranteed funds for education and health care on reservations in exchange for large swaths of territory. The Navajo Nation was one such tribe, and it entered into an agreement with the government in the Treaty of 1868.
“All of the tribes have long-standing treaties in exchange for services from the federal government through the Bureau of Indian Affairs,” Loftin added. The BIA handles education, law enforcement, health clinics, and a lot of services which may differ from tribe to tribe.
“The federal government owes us this: We prepaid with millions of acres of land,” Aaron Payment, chairman of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, told the New York Times in a recent article. “We don’t have the right to take back that land, so we expect the federal government to fulfill its treaty and trust responsibility.”
The Interior Department’s Indian Affairs Bureau allocates funds to tribes to conduct services themselves or employs federal workers to run programs on reservations. They provide basic services to an estimated 1.9 million Alaska Natives and American Indians. This means that salaries rely heavily on federal funding, and if tribal employees aren’t being paid then tribal courts, disaster relief, law enforcement and road maintenance all may be affected, according to the New York Times.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs Contingency Plan states which employees will be affected in government shutdowns. According to its methodology the following types of personnel will continue to work throughout the shutdown:

Law Enforcement

Human Services (child protection)

Wildland Fire Management

Irrigation

Safety of Dams


Functions that are allowed include:

Emergency response on tribal lands

Critical services that address health and safety

Immediate response to cases of child abuse and neglect

Enforcement of tribal and federal laws

Protect federal facilities and infrastructure

Provide critical services for delivery of power and water to communities, irrigation systems, and dams

Provide transportation infrastructure construction and maintenance


Transportation, irrigation, and power revenue projects operate on revenues collected on site and thus will continue operations. In total, according to the contingency plan, 2,295 employees in the U.S. are subject to furlough.
In specific tribes, how much the shutdown impacts them really depends on what sort of resources they have to use. “(The tribes) are completely providing those services until the government opens again,” Loftin said. Some tribes have more resources than others, and some have dedicated reservation lands while others might not. Those tribes will be impacted differently.
The Paiutes, for example, don’t have a designated reservation land so concerns with law enforcement, road clearing, and medical care might not be as big of a concern because they can access those services in the city they live in, Loftin said. Meanwhile, other tribes like the Navajo who live on the Navajo Nation reservation, may not be able to access those services without them being present on their land.
The Navajo Nation is a fairly rural reservation which overlaps in New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. Russell Begaye, the Navajo Nation’s president, has said that the government shutdown has already been difficult, according to the New York Times.
With it being early January, snow has covered the region but without federal maintenance, roads have stayed unplowed, according to Begaye. People have ended up stuck in their homes and unable to make the journey to buy water, groceries, and medicine due to blockages on the roads.
According to Loftin, whether a tribe’s roads will be impacted by a lack of snow removal services is totally dependent on their location. The Northwest band of the Shoshone tribe up by Brigham City, for example, might not be negatively impacted because the roads running through their lands are Utah state roads and will be cleared by the Utah Department of Transportation.
The Goshutes, on the other hand, live on the very westernmost part of the state. There’s a road that runs from Wendover to their tribal lands in the Skull Valley Indian Reservation. Kids on the reservation use this road to travel to school in Wendover, and part of that stretch is owned by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. If the BIA doesn’t clear the road then it’s up to the tribe to find a way to do it themselves or pay the state to help, according to Loftin.
“As more time goes on the greater the impact will be,” Loftin said. “(The shutdown will) start to have big impacts at some point for all of the tribes.”

Texto completo: BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor on Thursday formally requested the death penalty for five suspects in the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, but provided no new information about the murder or the investigation into how it happened.
The killing of Mr. Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul has badly tarnished the international reputation of the kingdom and of its crown prince and day-to-day ruler, Mohammed bin Salman.
After weeks of insisting that Mr. Khashoggi had left the consulate alive on Oct. 2, the kingdom finally acknowledged in November that its agents had killed and dismembered him, and vowed to hold the perpetrators accountable.
After the first court session in the case on Thursday, the public prosecutor's office released a statement saying that it had requested the death penalty for five of the 11 suspects charged.
It did not provide any of the suspects' names, or any details about what role they might have played in the crime. Nor did the statement explain why the prosecutor had sought the death penalty against some but not others.
Turkish officials and investigations by The New York Times have found that Mr. Khashoggi's killing was the result of a complex operation that involved at least 15 agents who flew into Turkey specifically for the job, many of them closely connected to Prince Mohammed.
They included intelligence agents who had traveled with the crown prince, a physician who specialized in autopsies and brought a bone saw, and a body double who donned Mr. Khashoggi's clothes and walked around Istanbul seeking to leave a false trail of evidence that he was still alive.
Saudi Arabia has insisted that despite the complexity of the operation, the decision to kill Mr. Khashoggi, 59, was made by the team on the ground and had not been ordered by their superiors in Riyadh.
Mr. Khashoggi had been close to the Saudi royal family before Prince Mohammed's rise to power. He moved to the United States and became a public critic of the Saudi government, writing columns for The Washington Post.
Demonstrating that it will hold accountable those responsible for Mr. Khashoggi's killing is expected to be a crucial part of the kingdom's efforts to move past the scandal, which has complicated its foreign relations and scared off Western investors it was counting on to support its cultural and economic reform plans.
But it remains unclear whether the trial, and the lack of public information about the legal proceedings, will quell worries in the West about Saudi Arabia's respect for the rule of law. The kingdom's courts enforce a strict interpretation of Shariah law, the legal code of Islam based on the Quran, but are also easily influenced by the country's royal leaders, critics say.
While the Trump administration, which considers the kingdom under Prince Mohammed's leadership an important ally in the Middle East, has stood by the prince, United States intelligences services and members of Congress believe that he ordered the killing.
The Saudi statement did not say when the next hearing in the case would take place. It said the suspects appeared with their lawyers, were given copies of the charges against them and asked for time to prepare their defenses.

Trump is right about misuse of U.S. forces

Texto completo: Donald Trump has been complaining for years about the promiscuous use of American military personnel. Two weeks ago, he did something about it, announcing the withdrawal of 2,000 troops from Syria and 7,000 from Afghanistan.
Republicans joined Democrats in condemning Trump for acting impulsively, sowing "chaos," and precipitating a "national security crisis." But it's the president's overwrought critics who are making choices without thinking, driven by the momentum of military mistakes to support open-ended commitments that make no sense.
The U.S. intervention in Syria's civil war was never authorized by Congress, and its aims were nebulous. A few months ago, Trump's national security adviser was saying American forces would stay in Syria as long as Iran or its proxies are operating there -- in other words, indefinitely.
U.S. troops have been in Afghanistan for 17 years, and the Taliban occupy more territory than at any time since the 2001 invasion, notwithstanding the 3,500 reinforcements that Trump reluctantly approved in 2017. The withdrawal Trump has in mind would reverse that surge and then some, leaving 7,000 troops in a country the U.S. should have left long ago.
Trump's decision to stop American involvement in one endless war and curtail it in another provoked the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, which tells you something about the "adults in the room" -- those who supposedly were protecting the country from an erratic, ignorant president's worst instincts. Sometimes, as in "The Emperor's New Clothes," adults are committed to upholding unexamined dogma, and it takes a child to point out the truth.
"The United States cannot continue to be the policeman of the world," Trump said during his visit to Iraq last week. "We're spread out all over the world. We're in countries that most people have never even heard about, and frankly, it's ridiculous."
Trump is right. It's ridiculous that the United States has 26,000 military personnel in South Korea 65 years after the Korean War, 54,000 in Japan 73 years after World War II and 64,000 in a dozen European countries 27 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
These countries are perfectly capable of defending themselves. South Korea's economy is about 50 times as big as North Korea's, while Japan and Germany have the world's third- and fourth-highest gross domestic products, respectively.
Under the hysterical headline "Trump unleashed: Mattis exit paves way for global chaos," CNN reporter Stephen Collinson wrote, "It's no longer absurd to ask questions like whether the President will suddenly decide to pull American troops home from South Korea after decades of keeping the peace or even pulling out of NATO." Collinson, of course, thinks it's self-evidently absurd to suggest that either move would be a good idea.
Trump is right to question commitments that the national security establishment takes for granted, and in this case, his lack of sophistication is an asset. But even such ardent interventionists as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who complained that Trump's Syria announcement "rattled the world," have trouble keeping track of the country's military operations.
"I didn't know there was 1,000 troops in Niger," Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, confessed after four American soldiers were killed there in October 2017. With U.S. troops deployed in more than 150 countries, perhaps Graham can be forgiven for overlooking a few.
Hawks such as Graham assume all those deployments -- even the ones they don't know about -- are justified. Trump argues that at least some of them are not. Which seems likelier to be true?
New York Times reporter Mark Landler said the abruptness of Trump's decisions regarding Syria and Afghanistan "unite(d) the left and right against a plan to extract the United States from two long, costly and increasingly futile conflicts." Although there are strong arguments for withdrawing from both places, Landler wrote, "the president's move short-circuited what many say is a much-needed national debate about the future of America's wars."
Nonsense. We are having that debate now, and it is long overdue.

Illinois Democrat has the knack

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- If Republicans have a lick of sense, they are alarmed by a recent sign of intelligent life in the other party. The sign is the election by Democrats in the House of Representatives of Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In November she won a fourth term by 24 percentage points, the largest margin of any Democrat running in a district Donald Trump carried in 2016. Her task as chair, which is to cement the Democrats' House majority in 2020, involves this arithmetic:
In the next Congress, 31 Democrats will represent districts Trump carried. In 2018, 40 Democrats flipped districts from red to blue -- 41, if the Democrat wins the North Carolina race clouded by allegations of vote fraud. Twenty-two Democrats won by 5 percentage points or less. Twenty-three lost by 5 points or less. Democrats have noticed that Bustos prospers in a mostly rural district that extends along the Mississippi from the Wisconsin border to a portion of Peoria. Sixty percent of the district's residents live in towns with populations of 1,000 or fewer, 85 percent are in towns of 5,000 or fewer. In November, she won all of her district's 14 counties, 11 of which are entirely rural.
What lessons can Democrats learn from her success among Trump voters? They might start by marrying a cop. She says she gets "instant credibility" by telling audiences that her husband, who has been in law enforcement for 34 years, is the sheriff of Rock Island County. Regarding guns, it is helpful if one of your sons finished second in the national collegiate trap-shooting competition. It also is helpful if another son is a union welder.
Favorable trends might tempt Democrats to think that they can thrive without the voters Bustos reaches. The Economist, noting that Trump's approval rating is "stratified by age," reports that baby boomers -- those born between 1946 and 1964 -- who have been America's largest age cohort for more than five decades will in 2019 be outnumbered by millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996. Boomers are -- were; they are shuffling off stage -- almost 75 percent white; millennials are 56 percent white. In this year's midterm elections, Democrats won two-thirds of voters ages 18 to 29, and 71 percent of millennial women.
Furthermore, the GOP, which thinks of itself as the redoubt of the devout, is competing in an increasingly secular country. The Economist says that "Nones" -- people with no religion -- "already outnumber Catholics and mainline Protestants," and in 2019 might outnumber evangelicals. "There will soon be more Nones than any single group of Christians." Ex-Catholics are 13 percent of the American population.
Furthermore, The New York Times reports that with the Democrats' capture of New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, Republicans now hold no "truly urban" district. Since Republicans lost four Orange County, Calif., seats in November -- the Democrats lost only two seats nationally -- come January there will be no Republican from there in Congress for the first time since 1940. And there will be no Republicans from New England.
If, however, Democrats aspire to be less of a coastal party -- this month there will be more House Democrats from California than from 36 other states combined -- they should want to emulate Bustos' success among voters she calls "Trump triers," those who are less than his devoted acolytes.
Republicans can hope that in 2020, with Trump presumably at the top of their ticket, the turnout will be much larger and very unlike that of 2018. But analyst Charlie Cook, citing Michael McDonald of the United States Elections Project, says the 2018 turnout of 50.1 percent was the highest of any midterm election since 1914. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report says Republicans lost 96 percent of House contests in districts Trump either lost or carried by less than 7 points.
Bustos sometimes connects with her constituents by asking them what they do for fun. When one woman answered "cable television," Bustos asked if her family did not go out to movies. No, the woman replied, four tickets and popcorn exceed the family's budget. This answer spoke volumes about the constituent's disposable income. Bustos' question revealed a well-honed political intuition. Democrats, she says, have to "own" districts like hers, "not rent them." This is what ownership looks like: Her four margins of victory have been 6 percentage points, 11, 20 and 24.

3 mysteries about Trump that House Democrats may solve

Texto completo: Democrats are taking over the House on Thursday, with plans to investigate President Trump and his administration on a number of fronts.
While special counsel Robert Mueller continues his own probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, the Democrats are hoping to shed more light on areas that so far have been left in the shadows.
The congressional investigations could end up answering some of the most intriguing questions of the Trump controversies.
Here are three of those questions:
Which mystery person did Donald Trump Jr. call before the Trump Tower meeting? Adam Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he wants to know who Donald Trump Jr. called before the pre-election meeting he had at Trump Tower with Russians who were promising dirt on Democrat Hillary Clinton.
While setting up the meeting, Trump Jr. called a blocked cellphone number. Some wonder if he was looping in his father. The Republicans who previously controlled the committee did not seek the number.
“One key question, of course, is: What was the president's role in that meeting in Trump Tower?" Schiff told The New York Times. “That phone call may lead to a place the Republicans didn't want to go and so they were unwilling to get the answer." Schiff, however, said it would be “very simple to find out and we do intend to find out" who was behind the blocked number.
What prompted Kremlin agent Maria Butina to ask Trump in July 2015 a question about US sanctions on Russia? “I believe I would get along very nicely with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, OK?" Trump told Butina from the podium at a Las Vegas event. “I don't think you'd need the sanctions. I think that we would get along very, very well."
Schiff said on MSNBC it would be fascinating to learn more from Butina, who has been convicted and is cooperating with federal prosecutors.
“That question that she asks [Trump] that he uses as the opportunity to express his opposition to Russian sanctions — was that a prearranged question? And if so, then who was doing the prearranging?" Schiff said.
Some of Trump's own advisers reportedly found the question coming from the audience at the event strange.
“[Special counsel] Bob Mueller may know some of the answers to some of these questions. It's our intention, the Intel Committee, to find out and do what we said we would in the beginning, which is follow the evidence wherever it may lead," Schiff said.
What is in Trump's tax returns, and why is he adamant about not releasing them? It is a central mystery of Trump's presidency. Trump has steadfastly refused to release his tax returns, breaking with a tradition that goes back decades.
What story could the returns tell?
Will they reveal he has financial ties to Russia and other countries that he has been dealing with as president on the world stage? Will they show his income and charitable contributions were lower than people thought? Will they provide clues leading investigators down other paths?
Incoming House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal of Massachusetts said shortly after the midterm elections that Democrats would seek Trump's tax returns.
Politico reported this week that Neal will take a go-slow approach, hoping to build a case with the public for the release before seeking the records. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told CNN the president would fight in court against releasing the returns.

Texto completo: ALBANY – Former Vice President Joseph Biden has the "best case" for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Cuomo, a Democrat, offered an endorsement Wednesday of a potential Biden presidential campaign, arguing that the Delaware Democrat has "credibility" with the American public.
The governor, who has denied interest in running in 2020 himself, made the comment after he was asked about Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential prospects.
"My two cents? I think of all the names that are out there, I think Joe Biden has the best case," Cuomo said on WAMC-FM (90.3) in Albany. "I think Joe Biden has the best case because he brings the most of the secret ingredient you need to win, which is credibility."
Cuomo was asked whether he might want to be Biden's running mate, but Cuomo demurred.
"I am not even focusing on any of that," Cuomo said. "What I'm doing is what I believe I need to do for this state."
Cuomo has long counted Biden as a powerful ally.
Biden delivered a speech endorsing Cuomo for re-election at the state Democratic Convention in May, praising him for pushing big infrastructure projects and emphasizing the need to get things done.
Prior to that, Biden has made trips to New York to hail Cuomo for increasing the minimum wage and mark the groundbreaking on improvements at LaGuardia Airport.
Cuomo, who was inaugurated for a third term Tuesday night, has repeatedly denied he will run for president himself, saying in an August debate that he would serve a full four-year term "unless God strikes me dead."
Another New Yorker, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, of Brunswick, Rensselaer County, has said she's exploring a bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020.
The New York Times reported last week that Gillibrand has been weighing potential campaign managers and a location for a headquarters, likely to be in upstate New York.
On Wednesday, Cuomo said the potentially huge field of Democratic presidential candidates should work on highlighting the positives of their work.
"I think the main issue for the Democrats is not going to be the articulation of the negative," Cuomo said. "It's going to be the articulation of the positive and the credibility of the positive."
The governor said Biden is best suited to do that.
"You don't hire an airline pilot who has never flown a plane," Cuomo said. "Where is the credibility in your argument? Joe Biden can say, 'I was there. I was not the president, but I was the second seat.'"

Texto completo: People under 21 are no longer able to buy semiautomatic assault rifles in Washington as of Jan 1. It is the first of several new state measures intended to reduce gun violence. The National Rifle Association has already filed suit.
Previously, state law barred the assault weapons' sale to those under 18. The new rules, approved by voters in a ballot initiative in November, come alongside dozens of moves by other states to strengthen gun control regulations in the absence of federal action.
"It is a meaningful step in the right direction," said Christian Heyne, legislative director at the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, on Washington's initiative. "Gun violence on the whole is such a complex problem. We need to have complex solutions, comprehensive solutions. This is a part of that conversation."
In addition to the age restrictions, Washington's new rules state that gun dealers must wait 10 days before delivering semiautomatic assault rifles they sell. That is designed, in part, to prevent impulsive action. The rules also require anyone buying a semiautomatic assault rifle to have completed a gun safety training in the last five years. The measure also imposes criminal penalties for unsafe gun storage, and requires more extensive background checks for purchases of the assault weapons.
Most of the new rules take effect in July.
"Every component is extremely important," said Renee Hopkins, chief executive of the Alliance for Gun Responsibility, the group that sponsored the ballot initiative. "This package really looks to reduce suicide, reduce accidental shootings and also reduce everyday gun violence, interpersonal gun violence, that we see playing out."
The Nov. 6 ballot initiative passed with more than 59 percent of the vote.
According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, state legislatures in 2018 passed 69 gun control measures, more than any other year since the Newtown, Conn., massacre in 2012, and more than three times the number passed in 2017. They included adding or improving state background checks, increasing regulations for concealed firearms and restricting firearm use for domestic abusers.
Opponents of Washington's ballot initiative said its provisions to safely store guns would make them "unavailable" for self-defense. It also said that banning sale of semiautomatic assault rifles to 18- to 20-year-olds "would leave already vulnerable segments of the population defenseless to attack." The N.R.A. and the Second Amendment Foundation have filed a lawsuit saying that the age restrictions violate the Constitution.
But gun control groups say public pressure has been mounting in response to recent high-profile mass shootings, including the slaughter at a country musical festival in Las Vegas that left 58 people dead and hundreds wounded in October 2017; and multiple shootings in 2018 at schools around the country, particularly at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. In that shooting, a 19-year-old man killed 17 people with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle in February.
Mr. Heyne said Washington's move, while not unique, is a "bellwether" for what could happen in the rest of the country.
Gun-related deaths are increasing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in December that the nearly 40,000 people who died from firearms injuries in the United States in 2017 was more than any other year since at least 1968. Nearly two-thirds of those deaths were suicides. The rate of gun deaths also increased to 12 deaths for every 100,000 people, the highest since the mid-1990s.
Some states like California and Connecticut have near-total bans on assault weapons, according to the Giffords Law Center. Assault weapons, generally thought to be more lethal, have been used in deadly mass shootings like those in Parkland, Las Vegas, Newtown and San Bernardino, Calif.
A New York Times analysis published in February found that 173 people have been killed since 2007 in mass shootings involving AR-15s. Yet they don't make up a large chunk of gun violence in America, Mr. Heyne said.
Ms. Hopkins said that existing laws already ban the sale of handguns to those under 21, and that the age change for semiautomatic assault rifles seeks to make the law consistent for the different type of firearms.
Gun control figured heavily in the 2018 election, as gun control groups outspent the N.R.A. Congress has generally failed to pass any meaningful legislation. A federal ban on the manufacture of certain "assault weapons" took effect in 1994. It expired in 2004.
No attempts to reinstate the federal assault weapons ban have been successful. In December, the Trump administration banned bump stocks, attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire in sustained, rapid bursts.
Gun rights organizations have succeeded in blocking other proposals at the federal level. And they are vowing to fight the states as well.
"The N.R.A. will fight to overturn this unconstitutional initiative," Chris W. Cox, executive director of N.R.A.'s Institute for Legislative Action, said of the Washington law, when the lawsuit was announced. "We will not sit idly by while elitist anti-gun activists attempt to deny everyday Americans their fundamental right to self-defense."
The N.R.A. did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday after the law took effect.
"The gun lobby is trying to thwart the will of nearly 60 percent of Washingtonian voters who supported common-sense gun reform in our state," Bob Ferguson, the state attorney general, said in a statement Wednesday. "We were not surprised the gun lobby filed a lawsuit. I look forward to representing the people of the State of Washington in court against the N.R.A."

Lagging enforcement paves way for tax fraud The gutting of the IRS lets the rich dodge their obligations while the rest of us pay.

Texto completo: Becoming a millionaire is easy, comedian Steve Martin used to say - first, get a million dollars. Then, when it comes time to pay taxes, don't.
These days, that's not really a joke. In fact, for those without ethics, it's becoming pretty good financial advice.
Just 5.8 percent of people with income over $1 million were audited by the Internal Revenue Service last year, less than half the percentage of 2011, and new investigations of people who don't file tax returns was down to 362,000 last year from more than 2.4 million in 2011.
Both decreases are the result of a nearly decade-long effort to gut IRS enforcement, as detailed in a recent investigation by ProPublica. And it's just the start.
According to the report, the number of IRS auditors is down a third from 2010, and at its lowest level since 1953, when the U.S. population was half what it is now. Not surprisingly, the number of audits conducted by the agency fell 42 percent between 2010 and 2017. The IRS criminal division brought 795 tax fraud cases in 2017, a 25 percent decline since 2010.
And the decreases are not evenly spread among Americans, which may be the point. Someone who utilizes the earned-income tax credit, which provides cash to people earning under $20,000 a year, is just as likely to be audited now as someone earning between $500,000 and $1 million a year.
These are not victimless crimes. The drop in investigations of nonfilers, for instance, has cost at least $3 billion each year in lost revenue, according to the IRS inspector general. In addition, the IRS lost $8.3 billion in expired tax obligations because investigators didn't have the resources to pursue them.
Every dollar in tax obligation that is avoided is a dollar that can't pay for roads, bridges, veterans or elderly health care. Every dollar not paid by an American wealthy enough to engage in complex tax avoidance must be made up elsewhere, a brunt that is typically borne by lower- and middle-class Americans - one way or another.
Take for example the tax avoidance perpetrated by Donald Trump and his siblings, as documented by The New York Times.
According to The Times, in the 1990s, the president's father, Fred Trump, in just one of many schemes, set up a company controlled by his children, then used that company as a purchasing agent for supplies for his apartment empire. Fred Trump then paid inflated prices for everything, passing on the extra money to his children.
By passing the money through his kids' company, he saved hundreds of millions on inheritance taxes, eventually paying about $52 million on the kids' $1 billion inheritance, rather than 10 times that as is prescribed by law.
Not only did the scheme avoid taxes that the law says should be paid to the U.S. Treasury, it also resulted in Fred Trump's tenants getting the short end of the stick: Their rents were increased based on the inflated prices paid to the purchasing agent, which appeared to city rent controllers to be the result of major improvements.
As a result, thousands of working-class tenants, many of them new immigrants and municipal workers, were forced to pay rents higher than they should have been. Some of them are still in those apartments, and have collectively been cheated out of tens of millions dollars in rent over the years.
That's just one instance by one man, which we only know about because his son invited scrutiny by becoming president.
Likewise, we know about the fraud conducted by Michael Cohen, the president's fixer, and Paul Manafort, his one-time campaign manager, only because they were in the orbit of the most powerful person in the world.
How many others are out there quietly ripping off the government and other taxpayers? We don't know, and neither does the IRS.

THE STORY OF 2018 WAS CLIMATE CHANGE FUTURE GENERATIONS MAY ASK WHY WE WERE DISTRACTED BY LESSER MATTERS

Texto completo: Our best hope may be the weather.
For a long time, many people thought that it was a mistake to use the weather as evidence of climate change. Weather patterns contain a lot of randomness. Even as the earth warms and extreme weather becomes more common, some years are colder and calmer than others. If you argue that climate change is causing some weather trend, a climate denier may respond by making grand claims about a recent snowfall.
And yet the weather still has one big advantage over every other argument about the urgency of climate change: We experience the weather. We see it and feel it.
It is not a complex data series in an academic study or government report. It's not a measurement of sea level or ice depth in a place you've never been. It's right in front of you. And although weather patterns do have a lot of randomness, they are indeed changing. That's the thing about climate change: It changes the climate.
I wanted to write my last column of 2018 about the climate as a kind of plea: Amid everything else going on, don't lose sight of the most important story of the year.
I know there was a lot of competition for that title, including some more obvious contenders, like President Donald Trump and Robert Mueller. But nothing else measures up to the rising toll and enormous dangers of climate change. I worry that our children and grandchildren will one day ask us, bitterly, why we spent so much time distracted by lesser matters.
The story of climate change in 2018 was complicated - overwhelmingly bad, yet with two reasons for hope. The bad and the good were connected, too: Thanks to the changing weather, more Americans seem to be waking up to the problem.
I'll start with the alarming parts of the story. The past year is on pace to be the earth's fourth warmest on record, and the five warmest years have all occurred since 2010. This warming is now starting to cause a lot of damage.
In 2018, heat waves killed people in Montreal, Karachi, Tokyo and elsewhere. Extreme rain battered North Carolina and the Indian state of Kerala. The Horn of Africa suffered from drought. Large swaths of the American West burned. When I was in Portland, Ore., this summer, the air quality - from nearby wildfires - was among the worst in the world. It would have been healthier to be breathing outdoors in Beijing or Mumbai.
Amid all of this destruction, Mr. Trump's climate agenda consists of making the problem worse. His administration is filled with former corporate lobbyists, and they have been changing federal policy to make it easier for companies to pollute. These officials like to talk about free enterprise and scientific uncertainty, but their real motive is usually money. Sometimes, they don't even wait to return to industry jobs. Both Scott Pruitt and Ryan Zinke, two now-departed pro-pollution cabinet secretaries, engaged in on-the-job corruption.
I often want to ask these officials: Deep down, do you really believe that future generations of your own family will be immune from climate change's damage? Or have you chosen not to think very much about them?
As for the two main reasons for hope: The first is that the Trump administration is an outlier. Most major governments are trying to slow climate change. So are many states in this country, as well as some big companies and nonprofit groups. This global coalition is the reason that the recent climate summit in Poland "yielded much more," as Nat Keohane of the Environmental Defense Fund said, "than many of us had thought might be possible."
The second reason for hope is public opinion. No, it isn't changing nearly as rapidly as I wish. Yet it is changing, and the weather seems to be a factor. The growing number of extreme events - wildfires, storms, floods and so on - is hard to ignore.
Only 40 percent of Americans called the quality of environment "good" or "excellent" in a Gallup Poll this year, the lowest level in almost a decade. And 61 percent said the environment was getting worse. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 66 percent of Americans said they wanted to see action to combat climate change. Some polls even suggest that Republican voters are becoming anxious about the situation.
The politics of climate change remains devilishly hard, especially because so many people around the world feel frustrated about their living standards. France's "gilet jaune" protests, after all, were sparked by a proposed energy tax. Compared with day-to-day life, the effects of climate change have long felt distant, almost theoretical.
But now those effects are becoming real, and they are terrifying. To anyone who worries about making a case for climate action based on the weather, I would simply ask: Do you have a better idea?
