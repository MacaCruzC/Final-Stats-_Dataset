Texto completo: NEW YORK - On a recent Tuesday evening, the line outside "Ain't Too Proud," the Broadway musical about the R&B supergroup the Temptations, snaked around the block. Many ticket holders fretted over whether they would be admitted before it started, but not Michael Kors.
He stood in line patiently with his husband, Lance Le Pere, playing I Spy a Celebrity. Jessica Lange was up ahead, making her way inside. A woman in a red coat stepped out of a car; Kors identified her as "Liza Minnelli's best friend."
"Her husband was like the disco dentist," he said. "Everyone at Studio 54 went to him."
Kors, 59, who built a multi-billion-dollar business off his beige off-the-shoul-der sweaters, baby blue skirts and "Project Runway" witticisms, had on his usual outfit: a black trench coat, black sweater, vintage gold Ray-Ban sunglasses and a pair of Levi's, which he wore with New Balance sneakers.
Le Pere, 48, had on an Ami windbreaker, Michael Kors T-shirt and Levi's jeans.
In February and September, the couple's lives are dominated by the fashion week calendar. During Tonys season, they pretty much live at the theater.
"I feel like we're cramming for a test as June gets closer," said Kors, who, with Le Pere, gave $1.5 million to the Roundabout Theater for its development fund and in 2016 had the VIP room there named in their honor. "It's like, 'How many can we do in a week?'"
This season, they have been to "True West," "The Ferryman," "Kiss Me Kate," "The Boys in the Band," "King Kong," "Oklahoma," "The Cher Show" and "Lifespan of a Fact," which they saw with Anna Wintour, their good friend and fellow theater lover.
"We're like the fashion people waving the flag," Kors said. "She and I used to be perplexed why more people in fashion don't go, but I think it's because they don't want to turn their phones off. And they don't want to be here on a scheduled time."
Wintour said: "Michael and Lance are the ideal theater companions. They are knowledgeable, witty and always excited to be there! And they believe in eating quickly before curtain."
Kors and Le Pere even hop on planes to catch plays that haven't made it to Broadway.
Two years ago, they went to London for the National Theater's adaptation of the movie "Network." Soon after, Kors texted Rufus Norris, the theater's artistic director, offering to help bring it to Broadway; Kors and Le Pere ended up becoming investors and producers. Now, they're on the lookout for another show to back, perhaps a musical.
At "Ain't Too Proud," Kors and Le Pere made their way to their seats in the eighth row. The lights went down and Le Pere took Kors' hand in his.
The touristy crowd cheered big Temptations numbers like "My Girl" and "Shout," but Kors was more moved by edgier songs like "Get Ready" and "Papa Was a Rolling Stone."
"Ain't Too Proud" also took darker turns, with tales of drug abuse and friction with Berry Gordy Jr., the founder of Motown.
"Is there ever a show business story that's just smooth?" Kors said, as the curtain fell for intermission.
When "Ain't Too Proud" ended an hour later, Kors rushed backstage to shower the cast in superlatives ("You guys killed it") and take pictures with them. Afterward, around 10 p.m., he and Le Pere went to the restaurant Joe Allen for a bite.
Everyone there knew them. As frequent patrons, they have their own table near the bar. The order is always the same: a Caesar salad and hamburger, which they split. "This is our happy place," Le Pere said.
Kors was still elated that two of the cast members told him that they wore his clothes. In 2015, Wintour spearheaded an effort to glam up the Tony Awards. Some designers had to be strong-armed into lending performers free gowns, but not Kors.
"It may not be Jennifer Lopez at the Golden Globes, but I'm excited Patti LuPone wears Michael Kors," he said. And, the boundaries separating television, film and theater no longer exist, he added.
Cynthia Erivo, he pointed out, parlayed her performance in the Broadway musical "The Color Purple" into a starring role in the box office hit "Widows." Billy Porter, the Tony-winning actor, is a breakout star on the F/X show "Pose."
The conversation turned to another F/X series, "Fosse/Verdon," about Bob Fosse and his wife Gwen Verdon. The show has gotten mixed reviews, but Le Pere and Kors are huge fans. The minute it came up, the two seemed to be pantomiming each other.
"We love it," Kors said. "Obsessed."
"There's nothing like it," Le Pere said. "She's amazing," he added, referring to Michelle Williams, who plays Verdon.
"Amazing," Kors said.
"He's brilliant" Le Pere said, referring to Sam Rockwell, who plays Fosse.
"Brilliant," Kors said. "Every part is done so amazingly."
Nevertheless, Kors made it clear that he and Le Pere do not see themselves as theater queens.
So what if they saw recent Broadway productions of "Mary Poppins" and "Hello Dolly" four times each? Or made sure to catch the Roundabout Theater's production of "Cabaret" three times: first with Michelle Williams playing Sally Bowles, then with Emma Stone in the role and finally with Stone's replacement, Sienna Miller.
"We're experience groupies," Kors said.
To prove the point, Kors listed other things he and Le Pere have done recently, including trips to Las Vegas (to catch Cher at Caesar's Palace) and MetLife Stadium (to see Beyonce, despite torrential downpours). "We would have stayed til 2 a.m. if we had to," Kors said.
As Kors sees it, "getting out and having your eyes and your ears and your senses open to something other than your own fashion world" is essential to the creative process.
"How do you possibly design things for human beings if you're not part of the human world?" he said.
He is aware that most fashion people take fashion incredibly seriously. That mostly annoys him. "Have fun," he said.

Texto completo: Oh yeah, the Finals.
The NBA season is supposed to lead dramatically to this point but was widely believed to be over before it started with the Warriors coming off three titles in four seasons … having lost the one in 2016 after leading the Cavaliers 3-1… with no LeBron James-led contender arising in the East to worry about.
Instead, it’s the Toronto Raptors with their star/upcoming free agent, Kawhi Leonard, and trash-talking rapper/co-owner, Drake, representing the East and, in an upset, taking a 1-0 lead.
Unfortunately, Leonard played hurt last series as his uncle/adviser, Dennis Robertson, told Yahoo’s Chris Haynes (“You could clearly see he was in pain.”)
Nor did Kawhi look too bouncy in Game 1, scoring 23 points and shooting 5 for 14 from the field.
So, lead or no lead, good luck, Raptors!
The matchup looked so one-sided, Warriors players were being asked before it started if Steph Curry would finally be the Finals MVP … based, of course, on the assumption that injured Kevin Durant won’t be a major factor and that wouldn’t matter to the team.
Meanwhile, the New York Times’ Marc Stein introduced his plan for the anticipated walkover: multiple postseason tournaments like European soccer teams.
Compounding the absurdity, Commissioner Adam Silver told Stein that a second “cup” was “in the conceptual phase.”
As if the league needs a new attraction with a boffo comedy going as Magic Johnson continued to bash the Lakers while pledging undying love to them?
It was another crazy week with ESPN.com’s Baxter Holmes producing a 6,500-word opus on Johnson’s misbegotten era … while ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith melted down on the air, decrying his own company’s story.
Smith is Magic’s guy at The Wide World of Sports. As Stephen A. actually noted, he was embarrassed to have Johnson coming in the same day Holmes’ piece ran, in which Magic was alleged to be an abusive boss who had several Lakers staffers resigning and/or taking anti-anxiety medication.
Ranted Stephen A. in Johnson’s defense:
“Oh my god! Let’s get the ax! Let’s take Magic Johnson to the guillotine!”
Of course, with Johnson determined to keep going on the air to defend himself, these coincidences in timing are becoming common … like the week before when Magic went on to call GM Rob Pelinka a back-stabber, the same day the Lakers introduced Coach Frank Vogel in their first press conference since Johnson’s resignation 41 days before.
In the part we didn’t know before, Holmes reported James’ agent, Rich Paul, waged a season-long campaign against Coach Luke Walton.
This was confirmed by Silver, himself. In an early-season chance meeting, the commissioner said Paul told him something to the effect of, “Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.”
Assuming that Paul’s opinions followed James’, and Johnson’s followed LeBron’s, this explains why Magic went off on Walton at the seven-game mark, turning Luke into a lame duck.
LeBron knows he’s held to the highest standards and has done this before, trying and failing to get Erik Spoelstra fired in Miami, succeeding in getting David Blatt fired in Cleveland.
In this, James was joined by Johnson, feeling exposed after his controversial decisions to forego shooters and sign eccentrics such as JaVale McGee, Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley.
Not that Magic was supposed to take orders from James. With LeBron locked up for three seasons, it was the other way around.
It was Johnson’s job to make James understand they might have to sacrifice this season to finish rebuilding after saving a maximum salary slot and bringing in so many veterans on one-year deals.
What Magic wasn’t supposed to do was go off on Walton before Thanksgiving on LeBron’s behalf, undercutting what little stability they had.
Of course, conveying that message meant realizing it, himself. By all accounts, Magic didn’t, talking of building for the future while challenging Golden State at the same time.
A Lakers staffer told Holmes he didn’t know if Johnson had a plan. Actually, Magic did … or LeBron did … and it was a dilly: Trade for Anthony Davis, off-loading enough salary to save their max slot for another star free agent to put alongside James.
Unfortunately for Magic, it proved impossible with New Orleans blaming the Lakers for their heavy-handed, obviously LeBron-driven, wooing of A.D.
Worst of all for Johnson, he wasn’t working at the Lakers job full-time and couldn’t live it down when it got into the press.
“And last but not least, lazy?” Magic told Stephen A. last week, re-framing the charge into one he could lampoon.
“I have built a $600 million business. You can not be lazy going from basketball and winning five championships. … I wasn’t lazy as a player and I’m not lazy as a CEO and a business owner. That’s never going to happen.”
Of course, no one said he was lazy. The charge was that he wasn’t often in the Lakers’ office, which he hasn’t addressed.
Holmes, noting Johnson’s many business interests, suggests he was in their office “once a week or every two weeks.”
Infrequent as that was, it could have been OK if Johnson had a smooth working relationship with an experienced No. 2 man who assigned all the detail work.
Imagine if Jeanie Buss had kept GM Mitch Kupchak, who had all the qualifications, instead of lumping Mitch in with her brother, Jim, when she fired him.
The No. 2 man became Pelinka, an agent, hired at the suggestion of his client, Kobe Bryant, neither of whom had front office experience.
As for Johnson’s inconceivable charge of being stabbed in the back … still unspecified aside from citing “little things that bothered me” … he had more than two seasons with Pelinka. If loyalty was an issue, Magic should have been able to tell long before.
Unfortunately for the Lakers and Jeanie, who kept Pelinka, Rob is now lumped in with Johnson in the press, as if he was Magic’s partner in crime … setting up Pelinka as the scapegoat for the next thing that goes wrong.
Actually, Pelinka looks more like another of the staffers Magic ran roughshod over.
Pelinka, reported Holmes, survived with the avid support of Jeanie’s best friend and new Lakers power player, Linda Rambis.
Now to see how long any of them, Rob and/or Linda, last.
If there’s a silver lining for Lakers fans, it’s that the heat in the press is exposing an organization run on nepotism and cronyism, which Jeanie might finally be obliged to recognize and professionalize.
Of course, that suggests more misadventures await in the meantime so buckle up.

Long-delayed victory for integrity

Texto completo: When Marilyn Webb asked a distinguished male professor to serve on her dissertation committee at the University of Chicago, he said he would do so only if he could go to her apartment and give her baths.
So she asked another prominent professor, this one an expert in moral development. He pinned her against the wall, kissed her forcefully and "began slobbering all over my face," she recalled, adding, "He told me it was quid pro quo."
Webb pushed him off, walked out and had a good cry. "The fact that they saw me as just a sexual being and a sexual object was so stunning to me, it just shattered me," she said. "I didn't even have the confidence to get angry. I was just so hurt."
She had deeply admired both professors and had spent three years completing coursework and preliminary exams for her Ph.D. in educational psychology. But this was 1967.
"There was no word for sexual harassment, there was no language for this, there was no Title IX, no administrator to report it to," Webb told me. "I felt shame as if I had done something wrong, and there was no recourse. So I left."
Webb dropped out of the Ph.D. program and moved to Washington to become an activist in the nascent women's movement. She founded a feminist newspaper, Off Our Backs, then a college women's studies program, wrote books and magazine articles and served as editor-in-chief of Psychology Today. She became an expert on death and dying and co-chair of the journalism program at Knox College in Illinois. "I've had a great life," Webb said.
But when the #MeToo movement gained traction, Webb thought about how her academic career had been cut short. As a 75th birthday present to herself in October 2017, she wrote to the president of the University of Chicago, Robert Zimmer, laid out what had happened, and asked him if the university could correct this injustice.
The two professors were dead, but Zimmer discussed the issue with colleagues who investigated, reviewed Webb's work and found her story credible. The university formed a dissertation committee - two white women and a black man, reflecting how universities have changed - and agreed that Webb would submit as a dissertation a book she had written, but with a new theoretical framework.
She did so, and next month at the age of 76, she will receive her Ph.D. at the University of Chicago graduation ceremonies.
"For a university, academic integrity is the most important thing," Zimmer explained. "If mistakes have been made, they need to be corrected."
Amanda Woodward, the dean of social sciences who will hand Webb the diploma, wasn't even born when Webb arrived at Chicago to begin work on her doctorate. "This is a victory," Woodward told me. "It's a sad comment on the way things were in the past, but such a victory for her to come back."
Webb is thrilled. "The culture changed," she said.
Gender discrimination was not, of course, only about sexual harassment or assault. The University of Chicago is granting another long-delayed Ph.D., to Cheryl Dembe, who was completing her doctorate in 1971 when her research adviser died unexpectedly. She could not find another - because she was female, the university acknowledges - and so had to drop out with a master's.
A faculty committee reviewed Dembe's work as a doctoral student and was impressed; it resembled contemporaneous work at Cornell University that later won a Nobel Prize. So Dembe, too, will be awarded a Ph.D.
I love these stories that end in triumph, but they should prod us to reflect. Half a century ago, we were largely blind to sexual harassment and gender discrimination, so talented women were pushed out - not just from doctoral programs but from every institution and workplace. Discrimination against gays was similarly invisible because, like sexual harassment, it was hard to talk about. Everybody lost.
So what are we still blind to today? What groups of people drop unnoticed out of Ph.D. tracks in 2019 - or out of journalism or investment banks or technology companies (or were never there to begin with)?
Race, gender and LGBT status get more attention now, but I suspect there's little notice of the absence of unauthorized immigrants, trans people and those with mental health challenges or other disabilities. The largest group of all that falls through the cracks is probably made up of those from poor, chaotic or working-class backgrounds. Children from the top 1% are 77 times more likely to attend an Ivy college than kids from the bottom 20%.
"Graduate students from low-income backgrounds are a group at risk that we aren't really noticing," suggests Kathleen Cagney, a University of Chicago sociologist who led Webb's dissertation committee.
So, yes, there's genuine and exciting progress, and I'm cheering Webb and Dembe. Hooray for them and for the University of Chicago! But let's learn from that experience and try to avoid other kinds of myopia that lead people even today to drop out and never fully deploy their talents - for then we all lose.

Apps Purged by Apple Say They Have Answer to Privacy Concerns

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Last year, Apple announced that it had created tools to help people limit the time they and their children spent on their iPhones. Around the same time, Apple began purging from its App Store a number of apps that offered similar services.
Now 17 companies affected by that purge say they have a technical answer to the privacy concerns that Apple cited for dropping them.
The companies on Thursday proposed the creation of an application programming interface, or A.P.I., a common bit of software that enables computer programs or apps to work with one another. The companies said the A.P.I. could tap Apple technology that would allow them to track screen time without invading privacy.
"Right now, technologically, only Apple has the right to do it on their devices, and we believe Apple should let everybody get a go," said Viktor Yevpak, the head of Kidslox, a parental-control app that has been targeted by Apple.
The companies' move puts added pressure on Apple ahead of its annual developers conference next week, when the iPhone maker interacts with thousands of app makers and lays out its vision for the year.
Apple is increasingly on the defensive over its tight control of the App Store. The high fees for selling services in the App Store and competition from Apple's own apps are drawing accusations that the tech giant is abusing its power.
Spotify recently complained to European regulators that Apple used the App Store to give its Apple Music service an unfair advantage. Dutch regulators are investigating whether Apple abused its control of the App Store. This month, the Supreme Court allowed an antitrust class action to move forward, saying consumers have the right to try to prove that Apple used the App Store to raise apps' prices.
And Kidslox and another parental-control app, Qustodio, filed a complaint with European competition officials over Apple's forcing changes to their apps. Another parental-control app complained to Russia's antitrust authorities.
Apple declined to comment on Thursday.
Apple has frequently created A.P.I.s to encourage app developers to use its technology. While the 17 app makers released a technical proposal on how it could work, a new A.P.I. would have to come from Apple itself.
This week, Apple published a web page explaining its approach to the App Store, saying it strives to create "a safe and trusted place for customers" and "a great business opportunity for all developers."
Apple said it reviewed about 100,000 apps a week and rejected roughly 40 percent, typically for minor bugs or privacy concerns. (Security experts say the approach has made iPhones safer than Android devices.) Apple stressed that it welcomed competition in the App Store.
Andrew Armour, a developer whose screen-time app was rejected by Apple, said he and the other developers had begun to collaborate after The New York Times reported last month on Apple's purge. He and Mr. Yevpak said they were upset that Apple had said in its response to the article that it removed their apps because "they put users' privacy and security at risk."
Mr. Armour said Apple had never said that when it removed or rejected their apps. "All they said was it went against one of their rules," he said. "None of us were doing anything malicious."
The developers said they were encouraged to act by Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive and one of the creators of the iPhone. Mr. Fadell spoke out about Apple's actions against the screen-time apps and suggested the technology that the companies are now proposing.
Mr. Fadell corresponded with several of the developers. "I will push it out to the world -- just make sure it's done BEFORE WWDC,"' he said in one message seen by The Times, using the abbreviation for Apple's developers conference next week.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Fadell said he had encouraged the effort but wasn't immediately available for comment.
Because Apple has demonstrated that it can enable people to track the time they spend on their phones -- as well as what their children are doing -- without invading privacy, the developers said Apple should give them an A.P.I. that would allow them to do the same.
The companies said they had wanted such an A.P.I. for years but were forced to use workarounds.
Many of them used a technology called mobile device management, or M.D.M., which enables one iPhone to control another. Apple allowed the practice for years but changed its policy last year. Apple said M.D.M. gave the apps too much access to children's devices.
"This isn't a matter of competition," Apple said in a response to The Times's article. "It's a matter of security."
Apple has removed or restricted more than two dozen screen-time and parental-control apps, according to a review by The Times. Still, Apple has left up at least three apps that use M.D.M., according to Sensor Tower, a firm that tracks information about apps.
Several apps that Apple purged didn't use M.D.M. but were told they had been removed for using a separate technology, virtual private networks.
Apple declined to comment on why it had removed those apps.

Texto completo: Our guide to stand-up, improv and variety shows happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
MICHELLE COLLINS: 'STRONG MONSTER' at Joe's Pub (June 1, midnight). This SiriusXM morning show host and former cast member of "The View" shows off her comedic and musical sides in this performance, accompanied by the pianist Kenny Mellman. If you've seen Collins in any of her after-show gigs, which have included hosting ABC's "Bachelor in Paradise: After Paradise," TLC's "90 Day Live" and Lifetime's "Little Talk Live," then you already know how quick and off-the-cuff her comedy is.

'HOW I LEARNED TO LIVE IN NEW YORK' at Caveat (June 6, 9 p.m.). The "How I Learned" storytelling showcase has taken place in New York City since 2009, and for this edition, it turns its theme inward, as Blaise Allysen Kearsley asks her guests to tell stories that reflect on adapting to the biggest city in America. Hear and learn from the comedians Rosebud Baker and Nore Davis, NPR's "Ask Me Another" host Ophira Eisenberg, the writer Mike Albo, and Dodai Stewart, a deputy editor for the Metro desk at The New York Times.

KEVIN JAMES at St. George Theater (May 31, 8 p.m.). How will the "King of Queens" be received on Staten Island? We expect cross-borough loyalty. James returned to CBS in 2016 for a two-season run of "Kevin Can Wait" but couldn't wait for that sitcom's finale in 2018 before he dropped his most recent stand-up special on Netflix, "Never Don't Give Up." And he's following his own advice on that front.

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
NATALIE PALAMIDES at the Bell House (June 4-6, 7:30 p.m.; through June 14). New Yorkers might know Palamides as the voice of Buttercup on the Cartoon Network's "Powerpuff Girls," but they have never had the chance to see her comedic chops in person before now. Under the direction of Dr. Brown, Palamides won the best newcomer prize at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for her 2017 show, "LAID," a surreal, silly piece about ova and the dilemmas of motherhood. She followed that up last year with "NATE," which allowed her to inhabit and explore toxic masculinity. Find out why Time Out Los Angeles named her a comedian to watch in 2019 as she stages each of these works over the next two weeks in their New York City debuts, with "LAID" showing at the Bell House from Tuesday to Thursday and "NATE" on June 11, 12 and 14.

WELLRED COMEDY TOUR at Carolines on Broadway (May 30, 7:30 p.m.; May 31-June 1, 7:30 and 10 p.m.). Trae Crowder was living in rural Tennessee when he went viral in 2016 with his YouTube videos as the "Liberal Redneck." Crowder has since gone Hollywood, making multiple TV appearances and scoring a development deal with his buddies Drew Morgan and Corey Ryan Forrester to turn their WellRED brand into a sitcom. They've already written a book together, "Liberal Redneck Manifesto: Draggin Dixie Outta the Dark," produced sketch videos for Comedy Central and recently released an album, "WellRED Live From Lexington." This is neither their first rodeo nor their first stand-up tour.

In our opinion: Everyone forgot the most important part of Mueller's statement

Texto completo: On Wednesday, special counsel Robert Mueller closed his first, and probably last, public appearance regarding the investigation into alleged Russian attacks on the U.S. election system with this conclusion: “There were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. And that allegation deserves the attention of every American.”
Unfortunately, the last thing said was the first thing forgotten.
National discussion instead turned to other declarations Mueller made during the nine-minute statement. Indeed, the Department of Justice could neither determine if the president committed crimes of obstruction nor say he was exonerated from wrongdoing. That, says Mueller, is for Congress to decide.
Investigating whether a sitting president committed a crime is serious business, and it’s vital Congress performs its duties of oversight. Equally vital is that lawmakers carry out those duties according to the highest standards of fairness and objectivity.
But a frenzy over impeachment proceedings misses the thrust of both Mueller’s statement and his two-year, multi-million dollar investigation: Foreign agents compromised U.S. democracy.
As Mueller urges, that should be on the mind of every American, and it deserves the attention of officials at every level of government.
According to Mueller, Russia used “sophisticated cybertechniques to hack into computers and networks used by the Clinton campaign,” stole private information and promoted that information through fake online profiles. The efforts were “designed and timed to interfere with our election and to damage a presidential candidate.”
As recently as April of this year, top government officials were concerned the country is still not ready to fend off a litany of potential cyberattacks aimed at throwing the 2020 election. “We recognize that our adversaries are going to keep adapting and upping their game,” FBI director Christopher Wray said during a speech in Washington last month following the release of a redacted version of Mueller’s report.
In preparation for safeguarding the U.S., the FBI has moved close to 40 agents and analysts to its counterintelligence division, the Department of Homeland Security established a new unit in its National Risk Management Center and the National Security Agency has expended an election security task force, according to The New York Times.
Still, a reported lack of coordination among Washington bureaucrats threatens to impede progress and leave vulnerable democratic processes. Whatever becomes of pending congressional investigations, securing the U.S. election system should be a nonnegotiable outcome of Mueller’s efforts.
Furthermore, Mueller deserves credit for his steady, almost invisible, profile the past two years. How he conducted one of the most politically divisive investigations in recent memory is evidence he was, as he alleged, “guided by principles of fairness.” Even to the very end, he didn’t sell out, refraining to answer questions from the press and signalling he would not appear before Congress.
Lawmakers now should let the same principles of fairness guide their actions by ensuring the country is safe from bad actors rather than losing themselves in partisan squabbles. America can’t afford to let seeds of division take root when democracy is on the line.

When a glimpse of starlight gave science hope

Texto completo: For Bloomberg
The test that convinced the world that Albert Einstein was right about the universe was enmeshed in the history of the First World War: The fighting affected which researchers failed and who succeeded, and when. When scientists finally did the key observations 100 years ago, on May 29, 1919, their feat acted as an antidote to leftover bitterness between former enemies Germany and England.
Testing the theory of relativity required precise observations of starlight during a total solar eclipse. One German astronomer chasing an eclipse in 1914 got into Russia before the war started but was soon captured and detained, his equipment confiscated.
When English scientists finally tested Einstein using that 1919 eclipse, the event generated worldwide headlines and served as a symbol of reconciliation — a demonstration of science transcending nationalism. It was a story of English astronomers helping to replace the bedrock of physics formulated by their own countryman, Isaac Newton, with a theory created by a German.
Newton formulated gravity as an invisible force between massive objects. Einstein’s theory replaced it with the notion that objects warped space-time and deflected the paths of other objects. Most people didn’t understand Einstein’s theory, but they appreciated it nonetheless.
Einstein himself proposed using an eclipse as a test back in 1911, well before the theory was published in 1915, said historian and physicist Daniel Kennefick, author of the book, No Shadow of a Doubt: The 1919 Eclipse That Confirmed Einstein’s Theory of Relativity.
In Newton’s theory, starlight would be unaffected by the gravitational pull of a massive object such as the sun. In Einstein’s theory, the sun’s mass would bend space, and the starlight moving through it, creating a tiny discrepancy between the apparent positions of stars whose light passed by the sun, and those same stars at night. And as astronomers knew, the one time it was possible to observe starlight passing by the sun was during a total eclipse.
After the 1914 attempt led to the arrest of the German astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich, there was another suitable eclipse in 1916, but by then war was all over Europe. Another try in 1918 failed because the American astronomers who were well positioned to see the eclipse never got their equipment back from Russia, where they had also gone in 1914.
By the time of the 1919 eclipse, the war was finally over, but this was a tough one to observe, said Kennefick. The path went mostly over ocean, and where it did cross land, it was over some of the most impenetrable parts of the Amazon in South America and the Congo Basin in Africa. And by that point, the Germans were not in a position to fund any expeditions.
But word of Einstein’s theory had reached English astronomer Arthur Eddington. He and some colleagues went to the Principe Island off the west coast of Africa, and as a backup, another English astronomer, Frank Dyson, organized an expedition to the town of Sobral, in Brazil. Both groups got a mix of failed images and good ones, and the good ones looked to confirm Einstein by showing the starlight deflected by the predicted amount.
Kennefick said the news caught the public imagination in a big way, and Einstein became an overnight celebrity. According to a story in Discover, the front page of The Times of London ran the headline “New Theory of the Universe: Newtonian Ideas Overthrown.” The New York Times reported: “Men of Science More or Less Agog.”
The feat helped dissolve bitterness left by the war, said Kennefick. But history moves on. One of the consequences of Einstein’s re-imagining of the universe was the equation E=mc2, which made people realize that a weapon like no other might be possible. And that changed everything.
Historians still argue whether scientific advances really represent progress, either in the human condition or our collective wisdom. But advances in science and technology prevent history from repeating itself, at least not exactly. The cycles of peace and war continue as always, but the nature of both continues to change each time around.

Turkey frees jailed US citizen who worked for NASA

Texto completo: An American citizen and former NASA scientist who had been jailed in Turkey was suddenly freed Wednesday.
39-year-old Serkan Golge has been in Turkish custody since 2016 when he was arrested in the southern part of the country while on vacation. The arrest occurred in the midst of a failed coup attempt where thousands were detained on dubious evidence as suspicions swirled in the Turkish government. Golge was sentenced to five years on terrorism charges.
Golge’s wife, Kubra Golge, confirmed to the New York Times that her husband was indeed released.
“I just talked to him on the phone. He is going back to his family,” she said. “He was shocked.”
“He said ‘I am very thankful I am out of prison. I am very happy.’ And I cried,” Kubra Golge added.
Golge was accused of working with U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government alleged was the mastermind behind the failed coup attempt. The only evidence authorities had against Golge was a $1 bill they found after searching his brother’s house. Turkish prosecutors alleged that Gülen would give blessed $1 bills to his followers.
Golge’s release came just hours after a Wednesday phone call between President Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A readout from the phone call said that the two discussed bilateral issues, including trade and tariffs. Golge was not mentioned in the readout and the White House did not confirm to the Washington Examiner that his case was discussed.
Prior to his arrest, the Turkish-American Golge was a senior research scientist at NASA studying the effects of space radiation on humans in the International Space Station. He traveled from Turkey to the U.S. in 2003 and became a citizen in 2010.
Turkey released American pastor Andrew Brunson in October. He was also swept up in the 2016 wave of arrests associated with the attempted coup. Trump had made Brunson's freedom a top priority in discussions with Turkey.

Texto completo: Presidential debate season is almost here, with 23 contenders hoping to make it to primetime. The Democratic National Committee has plans for 12 debates — six this year, six next year.
The first primary debate will air on NBC, MSNBC, and Telemundo over two nights, June 26 and 27. So far, 19 candidates qualify, which means they have at least 1 percent support in three qualifying polls, or provide evidence of at least 65,000 individual donations from a minimum of 200 different donors in at least 20 states.
The second debate, with the same qualifications for entry, will be on CNN on July 30 and 31.
And, as announced this week, the third debate will be on Sept. 12 and 13 on ABC and Univision. The qualifications are tighter for those wanting to participate in this one: A candidate will need to either have at least 2 percent support in three qualifying polls, or provide evidence of at least 130,000 individual donations from a minimum of 400 different donors in at least 20 states.

Texto completo: Critics and defenders of the National Security Agency faced off this weekend over a New York Times report detailing how hackers who locked up Baltimore's computer networks for the past two weeks relied partly on a leaked NSA hacking tool.
The tool, dubbed EternalBlue, has also been used to lock up city networks in San Antonio and Allentown, Pennsylvania, the Times reported.
Critics say the NSA is hellbent on developing dangerous hacking tools to use against adversaries and isn't adequately preparing for what happens when those tools leak and are used against U.S. targets.
Frank Baitman, a former chief information officer at the Health and Human Services Department, compared the situation to biological weapons that make their way out of a U.S. government lab and infect citizens. The federal government, he tweeted, should shoulder some of the cost of Baltimore's ransomware attack and other such breaches using the leaked code.
Baltimore City Council President Brandon Scott echoed that call and urged President Donald Trump to declare a federal disaster, which could speed federal funding.
"Given the new information and circumstances it's even more clear that the federal government needs to have a larger role in supporting the city's recovery," he said in a statement.
Many security researchers, however, say the real problem isn't with the NSA. They say that hacking victims like Baltimore still haven't taken sufficient measures against EternalBlue two years after it first leaked -- and aren't using a software patch released by Microsoft to to protect themselves
"If an organization has substantial numbers of Windows machines that have gone 2 years without patches, then that's squarely the fault of the organization, not Eternalblue," security researcher Robert Graham tweeted.
Robert Lee, a former NSA hacker who's now CEO of the cybersecurity company Dragos, said the NSA deserves some blame for EternalBlue being stolen. But he added but that culpability shifts as more time elapses with victims not taking measures to protect themselves:
In the Baltimore case, EternalBlue wasn't the main element of the malware that permitted hackers to take control of the city's networks. But it allowed them to move more easily from system to system and to broaden the scope of the attack, the Times reported.
And that's enough to cause alarm among some traditional defenders of the NSA.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Md., whose district includes Fort Meade and part of Baltimore, are asking the NSA for a briefing on EternalBlue's role in the Baltimore attack, the Baltimore Sun reported.
The cybersecurity community has long battled over whether the U.S. government draws the right lines when it decides whether to alert companies about hackable vulnerabilities it finds in their software and hardware or to exploit those vulnerabilities to spy on foreign adversaries.
The Trump administration says it vets those computer bugs through a governmentwide process called a "vulnerabilities equities review" and alerts industry roughly 90 percent of the time. But critics point out the bugs government holds onto are usually the most damaging.
The debate has grown fiercer in recent years as leaks and breaches have exposed a trove of government hacking tools used by foreign intelligence agencies and criminal hackers.Those leaks have raised serious questions about whether the government is capable of keeping its covert hacking capabilities truly secret.
That includes the 2017 leak of NSA tools - including EternalBlue - by a hacking group called Shadow Brokers and a leak of CIA tools dubbed Vault 7 to WikiLeaks that same year. Officials have not publicly tied Shadow Brokers to any foreign government or other organization. The Justice Department charged a former CIA employee with the Vault 7 leak in 2018.
EternalBlue was a component in the WannaCry ransomware that North Korea used in 2017, affecting more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries, and in the NotPetya attack launched by Russia the same year that wiped data from computers at banks, energy firms and government agencies.
Thomas Drake, a former NSA official and early whistleblower about the agency's warrantless phone and email surveillance programs, accused the NSA on Twitter of sacrificing the nation's security because of an "obsession with offensively owning the 'net.' "
Some security researchers, however, say the NSA is being unfairly blamed for a proliferation of dangerous hacking tools that would have happened whether or not the agency's tools had leaked.
If those tools hadn't leaked, they say, hackers would just use other ones that are equally damaging.

Texto completo: The Democrats running the House of Representatives have gone insane — and they prove it every day.
Despite the conclusions of the Mueller Report, Nancy Pelosi and her Deranged Democrat underlings in the House have not given up their fight to depose President Trump. They have six kangaroo committees in the House subpoenaing anyone who ever played golf with the president and looking everywhere they can for whatever financial or personal dirt they can find to use against him and his administration.
The Mad House Democrats don't care what irresponsible charges they make. When it comes to Trump, all's fair in hate and war.
Meanwhile, while they make fools of themselves and waste time trying to over-ride the Mueller Report, the Deranged Democrats refuse to do a single thing about the invasion of migrants on our southern border.
No Democrat would be caught dead calling it "an invasion." Neither would any journalist or pundit employed by CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times or the Washington Post. But when you have thousands and thousands of Central American asylum seekers over-running our border every day and overwhelming our ability to process and properly care for their families, it's an invasion.
Overcrowding is so bad now at the Texas border that the Border Patrol has had to fly or bus migrant families to processing centers in towns like Santa Fe, Denver, San Diego, San Bernardino and Murrieta, a city of about 100,000 between LA and San Diego.
No one is quite sure where they go after they are processed, but it could be anywhere. And they have little or no money, no food, no place to stay — just a slip of paper telling them to show up at their asylum hearing two years from now.
There's nothing planned.
The mainstream liberal media are especially at fault because they have done such a biased, half-butted job of covering the migrant invasion. They've shown us every misery suffered by the poor migrants after they get to American soil. And they've made sure the whole country knows the details about the separated families and the tragic deaths of six kids in U.S. custody — all of which, of course, are entirely the fault of a man named Trump.
They have consistently underplayed the scope of the invasion problem, its economic and social costs, its causes (bad immigration laws and a chicken Congress) and ignored its many other victims — the American ones.
The migrant invasion has hurt the overworked border patrol officers, the people and property owners in the towns at the border, American taxpayers and the poorest citizens of the USA whose unskilled jobs are most likely to be taken by migrants.
Now we have cities and towns far from the border becoming the latest victims of Washington's failure to fix immigration. It's their citizens who are going to have to pay for a lot of the food, housing, policing, education and healthcare of the migrants.

Texto completo: One thing that mystifies me about some corners of the cocktail world is the ongoing romanticizing of the American period of Prohibition, the nadir of this country's strange love-hate relationship with alcohol.
Even now, rarely does a week go by when I don't get a pitch for some new booze that summons the era or some new speakeasy-themed bar. To be clear, I like hidden entrances as much as the next bookish child who read "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" 30 times. And I like secret bars - even if I do scour the Internet for extremely specific directions before attempting to find one, to make sure I don't end up wandering helplessly around a hardware store without ever finding the specific hammer I have to turn six degrees to the left to reveal the secret entrance to Tools. (Such ridiculousness is at least better than so-called speakeasies that turn out to be in a hotel lobby, with windows you can see into, and you're left wondering what the speakeasy element is supposed to be. Is it that one bartender's mustache? It does seem a little old-timey.)
But really, stateside, Prohibition was a bad time. Today we make cocktails because they enhance and complement the flavors of quality spirits, but much of the mixing that happened during those dark years was to hide the flavors of bad booze. Violent crime increased, and lots of people died drinking denatured alcohol the government had deliberately poisoned to deter people from drinking it. For real: In a letter to the New York Times in 1927, humorist Will Rogers grimly joked that government "used to murder by the bullet only. Now it's by the quart."
If you must pine for the past, better to focus what Prohibition wrought across the pond in Europe, where many American bartenders and drinkers headed during the dry years. Or much closer to home, where 90 miles off the Florida coast, affluent Americans gallivanted off in droves to a place where both the literal and tippling climates were warmer. Prohibition didn't stop Americans from drinking, but it did a heck of a lot for the tourism industry in pre-revolutionary Cuba.
The Cuban bar scene was already swinging by the time Prohibition hit in the States, but the influx of thirsty Americans with money to spend helped push it further. Cuba was the first-known country to have an official bartending association (started in 1924), and from its beginning, the bartending culture that developed was an elegant one. The country's first guide for bartenders, the 1915 "Manual del Cantinero," provides an extensive recipe collection - but before that, it gives instructions regarding appearance and deportment, specifying that every good bartender must be well dressed, and that his white vest and shirt must always be clean, and that he should never socialize, play dice, smoke or drink with customers while he's working.
At least one bartender in Prohibition-era Havana later became very well known for his daiquiris: Constante Ribalaigua Vert of La Florida, better known as Floridita, where Ernest Hemingway drank (and drank, and drank) his preferred Papa Dobles, the rum-heavy daiquiris Ribalaigua named for him.
If you drop the word "cantinero" into a translator, you'll get "bartender," but bartending can encompass a lot of different styles and activities, and the translation doesn't capture the elegance of the Cuban tradition. It's that style that Julio Cabrera has long been training bartenders in, and it's that culture that he's aiming to preserve at Cafe La Trova on Calle Ocho in Miami, his project with chef Michelle Bernstein.
When I previously spoke to Cabrera, it was last year during the craziness of Tales of the Cocktail, the annual drinks conference in New Orleans, before he opened La Trova. It took us about 10 minutes to just cross the lobby to find a quiet place to talk, because young bartenders kept stopping Cabrera with hugs or fist bumps, wanting to catch up with a man many of them regard as a mentor. Cabrera has tended bar in his native Cuba, the United States, Italy and Mexico and has been leading bartender trips to Cuba to increase knowledge of the cantinero style for years.
La Trova, he hoped, would give him a chance to spread the tradition further. He described the project as his "dream bar," one that would reflect his love of his native country in its food, coffee, live music and drinks.
Open now for six months, La Trova naturally serves (along with an assortment of original cocktails) the most famous Cuban drinks: the El Presidente, the Hotel Nacional (a bright, rum-based sour with apricot liqueur) and, of course, a classic daiquiri and mojito. Those last two drinks are the greatest icons among Cuban cocktails, Cabrera says. And they've truly gone global - though with mixed levels of success.
Making a great daiquiri has become a point of pride for many bartenders, as it's a seemingly simple concoction - just rum, lime and sweetener - that falls apart if any of the three elements are out of balance. (Interestingly, in Cuba, Cabrera says, most bars continue to sweeten all their drinks with sugar rather than simple syrup. "With simple syrup, you're already mixing sugar with water, so you're adding dilution before you even start the drink," he notes.)
If the likelihood of finding a good daiquiri outside Cuba has improved, the picture is less rosy on the mojito front. "Ninety-nine percent of mojitos I have, still, everywhere I go, are not made the right way," he says. The glitches he sees are multiple: crushed ice rather than cubes, shaking the drink instead of muddling the mint and building the drink right in the glass, or topping it off with sugary Sprite rather than the neutral bubble of club soda.
But when it comes to the cantinero style, a bartender can make a great drink and still not nail the approach. "It's not just making the cocktail; it's making it a different way," Cabrera explains, "with attention to detail and particular flair. Cantineros were known for great technique and hospitality, and they were expected to make good cocktails, but be part of the hospitality and entertainment as well."
One technique that's far more common in Cuban bartending is throwing drinks, a mixing technique that hasn't yet caught on widely in American bars. It's a delight to watch (and fun to try at home): Rather than shaking or stirring, the bartender "throws" the drink from one container to the other, pouring it from one tin to the other from a substantial distance, creating a long, slender ribbon of liquid that magically goes where it's supposed to. It adds chill, dilution and texture without the more substantial bubble and froth that comes from a hard shake.
Cabrera takes the cantinero tradition seriously, and noted that La Trova follows the early traditions for its bartenders' dress and grooming of short hair, clean nails, no jewelry, no visible tattoos. He's not asking his staff for anything he wouldn't do himself: At Tales, he was sporting a neat little soul patch, but told me that it would be gone before La Trova opened. When we spoke again, with La Trova up and humming, he confirmed: His chin is now bare, as clean and crisp as a perfect daiquiri.

Texto completo: “¡Wow, qué es eso, hombre!”, exclamó un piloto, “¡mira cómo vuela!”.
Objetos voladores no identificados (ovnis en español, ufos en inglés) fueron vistos casi a diario entre el verano de 2014 y la primavera de 2015 en los cielos de la Costa Este. Y los testigos no fueron personajes dudosos sino pilotos de élite de la Marina estadounidense , que lo reportaron a sus mandos en el Pentágono e incluso al Congreso.
“ Esas cosas estaban ahí fuera todo el dí a”, explica ahora uno de ellos, Ryan Graves, al diario The New York Times. “Mantener un avión en el aire requiere de una cantidad notable de energía; a la velocidad a la que los vimos, 12 horas en el aire son 11 horas más de las que esperaríamos”, explicó Graves.
Este piloto de cazabombarderos F/A-18, que lleva una década en la Marina, se refería a objetos no identificados de formas extrañas (uno parecía una peonza girando en contra del viento; otro parecía una pastilla contra la tos del tamaño de un avión comercial).
A veces, quedaban grabados en video. En al menos una ocasión, estuvieron a punto de colisionar en el aire contra los cazas de combate. No parece que tengan motor, pero pueden alcanzar los 30,000 pies de altura a velocidades supersónicas. Y nadie dice que sean extraterrestres , pero no siempre parece existir una explicación plausible.
Tanto Graves como otros cuatro pilotos con los que habló el citado diario insisten en que vieron esos objetos durante unas maniobras de entrenamiento con el portaviones Theodore Roosevelt sobre el cielo entre Virginia y Florida. No aportan eso sí ninguna posible explicación.
La Marina tampoco tiene una versión oficial, pero sí ha difundido este año un manual secreto sobre cómo reportar un encuentro de sus pilotos con un ovni.
En algunos casos puede tratarse de drones comerciales , explica un portavoz, Joseph Gradisher, pero en otras ocasiones “no sabemos quién está detrás, no tenemos suficiente información”.
Los avistamientos de 2015 y 2015 fueron reportados a un programa secreto poco conocido del Pentágono “para la identificación de amenazas aeroespaciales”. Su responsable, Luis Elizondo, dimitió en 2017 tras calificarlos como “una sorprendente serie de incidentes”.
Su origen extraterrestre “es tan improbable que compite con otras explicaciones también poco probables y más mundanas”, arguye Leon Golub, astrofísico del centro Harvard-Smithsonian.
Como posibles explicaciones señala a errores en los aparatos de detección de los aviones, efectos o reflejos atmosféricos, o incluso errores en los sentidos de los pilotos debidos a la abundancia de estímulos en un vuelo a alta velocidad.
“La gente lleva décadas viendo cosas extrañas desde aviones militares”, explica el piloto Ryan Graves, “ sería muy gordo que hubiera algo allí arriba”.
Su compañero Danny Accoin afirma que se cruzó en dos ocasiones con estos objetos, capaces de acelerar, frenar y volver a acelerar a velocidad supersónicas como ningún avión conocido .
La primera vez, apareció en su radar pero él no lo pudo ver. Unos días después, uno de sus misiles lo detectó como posible objetivo, y también apareció en su cámara de infrarrojos, aunque él tampoco pudo verlo .
Los pilotos especularon con la posibilidad de que pudiera tratarse de un programa secreto de aviones o drones de última generación.
Pero el hecho de que se rozara una catástrofe cuando uno de esos objetos (descrito por el piloto como una esfera con un cubo dentro) pasó junto a un avión convenció a los pilotos de que un programa así no se permitiría en una zona de maniobras por el peligro que entrañaría.
Además, los ovnis no se comportan como un avión normal. “ La velocidad no mata ”, explica Graves, “frenar o acelerar sí”. Estos objetos pasan de cero a velocidad supersónica de forma casi inmediata, y trazan curvas que van más allá de lo que un piloto podría resistir.
“Cuando la gente dice haber observado fenómenos realmente extraños, a veces vale la pena investigar en serio”, dice la astrofísica Sara Seager, pero “lo que la gente a veces no entiende sobre la ciencia es que a menudo tenemos fenómenos que siguen sin poder ser explicados ”

CONGRESS HAS A RIGHT TO SEE TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS THE TREASURY SECRETARY IS DEFYING THE LAW AND SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT

Texto completo: An excerpted editorial from
The New York Times
As to whether Congress may obtain a president's tax returns, there is no ambiguity: Federal law empowers the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to submit a written request to the Treasury Department, which oversees the Internal Revenue Service, for "any return or return information." The Treasury secretary then "shall furnish" the requested information to the committee so that it may conduct its legislative functions.
Perhaps that statute is not clear enough for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The secretary earlier this month rebuffed just such a request from Rep. Richard Neal, the Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. In April, Mr. Neal requested six years' worth of federal tax returns for President Donald Trump and several of his companies.
The purpose of the request was not "harassment" of the president, as Mr. Trump and his defenders have branded efforts by Democratic House members to perform legitimate oversight functions. Rather, as Mr. Neal told the IRS, the committee "is considering legislative proposals and conducting oversight related to our federal tax laws, including, but not limited to, the extent to which the IRS audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president."
In a letter responding to Mr. Neal on May 6, Mr. Mnuchin said he consulted with the Justice Department and determined that the chairman's request "lacks a legitimate legislative purpose" and that the Treasury Department "may not lawfully fulfill the committee's request."
The Treasury secretary cited no authority for this stonewalling, which is consistent with the Trump administration's broad resistance to congressional oversight and the president's push to quash any investigation into his finances.
Just as the law is clear on this matter, so, too, is Supreme Court precedent. The court has repeatedly affirmed the validity of congressional actions taken within the "sphere of legitimate legislative activity" - and it has recognized that this sphere is far-reaching, encompassing "inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes."
In examining Mr. Trump's tax returns, Congress could determine that legislation forcing disclosure of a candidate's tax returns is necessary to guard against future presidential corruption and conflicts of interests.
Or it might not. As the Supreme Court put it in an instructive 1975 opinion largely upholding congressional prerogatives, "To be a valid legislative inquiry, there need be no predictable end result." It is also true that the court has elsewhere acknowledged that there is no such thing as the power on the part of Congress "to expose the private affairs of individuals without justification." Then, as now, the search for specific records must be tied to "a legitimate task of the Congress."
Mr. Neal is well aware of these precedents, which he cited in a follow-up letter to the IRS 10 days after his initial request for Mr. Trump's records. He seems to be preparing for a showdown in the courts, which, if history serves as a guide, should give him and his committee the latitude to continue their legislative functions unimpeded.

Texto completo: "It's time to celebrate!"
Hundreds of volunteers who aided the grim search and sensational rescue of Amanda Eller will celebrate Monday at a barbecue bash promoted by the "Findamanda" Facebook page.
The party reflects the relief and joy being expressed by friends and family of Eller, a physical therapist and yoga instructor who walked into a Hawaiian forest on May 8 and was not seen again for more than two weeks.
Eller, 35, survived on wild fruit, water, grit and determination. On Friday, searchers in a helicopter spotted her near a creek bed, and she was airlifted to safety about two hours later. Eller suffered a leg fracture and abrasions, was sunburned and hungry but was otherwise in good shape, her family said.
Eller, from her hospital bed, thanked the hundreds of volunteers who conducted exhaustive searches. She said her 17 days in Maui's Makawao Forest Reserve were the most difficult of her life.
"There were times of total fear and loss and wanting to give up," she said in video posted on Facebook. "It did come down to life and death and I had to choose. I chose life – I wasn't going to take the easy way out. "
Eller's mother, Julia, said her daughter hiked into the woods, stopped to meditate, then couldn't find her way back to her car. The SUV was found in the Makawao parking lot, her wallet and phone inside.
Julia Eller said her daughter kept walking, surviving by drinking from the creek and eating wild raspberries and other fruits. Amanda lost about 15 pounds. She fell two feet off a ledge and broke a bone in her leg. She lost her shoes in a flash flood. But she did not give up.
“I heard this voice that said, ‘If you want to live, keep going,'" Amanda Eller told The New York Times.
Julia Eller said Amanda waved at helicopters that occasionally flew overhead, but that the canopy was apparently too thick for searchers to see her. Amanda finally hiked to a waterfall, encountering a 20-foot cliff. She could go no farther. And the search for food was growing more difficult.
Julia Eller said she never gave up hope her daughter would be found.
"She's a trouper, a real warrior," Julia Eller said. "And I had no doubt that if anybody could make it through it, it was her. "
Julia Eller's hopes became reality when Javier Cantellops, Chris Berquist and Troy Helmer spotted Amanda late Friday from a helicopter.
Cantellops is a former Army Ranger who operates "Masters of Adventure," which leads diving, spearfishing and other outings in the Maui area. He said he, Berquist and Helmer were surveying terrain for possible locations to enter the woods on foot when they saw her.
"It was like a movie, man," he told a new conference Saturday. "Out of nowhere, we look and we did a double take. Out of the woods she comes. It's an incredibly happy ending. "
Cantellops said the helicopter dropped him and another searcher off more than 300 yards from Amanda, and the duo "broke brush all the way" to reach her.
As they approached her, "I said 'Do you recognize this voice? And she said "Javier?!"
"It's been a surreal moment," Cantellops said of the hours since the rescue. "I had to check my phone today to make sure it all really happened. "
Eller said her daughter was fearful that searchers might have given up. But the leaders of the search never wavered, she said. Dr. Zora Bulatovic, who treated Amanda, said she looks "amazing" and should recover fully.
“It's just a miracle that our daughter has come home to us," Eller said. "Miracles do happen. ”

State's own medical history intriguing

Texto completo: Last summer, my friend Billy Mounger suffered spinal issues. Fortunately, Billy's doctor advised against surgery. Other interventions — acupuncture, massage, physical therapy, and yoga — proved salutary.
Quality medical care involves intelligent scrutiny of options. Failure to educate oneself carries consequences. Assessing one's choices is agonizing absent knowledge. "Images in Mississippi Medicine" by Dr. Lucius "Luke" M. Lampton and Karen Evers (Mississippi State Medical Association) offers outstanding opportunities to comprehend the evolution of medicine in the Magnolia State.
The history documents disparate delivery of medical services. Patients were segregated by race at most hospitals for decades. The first African American hospital was in Natchez, in 1852. "African American fraternal orders... played key roles in [erecting] similar hospitals [throughout] the South during... Jim Crow...."
Dr. James Buchanan, at the East Mississippi Insane Asylum — built in 1885 to alleviate crowding at the Jackson Lunatic Asylum (where the University of Mississippi Medical Center sits today) — "wrote extensively on mental illness among African American patients at the institution and his writing on 'Insanity in the Colored Race' provided some of the first serious studies in America on mental illness among African Americans."
Yellow fever was likely introduced into "the new world by A. aegypti mosquito-infested slave ships voyaging from West Africa," and doctors first recognized the disease in the Americas in Yucatán, Mexico, in 1648. "Over the next two and a half centuries, yellow fever erupted with regularity... with hundreds of thousands of deaths, earning the virus deserved recognition as one of the worst plagues... ever...."
Gov. J.P. Coleman championed efforts to replace the racially segregated VA hospital in west Jackson with "the current VA east of UMMC. The Legislature resisted his efforts due to the requirement that it be... integrated.... Coleman, to his credit, stated at that divisive time: 'If we're going to be realistic, we should acknowledge that the federal government is not going to change its policy. The question is whether we want to do it.... I'm in favor of going ahead and giving the federal government permission to construct this facility.' Without Coleman's brave leadership, the new VA facility would not have been constructed."
The first African American Professor at UMMC was Dr. Helen Barnes, in 1969. Dr. Oswald Smith, of Clarksdale, was the first African American elected to the Mississippi State Medical Association in 1956. (An African American medical association, the Mississippi Medical and Surgical Association, existed from 1901). Dr. Smith was the first African American to contribute an article to the MSMA Journal, in 1959. Dr. Claude Brunson became MSMA's first African American president, in 2014.
Apart from Magnolia State medical history, the book provides personal perspective for those with roots here:
"... [T]he Hill-Burton Act (the Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946) would become the most forceful agent of change in the state, and hospitals the first public places integrated. Despite the strong support of Southern white politicians (Hill was an Alabama senator), facilities receiving Hill-Burton funding were not allowed to discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, or creed."
Lister Hill lived opposite my Montgomery maternal grandparents for decades. I knew him and appreciated learning more about his efforts expanding health care facilities in underserved areas. The New York Times noted, on Jan. 27, 1968, that Hill "has done more for the health of Americans in modern times than any man outside the medical profession."
I discovered that the 1903 two-year medical school was not made a four-year facility until 1955, but it attempted briefly to become one, utilizing clinical facilities at the Kuhn Memorial Hospital in Vicksburg, endowed by uncles of my great-aunt.
The historic MSMA gavel is pictured displaying the plate commemorating my oldest friend's namesake grandfather's tenure as MSMA president.
Succinctly put, the volume is pure pleasure, worth anyone's attention.

Hold off on impeaching president - for now

Texto completo: With all due apologies, I know I've weighed in on the debate about impeaching Donald Trump in previous columns. The reason I take it up again is because so many Democrats still can't decide how to proceed.
Democrats are split into two camps. Those who say it's a mistake to start impeachment hearings because they're bound to fail. Trump will still be in the White House because Senate Trumpers will never vote to convict him. And those who insist that - even if they're sure to fail - Democrats must begin impeachment hearings anyway, because not doing so would in effect endorse Trump's unacceptable presidential behavior. More than any other factor, how that issue is resolved, I believe, could determine what happens in 2020.
First, let's be clear. Why should Trump be impeached? He's debased the office of the presidency. He's told thousands of lies. He played footsie with a foreign adversary to win an election. He obstructed justice, many times. He intimidated witnesses. He ordered top aides to commit crimes. He defied congressional subpoenas.
There's no doubt, as Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., concluded after reading the Mueller report, Trump has "engaged in impeachable conduct." Whether he actually committed crimes does not matter, Amash points out, because impeachment "simply requires a finding that an official has engaged in careless, abusive, corrupt, or otherwise dishonorable conduct" - all spelled out in the report.
Still, no matter how strong the case, Speaker Nancy Pelosi's advised Democrats in Congress not to rush into impeachment. They're better off, she told them, focusing instead on three priorities: their legislative agenda, especially health care; oversight hearings; and beating Donald Trump in 2020. And, for a while, most Democrats agreed to hold back. Until last week.
For many Democrats, what made the difference was Trump's stopping former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before the House Judiciary Committee.
Democrats wanted to hear from McGahn because, after revealing that Trump twice ordered McGahn to fire the special counsel and then lie to The New York Times about it, Mueller says it's up to Congress to investigate further in order to determine whether Trump is guilty of criminal obstruction of justice. By blocking McGahn's testimony, Trump's also blocking Congress from doing its job.
On top of that came Baby Donnie's White House temper tantrum. In a stunt orchestrated ahead of time, Trump stormed out of an infrastructure meeting with Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, supposedly upset because Pelosi had earlier accused him of engaging in a cover-up, which he has, and went to the Rose Garden, where reporters were assembled in front of a lectern with the sign "No Collusion. No Obstruction."
"I don't do cover-ups," Trump fumed. No, and Nixon wasn't a crook, either.
With that, the anti-impeachment dam built by Pelosi began to crumble. A week ago, there were only a handful of Democrats wanting to start impeachment hearings. Today, there are 30 to 40, including at least one member of the House leadership, Rhode Island's David Cicilline.
Still, Pelosi urges restraint, based on five arguments.
One, doing impeachment would suck up all the oxygen and make it practically impossible to pass legislation on any issue. Two, impeachment has little public and zero, aside from Justin Amash, bipartisan support. Three, Democrats can achieve almost the same results by proceeding first with oversight hearings now underway in the judiciary, intelligence, financial services, ways and means and oversight committees. Four, as noted above, impeachment would hit a dead end in the Senate. Five, impeachment might help Trump, by allowing him to run for re-election as a victim.
For now, I believe, Pelosi makes a strong case. Democrats are smart to hold off, while letting the case build against Trump for 2020. But that could still change, depending on how he responds to court rulings against him. After refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas, if Trump also rejects court orders to comply, he'd be declaring war on not one, but two co-equal branches of government. At that point, Democrats would have no choice but to launch impeachment hearings. And it's a safe bet that's what's going to happen.

Texto completo: On my first visit to one of Maine's unbridged, yet well-inhabited islands, I chatted with a woman who told me she had to get to bed early for a medical procedure the next day. To complete it, she told me, she had to travel by ferry off-island, then by taxi. The journey promised to be quite a slog.
"That seems like a lot of trouble for something so straightforward," I remarked. "Why not do it here?"
"Oh, there are no doctors on the island," she replied.
Seeing the alarm on my face, my new friend tried to allay my concerns: "But don't worry. If you get sick while you're here, we have a veterinarian. That's pretty close."
I have been reminded of that conversation quite a bit this week, every time I look back at my notes from a recent meal at Freeport's Azure CafÃ©.
Open since early 2003, Azure CafÃ© quickly became known for its fine-dining, multi-course, mostly Italian menu and romantic setting. "We actually had white tablecloths on the tables for the first year," owner and general manager Jonas Werner told me. "But I think people were a little intimidated by the formality of the place, so we got rid of them, but we kept the food the same."
During the subsequent dozen years, under former executive chef Christopher Bassett, Azure CafÃ© won awards from Wine Spectator, Yankee Magazine and TripAdvisor, as well as a three-and-a-half-star review from this paper in 2014.
Things changed abruptly a little over three years ago, when Bassett departed to become a baker and manager at Slab Sicilian Street Food in Portland. The owners chose not to replace him.
"No chef. It's just my kitchen supervisors and me," Werner said. "We come up with new recipes, and we're trying to transform the restaurant and the menu into something we believe is more palatable to today's diners, especially between 21 and 40 who are used to what I call chef-run restaurants. Places where they don't allow for substitutions, you get more small plates and food is sent out of the kitchen when it's ready."
With brighter lighting, terra-cotta paint to replace olive drab on the walls and Pandora spinning a soundtrack called Hipster BBQ at lunchtime and Hipster Cocktail Party during dinner, Azure CafÃ© is jockeying to become both more casual and trendy - a cool, "chef-run" restaurant...with no chef.
Some of Bassett's dishes remain on the menu and continue to impress. There's a bitsy sliver of flourless chocolate torte ($7.25), lavish with bittersweet ganache and accessorized with a smoky, Knob Creek Bourbon caramel drizzle; the Insalata Mescolare ($7/$11), a simple spinach salad brightened up with a grilled-strawberry vinaigrette and a scattering of candied pistachios. Or the best item I tasted on my recent visit, a bountiful cioppino ($34) with a half-lobster, countneck clams and mussels plunged into a crimson broth that prickled with peppery heat.
Still, a good recipe only takes you so far, as my side dish of Parmesan risotto ($7) showed. Glopped carelessly onto a small plate, the unbudging mound of rice was too oniony and fatty, having been loosened before service with cream, rather than an extra ladleful of vegetable broth. It's hard not to imagine that with a good chef on the pass, this plate never would have made it into the dining room.
Alongside legacy dishes are newer additions designed, as Werner told me, to "appeal to a non-traditional Azure CafÃ© customer, a diner looking for something more interesting." One, the chickpea fritters ($7), really just Werner's take on falafel, were lovely: crisp little garlicky quenelles fried to a walnut-brown and served still steaming inside. The accompanying Sriracha aioli was also a smart way to add kick to the dish.
Much less successful, the chicken and waffles ($18) came from the "From Azure" portion of the menu that our server explained elliptically "means things that aren't necessarily from Italy, or Maine, or anywhere." Featuring boneless, double-breaded chicken breasts that were more like chicken fingers than traditional fried chicken, and cardamom-infused maple syrup on a too-sweet, excessively cinnamon-spiced waffle, this entrÃ©e tasted like a brunch dish engineered to appeal to an 8-year-old.
Judging from the mostly middle-aged patrons eating in the dining room with me, most of whom had opted for Italian-American dishes like eggplant Parmesan ($22) and linguine with meatballs ($19.75), it seems safe to say that Azure CafÃ©'s recent bid to lure more youthful diners with its eclectic menu isn't paying dividends yet.
Indeed, the youngest people in the place were the staff, and while they weren't paying guests, several were active participants in the drive toward informality. In the open kitchen, one of the line cooks sported a beachy black tank top - no apron. Worse, the host, who wore droopy, unhemmed khakis and an unlaced pair of the filthiest sneakers I have seen outside of a tractor pull.
"Careful of the door in there," he cautioned me on my way to the men's bathroom. I tried pushing and pulling, but his warning was apt: The door refused to shut until it was slammed. Exhausted, I could only manage to wedge it roughly into the jamb. It would have to do, I reasoned. Not what I needed, but it was pretty close.

Texto completo: very week, The New York Times Magazine publishes a column called The Ethicist. It's like an advice column, but it focuses on how to be a good person. People from all over the world write in questions about problems they're facing, looking for answers from the expert who writes back to them.
This column has been around for 20 years, at least since I was a teenager and would read my aunt's copy of the magazine. I mostly looked at it for the pictures, but I also loved The Ethicist. It was evidence that sometimes the grown-ups around me didn't know what to do, and had to ask for help.
Now I work at the magazine in the photo department. Part of my job is to post The Ethicist on Instagram every week to see what other people think about the questions. That's how I noticed Queyka Saint-Louis, a 16-year-old from Randolph, Mass., who often commented with her own advice. I was surprised that someone so young left responses so insightful and clever, and I found myself looking for them.
I decided to reach out to Queyka and found that, like most teenagers, she uses Instagram to keep in touch with her friends, for memes and to see what her favorite celebrities are up to. But she also turns to the app for news. "I get most of my daily news from the 'gram," she says. She follows @nytmag, @washingtonpost, @haitiantimes and @cnn, for example. Why does she post on The Ethicist? Because she can share her thoughts while learning about others' points of view. "To be a really informed citizen in this society, where there are a lot of different things being shot at you," she says, "it's important to know about different opinions."
Some Ethicist posts on Instagram garner dozens of responses and can lead to arguing. Queyka says she can usually tell when a commenter has carefully considered the question and tried to help. The best advice, she says, comes from listening, trying to understand how the other person feels and then sharing your opinion only when someone else asks. Here are a few of her recent comments on The New York Times's account. ◊
If two people claim a lost cat, who should get it? What if it was clear to a vet that the cat had been a victim of neglect? A reader asks the Ethicist about the rights of a feline and facilitating reunification (or deciding not to). What would you have done? My plan of action would be: First, figure out who the real owner is. Then give it back to her/him under supervised reunification perhaps. So the cat would have to have checkups frequently. The owner would then have to take care of the cat. Maybe over time, the neglect checks would become less frequent until the cat has regular checkups. Have you discovered any previously unknown relatives through DNA testing or an ancestry website? A reader discovers that he has grandchildren, and that his son kept that from him. Was it right for him to do this? Does the rest of the family have a right to know? I am going to assume that the son is an adult, as he has children of his own. With that said, he has rational reasons to keep something as important as that from his father. So I think it was right for the son to do this. And I don't believe the rest of the family has a right to know. The son has the right to keep certain things to himself. Telling his family about his children isn't a duty but a choice. I know I am going to get a lot of dislikes for this comment right here. A designer and colleagues wonder: Should they speak up about a client's drinking problem? There are protocols in place for dealing with professionals on site who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. But what about a client who is herself in a state of intoxication? How would you handle it? I mean ... if it really bothers them, I think they should talk about it. I mean ... can you really be yourself while intoxicated?

Texto completo: What's on TV
HALLOWEEN (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Forty years (and nine sequels and remakes) later, John Carpenter's classic slasher film got yet another update, one that reprised Jamie Lee Curtis's role as the baby sitter who survived a killing spree on Halloween night. Ignoring the narratives of the franchise's other films, this reboot by David Gordon Green has our masked villain, Michael Myers (played by James Jude Courtney and the originating actor, Nick Castle), escape from a prison transfer and head straight back to Haddonfield. He's out for Laurie, of course, who has become a paranoid, rabid grandmother with a fortress for a house. Fans of the original know what to expect, and overall, they should be pleased with the gruesome result. "Green wants us to believe in his Bogeyman, and Curtis is his ace card," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her New York Times review. "Leaving no room for winks or giggles, she makes Laurie's long-festering terror the glue that holds the movie together."
RANSOM 9 p.m. on CBS. This crime series about a team of crisis and hostage negotiators wraps up its third run. The group is sought out for reasoning with criminals under intense pressure without resorting to violence. But that may change in this season finale, when Eric (Luke Roberts), the leader of the unit, considers drastic measures to free Cynthia (Karen LeBlanc) and her younger brother (Emmanuel Kabongo) after they're abducted.
What's streaming
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
THE PERFECTION (2019) Stream on Netflix. If you enjoyed watching Allison Williams channel her dark side in "Get Out," this twisted psychological thriller from Richard Shepard offers an equally delicious dose of crazy. The "Girls" star plays Charlotte, a former cello prodigy who abandoned her dreams years ago to care for her ailing mother. A decade later, Charlotte reaches out to her former teacher and is invited to judge a competition where she meets Lizzie (Logan Browning), the star pupil who has taken Charlotte's place at a prestigious Boston academy. Each is fascinated by the other, both enviously and sexually. From there, the movie zigs and zags and plunges into campy horror territory.
PITCHING IN Stream on Acorn TV. In this limited-series drama, a widower (Larry Lamb) reconsiders selling his camping park on the North Wales coast when his unpredictable daughter (Caroline Sheen) moves back home and offers to help out.
4 MONTHS, 3 WEEKS AND 2 DAYS (2008) Stream on Mubi; Rent on Amazon, iTunes or Vudu. With the debate over abortion rights playing out in the United States, this moving drama shines a light on the issue through the eyes of Gabita (Laura Vasiliu), a university student in Communist Romania who asks her friend Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) to help her secure an abortion. The procedure is illegal under Nicolae Ceaușescu's rule, so the girls turn to a secret abortionist (Vlad Ivanov) who agrees to help under one revolting condition. You may find what ensues difficult to watch but impossible to look away from.

2 Men Charged With Fraud Over Pelvic Mesh Removals

Texto completo: Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have charged a physician and the owner of a medical consulting firm over a scheme to persuade women to have their pelvic mesh implants surgically removed to bolster the value of lawsuits against the devices' manufacturers.
The scheme alleged in the indictment on Friday is one of the more unsavory sides of the mass tort litigation against a half-dozen manufacturers of pelvic mesh, which has led to nearly $ 8 billion in settlements for roughly 100,000 women.
The six-count indictment outlines a plot in which bribes and kickbacks were paid to get women from across the country referred to the doctor and others for the surgery. The procedures were paid with money from high-interest cash advances arranged by a group of so-called litigation finance firms.
Pelvic mesh, which was used to treat health issues caused by a woman's bladder pressing against her vagina, has led to severe complications for some women, such as bleeding and pain during sex. Sales of the mesh have been halted over safety concerns.
In the Brooklyn case, prosecutors charged Dr. Christopher Walker and Wesley Blake Barber, the medical consultant, with wire fraud and violations of the federal Travel Act.
The indictment said the two men had been part of plan "to entice the victims" to undergo the surgery while "falsely and fraudulently" describing the health risks associated with pelvic mesh implants and playing down the possible complications from removal surgery.
Dr. Walker was arrested on Friday in Florida, and Mr. Barber was arrested in Dallas, said John Marzulli, a spokesman for Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
Fritz Scheller, a lawyer for Dr. Walker, said his client would contest the charges. A lawyer for Mr. Barber was not immediately available for comment.
Prosecutors opened the investigation last year after a report in The New York Times about a network of consultants, doctors, lawyers and financiers that recruited women with mesh implants. The women were sent to medical centers in Florida for the removal surgery without regard to whether they were having problems with the implants.
The financing firms provided cash advances with high interest rates in anticipation of a favorable personal injury settlement for the women. The indictment said some women "were responsible for the medical bills associated with the removal surgeries even if they did not receive a settlement."
The larger settlements in the mesh litigation have gone to women who had the implant removed. Mr. Barber and Dr. Walker are accused of being involved in a network that sought to take advantage of that fact by persuading woman -- some of them having only minor problems with the mesh -- to have it removed in an assembly-line surgical procedure in Florida.
"The defendants and their co-conspirators exploited and defrauded women, misrepresenting health risks," Mr. Donoghue said.
The indictment refers to complaints from three unidentified women who said they had been contacted by representatives from the finance firms and Mr. Barber's companies, Surgical Assistance and Medical Funding Consultants, to determine whether they were interested in having the mesh removed. The charging document said the women had been unaware that Dr. Walker and others paid kickbacks and bribes to Mr. Barber's firms for the surgical referrals.
The companies that financed the surgery were not identified by name in the indictment and were not charged with any wrongdoing. The charging document said one of the companies was based in Brooklyn and the other in Boca Raton, Fla.
A person familiar with the matter but who declined to be identified because the matter was not public said the Brooklyn finance firm was LawCash, which provides cash advances against potential legal settlements. LawCash was one of two firms mentioned in the Times article a year ago.
George Arzt, a LawCash spokesman, said the company had no comment.
When complaints about the mesh started arising about a decade ago, lawyers aggressively advertised for women who had received implants, and signed them up by the thousands to file claims against the manufacturers. But some women have complained that money being offered by manufacturers was too low given that the complications from the mesh can get worse over time.
The average settlement in the mesh litigation is less than $ 60,000 before legal fees are deducted.
In light of the complaints, some manufacturers voluntarily stopped selling mesh implants. The Food and Drug Administration last month ordered the two companies still selling surgical mesh to treat pelvic organ prolapse to stop distributing it in the United States.

Texto completo: Feb. 22 is National Margarita Day. This year, the spirited celebration falls on a Saturday, which means you have a whole weekend day to gather ingredients to make a legit margarita, instead of a pre-mixed, salty mess.
And, really, it won't take long at all considering you need just four ingredients: tequila, Cointreau, freshly squeezed lime juice and ice, according to the International Bartenders Association.
Since we're on the subject, can we talk about other beloved cocktails that have wandered off their paths?
Remember last year's New York Times' recent controversial take on the Aperol Spritz, calling out the "not good" Instagram-darling drink as "something that drinks like a Capri Sun after soccer practice on a hot day. Not in a good way. "? We hate to say we agree, but here we agree and we're stirring the pot some more.
From the margarita to your precious boozy brunch mimosas, all your beloved go-to drinks are trash. It's not that they're genuinely horrible cocktails. It's just that these drinks are often made with subpar ingredients and not enough care to live up to their full potential.
Professional mixologist and CEO of Alchemiq Catering, Igor Zukowiec, says the quality of ingredients – yes, even the ice – used in the cocktails is what matters the most.
"It’s definitely a lack of balance between all of the ingredients that you use," he says. "Poor quality ingredients like let’s say bottled lime juice never produce a good cocktail. "
We're here to help you live your best life. Check out the list below to see how you can enhance your favorite cocktails.
Margarita
Salt does not belong on a margarita rim.
Some of the salt ends up falling into your drink which throws off the entire flavor and then you end up drinking salty tequila. Opt for a naked rim or dust it with some sugar because if you get some sugar into your drink, it'll still taste like a margarita.
Save the salt for the Patron shots.
The margarita can be delicious with fresh ingredients and imaginative spirits, but is too often trash because of dive bar versions that use sugary sour mix instead of fresh juice.
"Margarita is usually made with cheap triple sec and it’s so much better if you skip the triple sec completely and just go for agave syrup instead," Zukowiec suggests.

French Martini
It's not French, it's not a martini and, unfortunately for this cocktail's devotees, it's not very good. The French Martini isn't an import from overseas, but rather a 1980s-era domestic invention that combines vodka, pineapple juice and the once-trendy raspberry liquor Chambord that has fallen out of favor in recent years among newer, trendier cocktail bars.

But that doesn't mean the individual aspects of a French Martini don't have its charms. Instead of pineapple canned juice, opt for fresher juice in a bottle, and pair it with rum instead of vodka for fun tropical drinks perfect for summer.
As for Chambord, don't throw out that bottle just yet. The super-sweet liqueur can be used in moderation to punch up classic cocktails like a Collins or a mojito, sweeten a fizzy punch, or even just take the place of simple syrup in a recipe.
Aperol Spritz
The cocktail behind all the controversy, the Aperol Spritz, is a heavily-branded version of a classic Italian spritz, which combines sparkling wine – often prosecco – with soda water and a bitter liqueur.
In the case of the Aperol Spritz, the cocktail's bitter component, the syrupy-orange Aperol, just isn't bitter enough. It also doesn't help that it's often paired with cheap bubbles as it most commonly is at your average drinking establishment.
Aperol Spritz lovers may have revolted against the Times, but the article featured excellent tips to improve the cocktail, like using a higher-quality prosecco that, above all, doesn't overpower the drink with its sweetness. But swapping out the Aperol for another bitter is the easiest, and most fun, way to experiment with spritzes, from substituting Aperol for its Campari sibling to using an amaro or sweet vermouth instead.
Mimosa
Nope, not even your boozy brunch fave is safe.
A mimosa is just a headache waiting to happen, doomed by the same cheap bubbles in Aperol Spritzes. While orange juice mixed with prosecco or champagne is a good refreshing combination and simple enough (just two ingredients folks), their appeal is often drowned out by the careless mixing of drunk brunch goers.
In the midst of the excitement of bottomless mimosas, just take a little more care in crafting your drink instead of continuously pouring champagne on top of your half finished mimosa.

Moscow Mule
Just because you mixed vodka and ginger ale together and put it in a copper cup does not mean you can call it a Moscow Mule.
The audacity, honestly.
The mule is made with vodka, ginger beer and lime juice. Simple enough, but oh so easy to mess up. Key ingredient: ginger BEER, not ginger ale. Most bars either don't have a supply of ginger beer or think the copper cup is shiny enough to distract from the flat taste of the ginger ale. It isn't.

If I wanted a vodka ginger ale, I would've asked for it.
This cocktail has a simple fix. Use a good quality ginger beer and you're well on your way to creating the perfect Moscow Mule.
Tequila Sunrise
An unholy sugar bomb of tequila, grenadine and orange juice, the tequila sunrise gets its name for its orange-to-red ombre coloring reminiscent of a morning sky -- and the cocktail's poeticism stops there.
And while the drink may have its simple charms, it's also an easy recipe to elevate. Instead of just tequila, invite mezcal to the party to give the cocktail a smokier flavor. Ditch the store-bought grenadine for a homemade syrup, some pomegranate juice or, to cut the sweetness of the drink, a red bitter like Campari.
The orange juice is also expendable to this cocktail – lemon juice could work as an alternative as could other kinds of fresh squeezed citrus.
Lemon Drop
In theory, it sounds great. What could go wrong with a little vodka and some lemon juice? It's just basically an adult lemonade, right?
To this day, I still don't know what a lemon drop is supposed to taste like because every one I've had has tasted like a completely different cocktail.
The Lemon Drop is supposed to be made with vodka, simple syrup, triple sec and lemon juice. Go easy on the triple sec and use fresh lemon juice instead to liven this one up a bit.

Texto completo: El gobierno de Donald Trump reactivó una práctica de 2012 en la que avisa a los empleadores de inmigrates cuando sus nombres y los números de seguro social no coinciden
Por esta razón cientos de trabajadores de todo el país se están viendo obligados a dejar su empleo después de que sus patrones recibieran las llamadas cartas “no match” y no pudieran demostrar su presencia legal en Estados Unidos.
El “bombardeo” de misivas o “cartas de no coincidencia”, que advierten sobre discrepancias entre los registros de la Administración de la Seguridad Social, el nombre de la persona y los números de seguro social que figuran en el Formulario W-2 de un empleado, ha provocado preocupación entre los empresarios.
Por temor a recibir sanciones federales, los empleadores han optado por hacer una “limpieza” de sus plantillas laborales.
“Estas acciones colocan a los empleadores en una situación alarmante, debido a que dependen de la mano de obra de miles de inmigrantes para que sus negocios continúen funcionando en una época de ‘high employment’ (alto empleo”) , dijo a Efe la activista y analista en inmigración Carmen Cornejo.
El dueño de una mueblería en Phoenix, Arizona, quien solicitó el anonimato, recibió dichas cartas recientemente, y ante el temor de ser penalizado por el Gobierno, buscó asesoría legal.
Su objetivo, dijo, era proceder con el despido de sus empleados indocumentados de forma digna y apegándose lo más posible a la legislación.
“Nadie quiere meterse en problemas con el Gobierno federal, nada más quería saber cuáles era mis responsabilidades; no los puedes correr abruptamente, primero tienes que darles la oportunidad de comprobar que están trabajando legalmente”, dijo el empresario a Efe.
En carne propia lo vivió Sofía Andrade, quien trabajaba en una compañía que elabora ensaladas. Andrade narró que su patrón dijo de repente a un grupo que tenían cuatro días para la comprobación de su legalidad en el trabajo y poder conservar el empleo.
“Nos avisaron en una reunión de que tenían un reporte de Inmigración y nos dijo el patrón que le pidieron la lista y el nombre de todos los trabajadores y su seguro social” , explica a Efe Andrade.
“Cerca de 40 personas tuvimos que dejar nuestros trabajos”, comentó la inmigrante, que llevaba seis meses en la compañía.
Ahora, agregó, tiene que trabajar en una fábrica de carpintera con un pago de 11 dólares la hora, bajo condiciones “muy duras” y que considera fuera de la ley.
“El trabajo es muy pesado, el jefe abusa porque a veces trabajamos jornadas de 13 horas al día y no nos las paga (…) completamente, pero me tengo que aguantar, porque no tengo papeles”, indicó Andrade.
Durante el corriente año, la administración Trump, a través de la SSA, ha estado enviando más de 570,000 “cartas de no coincidencia” a empresas en todo el país, de acuerdo con datos del New York Times.
Cornejo señaló que se ha notado el incremento en estas prácticas gubernamentales, ya que frecuentemente recibe llamadas de trabajadores que piden asesoría por los despidos, que consideran “injustificados”.
“No saben exactamente lo que está pasando. Para ellos su prioridad es cumplir con el trabajo, pero tristemente no están cumpliendo con las leyes al ser indocumentados, explicó la activista.
Cornejo mencionó que estas cartas están causando ansiedad a las empresas, principalmente a las de hostelería, agricultura y la construcción, sectores que se han visto más afectados por estas medidas impulsadas por el Gobierno.
“La verdad es que nadie quiere meterse en problemas con el Gobierno federal, aunque sean buenos empleados tienen que corroborar su información y al final la mayoría se va por voluntad propia”, sostuvo.
Cornejo detalló además que las razones de las discrepancias de dichas cartas pueden ser por cambios en los nombres conyugales y errores tipográficos en los formularios, pero que actualmente se están utilizando para escudriñar el estatus migratorio del trabajador.
La SSA suspendió el envío de estas cartas a las compañías en 2012, pero la Casa Blanca reanudó esta práctica en marzo pasado.
Los críticos dicen que la reactivación de las cartas es parte de la línea más dura de la actual Administración republicana y de sus políticas de inmigración.
“Esto es totalmente planificado, las acciones por parte del Gobierno, son deliberadas y van en aumento. No solo están haciendo su trabajo habitual, sino que el Gobierno está exigiendo un incremento en el número de casos”, matizó Cornejo.

Texto completo: "We went through a pretty dramatic shift with this record. The band lineup, the creative process, the sound: all of it changed in ways that really reflected our growth and evolution."
A.J. Haynes, vocals/guitar
Seratones, a Shreveport-based rock band, is announcing the release date for their new album, introducing a new band lineup, and preparing for a North American tour.
The band's first single from the album and accompanying music video premiered today.
"Power," Seratones' sophomore album, will be released on Aug. 23. It's available for pre-order at geni.us/spower.
Seratones members are A.J. Haynes (vocals/guitar), Jess Gabriel (drums), and Adam Davis, plus new band members Travis Stewart (guitar) and Tyran Coker (keyboard).
"Power," produced by Bradley Shultz of Cage The Elephant was recorded at Battle Tapes studio in Nashville. The album will be distributed under the band's record label, New West.
"Power" will be the group's first album in more than three years.
"We went through a pretty dramatic shift with this record," Haynes said. "The band lineup, the creative process, the sound: all of it changed in ways that really reflected our growth and evolution."
Upon the announcement of the album, Seratones released their first single and music video, "Gotta Get To Know Ya," directed by Danielle Calodney.
On "Power," fans will hear more of Haynes captivating, powerful, and southern soulful songbird vocals heightened by the musicians' signature style, dubbed as brash proto-punk and garage rock.
The gospel-trained vocalist is a product of the Brownsville Baptist Church in Louisiana with deep roots in soul music, which is ever-present in the singer's dynamic delivery.
"With this album, I knew that I really wanted to draw from the pantheon of soul music," Haynes said. "Soul was what I danced to in the kitchen with my mother. It's what I'd come home to at night and listen to on my record player. Things are really heightened and scary and overwhelming in this country right now, and returning to soul music was a way of reaching for comfort and security in all of that."
"Power" taps into social and political themes and presents the message that vulnerability can be powerful. Inspiration stems from Haynes' experience as an advocate for racial equality and years fighting for reproductive rights and serving as a counselor at one of Louisiana's last remaining abortion providers.
"I came to recognize that I have this lineage and these inherited experiences that are beautiful and worthy of exploration," Haynes said. "I'm terrified by what women endure. I'm in awe of what women survive. I'm humbled by what women build."
Haynes' lyrics tap into her internal struggle to adapt and overcome, and other personal reflections derived from poetry.
"Gotta Get To Know Ya," the first single, is about her "ever-lingering anxiety about global warming" and her "electric need to dance in order to escape said existential doom."
Seratones debuted in 2016 with the album "Get Gone." The band quickly gained popularity in their hometown of Shreveport and has been on a steady rise to fame around the world.
The band made its national television debut on "CBS This Morning." They were a standout act on NPR's "Tiny Desk" concert series.
Seratones have been recognized and praised by leading music industry critics and publications, including NPR Music, New York Times, Pitchfork, Wall Street Journal, and Rolling Stone.
Seratones' have shared the stage with top acts, such as Charles Bradley, St. Paul & The Broken Bones, Thao & The Get Down Stay Down, and Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats.
Seratones will take their act out on the road once again as headliners for a North American tour. Tickets are available for sale at seratones.band/tour.

Our view: Pardoning war crimes would be unpardonable

Texto completo: When he was a National Guardsman serving in Afghanistan, Derrick Miller loomed over a civilian who was being interrogated and fired a bullet into the man's head. Then Miller turned to another soldier and said, "He was a liar."
Miller was sent to prison eight years ago for that premeditated murder after a prosecutor urged a military court to make "a statement about how soldiers should behave."
President Donald Trump will also make a statement about how soldiers should behave -- one utterly misguided and corrosive to military discipline -- should he follow through on plans reported by The New York Times to pardon, on or around Memorial Day, troops accused or convicted of war crimes.
"Bad message. Bad precedent. Abdication of moral responsibility," a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, declared on Twitter.
Miller, since released on parole, hopes to be among those pardoned. Others include:
Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused by platoon members of wanton acts of violence, including stabbing to death a teenage boy, and gunning down a girl and an old man. Gallagher is said to have boasted about his kills and labeled his accusers as traitors.
Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, a Green Beret charged with executing a man suspected of being a Taliban bomb-maker who had been ordered released. Golsteyn admitted the crime only after undergoing a polygraph.
Former Blackwater contractor Nicholas Slatten, convicted of instigating the slaughter of 14 Iraqi civilians with a cadre of Blackwater gunmen at a Baghdad intersection.
Holding these men accountable for wartime barbarity has somehow been misconstrued by part of Trump's base as justice gone awry. Trump, who trafficks in a culture of pseudo toughness that endorses torture or the killing of terrorist families, has caught their drift.
Pardoning a convicted war criminal is not out of character for Trump. Earlier this month, he pardoned a former Army first lieutenant serving time for "unpremeditated murder in a combat zone." He had been convicted of ordering an Iraqi prisoner to strip naked before shooting the man to death.
War by its nature is brutally dehumanizing. The U.S. military copes by working to instill order and discipline, and it has been largely successful in a human history of armies that have ruthlessly slaughtered civilians and defeated combatants alike.
"Although military necessity justifies certain actions necessary to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible," reads the Defense Department's Law of War Manual, "military necessity cannot justify actions such as cruelty or wanton violence."
Trump will turn this military maxim on its head if he chooses to issue these pardons, with the added blasphemy of doing it on a holiday honoring all that Americans cherish about the sacrifices of those in uniform.

Texto completo: A day after the National Rifle Association filed a lawsuit saying its reputation had been smeared by its most prominent contractor, that contractor claimed in its own filing that it had been smeared by the N.R.A.
The dueling claims escalated the legal battle between the N.R.A. and Ackerman McQueen, an advertising firm that has worked with the gun group for nearly four decades. The bitter split between the organizations sparked a recent power struggle between Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.'s chief executive, and Oliver North, an Ackerman employee who was ousted as the N.R.A.'s president last month.
Ackerman is seeking $ 50 million in the counterclaim it brought on Thursday in state court in Virginia, a filing that was previously reported by The Daily Beast. The N.R.A., in two separate suits against Ackerman, had accused it of refusing to fully cooperate with an audit, defaming Mr. LaPierre and breaching confidentiality agreements.
Ackerman rebutted those allegations in its suit, saying that it had "complied with every audit" requested by the N.R.A. -- including one in February -- and that it itself was defamed by the gun group.
It also accused the group's outside lawyer, William A. Brewer III, of sharing "misleading information," though redactions left it unclear what was being described in that way. Ackerman said its business had been harmed by an article that appeared in The New York Times in March, which included the first report that Mr. North, then the N.R.A.'s president, had a financial contract with Ackerman.
Mr. Brewer called the legal filing "a misguided attempt to deflect attention from Ackerman McQueen's numerous failures to comply with its obligations," adding that its claims emerged only after the N.R.A. "sought to compel the agency to provide documents and billing records."
Ackerman declined to comment.
The closeness of the organizations over the years has made the rift all the more shocking. Ackerman has given the gun group a voice going back to the "I'm the N.R.A." campaign in the 1980s. Mr. LaPierre's wife, Susan, once worked for the firm, and its top executive in the Washington area, Tony Makris, is a former business associate of Mr. LaPierre. On top of that, Mr. Brewer is the brother-in-law of Ackerman's chief executive.
Ackerman also continues to operate NRATV, the N.R.A.'s hard-edged online streaming service.
The legal fight is connected to an investigation into the N.R.A.'s tax-exempt status by Letitia James, the attorney general of New York. Amid threats by Ms. James last summer to investigate, the N.R.A. began auditing contractors, and it has said Ackerman refused to fully cooperate, though Ackerman disputed those claims in its latest filing.
Ackerman also said the N.R.A.'s lawsuit last month "was not legally and properly authorized by the N.R.A. board" as required by New York law.
Leaks have angered both sides. Mr. North held a typically ceremonial post as N.R.A. president but had an Ackerman contract said to be worth millions of dollars. Mr. LaPierre billed $ 275,000 for purchases at a men's wear boutique in Beverly Hills, and $ 267,000 on personal expenses, including travel to the Bahamas, Florida, Nevada, Budapest and an Italian lake resort.
With the N.R.A. facing scrutiny over its finances and emboldened opposition from gun control groups, Ackerman said the organization had been "highly effective in turning the spotlight away from the N.R.A.'s troubles."

'That's Called News Gathering': Charges Alarm Advocates of Press Freedom

Texto completo: Journalists and press freedom groups reacted with alarm on Thursday after the Trump administration announced new charges against Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks leader, for publishing classified information, in a case that legal experts say takes direct aim at previously sacrosanct protections for the news media.
In indicting Mr. Assange for obtaining, accepting and disseminating classified materials, the Department of Justice opened a new front in its campaign against illegal leaks. While past cases involved government employees who provided material to journalists, the Assange indictment could amount to the pursuit of a publisher for making that material available to the public.
"It's not criminal to encourage someone to leak classified information to you as a journalist -- that's called news gathering, and there are First Amendment protections for news gathering," said Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer who frequently represents media organizations like CNN. "The ramifications of this are so potentially dangerous and serious for the ability of journalists to gather and disseminate information that the American people have a right to know."
Federal prosecutors under President Trump have drawn criticism for extending a crackdown on leakers that had ramped up during President Barack Obama's administration. The indictment of Mr. Assange -- which related to WikiLeaks' publication of secret documents leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst -- struck some experts as a grave escalation.
"It is one thing to charge a government official who has sworn an oath not to disclose classified information," said Matthew Miller, who served as the Justice Department's chief spokesman under Mr. Obama's attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr. "It's another thing to charge someone outside the government who published information or solicited information, which is something that reporters do all the time."
The charges against Mr. Assange are likely to face a challenge on First Amendment grounds. And journalists' use of illegally obtained materials has been upheld in Supreme Court cases. But Mr. Miller said prosecutors had now skated to the edge of criminalizing journalistic practices.
"The Espionage Act doesn't make any distinction between journalists and nonjournalists," Mr. Miller said, referring to the law that Mr. Assange is accused of violating. "If you can charge Julian Assange under the law with publishing classified information, there is nothing under the law that prevents the Justice Department from charging a journalist."
A deeply divisive figure, Mr. Assange is in some ways an unlikely martyr for press freedoms. A crusader for radical transparency, he is faulted by many American liberals for releasing hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee at the height of the 2016 presidential race.
"The calculation by the Department of Justice is that here's someone who people don't like," Mr. Boutrous said. "There's a real element of picking the weakest of the herd, or the most unpopular figure, to try to blunt the outcry."
Justice Department officials on Thursday cited Mr. Assange's mixed reputation as they tried to reject the notion that they were interfering with the free press.
"The department takes seriously the role of journalists in our democracy, and we thank you for it," John Demers, the head of the department's National Security Division, said at a briefing with reporters. "It is not, and has never been, the department's policy to target them for reporting."
"Julian Assange is no journalist," Mr. Demers added.
Still, press advocates were quick to condemn the Justice Department on Thursday. The American Civil Liberties Union called the indictment "a direct assault on the First Amendment." The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press described it as "a dire threat."
Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard lawyer who has been a recent ally of Mr. Trump, said the case against Mr. Assange was "really the first time since the Pentagon Papers that the government has gone after publishers."
"We all think there's a difference between The New York Times and Assange from a practical point of view, but from a constitutional point of view, it's hard to find that difference," Mr. Dershowitz said. "They're both publishing classified, stolen material."
"This is analogous to if The New York Times and The Washington Post had been prosecuted after publishing the Pentagon Papers," Mr. Dershowitz added, referring to the top-secret report on Vietnam whose publication in 1971 was upheld by the Supreme Court. "It's a very, very frightening development."
But Asha Rangappa, a lawyer and former F.B.I. counterintelligence agent, said she believed that the Justice Department had made a crucial distinction between Mr. Assange's activity and the work of traditional journalists.
"He wasn't simply a passive recipient of classified information; he actively participated in the breaking of the law," Ms. Rangappa said. She added that Mr. Assange's efforts to help his source, Ms. Manning, illegally obtain documents amounted to "aiding and abetting the criminal act itself."
"That is a meaningful distinction from a bona fide news organization that truly has a public interest goal," Ms. Rangappa said.
Seymour Hersh, the investigative journalist who exposed the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War and misconduct by the C.I.A., among other revelations, wrote in an email that the move against Mr. Assange was troubling.
"Today Assange," Mr. Hersh wrote. "Tomorrow, perhaps, The New York Times and other media that published so much of the important news and information Assange provided."

A look at Mario Batali's rise and fall

Texto completo: Celebrity chef Mario Batali, who has been accused of sexually harassing and assaulting multiple women, is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Boston on charges that he groped and kissed a woman in a Back Bay restaurant two years ago. It appears to be the first criminal charge to arise from the series of allegations.
When Eater first broke the news in 2017 that several women had accused Batali of misconduct, Batali confessed that “much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up" to how he acted. After three additional women accused Batali of assaulting or raping them, The New York Times reported that two of the cases couldn't be tried because they were outside of that state's statute of limitations, and there was not enough evidence for legal action on the third allegation.
Here is a look at Batali's rise and fall.
■ Batali, 58, grew up in Seattle and spent his childhood watching his grandmother make Italian specialties passed down in the family, according to a PBS bio. He graduated from Rutgers University and studied at Le Cordon Bleu, the famous culinary school, in London, before dropping out. Next up: a three-year apprenticeship at a restaurant in an Italian village.
■ In his heyday, Batali owned restaurants around the world through his company, the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group. They included flashy spaces like Babbo Pizzeria e Enoteca on the South Boston waterfront, Batali's first Boston-area restaurant.
His culinary focus was on Italian culture and cuisine. After the allegations broke, Grub Street reported that Batali's restaurant empire lost almost 30 percent of its business. Batali eventually released his ownership stake in the group. 
Batali was also a minority owner of Eataly, an Italian culinary marketplace with a location in Boston. The complexes combine a mix of dining, shopping, and learning elements. Batali sold his ownership after the sexual assault allegations surfaced. Eataly also removed Batali's products from stores.
■ Batali's fame came from his TV work, including a cohosting gig on ABC's “The Chew" spanning more than 1,000 episodes, per Eater. The series follows a daytime talk show format but with a food focus. Batali stepped back from the show amid the allegations in 2017 and was later fired by ABC.
Prior to joining “The Chew," Batali hosted several culinary tour shows on the Food Network, including “Molto Mario," “Mediterranean Mario," “Mario Eats Italy," and “Ciao America with Chef Mario Batali." Batali was also a part of the network's “Iron Chef" competition franchise.
■ Batali is known for his devotion to orange Croc footwear. In an interview with Details, he said he purchased 200 pairs of the signature clogs when he heard they'd be discontinued. Batali even teamed up with Crocs to create a “Bistro Mario Batali Vent Clog," but the partnership was terminated in March 2017.

McDonald's complaint: UC student groped by co-worker forced to resign

Texto completo: A University of Cincinnati student said she thought she'd found a decent job that would allow her to continue working toward a degree in business while paying the bills.
But in less than a month working at a McDonald's on Montgomery Road in Sycamore Township, Carole Stahl was followed to her car one night by a male co-worker, according to a complaint filed Tuesday with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Inside her car, the co-worker grabbed her breast and rubbed the inside of her legs as she tried to deter him, according to her complaint, one of dozens filed nationwide by workers aiming to address what they deem a systemic problem of sexual harassment within the company.
She said in the filing that the co-worker persisted during the late February incident, talking about his penis size and then licking her face and earlobe. She said in the complaint she reported what had happened to a manager, who told her to either continue working with the man on the higher-paying night shift or be demoted to a less desirable shift.
The man wasn't disciplined, according to her complaint.
"I felt very unheard," Stahl, 30, said in a phone interview Tuesday. "Once you go through something like that, especially at a workplace, you always have that in the back of your head. 'It's dark now, closing time. Am I going to be OK?' "
She was forced to resign, the complaint states, and as a result of the lost income, dropped out of college.
Her story parallels that of others' who came forward Tuesday in the coordinated filing of 25 sexual harassment charges and lawsuits against McDonald's.
A New Orleans worker reported to the EEOC she'd been groped, only to have her manager tell her she was "probably giving sex appeal" and should "take it to the next level with him."
In Kansas City, McDonald's corporate office gave one worker the "run-around" after she reported a co-worker solicited sex for cash and asked her for a "quickie," according to another complaint.
The workers are demanding McDonald's leadership meet with them to work toward ending "sexual harassment at the company's restaurants."
"Every day, workers are forced to choose between getting a paycheck or speaking up about their abuse," said Sharyn Tejani, the director of the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, in a statement.
The fund, formed last year to help extend the #MeToo movement beyond Hollywood, is defraying costs of the legal filings. The American Civil Liberties Union has provided legal assistance and the effort has been spearheaded by the Fight for 15, a labor group.
Protesters marched outside McDonald's corporate headquarters in Chicago on Tuesday, days before the company's annual shareholder meeting.
Padma Lakshmi, a television host and actress, was among them.
"I'm in awe of the brave cooks and cashiers who are standing up to McDonald's and speaking out to put an end to widespread sexual harassment at one of the world's most powerful companies," Lakshmi said.
In a letter addressed to Lakshmi, McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook outlined new measures, such as a third-party hotline to report complaints, new bias and harassment training and new posters stating new policy sent to the roughly 14,000 McDonald's locations in North America.
But Time's Up, in a letter to McDonald's leaders sent two days later, wrote that the company has failed to adequately respond to complaints.
In the past, the company has claimed it is not responsible for employees' behavior at franchise locations, according to The New York Times. That's a stance that Gillian Thomas, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Women's Rights Project, rejects.
"This is a company that has especially used the franchise model as a shield," Thomas told The Times.
Sexual harassment is common in the fast food industry, with 40 percent of women reporting being subject to unwanted sexual behavior on the job in a 2016 survey by Hart Research Associates.
Stahl hopes to soon re-enroll in school. She is optimistic her activism will help contribute to more accountability from the burger giant.

Officers decry pardon plan for troops accused of crimes

Texto completo: Current and former military officers urged the White House not to pardon service members and security contractors implicated in war crimes, warning that forgiving their offenses would send a dangerous signal to U.S. troops and potential adversaries.
Aides to President Donald Trump have been examining high-profile war crimes cases from Iraq and Afghanistan, preparing paperwork so Trump could issue pardons during Memorial Day commemorations next week, according to two senior U.S. officials.
But the possibility that Trump could issue pardons has brought a flood of opposition from current and former high-ranking officers, who say it would encourage misconduct by showing that violations of laws prohibiting attacks on civilians and prisoners of war will be treated with leniency.
"Absent evidence of innocence or injustice, the wholesale pardon of U.S. service members accused of war crimes signals our troops and allies that we don't take the law of armed conflict seriously," retired Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a tweet Tuesday.
He added: "Bad message. Bad precedent. Abdication of moral responsibility. Risk to us."
Among those under consideration for a pardon is Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL awaiting court-martial on charges that he shot unarmed civilians and stabbed a teenage Islamic State fighter in Iraq in 2017, according to one of the officials, who discussed the internal deliberations in return for anonymity.
Gallagher has pleaded not guilty and commentators on Fox News have lobbied Trump to pardon him.
Other cases being examined by the White House include those of Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, who is charged with killing an unarmed Afghan in 2010; three Marine snipers prosecuted for urinating on the corpse of a dead Afghan fighter in 2011; and a former security guard for Blackwater Worldwide who was convicted of murder in December for killing unarmed Iraqis in 2007.
Other officers warned that if U.S. personnel accused of such crimes escaped punishment, civilians on foreign battlefields would be less inclined to cooperate with U.S. forces, and U.S. service members taken prisoners would be more likely to be mistreated or even killed when taken captive.
"If President Trump issues indiscriminate pardons of individuals accused -- or convicted by their fellow service members -- of war crimes, he relinquishes the United States' moral high ground and undermines the good order and discipline critical to winning on the battlefield," said retired Gen. Charles Krulak, a former commandant of the Marine Corps.
Several officials said Trump is not believed to have consulted his senior military advisers about issuing pardons. The possibility of military pardons was first reported by The New York Times.
Senior officers have not spoken out publicly about the possibility Trump could pardon accused war criminals, but many are privately outraged, according to one currently serving at the Pentagon.
Asked about the possibility that Trump would pardon service members, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters Tuesday: "I'm not really going to speculate on any of the pardons, but I would just say we'll leave it to the White House to comment on the situation there."
Trump has repeatedly bypassed normal procedures for issuing pardons and granting clemency, seizing on cases mentioned on Fox News or that resonate with him or his supporters.
This month, he pardoned Army Lt. Michael Behenna, who was convicted of killing an Iraqi during questioning in 2008.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Current and former military officers urged the White House not to pardon service members and security contractors implicated in war crimes, warning that forgiving their offenses would send a dangerous signal to U.S. troops and potential adversaries.
Aides to President Donald Trump have been examining high-profile war crimes cases from Iraq and Afghanistan, preparing paperwork so Trump could issue pardons during Memorial Day commemorations next week, according to two senior U.S. officials.
But the possibility that Trump could issue pardons has brought a flood of opposition from current and former high-ranking officers, who say it would encourage misconduct by showing that violations of laws prohibiting attacks on civilians and prisoners of war will be treated with leniency.
"Absent evidence of innocence or injustice, the wholesale pardon of U.S. service members accused of war crimes signals our troops and allies that we don't take the law of armed conflict seriously," retired Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a tweet Tuesday.
He added: "Bad message. Bad precedent. Abdication of moral responsibility. Risk to us."
Among those under consideration for a pardon is Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL awaiting court-martial on charges that he shot unarmed civilians and stabbed a teenage Islamic State fighter in Iraq in 2017, according to one of the officials, who discussed the internal deliberations in return for anonymity.
Gallagher has pleaded not guilty and commentators on Fox News have lobbied Trump to pardon him.
Other cases being examined by the White House include those of Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, who is charged with killing an unarmed Afghan in 2010; three Marine snipers prosecuted for urinating on the corpse of a dead Afghan fighter in 2011; and a former security guard for Blackwater Worldwide who was convicted of murder in December for killing unarmed Iraqis in 2007.
Other officers warned that if U.S. personnel accused of such crimes escaped punishment, civilians on foreign battlefields would be less inclined to cooperate with U.S. forces, and U.S. service members taken prisoners would be more likely to be mistreated or even killed when taken captive.
"If President Trump issues indiscriminate pardons of individuals accused - or convicted by their fellow service members - of war crimes, he relinquishes the United States' moral high ground and undermines the good order and discipline critical to winning on the battlefield," said retired Gen. Charles Krulak, a former commandant of the Marine Corps.
Several officials said Trump is not believed to have consulted his senior military advisers about issuing pardons. The possibility of military pardons was first reported by The New York Times.
Senior officers have not spoken out publicly about the possibility Trump could pardon accused war criminals, but many are privately outraged, according to one currently serving at the Pentagon.
Asked about the possibility that Trump would pardon service members, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters Tuesday: "I'm not really going to speculate on any of the pardons, but I would just say we'll leave it to the White House to comment on the situation there."
Trump has repeatedly bypassed normal procedures for issuing pardons and granting clemency, seizing on cases mentioned on Fox News or that resonate with him or his supporters.
This month, he pardoned Army Lt. Michael Behenna, who was convicted of killing an Iraqi during questioning in 2008.

Gillibrand to focus on rural health care

Texto completo: To promote her new policy plan to support children and family, Democratic candidate Kirsten Gillibrand will stop in Iowa for a West Des Moines roundtable with Iowa women and lawmakers and visit Iowa Falls, which has struggled with child care options and had its hospital recently stopped delivering babies.
The New York senator's policy plan focuses on children and aims to tear down obstacles that American families, particularly low-income residents, face when caring for their younger children.
"My new proposal, the Family Bill of Rights, will make all families stronger — regardless of who you are or what your zip code is — with a fundamental set of rights that levels the playing field starting at birth," Gillibrand said in a statement.
The Democratic presidential candidate's plan addresses the challenges rural Iowans face when seeking health care, particularly the lack of gynecologists and medical professionals that can care for women in labor.
She proposes developing training for rural medical facilities and providing more grants for health providers in less-populated areas.
Gillibrand will visit an Iowa Falls coffee shop Saturday to discuss those ideas.
In Iowa Falls, a town of around 5,000 residents, Hansen Family Hospital stopped delivering babies in 2018 because of a shortage of funds and available medical professionals. The nearest hospital that offers delivery services, according to the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, is in Mason City — about 40 miles away,
From 1973 to 2018, half of the Iowa hospitals that had provided maternity services stopped doing so, leaving only 70 available medical facilities for expecting moms, according to The Gazette.
Family-focused policy isn't new to Gillibrand or her campaign. She has tried for years to pass a paid family leave law through Congress that would allow workers to maintain cash flow while taking time off to care for themselves or their families. She introduced it again this year, according to the New York Times.
During a January visit to Iowa, Gillibrand advocated for universal pre-K and family pay leave during the Women's March in Des Moines.
More recently, she's been outspoken about the abortion laws passed in Georgia and Alabama. She also condemned Iowa Republicans' efforts to stop funding for Planned Parenthood.
Kirsten Gillibrand's public Iowa stops: Friday, May 24 West Des Moines: 10 a.m. (doors open at 9:30 a.m.), "Family Bill of Rights" Roundtable at the Community Room, West Des Moines Public Library, 4000 Mills Civic Pkwy.
Storm Lake: 4:15 p.m. (doors open at 4:05 p.m.), coffee and conversation at the Better Day Cafe, 518 Lake Ave N.
Fort Dodge: 7:30 p.m. (doors open at 7:15 p.m.), meet-and-greet at the ShinyTop Brewery, 520 Central Ave.
Saturday, May 25 Iowa Falls: 9:00 a.m. (doors open at 8:45 a.m.), discussion of Gillibrands' Family Bill of Rights' plan at The Coffee Attic, 604 Washington Avenue.
Mason City: 12:00 p.m. (doors open at 11:45 a.m.), meet-and-greet at the Cabin Coffee Company, 1304 4th St SE.
Charles City: 2:00 p.m. (doors open at 1:45 p.m.), meet-and-greet at the Office of Jim Davis, 101 N Main St.
Cedar Falls: 4:00 p.m., walking tour of Cedar Falls with Olivia Habinck, president of College and Young Democrats of Iowa, meet at Scratch Cupcakery, 315 Main St.
Waterloo: 6:30 p.m. (doors open at 6:15 p.m.), meet-and-greet at Locals Bar and Grill, 229 E 4th St.
Sunday, May 26 Waterloo: 11:00 am, Gillibrand will attend services with Rev. Dr. Frantz Whitfield and deliver brief remarks, Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist Church, 805 Adams St.
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand speaks with journalist and political science professor Bob Beatty after visiting with supporters at Cronks restaurant in Denison last month.

How does Trumpism stack up as a crisis historically?

Texto completo: Does Trumpism represent a crisis of existential proportions for U.S. democracy?
I admit I often feel so. Perhaps focusing on history as much as I do should help me ride the waves a little better. But I also don’t share the usual American optimism that our system is so brilliantly designed and balanced that nothing too bad can happen. Anyway, a state of constant freak-out can’t be good for my health.
So I benefited from a quiet little op-ed in today’s New York Times, by Greg Weiner, a political scientist who also worked in the U.S. Senate as an aide to Nebraska Democrat Bob Kerrey. It was headlined “It’s Not Always the End of the World.”
The current incumbent in the Oval Office describes the current situation as “American carnage,” a diagnosis with which I do not agree. But Donald Trump’s presidency strikes me as a colossal threat to important fundamental qualities I deeply value. After reading Weiner’s attempt to put things into perspective, however, I must confess that the crisis pales in comparison to some we have somehow survived. You know — slavery, secession, full-scale shooting war between the states, for example. Maybe.
My favorite line from Weiner’s short, calming prose poem reminds us that there are those, including the current president of carnage but also members of the news media, who have an incentive to exaggerate what the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. called the “fierce urgency of now.”
Weiner’s line went like this:
“Cable news stations attract more viewers with the breathless chyron ‘breaking news’ than they would with one reading ‘keep this in perspective.’ ”
Sigh. Now back to Thucydides, whoever he was.

Texto completo: Kris Goodfellow, a former journalist turned Redlands technology entrepreneur, says politicians in Sacramento can be doing more to grow the middle class.
Goodfellow, a Democrat, on Wednesday, May 22, announced her candidacy for the 23rd Senate District, which covers portions of Riverside, San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties.
The seat will be open in 2020 when Sen. Mike Morrell, R-Rancho Cucamonga, terms out.
“I know that politicians in Sacramento can be doing far more to expand educational opportunities, increase access to affordable health care, and give every individual a clear pathway to reach the middle class,” Goodfellow said in a statement.
“With the growing wage inequality in our community, I’m committed to leveling the playing field for everyone in the Inland Empire.”
Goodfellow is a member of the Redlands Cultural Arts Commission and member of the Court Appointed Special Advocate (C.A.S.A.) Board.
She holds a bachelor’s degree in Journalism from Northwestern University, where she also played Lacrosse. After college, Goodfellow worked for The Chicago Tribune, The New York Times and the Associated Press, where she covered the Oklahoma City bombing and corruption, among other things. After leaving journalism, Goodfellow, worked for Esri, the Redlands-based GIS company.
Goodfellow and her husband own Voyager Search, a Redlands-based search software company.
Politically, the 23rd District has little in the way of partisan lean, with 34.89% of registered voters listed as Democrats, 34.58% as Republicans and 24% as “no party preference.”
The district includes all or parts of Banning, Beaumont, Big Bear City, Big Bear Lake, Cedar Glen, Calimesa, Cherry Valley, Crestline, Homeland, Hemet, Highland, Lake Arrowhead, Loma Linda, Menifee, Mentone, Nuevo, Phelan, Pinion Hills, Rancho Cucamonga, Redlands, San Bernardino, San Jacinto, Wrightwood and Yucaipa.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Members of Congress are questioning Nike following reports that the company penalized athletes for getting pregnant by reducing their pay and asking them to make unpaid appearances on its behalf.
Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Wash., and Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., are asking Nike executives for details on the company's treatment of sponsored athletes following a New York Times report that said the company had stopped paying some athletes during their pregnancies.
"We are deeply concerned by recent reports that Nike has reduced sponsorship payments, or ceased payment entirely, for female athletes during their pregnancy and postpartum recovery, the legislators wrote in a letter to Nike's chief executive, Mark Parker, obtained by The Washington Post. Beutler and Roybal-Allard are co-chairs of the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Maternity Care.
Specifically, the representatives asked the company how often it has reduced or stopped sponsorship payments to female athletes, and what protections and accommodations are in place for women who become pregnant.
They also asked whether male athletes have been subject to similar pay cuts after becoming fathers.
A spokeswoman for Nike declined to comment on the letter. On Friday, the company said it would begin adding pregnancy protections to new contracts with female athletes. It did not, however, say whether existing contracts would be updated accordingly.
"We want to make it clear today that we support women as they decide how to be both great mothers and great athletes, the company said in a statement. "We recognize we can do more and that there is an important opportunity for the sports industry to evolve to support female athletes.

Texto completo: Mario Batali, the celebrity chef who stepped away from his restaurant empire after several women accused him of sexual harassment and assault, is now facing criminal charges for allegedly kissing and groping a woman against her will in a Back Bay restaurant in 2017.
Batali, 58, is charged with indecent assault and battery in what appears to be the first criminal charge to arise from a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him. He is scheduled to be arraigned in Boston Municipal Court on Friday morning.
His accuser's name was redacted from court records, but the account matches that of a Massachusetts woman who filed a civil lawsuit against Batali last August.
In a statement, the woman's lawyers said she is “grateful that the Suffolk County District Attorney's office in Boston has chosen to go forward in prosecuting Mario Batali on criminal charges of sexually assaulting her."
“Mr. Batali must be held accountable criminally and civilly for his despicable acts," said the lawyers, Eric Baum and Matthew Fogelman.
The woman told police she saw Batali at Towne Stove and Spirits on Boylston Street on March 31, 2017, according to a criminal complaint filed April 4.
The restaurant is near Eataly Boston, the Prudential Center Italian marketplace that was part of Batali's restaurant portfolio.
She was eating dinner at the bar with a friend and recognized Batali sitting a few seats away, according to the criminal complaint.
The woman told police she was taking a picture of Batali over her shoulder when he noticed her and told her to “come here right now," according to court records. She went over to apologize and tell him she would erase the photo, but Batali told her it was OK and offered to take a selfie with her.
As she stood next to his bar stool, Batali put his arm around the woman and then grabbed her chest, she told police. He then allegedly started kissing her face and touching her groin without her consent, records show.
The woman said she stopped taking photos and pulled away from Batali. She said he kept “pulling on her face" and asked her if she wanted to join him in his hotel room nearby at the Mandarin Oriental, adding that Batali seemed intoxicated “by the smell and half closed eyes," according to the criminal complaint.
She declined and quickly left the restaurant with her friend.
In the civil complaint filed by the Massachusetts woman last summer, her attorneys wrote that her encounter with Batali left her badly shaken.
“Without asking her permission or giving her any warning, and without having received any indication that she had any sexual interest in him whatsoever, which she did not, Batali sexually assaulted her," her lawyers wrote in the civil complaint.
A lawyer representing Batali said his client denies the accusations.
“The charges, brought by the same individual without any new basis, are without merit," said Anthony Fuller, a partner in the Boston office of the law firm Hogan Lovells. “He intends to fight the allegations vigorously and we expect the outcome to fully vindicate Mr. Batali."
If convicted, Batali could face 2½ years in jail and would have to register as a sex offender.
Like some of the other powerful men who have been accused of sexual misconduct during the #MeToo movement, Batali had faced civil litigation but until now had avoided criminal charges.
In December 2017, three of Batali's former employees and a chef who did not work for him accused him of inappropriately touching them, according to an article on the food publication Eater.
In a statement at the time, Batali said “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt."
“Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses," he said at the time.
Three other women then accused Batali of drugging and assaulting or raping them, according to reports by TheNew York Times and “60 Minutes."
Police in New York City investigated the accusations, but ultimately decided not to file criminal charges, The New York Times reported in January.
The statute of limitations had run out on two of the cases, and they did not believe they had enough evidence to prove the third, the newspaper reported. The cases could be reopened if more evidence surfaces.
Since the allegations became public, Batali has stepped back from his restaurant and business ventures, which include the restaurant Babbo Pizzeria on Fan Pier.

Texto completo: Former White House counsel Don McGahn skipped a Trump-Russia hearing Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee. Chairman Jerrold Nadler warned that McGahn would be held in contempt for defying a congressional subpoena and failing to appear.
"Our subpoenas are not optional," Nadler said at the opening of the hearing that McGahn no-showed. "This committee will have no choice but to enforce the subpoena against him."
It was yet another attempt by President Trump to stymie Democrats' investigations. McGahn was a key witness in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia probe.
US Representative Doug Collins, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, backing the GOP president, spoke scornfully of Nadler's position, saying the chairman preferred a public "fight over fact-finding."
The committee voted to adjourn the hearing immediately after Collins's remarks.
So what was it exactly that the Democratic-controlled committee wanted to ask McGahn about?
“Mr. McGahn did not appear today because the president prevented it, just as the president has said that he would 'fight all subpoenas' issued by Congress as part of his broader efforts to cover up his misconduct. This stonewalling makes it all the more important to highlight some of the incidents that Mr. McGahn is said to have witnessed," Nadler said. “Let me recount some of them."
Nadler listed three incidents described in the bombshell report released last month by Mueller. Here's a quick refresher on what Nadler said he wanted to highlight:
McGahn said Trump called him twice at home and asked him to terminate the Mueller investigation, which was looking at Trump In June 2017, after media reports that Mueller, who had been appointed the month before in the wake of Trump's precipitous firing of FBI Director James Comey, was investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice, Trump called McGahn twice to ask him to have Mueller removed.
“In interviews with this Office, McGahn recalled that the President called him at home twice and on both occasions directed him to call [then-deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, who was overseeing Mueller's investigation] and say that Mueller had conflicts that precluded him from serving as Special Counsel," the Mueller report said.
McGahn recalled Trump urging him in one call, “You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod." He also recalled Trump being more direct in another call, saying, “Call Rod, tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can't be the Special Counsel" and “Mueller has to go" and “Call me back when you do it."
McGahn and other advisers believed the “conflicts" Trump asserted were “silly" and “not real" and had previously told Trump that, the report said.
McGahn stalled Trump in the first two calls and “recalled feeling trapped," the report said, “because he did not plan to follow the President's directive but did not know what he would say the next time the President called."
McGahn prepared to resign rather than carry out the request and told then-chief of staff Reince Priebus. Priebus recalled that McGahn said Trump had asked him to do “crazy [expletive]," but he didn't provide details. Trump ultimately did not follow up on his directive to McGahn, and McGahn later returned to work.
In analyzing the incident, the report said, “McGahn is a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House. McGahn spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, making it unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President's request."
“Substantial evidence indicates that the President's attempts to remove the Special Counsel were linked to the Special Counsel's oversight of investigations that involved the President's conduct- and, most immediately, to reports that the President was being investigated for potential obstruction of justice," the report said.
Months later, Trump asked McGahn to deny that Trump had asked him to fire Mueller In January 2018, The New York Times reported that Trump had ordered McGahn to fire Mueller.
Trump then repeatedly tried to get McGahn to deny the story, but McGahn resisted.
Trump, through a personal lawyer, two aides, and then finally personally, tried to persuade McGahn.
Trump's efforts included telling his personal secretary Rob Porter to tell McGahn to “create a record to make clear that the President never directed McGahn to fire the Special Counsel," the Mueller report said. Porter recalled that Trump called McGahn a “lying bastard" and said he wanted something “for our records."
“McGahn shrugged off the request, explaining that the media reports were true," the report said.
Ultimately, McGahn and Trump faced off in the Oval Office, the report said.
In the Oval Office meeting, “The President began . . . by telling McGahn that the New York Times story did not 'look good' and McGahn needed to correct it," the report said. “McGahn recalled the President said, 'I never said to fire Mueller. I never said 'fire.' This story doesn't look good. You need to correct this. You're the White House counsel.' "
“The President asked McGahn, 'Did I say the word 'fire'?' McGahn responded, 'What you said is, 'Call Rod [Rosenstein], tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can't be the Special Counsel.' The President responded, 'I never said that.' The President said he merely wanted McGahn to raise the conflicts issue with Rosenstein and leave it to him to decide what to do. McGahn told the President he did not understand the conversation that way and instead had heard, 'Call Rod. There are conflicts. Mueller has to go.' The President asked McGahn whether he would 'do a correction,' and McGahn said no. McGahn thought the President was testing his mettle to see how committed McGahn was to what happened," the report said.
Trump's then-chief of staff John Kelly told Mueller's team that after the Oval Office meeting, McGahn had insisted that he “did have that conversation" with Trump about firing Mueller.
Sometime later, Trump's personal lawyer called McGahn's lawyer and relayed that the president was “fine" with McGahn.
“Substantial evidence indicates that in repeatedly urging McGahn to dispute that he was ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated, the President acted for the purpose of influencing McGahn's account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the President's conduct towards the investigation," the report said in its analysis of the incident.
Trump asked McGahn to prevent Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation In March 2017, as then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions appeared poised to recuse himself from overseeing the Trump-Russia investigation, Trump called McGahn and “urged him to contact Sessions to tell him not to recuse himself from the Russia investigation," the Mueller report said
McGahn believed, among other things, that Trump felt the recusal would leave Trump “unprotected from an investigation that could hobble the presidency and derail his policy objectives."
“McGahn reached out to Sessions and reported that the President was not happy about the possibility of recusal. Sessions replied that he intended to follow the rules on recusal. McGahn reported back to the President about the call with Sessions, and the President reiterated that he did not want Sessions to recuse," the Mueller report said.
McGahn continued trying throughout that day to avert Sessions' recusal, calling Sessions two more times, as well as speaking to Sessions' lawyer, his chief of staff, and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, the report said.
Sessions recused himself anyway.
The next day, McGahn, along with other advisers, was called into the Oval Office, where he was confronted by an angry Trump.
“The President opened the conversation by saying, 'I don't have a lawyer.' The President expressed anger at McGahn about the recusal and brought up Roy Cohn, stating that he wished Cohn was his attorney," the report said.
Cohn was a New York lawyer known for his belligerent tactics who once worked for Trump but before that was best known for his association with disgraced Senator Joseph McCarthy and his feverish hunt for Communist sympathizers in the 1950s.
“McGahn interpreted the Roy Cohn comment as directed at him, suggesting that Cohn would fight for the President whereas McGahn would not. The President wanted McGahn to talk to Sessions about the recusal, but McGahn told the President that DOJ ethics officials had weighed in on Sessions's decision to recuse," the report said.
That weekend, Sessions and McGahn flew to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump.
“Sessions recalled that the President pulled him aside to speak to him alone and suggested that Sessions should 'unrecuse' from the Russia investigation," the report said.
“The President contrasted Sessions with Attorneys General Holder and Kennedy, who had developed a strategy to help their presidents where Sessions had not. Sessions said he had the impression that the President feared that the investigation could spin out of control and disrupt his ability to govern, which Sessions could have helped avert if he were still overseeing it," the report said.
Sessions never did reverse his recusal, resigning in November 2018.

But first, that's not an Oreo, Ben Carson: The poor guy mixed up a real estate term with an Oreo. You know, the sandwich cookie.
It's painful. It's risky. And there's little evidence to back it.
Episiotomies – a surgical cut in the vagina – often do more harm than good in childbirth. The injuries women suffer from complications can last years, and there is little evidence of the procedure's benefits. Yet a startling number are still happening. A leading hospital safety group says the cuts should occur in no more than 5% of vaginal deliveries. A USA TODAY analysis found rates of 20% or higher for episiotomies at dozens of hospitals in eight states – some nearly double the recommended rate. The new analysis is another example of how childbirth care at hospitals varies dramatically – and how data kept secret could inform women’s health care decisions.

Monday, Depp filed court documents calling Heard's domestic violence allegations against him "fabricated" and "categorically" false. The actor included photos of alleged injuries Heard inflicted and a claim Heard defecated in his bed in a "sick prank. " What about the joint declaration of mutual love and respect they issued after their divorce settlement in 2016? That's over, apparently.
Abortion rights backers to politicians: 'Take notice'
Thousands of #StopTheBans supporters – fueled by fury over a string of state laws aimed at restricting access to abortions – rallied Tuesday across the nation for abortion rights. "Politicians, take notice: If you come for our reproductive freedom, you'll have to get through ALL of us," the ACLU said in a statement. Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Mississippi recently approved legislation that would restrict access to abortions in their states. Kentucky and Missouri are among states considering action. Abortion foes hope the Supreme Court will reverse or weaken the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling.

Texto completo: Earlier this month, my column covered bond basics – how they work and their proper purpose in a blended growth portfolio. But many see a 100% (or very heavy) bond portfolio as a set-it-and-forget-it safe income generator.
Considering various risks shows why bonds alone rarely are best for retirement cash flow.
1. Interest rate risk.
Bond prices and interest rates move oppositely. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Rates will probably increase little in 2019, but when they do, selling before maturity (to meet an expense, perhaps) locks in losses.
2. Credit risk
Otherwise called default risk – the potential that a bond issuer reneges on the contract. When the issuer can’t make interest or principal payments, they default. Depending where you sit in a bankruptcy pecking order, you may not get your money back. When Greece defaulted in 2012, bondholders suffered huge losses. Higher credit risk bonds carry high-interest rates – alluring – but that simply balances the higher likelihood of loss.

3. Liquidity risk
With individual bonds rather than a bond fund, you can hit trouble when it’s selling time. Many bonds – particularly corporate and municipal issues – don’t trade much. That can make them tricky to price and find buyers for. Most bonds aren’t like stocks, which trade daily on public exchanges. Selling can be more slippery than a politician’s pretty promises. You can’t sell in a flash near prices found online. Selling a “thinly” traded bond with few buyers can leave you forced to sell at steep discounts – particularly if there are no buyers and you need the proceeds fast for unexpected reasons.
4. Reinvestment risk
Owning high-interest bonds from low-risk issuers – and planning to hold them until they mature – may seem fool-proof. Yet even here, risks lurk. Many corporate bonds are “callable” – meaning the issuer can redeem them at will. Companies often do this when interest rates fall. Why keep paying the higher rate when they can call the bond at below market prices and float a cheaper new one? Good for them. Bad for you.
Even if your bond isn’t called, trouble can loom when it matures and you must replace that income stream. What if you can’t find something with a high enough yield? A 30-year U. S. Treasury bond from 30 years ago paid over 8% a year. Good luck finding that with low default risk now! America’s current 30-year yield is below 3%. You can’t even get near to 8% in Greece! Its 25-year debt pays just 4. 3%. You’d need a 30-year Mexican or Brazilian bond, skyrocketing credit risk.
5. Inflation risk
Few bonds have inflation-linked interest rates. Normally, interest is the same each year. When the bond matures, you get the exact face value back. Over time, even low inflation erodes the interest income’s purchasing power. Ditto for your principal. With a 10-year bond maturing now, the $1,000 you receive buys far less today than it did when issued in 2009. To maintain purchase power, your money must grow.
Don’t get me wrong. I like bonds. Unlike many investments, they are transparent, with definable risks, and respond exactly proportionally to those risks – unlike many non-transparent and complexly defined investments, say, many annuities (per my April 14 column).
So, they are a good tool but like any tool must be used correctly with eyes wide open on their risks.
Usually, that is done best as part of a bigger blended portfolio aimed at growth where the bonds’ role is, above all, to provide relative stability by dampening volatility.

Why Can't We Fight Online Hate?

Texto completo: The White House on Wednesday announced it would not sign the Christchurch call to action, an informal international pact among France's and New Zealand's leaders and social media platforms to combat online extremism.
The call to action is a broad statement of intent, rather than a detailed policy proposal. It urges nations and private tech companies to address terrorist content online. Specifically it urges signers to "ensure its efficient and fast removal and to prevent the use of live-streaming as a tool for broadcasting terrorist attack." The White House refused to sign the accord on the ground that it violated constitutional free-speech protections.
The statement was inspired by the attack on two mosques in March in Christchurch, New Zealand, that left 51 Muslim worshipers dead. The massacre was live-streamed on Facebook and spread virally on the internet.
The Trump administration's rationale barely addresses the concerns in the call to action. Far from a sweeping legal decree, the Christchurch call is a nonbinding pledge without any plan for enforcement or regulatory measures; it is merely an acknowledgment of a growing problem, partly facilitated by a deeply unregulated internet. Without legally binding mechanisms or strict policy enforcements, the stakes of signing are low. So the act of not signing sends a strong message and cheapens the free-speech protections the administration claims to hold dear, using the First Amendment as a political tool and an excuse for inaction.
The administration's trepidation at intervening in the content moderation processes of social media platforms is also wildly inconsistent with the president's own behavior on tech-platform oversight. For months, Mr. Trump has used his Twitter feed to rail against perceived social media censorship of conservatives and threatened to intervene.
Last August, he accused Google of "suppressing" conservative voices and "hiding information and news that is good" about him after seeing an infographic on cable news from a "not scientific" study. In April, the president met with Twitter's C.E.O., Jack Dorsey, where he derailed a conversation on public health to complain about losing followers of his personal Twitter account. Mr. Trump hinted at intervening in tech-platform moderation as recently as this month after Facebook banned a number of pro-Trump media figures for "extremism." His response on Twitter: "We are monitoring and watching, closely!!"
As if to make its priorities regarding online freedom even clearer, just hours after declining to sign the Christchurch call, the White House announced an online tool for reporting tech-platform bias. "No matter your views, if you suspect political bias caused such an action to be taken against you, share your story with President Trump," it said.
The administration appears unwilling to apply similar standards to white nationalist terrorist activity online. "We maintain that the best tool to defeat terrorist speech is productive speech, and thus we emphasize the importance of promoting credible, alternative narratives as the primary means by which we can defeat terrorist messaging," the White House said in a statement regarding its decision not to sign the pledge.
It remains unclear how such "productive speech" might mitigate the logistical concerns of terroristic content spreading online. The Christchurch attack was engineered explicitly to go viral across the internet and did just that. In the 24 hours after the attack, the video was uploaded at a rate of once per second, with 1.5 million copies deleted within 24 hours. The companies themselves have struggled to keep up; according to one report, copies of the footage were still circulating across Facebook and Instagram 36 days after the attack.
It's exactly these structural problems that the call to action looks to address. Not by signing strict speech restrictions into law, but by signaling the urgency of the problem and acknowledging that online extremism will spread unless governments and tech companies refine the processes of identifying and eradicating dangerous content before it reaches those most vulnerable.
And there's reason to believe many of us are more vulnerable than we think. Though it's difficult to measure the trauma of being subjected to racist memes, slurs and violent imagery, the rise of online extremism and live-streamed violence is undoubtedly a mental health issue. In an Op-Ed for The Times, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand said that "in the first week and a half after the attack, 8,000 people who saw it called mental health support lines here in New Zealand," a staggering figure in a country of just under five million. And as reports from content moderators dealing with secondary traumatic stress and post-traumatic stress disorder show, the long-term impacts of the job take a quiet but powerful toll on the mental health of those who watch it. Which is to say that the issue is deeply nuanced; maximalist free speech for some may mean long-term psychological turmoil for others.

Of course the call to action is far from perfect. And some of its commitments, if codified into law, could very well have consequences. As Courtney Radsch, the advocacy director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, wrote on Wednesday, "the sweeping focus on online service providers risks pushing censorship into the infrastructure layer, commonly thought of as the layer that makes the internet work."
Dr. Radsch's argument reflects a tortured struggle of the digital age, which is that we seem currently unable to find a satisfactory way to combat violence, terroristic propaganda and recruitment without emboldening censors. The balance is precarious, and most paths forward for content moderation are a minefield of unintended consequences -- just ask Facebook, Twitter and Google, who have been made to grapple with once seemingly innocuous choices that have brought us to where we are today.
The dizzying complexity of the task shouldn't be a reason to shy away from a commitment to an internet that prevents the unnecessary amplification of violence and hatred. That tech companies like Facebook, Google and Microsoft, which have historically done everything in their power to avoid making overly censorious decisions, have signed on seems to suggest they agree.
Many of the provisions in the call to action like "development of industry standards or voluntary frameworks" or "cross-industry efforts" to share information to block coordinated attacks seem far more organizational than censorious. And some policies, including the commitment to "building media literacy to help counter distorted terrorist and violent extremist narratives" fits squarely within the Trump administration's stated desire to fight grotesque speech with "productive speech."
Should the United States take every word of the Christchurch call to action as binding? Probably not. Thankfully, the call to action gives participants that leeway. Though its drafting body would likely disagree, its ultimate purpose seems to be to send a message, not to codify international law. Without regulatory measures, the commitments are, at worst, ceremonial. But at best, they're a statement of intent -- one that will prompt continued attempts to find solutions, heightened awareness, and, most importantly, a transparent debate over the future of the internet. And to turn one's back on that commitment isn't just lazy, it's shameful.

Texto completo: Enough is enough
Thanks for writing the column on the horse racing industry. I have turned against horse racing since Santa Anita re-opened the track after the deaths of the 23 horses. Enough is enough.
My family had racing thoroughbreds in New England for 30 years. I used to care for our layups. I had a Derby party every year. I bet on the races. I rescued thoroughbreds headed for slaughter. I undertook an independent slaughter investigation, exposing a kill buyer in Maine.
With a background in disaster analysis, I analyzed track accidents and tried to bring some sense and safety to light, and was roundly booed for my pains.
I wrote several racing stories for the New York Times. I have good friends in racing. My family took very good care of our horses. But we were the exception.
The advent of Lasix and the plethora of other legal and illegal performance enhancing drugs used on racehorses has appalled me.
Yet the biggest indicator of "breakdown" is the inability of this industry to come together and work as a team nationally to improve and update racing to a 21st century humane standard.
American horse racing is a shameful sport now. The incessant bickering over the Kentucky Derby result shows just how dysfunctional this sport has become. The disqualification ruling has begun the cannibalization of it all.
I hope for an outlawing of the sport as per the greyhound racing. So your column is important, with Florida a mainstay of winter racing.
I hope people there take up the cause. Horse racing had opportunity since the Derby breakdown of Eight Belles in 2006 to change course. Instead, there's been nothing but entrenchment.
I am now an ardent supporter of ending the sport, having hit my own tipping point.
I hope many read your column and support the demise of a backwards and cruel industry where the winners are heralded until they retire, and the rest end up thrown away, slaughtered or abused elsewhere. It simply must end, for the sake of the horses.

The tragedy and
cruelty of horse racing
Kudos to Patrick Battuello, president of Horse Racing Wrongs, and Sun Sentinel Columnist Fred Grimm for reminding us of the tragedy and cruelty of horse racing.
Horses are treated as badly as greyhounds and that cruel sport needs to be ended also. Count me and thousands of others to work on ending this mistreatment of horses for entertainment and greed.

'Wanna trade places?'
As a registered nurse for many years, my yearly raise is 2 percent. I am required to work weekends, holidays, be on call, pay my own health insurance and have suffered four on the job injuries including a broken bone.
Contrast that with school teachers who have off every holiday and weekend to spend with family, receive free health insurance, are not on call, have a low risk of job injury, do not have to go to work during a hurricane and their days off equal 15.3 weeks a year.
Subtract the cost of my health insurance and 15.3 weeks pay from my salary and I am at the mid to lower spectrum of a teacher salary. With all the above benefits, why are they so unhappy? Wanna trade places? I would love to be off every weekend, holiday and 15.3 weeks and not have to pay for health insurance.

Texto completo: ATLANTA - A billionaire technology investor and philanthropist says he will provide grants to wipe out the student debt of the entire graduating class at Morehouse College - an estimated $40 million.
Robert F. Smith, this year's commencement speaker, made the announcement Sunday morning while addressing nearly 400 graduating seniors of the all-male historically black college in Atlanta. Smith is the Founder and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm that invests in software, data, and technology-driven companies.
"On behalf of the eight generations of my family that have been in this country, we're gonna put a little fuel in your bus," Smith told the graduates. "This is my class, 2019. And my family is making a grant to eliminate their student loans."
The announcement elicited stunned looks from faculty and students alike, before the graduates broke into the biggest cheers of the morning. Morehouse said it is the single largest gift to the college.
Smith, who received an honorary doctorate from Morehouse during the ceremony, had already announced a $1.5 million gift to the school.
The pledge to eliminate student debt for the class of 2019 is estimated to be $40 million.
In the weeks before graduating from Morehouse on Sunday, 22-year-old finance major Aaron Mitchom drew up a spreadsheet to calculate how long it would take him to pay back his $200,000 in student loans - 25 years at half his monthly salary, per his calculations.
In an instant, that number vanished. Mitchom, sitting in the crowd, wept.
Report: Trump, Kushner bank transactions raised red flag
NEW YORK - Multiple transactions involving legal entities controlled by President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner aroused the suspicion of anti-money laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank in 2016 and 2017, according to The New York Times.
The specialists recommended the matter be referred to a unit of the Treasury Department that polices financial crimes, but bank executives rejected their advice, the newspaper reported on Sunday.
As a result, the "suspicious activity reports" about the transactions were never filed with the government, the New York Times reported.
The report didn't give specifics about the nature of the transactions but said some of them involved money being transferred back and forth with foreign entities or individuals.
Report: Navy submariners kept list rating female crew, sex acts
Sailors aboard a U.S. Navy submarine circulated sexually explicit lists that ranked female crew members, an investigation found. The lists, first reported Friday by Military.com, were uncovered through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The 74-page investigative report reveals two lists - one with Yelp-like star ratings on the women and another containing "lewd and sexist comments" beside each woman's name, according to Military.com.
In February 2018, the USS Florida became the second to integrate female members. The misconduct came to light four months later, when two sailors aboard the Florida brought the lists to a superior officer, reporting that they were stored on an internal computer network and updated regularly, Military.com reported.
In oil-rich Venezuela, mile-long lines to buy gas in major city
MARACAIBO, Venezuela - U.S. sanctions on oil-rich Venezuela appear to be taking hold, resulting in mile-long lines for fuel in the South American nation's second-largest city, Maracaibo.
Some drivers said they'd had to wait almost 24 hours to fuel up, and people have been grabbing catnaps on the hoods of cars or in truck beds.
Nearing empty and stuck in line, infectious diseases doctor Yoli Urdaneta said she couldn't make her shift to treat patients.
"I've spent four days trying to get gasoline," Urdaneta said. "But I couldn't."
Russ Dallen, a Miami-based partner at the brokerage firm Caracas Capital Markets, said Sunday that stiff U.S. sanctions on top of Venezuela's decaying refineries has begun to hit home.
Man charged in abduction of girl, 8, from street
FORT WORTH, Texas - A man has been charged in the abduction of an 8-year-old girl who was snatched from a street in Fort Worth, Texas, as she walked with her mother.
Fort Worth police say the girl was found safe Sunday, about eight hours later, at a hotel in nearby Forest Hill.
Police say 51-year-old Michael Webb was arrested on an aggravated kidnapping charge. He is being held without bond.
Officer Buddy Calzada says a man grabbed the girl Saturday evening, and sped away with her in a car. Police released surveillance video of the car. Police found Webb and the girl at the hotel after witnesses reported seeing the car there.
She was taken to a hospital.
Online records don't show an attorney representing Webb who can speak on his behalf.
Plane crash in Honduras kills 4 Americans,
1 Canadian
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras - Four Americans and a Canadian pilot were killed when a small plane went down off the coast of Roatan island in Honduras, officials said Sunday.
Armed Forces spokesman Jose Domingo Meza confirmed the nationalities of those who died in Saturday's crash.
The Piper Cherokee Six plummeted into the Atlantic shortly after takeoff from the popular tourist destination of Roatan en route to the port of Trujillo. The military said in a statement that rescue boats with police divers and firefighters recovered four bodies within minutes of the crash, and transported another to a hospital, where he later died.
The U.S. State Department also confirmed the deaths of four U.S. citizens. They did not release names.
In Indiana: An explosion leveled a home in southern Indiana early Sunday, killing one person, injuring two others and leaving several nearby homes uninhabitable, authorities said.
Hours after the explosion shattered windows across a Jeffersonville neighborhood and sent debris flying onto roofs, lawns and cars, officials had not said what they believe caused the explosion.
Indiana State Police, Jeffersonville police and firefighters were at the scene, along with crews from Vectren, a natural gas provider.
Jeffersonville police Lt. Isaac Parker told The Courier-Journal that the house exploded just before 5 a.m. Sunday in the Ohio River city.

Texto completo: Only a few weeks ago, The New York Times, of all newspapers, did an up close and personal look at Wisconsin's dairy industry and concluded that the state's milk farmers are facing extinction.
We were saying that way back in the so-called good old days, when Dwight Eisenhower was president and his agriculture secretary, Ezra Taft Benson, was cutting farm subsidies all the while milk prices were plummeting. Benson, a devout Mormon, believed farm price supports were a blatant example of socialism. To us farm kids at the time, Benson became a nasty name. Many family farmers in the '50s calculated that at the end of the day, they had actually lost money. It was costing them more to feed and nurture their milk cows than they received from the cheese factories and other milk processors who bought their milk.
Those days were probably the beginning of the long decline in the number of family farms that has escalated to alarming numbers in just the past couple of years, and has led to stories like the one in The Times last month. Yes, there have been rebounds and better times in the nearly 70 years since Ezra Taft Benson was secretary, but in the long run, family farmers have been left behind.
There has never been a satisfactory answer to dealing with surplus production, as one example. Farms aren't like factories, after all. If too much of a product is being manufactured, the factory can simply be idled for a few months. If too much milk is being produced, how do you get thousands of independent farmers to act as one? It's impossible.
The current low milk prices being paid to farmers is a direct result of the glut of milk on the market.
All that, of course, has been bad enough. But now, as if farmers had not already suffered enough economic harm, they're being asked to do more like suck it up during Donald Trump's tariff war with China.
The dairy industry had been holding out hope that the surplus problem could be eased by building stronger international sales. China was seen as an important part of that. Unfortunately, the tariff war has dashed all hopes for that.
The U.S. Dairy Export Council reported last week that the volume of dairy exports to China has fallen by 43 percent since Trump's tariffs went into effect. Those close to the situation are afraid that once American farmers lose those sales, they will be much harder to win back. When you're forced to forge new relationships for a product, they usually last.
Nor are dairy groups impressed with Trump's plan to send one-time cash payments to farmers hurt by the tariffs. Shelly Mayer, executive director of Professional Dairy Producers, has proclaimed that the aid promised by Trump isn't nearly enough to make up for the revenue farmers are losing.
Last year, Wisconsin led the nation in farm bankruptcies for the third year in a row. Between Jan. 1 and May 1 this year, more than 300 family farmers have called it quits.
They're being told by Trump and Republican legislators that they should just hold tight and suffer short-term pain for long-term gain.
Sounds good, but it's not a recipe for survival. CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel ; Zweifel is editor emeritus of The Capital Times: dzweifel@madison.com, 608-2526410 and @DaveZweifel.

Compelling stories that we overlook

Texto completo: My colleague David Bornstein points out that a lot of American journalism is based on a mistaken theory of change. That theory is: The world will get better when we show where things have gone wrong. A lot of what we do in our business is expose error, cover problems and identify conflict.
The problem with this is that we leave people feeling disempowered and depressed. People who consume a lot of media of this sort sink into this toxic vortex - alienated from people they don't know, fearful about the future. They are less mobilized to take action, not more.
Bornstein, who writes for The New York Times and also co-founded the Solutions Journalism Network, says that you've got to expose problems, but you've also got to describe how the problems are being tackled. The search for solutions is more exciting than the problems themselves.
But many of our colleagues don't define local social repair and community-building as news. It seems too goody-goody, too "worthy," too sincere. It won't attract eyeballs.
That's wrong.
I've spent the past year around people who weave social fabric, and last week about 275 community weavers gathered in Washington, for a conference called #WeaveThePeople, organized by the Weave project I've been working on at the Aspen Institute.
The people at this gathering are some of the most compelling people I've ever met. Charles Perry was incarcerated for nearly two decades and now connects community members to health care systems in Chicago. Dylan Tête was an Army ranger who served in Iraq, suffered from PTSD and has built communities in New Orleans for vets. Sarah Adkins came home one Sunday to find her husband had killed their kids and himself, and she now runs a free pharmacy and leads a life of service in Appalachian Ohio.
Pancho Argüelles works in Texas, accompanying workers who have suffered spinal cord injuries on the job. He helps find the diapers, wheelchairs and other things that will allow them to live with dignity. Pancho radiates a deep wisdom, almost a holiness. As he and the others spoke about their values, the same thought kept pounding in my head: How is this not a story? Why don't we cover these people more?
At most conferences people lead with their bios, but at this gathering people led with their pain.
A prominent researcher described how she was abused as a child, and how this led her into her research into children's emotional development. A woman from South Carolina talked about loved ones she had lost and the time she tried to talk a man out of jumping off a bridge, finally confessing: If you jump, I'm going to jump, too. A man admitted that all the people he had loved had left him, and that he had lived with the trauma believing that his wife will leave him, too. In the atmosphere created this week he felt free to let go of that trauma.
It was emotionally gripping through and through. The weavers know how to open relationships with vulnerability and they know how to build connections and move to action. Their defining feature is that they are geniuses at relationship.
Martha Welch, a professor and researcher at Columbia, pointed out that our emotional health is dependent on connection with others. We don't just regulate emotions ourselves. We co-regulate with others and need connection with others to keep from spinning out of control.
Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out that associational life is the central feature of American life. But somehow we in the media under-cover this sector. We barely cover the most important social change agents. These people are not goody-goody. They are raw, honest and sometimes rude.
How did we in our business get in the spot where we spend 90% of our coverage on the 10% of our lives influenced by politics and 10% of our coverage on the 90% of our lives influenced by relationship, community and the places we live in every day?
George Will writes for the Washington Post. His syndicated column appears Sundays and Thursdays.

NRA is in disarray, and that could be good for everyone; OP-ED

Texto completo: It's a long-standing joke among journalists that the go-to political headline in a pinch is: "Democrats in Disarray." Somewhere, somehow, it's probably true.
So it's a change of pace that a slew of reports in recent weeks amply justify the headline "NRA in Disarray." Accounts about the organization's financial crisis and internal dysfunction confirm what many of us have always suspected: The National Rifle Association is a racket that stokes fear, aggravates our country's divisions and blocks reasoned debate about gun violence to feather the nests of the conservative elite. A self-dealing class exploits the anxieties of Americans far removed from power and turns the Second Amendment into a money machine. No wonder President Trump loves the NRA so much.
The most revelatory detail in the latest of these stories, a helpfully extensive investigation this week by Danny Hakim in The New York Times, concerns the fashion habits of Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's longtime CEO. Hakim reports that LaPierre billed the organization that claims to speak for the heartland $275,000 "for purchases at the Zegna luxury men's wear boutique in Beverly Hills."
Beverly Hills?
Unlike LaPierre, I'm just an unsophisticated real American because I have never even heard of the Zegna luxury men's wear boutique. Must be nice to have your lifestyle financed by the people you spend your time scaring to death. The biggest falsehood: Shameful claims that high school students and grieving parents who plead for more effective gun laws pose a dire threat to the way of life of our country's small town and rural areas.
Yes, it will be delightful in the coming months to watch this pack of hypocritical demagogues gag on their counterfeit anti-elitist rhetoric as their organization faces fiscal and reputational embarrassment.
It will also be useful to learn more about why they seemed so eager to seek the favor of Russia and Vladimir Putin, how they funneled income to favored insiders, and why so many conservative politicians and activists have prostrated themselves before this golden calf erected to hallow high-capacity weapons.
That last reference comes straight from a thoughtful midwestern soul. It was invoked in 2018 by the Rev. Peter Marty, senior pastor of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Davenport, Iowa. "More than a hunting or safety device, the gun has become an object of reverence," he wrote in The Christian Century. "We bow in devotion at its altar." False gods usually serve profane purposes.
As often happens with racketeers, the NRA gang has had a falling out. That's why we are getting so much new information as one bunch leaks against another. Quite a crew they have over there! And we will be learning more about the organization's sketchy internal workings because New York Attorney General Letitia James is investigating the NRA's tax-exempt status.
People abroad who wish our country well are mystified about why we seem so unable to legislate sanely on guns. Countries that have a lot in common with ours - most recently New Zealand and, in 1996, Australia - responded to gruesome killings by changing their weapons statutes with cross-partisan support.
We are paralyzed by two things. First, the conservative movement and the Republican Party have been the NRA's willing agents. The organization's board has been a who's who of conservative glitterati. The anti-government right knows it can't sell Americans of modest incomes on its opposition to minimum wages, corporate regulation or more progressive taxes. So they channel their arguments through the gun issue and pretend that this is really a culture war between, well, Beverly Hills elitists and the good folks of Middle America. It's a big lie.
Let's start asking the GOP's politicians how they feel about being allied with a crowd that looks more and more like a bunch of swindlers.
And then there is the U.S. Senate, one of the most unrepresentative bodies in any democratic nation. Fact: The two Dakotas (population 1.6 million) have equal representation with New York and California (population 59.1 million). The House easily passed two bills in February strengthening background checks for gun purchasers, but they face a blockade in a GOP-led Senate where rural states have outsized power.
The NRA's implosion should be an occasion for a new conversation between metropolitan and small-town America that is, in any event, much needed. The high-living gun lobbyists do not have rural America's interests at heart. Advocates of gun safety do not disrespect fellow citizens who use guns responsibly. The real insult to them comes from the leaders who buy fancy clothes on their dime.

Civil Rights Bill Advances But Is Unlikely to Get Far

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The House passed sweeping legislation on Friday that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
The bill, passed 236-173, comes as departments across the Trump administration have dismantled policies friendly to gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, like barring transgender recruits from serving in the military or formally rejecting complaints filed by transgender students who are barred from restrooms that match their gender identity.
"The question before us is not whether the L.G.B.T.Q. community faces outrageous and immoral discrimination, for the record shows that it clearly does," said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. "The question is whether we, as Congress, are willing to take action to do something about it. The answer goes straight to the heart of who we want to be as a country -- and today, that answer must be a resounding 'yes."'
The legislation, which amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibits discrimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in both the public and private sectors, offering civil rights protections in businesses, hospitals and welfare services. It explicitly states that individuals cannot be denied access to a locker room or dressing room on the same basis.
The response from the Republican-controlled Senate and White House, however, is likely to be a resounding no.
Citing concern for "the safety of women and girls in intimate spaces" and "conscience protections" in place for medical professionals who decline to perform procedures they find morally objectionable, the administration opposes the measure, according to a draft statement of administration policy obtained by The New York Times. While affirming the administration's "belief in the dignity of every person," the draft also cited concerns that the bill could "force schools to teach and affirm sex education that includes self-identified gender identity."
House Republicans mirrored those fears on Friday. Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, took to the floor to argue that the legislation would harm children and set back the civil rights gains won by women.
"I implore my colleagues to listen to the stories of every stakeholder here, including the transgender girls and boys this bill is meant to help -- because we may be hurting them by allowing doctors to prescribe hormones and perform major surgeries on adolescents without parental consent or involvement," Mr. Collins said.
Since taking office, President Trump's administration has enacted a sweeping deconstruction of policies and rules intended to protect gay and transgender individuals. In 2017, the Justice Department sided with a cake shop owner who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, filing legal briefs arguing that a landmark 1964 civil rights law did not ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, also rescinded guidance for schools that was intended to protect transgender students in bathrooms and locker rooms.
Similar efforts have been undertaken by other cabinet members. The Department of Health and Human Services spearheaded an effort to establish a legal definition of sex as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth, The Times reported last year.
The administration has also appointed several judges who have advocated dismantling protections based on sexual orientation. Jeff Mateer, whose nomination to the district court was later dropped, described transgender children as evidence of "Satan's plan." Mr. Mateer and another district court nominee, Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, wrote a brief to the Department of Health and Human Services that sought to roll back civil rights protections for transgender people, citing a scientist at Johns Hopkins University who argued that the "sense of being transgendered constitutes a mental disorder." Mr. Kacsmaryk is waiting for the full Senate to take up his nomination.
"Despite significant advances, L.G.B.T. people across the country remain vulnerable to discrimination on a daily basis and too often have little recourse," said Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, the lead sponsor of the bill. "It is past time for the Equality Act to be written into law."

Amazon to Invest in Uber Eats Rival Deliveroo

Texto completo: LONDON -- Amazon is taking a big step into the international restaurant delivery business -- and taking a shot at one of Uber's most promising markets in the process.
The e-commerce giant said on Friday that it would lead a $ 575 million investment in Deliveroo, becoming one of the London-based start-up's biggest backers.
The cash infusion will strengthen one of the largest international rivals to Uber's meal-delivery division, UberEats, which the ride-hailing company has identified as one of its most promising businesses.
Including the new investment round, which also involved existing backers like T. Rowe Price and Fidelity, Deliveroo has now raised $ 1.53 billion.
The start-up, which was founded in 2013, has become a familiar sight in London, Paris and other cities, with couriers zipping along streets ferrying customer orders. Though the company began as a restaurant delivery business -- it now serves 80,000 establishments -- it has also been setting up its own stand-alone kitchens, an increasingly popular business model.
Deliveroo has expanded beyond Britain to 13 other markets, including Australia, France, Hong Kong and Kuwait.
The Deliveroo investment offers Amazon another path into restaurant delivery, after it gave up its own such service in Britain in December. The service, which is running in several cities in the United States, was available to Amazon Prime subscribers in parts of London but did not make much of a dent in the face of competition from Deliveroo, UberEats and Just Eat.
"We're impressed with Deliveroo's approach, and their dedication to providing customers with an ever increasing selection of great restaurants along with convenient delivery options," Doug Gurr, who manages Amazon's British operations, said in a statement. "We're excited to see what they do next."
With the new capital, Deliveroo plans to hire more programmers and offer more incentives to restaurants and couriers.
"Amazon has been an inspiration to me personally and to the company," Will Shu, Deliveroo's founder and chief executive, said in a statement. "We look forward to working with such a customer-obsessed organization."
The bet will put even more pressure on Uber, whose public-market debut last week was dented in part because of concerns that its once-meteoric growth rate was slowing down. (Other food-delivery businesses took a hit as well: Shares in Just Eat were down more than 8 percent in trading in London on Friday, at 622 pence.)
Privately, Uber has identified growing competition to UberEats as one of the reasons its growth has declined, The New York Times reported this week. Cash injections in rivals like DoorDash in the United States and Rappi in Latin America have forced Uber to spend more on UberEats to shore up its market position, denting its growth.
Uber announced this year that it would cut its food-delivery fees in Britain and Ireland, in response to competition from Deliveroo and Just Eat.
Uber had held discussions to buy Deliveroo last year, according to news reports, but the two sides reportedly were far apart on price.
The challenge from Amazon holds an additional sting for Uber: The ride-hailing company repeatedly pitched itself to prospective investors in its initial public offering this month as the Amazon for transportation.

Texto completo: Decorated in eye-catching gold lettering, President Donald Trump’s 1987 memoir — a self-described “common sense guide to personal finance” — is touted as “a firsthand account of the rise of America’s foremost deal-maker.”
But following news last week that Trump reported more than $1 billion in financial losses to the IRS during a perceived high point in his business career, the ghostwriter of The Art of the Deal, once called an “unguarded look at the mind of a brilliant entrepreneur,” has another description for the book: Fiction.
“I’d be fine if Random House simply took the book out of print,” Tony Schwartz, a vocal critic of the president, tweeted last Wednesday. “Or recategorized it as fiction.”
Schwartz’s tweet comes after The New York Times found that Trump reported staggering losses between 1985 and 1994 — a period of time in which the president, largely due to the success of his book, had achieved widespread fame for appearing to be a self-made billionaire gifted with seemingly unrivaled business acumen. The Times report, however, painted a starkly different picture.
“In fact, year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer,” the Times wrote, pointing out that by the time the best-selling memoir was released, Trump was already in “deep financial distress.”
The book’s portrayal of Trump’s business prowess once again came under fierce scrutiny from Schwartz, who has openly expressed remorse for ghostwriting it.
This isn’t the first time Schwartz has publicly disparaged The Art of the Deal.
“I put lipstick on a pig,” he told The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer in 2016. “I feel a deep sense of remorse that I contributed to presenting Trump in a way that brought him wider attention and made him more appealing than he is.”

Texto completo: Novelist Daniel Silva paid tribute Thursday to I.M. Pei, following the death of the internationally recognized architect.
“In honor of the great architect I.M. Pei who left us today at the age of 102,” Silva said in an Instagram post with the cover of his 2011 book Portrait of a Spy. The cover prominently features the Pei-designed glass pyramid at the Louvre museum in Paris, where the novel is partially set.
Instagram
“An amazing artist I.M.Pei has died. Gabriel and I both admired his remarkable art and architecture. See the cover of Portrait of a Spy,” Silva said on Twitter, mentioning the main character of many of his novels, Gabriel Allon.
Silva is a New York Times bestselling author of more than 20 spy novels and a former executive producer at CNN.
I.M. Pei, who died Thursday at age 102, was one of the most renowned architects of the 20th century.
Pei designed the controversial Louvre pyramid, along with L’Enfant Plaza and the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., among many other modernist buildings.
“Architecture is like a tree,” Pei said in an interview with the the Washington Post in 1978. “It grows and matures and branches out. I am part of that tree, of that movement, not starting, or ending, or following anything.”

Texto completo: It's time to catch up on some of your recent questions to Inside the Newsroom.
Are you kin or do you have an interest in ventures of Gloria Estefan?
The reader - one of my regulars - didn't explain his question, but I assume it is in response to a large photo of the singer and businesswoman on A1 of the printed newspaper last Friday. The photo highlighted the opening of Estefan Kitchen at the Margaritaville Resort Orlando in Kissimmee.
The answers are no and no.
But to answer what I assume the reader really is asking, yes, I think the photo was displayed too prominently in the Orlando Sentinel.
The photo was a late change to replace one of an Apollo 11 anniversary event featuring Buzz Aldrin. That event ran late and we scrambled to find something to fill the space, so moved the Estefan photo from the Local & State front to A1. It was not the best choice, but at that time, the only one that we could do to make deadline.
Restaurant and retail openings are among our most popular articles, so it's a fine topic to cover.
Still, point taken. In this case, it was not worthy of the front page with such a large two-photo package.
When will you get a new food and restaurant writer?
Several readers lately asked me if we intended to replace Lauren Delgado, our food writer who left to work for a local nonprofit in March. I'm happy to report we have found her successor - Amy Drew Thompson. She starts as our new food critic on Monday.
Thompson will be writing her own introductory column, but here is a little about her, from a note that Cassie Armstrong, the Things to Do director of content, sent to the newsroom this week:
"Amy has dabbled in radio and worked in TV news, but her first and greatest love is delivering the practiced prose that people connect with.
"She has been an active freelancer for the USA Today Travel Media Group, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Visit Orlando, Edible Orlando and our own GrowthSpotter. Her story topics have included the Best Places to Find Grilled Cheese in All 50 States, Everything You Need to Know About Epcot Food & Wine Festival, and Brunch! Top Orlando Options for the Undisputed Queen of Meals.
"Originally from New York, Amy has spent nearly three decades as a professional writer and roughly half her life as a Floridian. She has two daughters that keep her on her toes.
"Amy has already been marinating story ideas and is ready to hit the road running on Monday."
Even as we welcome Amy, we say goodbye to another fixture on our coverage of the local restaurant community. Kyle Arnold, our business reporter who also covers retail, will leave June 14 to take a position covering aviation and airlines for the Dallas Morning News.
"Kyle joined the Sentinel about five years ago, and in that time has become the newspaper's expert on restaurant and retail news," Mark Skoneki, the director of content for the economy and politics, said. "He's covered everything from Black Friday to Darden Restaurants and Orlando's ever-growing restaurant scene. Of late, he's been writing about real estate news, bringing back needed general coverage of this important industry."
Before you ask, yes, we do plan to replace Arnold.
(Side note to my former Tampa Bay Times podmate, DMN editor Mike Wilson - Aggghhh! You owe me one!)
Why can't I comment on articles on OrlandoSentinel.com? Will you bring them back?
A few readers asked this again after we switched to our new website format last week. Readers were able to comment at the bottom of articles until last August, when we removed that function.
I plan to write a longer column about this but want to know what you think.
Would you like to comment on OrlandoSentinel.com? Did you find that the comments threads under articles were helpful or hate-filled? Has social media changed how you interact with us, posting to Twitter rather than on site?
Email me at jcutter@orlando sentinel.com.
Where is Ticked Off!
That's a question I suspect we will get on Monday. Our Ticked Off! column is moving from under the puzzles in the Local & State section to the opposite page under the TV grid. The change is needed for a new design for the other items under the puzzle page - don't worry, nothing is being killed. You will find Ticked Off! under TV listings in Local & State on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.
Ticked off about that or anything else? Email tickedoff@ orlandosentinel.com.

Pelosi: Trump not authorized to use military force in Iran

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned the Trump administration Thursday that it lacks congressional authority to use military force against Iran amid reports his aides are calling for military mobilization to respond to new threats in the region.
“They have no authority to go forward in any way,” Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters.
Pelosi and Senate Democratic leaders are seeking a congressional briefing from the Trump administration about Iran. A small group of bipartisan leaders will receive a classified briefing Thursday, and it’s likely the Trump administration will provide an all-Congress briefing in the coming days.
Lawmakers have grown increasingly wary of new military action abroad.
Congress last authorized the use of military force nearly two decades ago. They’ve been reluctant to revisit the issue but at the same time many don’t want the United States engaged in new military action abroad.
Pelosi said the 2001 vote authorizing the war in Afghanistan does not greenlight action in the Middle East.
“The responsibility in the constitution is for Congress to declare war,” Pelosi said. “So, I hope the president’s advisers recognize they have no authority to go forward in any way."
The Trump administration said Iran has acted in a threatening manner to U.S. interests in the region.
The U.S. moved an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf, and ordered the evacuation of the U.S. embassy in Iraq following perceived threats from neighboring Iran and photos showing Iranians loading missiles on to boats in the gulf.
The New York Times reported the military is planning to mobilize 120,000 troops to deploy to the Middle East if Iran attacks U.S. interests in the Middle East. Trump called the report “fake news” but said the U.S. would respond if attacked by Iran.
Pelosi praised reports suggesting Trump wants to avoid engaging in a conflict in the Middle East, and she noted the two of them had shared opposition to the Iraq War.
“I like what I hear from the president, that he has no appetite for this,” Pelosi said, calling on him to maintain that attitude, “even though some of his supporters are rattling sabers.”
Shortly after Pelosi's press conference, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., praised Trump's approach.
"Any action this administration takes will be thoughtful, we'll look through, and will be in consultation with the House and the Senate," McCarthy said. "What has transpired today is the administration is trying to make sure there is not [a military response]. It's sending a very clear message to Iran. B-52s are being sent there, aircraft carriers. ... The administration is taking actions to make sure that question is not raised," he added.
[Opinion: Here's how you'll know we're about to go to war with Iran — right now, we're not]

Texto completo: With the addition of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to the 2020 race, there are a total of 24 major candidates (depending on who you count as “major") in the hunt for the Democratic nomination to face President Trump.
Amid such a crowded field, it might seem like anyone can run for the White House. Indeed, according to the Federal Election Commission, hundreds of candidates have filed paperwork to seek the Democratic nomination.
Interested in joining the pack? First thing's first: Are you a natural-born US citizen? It's a constitutional requirement to run for president, meaning that you must have been born in the United States or born abroad to a US citizen parent. Next: Are you 35? That's the minimum age set by the Constitution.
Of course, there's a lot more to it than that. Here are the steps to become a candidate for commander in chief:
Fill out paperwork To legally raise and spend money as a presidential candidate, you'll need to file paperwork with the federal government. You can set up an exploratory committee with the Federal Election Commission, allowing you to raise money for the purposes of “testing the waters" for your campaign. Or, you can skip straight ahead to filing a statement of candidacy with the FEC. This designates a campaign committee to raise and spend money on your behalf.
Speaking of which . . .
Raise money for your campaign A modern presidential campaign costs hundreds of millions of dollars. That's a lot of cash, and candidates must be mindful of where it comes from.
There are restrictions on who can contribute and limits to how much they can give. For example, a campaign can only receive $2,800 from an individual per election. And super PACs — which can raise and spend huge sums of money with few restrictions but are legally not allowed to coordinate with campaigns — are a political landmine in the 2020 Democratic primary, with many candidates swearing them off.
Alternatively, you could try the grass roots, raising money from many small donors, as Senator Bernie Sanders has done effectively. That has its own pitfalls, though, especially if you don't have the campaign infrastructure to reach a massive pool of donors.
Don't forget about federal reporting requirements: You're required to tell the FEC (and by extension, the public) how much your campaign has raised and spent every quarter.
In addition, campaigns are required to itemize and identify donors that gave more than $200.
Hire a staff You'll need lots of people to help spread the word about your campaign, especially in the early primary states. Bad news: You're behind on this, as many candidates have already set up large organizations in key states. At the end of March, Senator Elizabeth Warren had 164 people on staff, making her campaign operation the largest by far, BuzzFeed reported. Senator Bernie Sanders followed with 86 people.
Visit early primary states You're late to this, too. The 2020 hopefuls have already held hundreds of events in New Hampshire, according to NECN, which tracks candidate visits to the state. Representative John Delaney is alone responsible for 91 of them, according to the cable network. A recent Suffolk/Globe poll found that already about one in five New Hampshire Democrats have attended an event for a 2020 candidate.
Meet voters, take selfies Selfies are the new handshakes. Today's candidates pose with thousands of people as they make their way around the campaign trail. Warren recently boasted that she had taken 20,000 selfies with voters since the start of her campaign.
Gather endorsements Get other people to say publicly how great you are. Vice President Joe Biden was ready with a few endorsements from influential people and groups on the day he announced his candidacy.
Get on that debate stage The Democratic National Committee has outlined a series of benchmarks candidates must hit to appear at major debates. The rules were meant to give an equal shot to the unwieldy field of candidates. To get on stage, you'll need at least 1 percent support in three DNC-approved polls, or 65,000 unique donors, with 200 unique donors per state in at least 20 states. The DNC has also set up tiebreakers in the event that more than 20 candidates meet these thresholds.
Get on the ballot All that work to get your campaign up and running won't mean much if you're not on the ballot. Requirements to access the ballot vary by state and can include tasks like filing paperwork, collecting signatures, and paying fees — all on a series of deadlines. Getting on many ballots in a short span of time can be a logistical challenge.
For example, in Massachusetts, candidates can get on the primary ballot in a few ways: Gather 2,500 voter signatures, certified by elections officials; be placed on the ballot by the secretary of the Commonwealth; or be designated by the state party committee. And in 2016, Massachusetts was just one of 11 states that held a primary on March 1. That's a lot of moving pieces.
See how it's going Of course, the field of candidates typically whittles itself down well before the first votes are cast (The New Hampshire primary, for example, will probably be scheduled for February 2020). Candidates who are not raising much money, gaining much traction in polls, or gathering many endorsements eventually suspend their campaigns and throw their support behind a preferred rival.

Texto completo: The debate over immigration gets repetitive. We argue about the merits of a wall, the morality of separating parents from their children at the border, and the minutiae of asylum. Lost in the politics are facts and figures - numbers and people.
After two years of hearing President Donald Trump cite links between crime and immigration we now know it is a false equation.
Results are in from a collaboration between The New York Times' The Upshot and The Marshall Project, a nonprofit online journalism organization. While the U.S. immigrant population has risen by 118 percent since 1980, violent crime has gone down by 36 percent over the same period.
Looking at urban centers and crime, the study found no correlation between violence and the presence of immigrants. Coming on the heels of earlier studies that found no link between legal immigration and crime, this new analysis expands the research to include immigrants here illegally. In short, we can't blame immigrants for our troubles.
But here is another surprise: We can't survive without immigrants. Getting less attention are studies on the extraordinary value of immigrants. If you have a parent, a grandparent or know anyone 65 and older, chances are they will need care at some point. What you might not know is that, according to the Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute, a nonprofit organization, 1 million immigrants take care of our elderly in America. That's right. One-fourth of the nation's 4 million direct care workers are immigrants.
And don't think that Trump and his administration are unaware that America relies on nurses and home care aides from the very places he seeks to crack down on - El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras, as well as Muslim countries hurt by his immigration ban. A caregiver gap is something that might just wake up ordinary Americans to the fact that our elderly are in the hands of hardworking and dedicated Americans born in foreign lands, as well as people from foreign lands who are not yet Americans.
Taken together, The Upshot and Marshall Project study challenges this administration's false assertions about immigration. It is time to move beyond rhetoric to reality.

Con; Battle of the review stars

Texto completo: As America's dining culture has emerged and continuously evolved over the last half-century, so too has its notions around food criticism. One endless debate trails restaurant reviews: Do star ratings have any real worth? Our restaurant critics, Patricia Escarcega and Bill Addison, weigh the pros and cons of assigning stars during this golden age of Los Angeles dining.
--
At the beginning of our tenure, Bill and I took up the question of whether to reintroduce star ratings to the dining section. Bill leaned toward reinstituting them; I wanted to leave them in the dustbin. Our predecessor, Jonathan Gold, did away with starred reviews in 2012. I've many reasons to be grateful to Gold, a man I never met in life, but whose legacy I reckon with every time I sit down to write a review. Gold was not just a great critic, but also one of our best contemporary American prose stylists, and he used his gifts in service of charting the beauty and richness of Los Angeles. He shaped and enriched my understanding of Los Angeles food and culture more than any other writer I can name.

I'm particularly grateful to Gold for helping dismantle the star system from the L.A. Times' Food section. The thing I feel most deeply in my bones is that stars reinforce a framework of thinking about food and dining that is systematically faulty and wrongfully weighted toward fine dining. You are no doubt familiar with the complaints lobbed at the most famous star rating system in the gastronomical universe, the 100-plus-year-old Michelin Guide: It's too Eurocentric. It overemphasizes formality and presentation, attributes that favor fine dining. Its fleet of super-secret restaurant inspectors, dispatched only to a handful of countries and cities around the globe, offer a painfully small window into the wide world of eating. Michelin has helped cement stars in the public consciousness as totems of haute cuisine and luxury.
Stars are especially incompatible with a city such as Los Angeles, which derives much of its identity and strength from the astonishing diversity of the people who live and eat here. For a star system to work meaningfully, we must define what we mean by a four-star restaurant.
So what does a four-star restaurant look like in L.A. right now? Is it the genre-defying food truck? The modest-looking strip mall gem? The swanky Beverly Hills spot that ties off your leftovers with a silken bow? Stars can't contain this breadth.
I will concede that stars can steer a meaningful conversation about the current food and dining landscape. (Remember Pete Wells' famous revision of Per Se's star rating in the New York Times? Remember the lively conversation that ensued? Of course you remember.)
The most compelling argument I've heard in favor of stars is that they are "servicey." They offer a quick snapshot of a restaurant's standing for time-strapped readers. The flipside, of course, is that they compromise the nuances of a review, reducing whatever complexity it contains to a few pointy symbols on the page. I don't think it's a coincidence that the only restaurant critic to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize is one who penned unstarred reviews. Gold's reviews allowed -- maybe even forced -- readers to engage with his sentences and, by extension, his insights, and the context he considered restaurants in.
In the end, I'm not convinced that even the highest star rating is useful to readers or restaurants. A low or high star rating can pigeonhole a kitchen in unhealthy ways. A colleague told me a story recently about a "five-star" restaurant that lost its high rating, but continued to advertise itself as a "five-star" restaurant far beyond the rating's shelf life. A star rating can be turned into a disreputable marketing tool. Conversely, a low rating can stymie a young restaurant on the verge of finding its sea legs.
Restaurants are closer to living organisms than static things. Trying to measure a restaurant in stars is like trying to quantify the value of a summer breeze, or a kiss, or any other (hopefully) pleasant, ephemeral experience you can think of. In the end, it is beyond measurement.

International worries flare that US sliding toward Iran war

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – International worries flared into the open Tuesday that the Trump administration is sliding toward war with Tehran amid skepticism about its claims that Iran poses a growing threat to the U.S. and its allies in the Persian Gulf and beyond .
The U.S. military rebutted the doubts about such a threat, and President Donald Trump denied a report the administration has updated plans to send more than 100,000 troops to counter Iran if necessary. Trump then stirred the controversy further by saying, “Would I do that? Absolutely.”
The day of turmoil was set in motion when a British general contradicted the administration’s claim of a rising Iranian threat in the region.
“No, there’s been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria,” said Maj. Gen. Chris Ghika, a senior officer in the U.S.-backed coalition fighting the Islamic State group. Ghika, speaking in a video conference from coalition headquarters in Baghdad, told reporters at the Pentagon that the coalition monitors the presence of Iranian-backed forces “along with a whole range of others because that’s the environment we’re in.”
But he added, “There are a substantial number of militia groups in Iraq and Syria, and we don’t see any increased threat from any of them at this stage.”
Late in the day, In a rare public rebuttal of an allied military officer, U.S. Central Command said Ghika’s remarks “run counter to the identified credible threats” from Iranian-backed forces in the Mideast. In a written statement, Central Command said the coalition in Baghdad has increased the alert level for all service members in Iraq and Syria.
“As a result, (the coalition) is now at a high level of alert as we continue to closely monitor credible and possibly imminent threats to U.S. forces in Iraq,” the statement said.
At the White House, President Trump, who has repeatedly argued for avoiding long-term conflicts in the Mideast, discounted a New York Times report that the U.S. has updated plans that could send up to 120,000 troops to counter Iran if it attacked American forces.
“Would I do that? Absolutely,” he told reporters. “But we have not planned for that. Hopefully we’re not going to have to plan for that. If we did that, we’d send a hell of a lot more troops than that.”
Reinforcing Trump’s denial, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a joint news conference in Sochi with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, “We fundamentally do not seek war with Iran.”
Lavrov said Pompeo told him that a potential deployment of 120,000 U.S. troops to the Mideast was only a “rumor.” Lavrov said the international community needs to focus on diplomacy with Iran, including on the potentially explosive issue of Iran’s nuclear program, which is constrained by a U.S.-brokered deal in 2015 that Trump has abandoned.
U.S. Iran envoy Brian Hook told reporters traveling with Pompeo in Brussels that the secretary of state shared intelligence on Iran with allies since “Europe shares our concerns about stability in the Gulf and the Middle East.” What the Europeans do not share, however, is Washington’s more aggressive approach to Iran.
“We are very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident, with an escalation that is unintended really on either side but ends with some kind of conflict,” British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told reporters in Brussels.
“What we need is a period of calm to make sure that everyone understands what the other side is thinking,” Hunt said.
Last week, U.S. officials said they had detected signs of Iranian preparations for potential attacks on U.S. forces and interests in the Mideast, but Washington has not spelled out that threat.
The U.S. has about 5,000 troops in Iraq and about 2,000 in Syria as part of the coalition campaign to defeat the Islamic State group there. It also has long had a variety of air and naval forces stationed in Bahrain, Qatar and elsewhere in the Gulf, in part to support military operations against IS and partly as a counter to Iranian influence.
Tensions rose another notch with reports Sunday that four commercial vessels anchored off the United Arab Emirates had been damaged by sabotage.

You can fight Rashida Tlaib’s bad Holocaust history without politicizing the Holocaust

Texto completo: My dear friend Jessi and I periodically visit the Holocaust Memorial Center in Farmington Hills, Mich., to refresh our understanding of the Holocaust, and to inform ourselves about the power of prejudice.
On our most recent visit, our guide began his tour by removing a giant tome from a pedestal in the center’s lobby. Walking it slowly through our group, he explained why the book was so large: It contained all 6 million Jewish victims of the Holocaust, each recalled simply, line after line, page after page, as “Jew.”
The book, which we had never seen on previous visits to the center, was a poignant, breathtaking reminder that there will always be more to learn about the Holocaust.
Since taking office in 2019, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., whose 13th congressional district lies moments away from the center’s campus, has made several disconcerting anti-Semitic and anti-Israel statements while reinforcing her commitment to anti-Israel causes. Her latest self-serving attempt to reframe the historical role Palestinians played in the post-Holocaust creation of Israel has posed a direct challenge to the Holocaust Memorial Center’s mission “to engage, to educate, and to empower by remembering the Holocaust.”
The Palestinian American Tlaib said on a podcast that the Holocaust gave her a “calming feeling” that her Palestinian ancestors had “provided that right” for Jews to have a “safe haven” in Israel after the Holocaust, though it had caused them to lose “their lives, their livelihood, their human dignity, [and] their existence in many ways.”
Though commentators like the Washington Examiner’s Philip Klein had already debunked Tlaib’s flawed history, I reached out to the center with questions within their mandate about how to counter the congresswoman’s misinformation and her anti-Semitic statements.
Rather than answer, the center requested I contact Michigan leaders at the Anti-Defamation League or Jewish Community Relations Council.
The ADL provided a copy of its official statement about Tlaib’s remarks. While correcting Tlaib’s misstatements, they also condemned Republican attempts to correct the congresswoman as “weaponiz[ing]” the Holocaust.
TweetTweet
Increasingly throughout the past three years, as Americans have viewed current events through a lens heavily colored by their political identities, the Holocaust has become a part of our political dialogue. Unfortunately, the era is rarely addressed with the context required to acknowledge and honor its weight and trauma, but rather with a lightness which is incongruous with the tragedy of its 11 million victims.
Tlaib’s approach of spreading misinformation about the era to pursue a personal political agenda, and her subsequent attacks on those who seek to correct her, marks a new and disgusting low in political discourse surrounding the Holocaust and anti-Semitism.

In the last seven months, white nationalists carried out deadly anti-Semitic shootings on two American synagogues and temples. Two days before, and two days after the latest attack in Poway, Calif., the New York Times’ international edition published anti-Israel cartoons with anti-Semitic tropes. Between 2017 and 2018, the Anti-Defamation League recorded a 105% increase in “physical assaults against Jewish individuals.”
At this juncture of American history, with a communal tendency to talk around, rather than about, the Holocaust, and as politicians who speak out are slammed for "weaponizing" the period, we desperately need groups like the Holocaust Memorial Center to provide measured input.
On our most recent tour, Jessi and I found that the center’s docents were not afraid to weigh in on current political issues.
When we toured in January 2019, our guide gave a first-rate exploration of the center and the history of the Holocaust. However, he passed the history through his personal political lens, peppering the tour with one-sided commentary about the migrant caravans approaching our southern border.
The inappropriate diatribe did not detract from our experience. Jessi and I visit the Holocaust Memorial Center not because we are conservative, but because we are human beings who seek to understand how pseudoscience and hatred launched a terrible genocide.
Our visits are not taken lightly. I return out of a commitment made when I was a child first trying to comprehend that horrible history. Jessi’s visits come at great emotional cost. Her great-aunt’s family perished during the Holocaust, and the period has had a permanent effect on the people she loves dearly.
One of the last exhibits at the Holocaust Memorial Center is a diorama of Auschwitz, surrounded by larger-than-life photographs of a transport of victims newly arrived at the death camp. As our tour guide explained that the photograph showed the final hours spent by harmless people before they were led to their undeserved deaths in the gas chambers, Jessi began to cry. I grabbed her hand, and we stood together in the discomfort of recalling the tremendous horrors of that past.
The Holocaust Memorial Center stands not to be political, but to educate the public about a terrible period of history. However, when American politicians or commentators muddle the truth, and heated political debates ensue, educational organizations should stand apart from the fray to present the facts, absent of blame or shame. If such organizations stand on the sidelines as hatred rises and that vital history is misrepresented, Americans will continue to find themselves engaging one another with the very prejudice, hatred, and false facts which once paved the way for the murder of 11 million people.

The nature of nurturing

Texto completo: Mothers' Day can be bittersweet. ∙ For those who have lost their mothers, this day can be weighted with emotional memories, both good and bad. ∙ Those who still have their moms and who are blessed with being a mom, know there's nothing like a mother's love. ∙ As we celebrate this upcoming Mother's Day, I want to discuss the positive impact a mother's nurturing has on the outcome of a child. ∙ It's a given, mothers want what's best for their children; though occasionally, what is perceived as "best" in the mother's eyes can also have a reverse impact on the child's emotional and behavioral disposition.
As an example, mothers (and parents in general) focus on the importance of their child's academic performance; though education is important and does set the stage for future opportunities, there are other attributes to consider.
A child who is taught to manage their emotions is two times more likely to become successful in life.
In addition, children with good self-control and reduced compulsivity are less likely to have behavioral problems, drink, take drugs or end up in jail.
Furthermore, a mother's tone while speaking to her child also affects the brain's structural development.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Joan Luby from the Washington School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, compared the interaction and development of two separate groups of 3- and 4-year-old children.
The first group hosted extremely nurturing and interactive mothers, while the second group had mothers with less or non-nurturing attributes.
After four years of research, the children who had considerable amounts of nurturing and guidance developed a 10 percent larger hippocampus on MRI brain scan studies.
The hippocampus, located in the center of the brain, directs bodily functions, controls learning and memory, while also supporting the body's response to emotional stress.
A subsequent study conducted by Dr. Akemi Tomado, a child mental health researcher in Japan, found less developed gray matter in the brains of children who had been verbally abused.
Gray matter, a major component in the brain, controls emotions, attention span and decision-making.
Children whose parents frequently yell and repeatedly state the children were "bad" exhibited lower self-esteem.
Typically, parents who use strong but directly negative language toward children believe they are making their child more responsible and compliant; research shows that parental sarcasm and threats inadvertently make children feel guilty, unloved and inferior.
This poor self-perception can lead to depression and/or anxiety in children.
So, what's the best approach in nurturing your child? Disciplining your child, teaching your child? What's the best way to communicate while trying to teach them right from wrong?
Stay calm, model good behavior. Recognize your emotions. Never try to discipline a child when you are angry.
Seek professional help when needed to better handle parent/child issues.
Don't suppress child's feelings. Allow the child to express his or her emotions such as crying, but teach the child to define behavior with a word.
For example, you state: "You are frustrated your brother took your toy but hitting your brother is never OK."
Feelings are what they are. Children should own their feelings, but outbursts caused by feelings are not good and will get them into trouble.
Have empathy for your child. Let your child know you are listening. As an example, say, "I understand you are angry, you want to yell and scream, please know I'm here if you need me."
You are not agreeing with the behavior but stating you do understand it.
It's important to note, screaming at a yelling child only makes the yelling louder as he or she wants to be heard.
Remember, if you both are yelling, no one is listening.
Problem solve. Once their anger dissipates, children need guidance to help problem solve.
A mother could say, "Next time, when you become angry, how could you behave differently?"
When the child responds with a different solution, answer: "If you do that instead, what do you think would happen next time?"
This will build the child's self-esteem and improve inappropriate responses over time. Always watch for good behavior and praise that behavior.
Listen. Make sure when communicating with children they have your undivided attention. No phones allowed
If you don't give them undivided attention, your child will seek help elsewhere or worse, stop talking to you altogether, while internalizing stress.
Avoid pacifying bad behavior. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents against using technology to pacify an unruly child as this method does not allow the child to learn to regulate his or her emotions.
Seek help from a pediatric healthcare professional when needed.
Some children need an evaluation to rule out autism, developmental delay, anxiety, ADD or ADHD. Sometimes a formal behavior modification program can be instituted to encourage good behavior and build self-esteem.
Our job as mothers is to nurture our children to help them find their unique gifts, as they all possess them.
As New York Times best-selling author, Dr. Wendy Mogel, states, "Try to see your child as a seed that came in a packet without a label. Your job is to provide the right environment and nutrients, while also pulling out the weeds. You can't decide what kind of flower you'll get, or in which season it will bloom."

Here Comes Bootleg Art From 'Christy's'

Texto completo: "I've never actually had to go to court over one of these things," Eric Doeringer said last week, standing in front of a wall of his latest artworks. "Generally, when they ask me to cease and desist, I do that."
Mr. Doeringer, known for his appropriations of works by famous contemporary artists, had been holed up in his studio on a graffiti-speckled block in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, working on his new project. On Friday, he will debut "Christy's," a show at the Chelsea gallery space High Line Nine curated by A Hug From the Art World. Mr. Doeringer will be exhibiting and selling bootleg versions of artworks up for auction this month at the Post War and Contemporary Art evening sale at Christie's New York.
The authentic versions of the works, on view at Christie's New York beginning Saturday, include pieces by Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg. Their expected sale prices reach well into the millions.
The asking price for Mr. Doeringer's copies? A flat $ 1,000 each.
"In the art world, auction prices are pretty much the only public record of what a work is worth, so it sort of sets the value of artists' work," Mr. Doeringer said. "The idea was to take this event and knock it off and make these multimillion dollar works of art available for a lot less."
On the studio walls hung Mr. Doeringer's versions of works by Frank Stella, Wayne Thiebaud, Kaws, Giorgio Morandi, Rauschenberg and Warhol. The knockoffs are smaller than the pieces they're based on and with clear imperfections -- a wobbly line here, a visibly pasted-on bit there -- but instantly recognizable.
"They'll fool you from a distance," Mr. Doeringer said. "They won't fool you close up."
Mr. Doeringer, 44, who has an M.F.A. from Tufts University and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, has been making his bootlegs of famous art since 2001, when he began selling homemade copies of works by artists like Elizabeth Peyton, John Currin and Damien Hirst from a stand he set up on West 24th Street, near galleries that would be showing some of the very work he was appropriating.
He was inspired, he said, by vendors selling knockoff handbags on Canal Street in downtown Manhattan.
Since then, he's exhibited in actual galleries, and recently started making more altered riffs on famous works. ("Those in search of exact look-alikes, beware," Roberta Smith wrote in The New York Times in a review of Mr. Doeringer's 2014 exhibition, "Paintings & Sculpture," which featured his takes on Warhol soup cans at the now-shuttered Lower East Side gallery Mulherin & Pollard. "These works are not copies as much as updates based on current company designs.")
What does Christie's think of Mr. Doeringer's latest imitations?
"We're flattered," Alex Rotter, the chairman of post-war and contemporary art at Christie's, said in an email. "Whether it is art or music, a good bootleg version reminds you of an experience that you enjoyed and want to hold onto. We hope people will come and experience the original artworks at Christie's as well as the bootleg versions in Chelsea -- both are free and open to the public. I may do some shopping myself."
Making the bootlegs -- Mr. Doeringer is creating versions of around 30 artworks for the "Christy's" auction -- involves working backward. For a knockoff of Warhol's "Double Elvis," a silk-screen portrait of two identical, overlapping images of Elvis Presley in cowboy regalia, Mr. Doeringer found a digital version of the original photo Warhol used -- a publicity still from the Don Siegel western "Flaming Star" -- and created a stencil from it. So Mr. Doeringer's version, titled "Andy Warhol (Double Elvis)," was essentially made using a digital approximation of Warhol's method.
For a collage copy of Mr. Thiebaud's "Eating Figures (Quick Snack)," a painting of a man and a woman sitting holding hot dogs and drinks, Mr. Doeringer painted a white background and chair legs onto canvas and stuck on top of it a digital print of the two people taken from an image of the original painting -- which he pulled from the Christie's website.
For an impromptu in-studio demonstration of how he created a scaled-down version of Jeff Koons's "Rabbit," an iconic stainless steel sculpture that Christie's estimates will sell for $ 50 million to $ 70 million, Mr. Doeringer inflated (by mouth) one of several plastic rabbits he bought online. Its shape, it had to be said, was strikingly similar to Mr. Koons's sculpture -- though it was also translucent neon yellow and had a cartoon face.
Mr. Doeringer would paint it silver.
"It's not exactly right," he said, holding out the fully inflated bunny. "But it's pretty close."

Barr picks U.S. attorney to review probe origins

Texto completo: Attorney General William P. Barr has tapped John H. Durham, the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut, to investigate the origins of the special counsel's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Barr picked Durham in recent weeks to work on the review, which is designed to ensure the U.S. government's "intelligence collection activities" related to the Trump campaign were "lawful and appropriate," a person familiar with the decision said.
Barr had confirmed the review publicly, though the person leading it was not previously known. Durham's selection was first reported by the New York Times.
Durham was confirmed as a U.S. attorney in February 2018 and had previously earned a reputation as a dogged career prosecutor tapped by previous attorneys general for other high-profile roles.
In 1999, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Durham to investigate law enforcement corruption in Boston, and more recently, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. called on him to investigate the treatment of CIA detainees and the destruction of videotapes.
In its 448-page report, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's team wrote that while its investigation established that the Trump campaign "expected it would benefit electorally from" information stolen in Russia-backed efforts, it "did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."
Mueller also found 10 "episodes" of potential obstruction of justice by President Trump but ultimately concluded that it was not his place to determine whether the president broke the law.
In the weeks since the release of the report, Trump and his allies have launched a new rallying cry: "Investigate the investigators."
Trump and other Republicans have argued that the FBI "spied" on Trump's campaign by surveilling former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page under a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Page's communications were surveilled in late 2016 and early 2017, after he left the Trump campaign. Barr has said government "spying" occurred on the Trump campaign, though he has insisted he did not intend the word to carry a pejorative meaning.

Texto completo: You can always count on New York Times columnist Charles Blow to repeat whatever liberals have been saying for the past week, in case you missed any of it.
On Monday, Blow insisted, as Democrats and the news media have been doing, that President Trump and political allies “are executing a strategy of wholesale obstruction, refusing to comply in any way on any front.”
And with that, the tired narrative that Trump has so far refused to comply with the ridiculous, endless Russia investigation was put to bed. There’s nowhere to go after Blow says it.
The claim that Trump has refused to “comply” would be laughed at if the Times op-ed page weren’t always so predictably fact-free. Mueller’s probe included interviews with 500 witnesses, the execution of as many search warrants, and the issuance of nearly 3,000 subpoenas. It was concluded with an unlimited budget, unlimited time frame, and with the help of 20 lawyers and 40 FBI agents.
Don McGahn, the lawyer for Trump during the investigation, sat for 30 hours' worth of interviews with Mueller’s team and submitted written answers on behalf of Trump to the investigation.
This, according to Blow, is “wholesale obstruction, refusing to comply in any way on any front.”
I gather than Democrats and liberals in the media want to keep the party going now for the same reason they demanded the investigation to begin with — to maintain an indefinite cloud over Trump’s White House that hampers his progress. If it weren’t solely a political maneuver, this wouldn’t be the 50th time that Blow has called for impeachment, not because it would go anywhere but for the political damage it would do.
At some point, enough is enough. That point was on April 18, 2019, when Attorney General William Barr released the Mueller report with minimal reductions to the public.
Anyone outside of Washington who wants to know what’s in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report can read it. But don't trust the media as to its content, or you might fall prey to lines like this from Blow: “There is no doubt whatsoever that Trump broke the law by obstructing justice, as he sought to end investigations into him, his campaign and his administration. The Mueller report makes that abundantly clear. Special Counsel Robert Mueller refused to state declaratively that Trump committed a crime because of Department of Justice guidelines issued by the Office of Legal Counsel that are against indicting a sitting president.”
This is not true in any way. Blow is either deliberately misleading his readers or he didn’t read the actual report, which stated neither of these things.
An honest reading shows that Mueller explicitly stated there was a lot of doubt about whether Trump had broken any obstruction law. It noted that there was no underlying crime (conspiracy with Russia) to have obstructed the justice of and that there was “substantial evidence” that the intent behind Trump’s actions in questoin were political and not criminal.
Mueller’s acknowledgment of current Justice Department policy not to indict sitting presidents was a legal footnote on process, not a complaint that his hands were tied in what would otherwise be a clear-cut case.
There is nothing left to do here, Just because Democrats and liberals like Blow keep making demands doesn’t mean anyone in the administration needs to volunteer to be dragged around by their neck, lest they be accused of “wholesale obstruction, refusing to comply in any way on any front.”
It's always something: No Russia conspiracy? Then, give us the unredacted Mueller report (which would violate federal law). No? Then, give us your tax returns.
The whole thing is sick. There’s no refusal to “comply.” There’s only a Democratic Party and a liberal news media refusing to face reality.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON.— Teresa Todd recuerda bien cuando se detuvo en una zona desértica en Texas a ayudar a tres hermanos que habían sido abandonados por su grupo . Su gesto de buena samaritana le costó una breve detención, pero ahora lucha para que el Congreso modifique las leyes y no castigue a personas que rescaten a migrantes .
Todd es abogada de la ciudad fronteriza de Marfa y del condado de Jeff Davis, en Texas, situados en un altiplano del desierto chihuahuense.
Durante una noche fría en febrero pasado se detuvo a ayudar a tres jóvenes salvadoreños que fueron abandonados por su grupo porque la más joven, Esmeralda, se enfermó y no podían avanzar .
En entrevista telefónica con Noticias Telemundo, Todd explicó este lunes que sólo pensó en su hijo menor cuando vio las figuras pidiendo auxilio en un lugar tan aislado y obscuro, y su instinto materno la obligó a actuar .
“Creo que paré en parte porque soy madre de dos adolescentes, de 17 y 15 años, y el joven que corrió delante de mi coche era casi del mismo tamaño que mi hijo menor. Les pedí que se subieran a mi coche, y poco después llegó la Patrulla Fronteriza y me advirtió de que podrían enjuiciarme ” por transportar a inmigrantes indocumentados, explicó.
Todd pasó 45 minutos en una celda y un total de tres horas en detención. Varios días después, agentes federales, con orden de cateo en mano, llegaron a la alcaldía a confiscarle su teléfono. Se lo devolvieron 53 días después, causando enormes interrupciones en su trabajo.
“Mucha gente se molestó conmigo porque no les devolvía las llamadas, y en ese teléfono tengo mucha información privilegiada de mis clientes. Como abogada, claro, me causó muchos problemas”, se quejó Todd, cuyo caso salió a luz pública el viernes pasado en un artículo del diario The New York Times.
Desde entonces, su oficina no deja de recibir llamadas, y en las redes sociales la mayoría de los comentarios son para elogiar y respaldarla.
Los tres jóvenes, Carlos, Francisco y Esmeralda, formaban parte de un grupo de diez personas cuando cruzaron el Río Bravo. Al parecer, llevaban seis días caminando y ya habían agotado sus raciones de comida y agua cuando Esmeralda, de 18 años, presentó graves síntomas de deshidratación.
Todos siguen bajo custodia de la Oficina de Inmigración y Aduanas, aún cuando han solicitado asilo. Su caso se complica porque los dos hermanos presuntamente firmaron documentos que, según ICE, autorizan su “autodeportación” .
Dan Domínguez, alguacil del Condado Presidio, cercano a Marfa, ha dicho a la prensa que, a su juicio, Todd debería ser sometida a juicio porque, sin importar su gesto humanitario, “la ley es la ley” .
Es que, según el código penal, las autoridades federales pueden presentar cargos criminales contra personas que, a sabiendas, intenten transportar a inmigrantes indocumentados más allá de los puntos fronterizos, los oculten u ofrezcan albergue.
Una vez declaradas culpables, esas personas suelen afrontar una multa y sentencia carcelaria .
Según datos oficiales, entre 2015 y 2018, el número de personas acusadas por contrabando y dar refugio a inmigrantes indocumentados aumentó en casi un tercio, de 3,441 a 4,532 .
En abril de 2017, bajo el entonces fiscal general, Jeff Sessions, la Administración Trump instruyó a los fiscales en todo EEUU a que dieran máxima prioridad a enjuiciar a quienes faciliten los cruces ilegales, o trasladen y den albergue a al menos tres migrantes indocumentados.
Otros casos similares al incidente con Todd en la franja fronteriza también han tenido amplia cobertura mediática, como el de activistas en Arizona, del grupo “No More Deaths/No Más Muertes”, que en enero pasado fueron condenados por proveer agua y comida a migrantes en zonas desérticas.
En California, activistas del grupo “Border Angels”, que desde hace 20 años dejan ropa, comida y bidones de agua para los migrantes en el desierto, han sido objeto de críticas de grupos anti-inmigrantes.
Mientras Todd presiona para que el Congreso modifique las leyes migratorias, la abogada expresó esperanza en que los jóvenes que atendió aquella noche puedan obtener asilo.
Cuando Todd se enteró de que Francisco “agradeció a Dios primero, y después a esa señora” que los rescató de una muerte casi segura, la abogada no hizo más que ponerse a llorar , dijo.
“Tengo dos trabajos y dos hijos, pero estoy intentando hacer todo lo que pueda por ayudar en esto… nuestro tiempo juntos fue muy breve esa noche, pero me conmueve mucho su caso y espero que consigan asilo para quedarse en EEUU, porque está claro que sus vidas correrían peligro si son devueltos” a El Salvador, puntualizó Todd.

Drug price-fixing lawsuit pushes CT probe into national spotlight

Texto completo: Connecticut’s new attorney general, William Tong, is dramatically expanding the scope and raising the profile of the state’s long-running investigation of drug price-fixing, accusing the generic drug industry of a massive anti-trust conspiracy that has cost American consumers, taxpayers and insurers billions of dollars.
In lawsuit filed Friday in U.S. District Court and announced Sunday night by his office as “60 Minutes” aired a story about the case, Connecticut and a coalition of 43 other states accuse Teva Pharmaceuticals and 19 of the nation’s other leading generic drug manufacturers of conspiring to fix prices on more than 100 drugs.
“We have hard evidence that shows the generic drug industry perpetrated a multi-billion dollar fraud on the American people. We have emails, text messages, telephone records, and former company insiders that we believe will prove a multi-year conspiracy to fix prices and divide market share for huge numbers of generic drugs,” Tong said in a statement.
Tong is holding a press conference about the case Monday in Hartford, joined by consumer health advocates.
The new lawsuit is the second filed by the office against the generic drug industry, both arising from an investigation opened in July 2014, during the administration of Tong’s predecessor, George Jepsen. Tong, who had been a state representative from Stamford, was elected in November and took office in January.
The investigation began when Mike Cole, who supervises the office’s antitrust and fraud unit, read a story in the New York Times headlined “Rapid Price Increases for Some Generic Drugs Catch Users by Surprise.” On a hunch, he emailed the story to one of his antitrust lawyers, Joe Nielsen, and they eventually asked Jepsen for authorization to issue subpoenas.
Two years later, Nielsen shared his findings at a confidential meeting with anti-trust lawyers from attorneys general in other states. A coalition led by Connecticut, initially joined by 19 other states, filed the first suit in December 2016. The coalition quickly expanded to 40 states and now numbers 44.
The industry generally has denied any wrongdoing, although two former executives from Heritage Pharmaceuticals, one of the original defendants, have reached settlements with the coalition of states and are cooperating.
The new lawsuit names 20 corporations and 15 executives as participating in a conspiracy led by Teva. It claims the conspirators have fixed prices on more than 100 generics, turning market forces on their head and causing prices to jump by as much as 2,000 percent.
“Typically, when the first generic manufacturer enters a market for a given drug, the manufacturer prices its product slightly lower than the brand-name manufacturer. When a second generic manufacturer enters, that reduces the average generic price to nearly half the brand-name price,” the suit says. “As additional generic manufacturers market the product, the prices continue to fall. For drugs that attract a large number of generic manufacturers, the average generic price falls to 20 percent or less of the price of the branded drug.”
In a telephone interview Sunday night, Tong declined to say if his office withheld an announcement of the new lawsuit to time its release with “60 Minutes.” The Associated Press filed a report on Saturday. Tong said his office had been rushing to finish the expanded lawsuit in coordination with the other states.
“We got it done Friday,” Tong said. “60 Minutes happened to be on a parallel track.”
CT Mirror first covered an element of the “60 Minutes” story in January 2017: How Cole’s hunch and Nielsen’s investigation put the attorney general’s office of a small state at the forefront of investigating what “60 Minutes” now says may be the biggest price-fixing scheme in U.S. history.
The original case was well-covered nationally, but Tong said there has been no sustained attention of a scam that he says is central to the rising cost of U.S. health care.
“It has been a remarkably sleepy story. These are the biggest manufacturers of generic drugs — they are 90 percent of the market,” Tong said. “I think people are just now starting to understand.”
The suit filed Friday names 20 corporate defendants:
Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.
Sandoz, Inc.
Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Actavis Holdco US, Inc.
Actavis Pharma, Inc.
Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Texto completo: TORONTO — The Process is dead. Long live the process
Asked where The Process is at this stage of his career, Philadelphia 76ers All-Star center Joel Embiid — dejected from losing to Toronto 92-90 in Game 7 on Sunday — said, “I don’t give a damn about The Process. ”
Quite the admission from Embiid, who came to embody the Sixers’ divisive rebuild set forth by former general manager Sam Hinkie.
Regardless whether Embiid uttered his comment in the disappointment of defeat or if that’s how he really feels, the Sixers have reached a critical moment in this era.
Where do they go from here? Who is on the team at the start of the 2019-20 season?
Kawhi's historic buzzer-beater: Inside shot that lifted Raptors into East finals
General manager Elton Brand has proven himself in his first season in the job following the Bryan Colangelo Twitter disgrace that resulted in Colangelo losing his job.
Brand acquired Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris in trades during the season and the work gets more difficult, but Philadelphia has answered its first big question with the team deciding to bring back coach Brett Brown.
Rumors had percolated for some time that Brown was in jeopardy, and The New York Times reported before Game 7 that it would be difficult for Brown to save his job if the Sixers didn’t advance to the conference finals.
Ownership had been on record saying the Sixers have the talent to beat anyone in the East, and Brand told reporters in April the goal was to get deeper in the playoffs than last season, which was a second-round exit, the same as this season. But basing Brown's future on an incredible buzzer-beater by Kawhi Leonard in a Game 7 seemed short-sighted.
Turning pro: Michigan's John Beilein leaving to coach Cavaliers
Porzingis incident: Mavericks star involved in altercation at club in Latvia
Brown had his playoff starting five — Embiid, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and J. J. Redick — for 10 regular-season games. He had to coach three iterations of 2018-19 Sixers: the team he had at a training camp, the team he had after the Sixers traded for Butler in November and the team he had when the Sixers acquired Harris from the Los Angeles Clippers in February.
With the coach position resolved, Brand and the Sixers can focus on the roster. Butler likely will become a free agent and Harris will be a free agent. Do those two want to come back, and at what price and length of contract? Giving up what they did in trades to get those two indicates the Sixers are willing to spend to keep both.
A third starter, Redick, is also a free agent along with Mike Scott, Amir Johnson, Greg Monroe and Boban Marjanovic.
Because Philadelphia has several young players on team friendly contracts, the Sixers have money to spend in free agency.
In the draft, the Sixers have one first-round pick and three second-round picks. While the draft is important, it’s far less so compared to the coaching situation and free agency.
It's one of the more intriguing offseason story lines: How do the Sixers take the next step of their development? How do they become a championship contender?
It's a process, that's for sure, and it's in Elton Brand's hands.

Texto completo: Good books spring from provocative questions, such as those posed by El Cerrito-based writer James Vlahos in his intriguing new book, "Talk to Me" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $28, 336 pages).
In "Talk," Vlahos, a regular contributor to The New York Times and Wired, addresses the economic, cultural and psychological impact of voice-driven artificial intelligence or conversational AI. Think of Siri, Alexa and talking appliances, and Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.
As we interact with technology less by touch and more by talk, how will issues of privacy be determined? Who stands to profit the most? Can machine learning systems that enable computers to amass and utilize enormous amounts of data also teach compassion? Or will interactions with voice computing devices be more like a series of bad dates that ultimately end with breakups? If conversational AI achieves the level of interaction we enjoy in real life with actual people, will it increase our addiction to all things digital?
As fascinating as these queries are, the origin of "Talk" was a far simpler question. When his father was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer in 2016, Vlahos wondered what would it be like to continue to converse with him after he died. With only basic programming know-how, but a longtime interest in video games and technology, Vlahos developed a chatbot. He recorded his father speaking 91,970 words on topics including family history, jokes and his fanatical devotion to Gilbert and Sullivan. With approval from his mother and brother, he created Dadbot, an all-text chatbot with which he can converse forever with his father. He writes in the book, "If even a hint of digital afterlife is possible, then the person I want to make immortal is my father."
A 2017 cover story Vlahos wrote for Wired about his experience is the bedrock of the book, but root connections date back to childhood.
"I was born and raised in Kensington and majored in journalism at the University of Oregon," he said. "I wouldn't call ours an intellectual household, but it was literate. There were books all around; I remember we'd fight over who got which sections of the Sunday paper."
A college course on "Information Gathering" required selecting a topic and preparing an extensive, annotated bibliography.
"I picked the commercialization of children's television," he said. "It was about ads embedded in programs, like GI Joe in a cartoon to sell products to kids. I read hundreds of journals and books. For each source, you had to write a one-and-a-half page bibliography."
Deep research became Vlahos' top writing habit.
The interaction between people and electronics continues to leave him fascinated and wary.
"Computers, internet, phones; we keep getting new things foisted upon us. I'm not a technology scold, but I do wonder, what are the perils? One of the first things was for me to stop seeing voice-activated AI as magic, as automated computers doing amazing things," he said. "Particularly with dialogue systems, there's a human element as well. There are persona designers for Siri and Alexa. There are people with liberal arts degrees working on these things."
Learning about tech companies' approach to complex issues involving speech recognition, hearing, phonemes, conversational variability and societal "pain points" that smartphone virtual assistants were designed to improve was "an enormous pain in the (rear)," Vlahos said.
He began sleuthing at conferences, where scientists and other experts loved to talk. After he was effectively embedded covering Alexa for Wired, Amazon became his best source for state-of-the-art information.
Vlahos suggests the ghosts remaining in AI are human elements that embody everything machines do not offer naturally: warmth, charm, humor.
"It's much easier to teach a computer to solve a problem efficiently than to teach it where or when to say something emotionally appropriate," he said.
But users' desire to untether from a keyboard or handheld device drives the charge for voice AI to improve, especially in areas of language variability and conversational intimacy. He predicts conversational AI will eventually become virtually essential with users, and the company with the largest and earliest "land grab" will profit significantly.
In the meantime, three years working to produce "Talk to Me" won't alter his general approach to language and writing. But it has opened his eyes to new venues such as voice apps he might "play around in." Vlahos is working on his mother's oral history using Alexa, as well as developing a true-crime podcast and pondering his next book.

Texto completo: When Brant Dadaleares, owner and chef of the Gross Confection Bar in Portland, said the server station at the center of his debut restaurant's exposed-brick dining room was built into a vault, I wasn't sure what to believe. While I was certain he was telling the truth, I didn't know what he meant by "vault."
My confusion might sound strange, but by that point I had already learned that Dadaleares - a veteran of some of Southern Maine's most respected restaurants, including Fore Street, Central Provisions and Arrows - loves to play with words, concepts and their meanings. Take the sardonic name he gave to his dessert-only restaurant: Gross.
By deploying the term ironically on social media, using it to characterize his own imaginative, frequently exquisite sweets, he challenges our understanding of the word.
Have we been wrong all along? Can "gross" actually be used in a positive sense, especially as a description of a business intended to lure in diners for a drink and something sweet after finishing a meal elsewhere?
"That name is just complete sarcasm," he said. "And when a friend of mine asked me why I'd name the place 'Gross,' I asked him, 'Are you ever gonna forget it? No? DING!' " Dadaleares' impious attitude toward labels plays out across his menu, where abstract-looking mounds and assemblages of components are given jarringly conventional-sounding names. Take the coconut macaroon ($7), one of the smaller, single-serving dishes on a list he calls, "The Taste."
You'd be forgiven for expecting a cookie. I did. Instead the dessert arrives as a free-form jumble of brown butter powder, dried-apricot jam, glistening blobs of passion fruit gel, dark Valhrona chocolate ganache, and interspersed throughout, roughly broken chunks of a chewy, caramelized, desiccated-coconut cookie. Each marvelous spoonful forces you to question everything you ever knew about macaroons.
So too, his fantastic grapefruit-Campari cake ($6), where an aerated, bittersweet sponge cake has been rent into irregular clusters, and adorned with crumbly honeycomb candy, sticky, syrup-confited grapefruit zest and broken shards of Earl Grey shortbread. Taken together, the dish brings to mind undersea debris that has settled lazily onto a coral reef.
Plating is not always so elegant and organic. Indeed, several dishes, like the otherwise delightful, savory-sweet brown butter panna cotta ($7) - a loose collection of wobbly cream, cubes of aromatic yuzu gel and puffed wild rice that has been tossed in caramel powder - look like they were accidentally dropped onto the plate from a height.
But frequently such haphazard presentation just creates another disconnect that reinforces streamlined, well-balanced flavors. The Bizarro-World version of an eclair ($6) looks disarmingly decoupled from classic French pastry, with its single tongue of craquelin-topped choux teetering atop a scoop of rhubarb sorbet, ready to topple into droplets of strawberry-rose fluid gel, coconut cream and a tart rhubarb compote. Touch it with your spoon, and that's exactly what it does. But after the first bite you won't care.
Just don't call Dadaleares' style "deconstructed."
"For me, it's all about textures and variants of flavors, acidity, fat," he said. "I start with a base of flavors and think of different combinations of things that go well together. I'll write down 'lemon, basil, coconut' and then a cooking procedure that will work with it. It's not deconstructed, more like composing ingredient-first."
Once all the elements of a dish are juxtaposed correctly, Dadaleares is able to make the leap to a name, something conceptually adjacent, although perhaps unrecognizable until you stick a spoon in.
"I wanted to make this unexpected," Dadaleares said, "but not so avant-garde that people didn't want to eat here."
The menu does feature dishes that appear (mostly) as you might predict. A warm steamed bun ($13) is just that: a white, yeasted Chinese bao that Dadeleares learned to prepare during a stint at Eventide. Bite in, and warm ginger-infused chocolate ganache courses out, dribbling into the orange marmalade glaze, and very likely down your chin.
Or Gross' version of a no-bake cheesecake ($6): It might be served in a glass, but with a buttery Speculoos crumble and tea-like tonka-bean custard, it looks immediately familiar, even if the flavors share more in common with a cardamom-forward Indian dessert than a 1980s dinner-party classic.
Mistakes, although rare, are minor and easily corrected. In the malted crumb brulee ($11), one of the larger-format dishes in a section of the menu called "The Set List," bacon imparts so much smoke flavor that it smothers the malt in the custard and the nuttiness of a gummy peanut-butter cremeux.
Similarly, the phenomenally rich, ultra-dense (and gluten-free) chocolate budino ($8) features brown-butter powder and shavings of creamy Norwegian gjetost cheese that together tilt the balance of flavors just a notch too far toward the savory. On my recent visit I overheard a man at a neighboring table ask his date, "Are you sure this is a dessert?"
It should tell you everything you need to know that they still finished it.
Cocktails, under bar manager Jaren Rivas (Tipo, Top of the East), also seem to be undergoing one final iteration of revisions. The best of these are barely sweet, like the melon-esque Mr. Allen ($11), a togarashi pepper-topped, cachaca-based sipper; or the Coup d'Etat ($12), a complex, rum-and-amaro drink that pairs especially well with chocolate desserts.
"That's my favorite," my server said, right before dislodging the oversized wooden serving board hanging over the edge of the two-top next to mine. "Yikes!" she cried, then ducked into what I thought was an old brick elevator shaft before returning with apologies and extra napkins.
A week later, when I inquired about the extensive renovations to the wide-berthed, subterranean rooms that Gross Confection Bar now occupies, I discovered my error.
Over the better part of a year, Dadaleares removed drop ceilings, bolt-on shelving and nearly two tons of debris from a space that, for nearly four decades, served as a Christmas ornament shop. But the 1883 John Calvin Stevens building was originally built as a bank.
What I suspected was an elevator shaft was literally what Dadaleares claimed it was - no metaphorical description or euphemism involved.
Sometimes a vault is just a vault.

Texto completo: Before their presidential aspirations became national news, six of the 23 declared candidates in the 2020 election were part of a different type of announcement published in The New York Times: their wedding announcement.
Two of Donald J. Trump's weddings were reported in The Times. Pete Buttigieg, Eric Swalwell, Tulsi Gabbard, Michael Bennet and Bill Weld were in the weddings pages, too.
Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a former naval intelligence officer, entered the Democratic primary race in January. He was 36 when he married Chasten Glezman, then 28, at the Episcopal Cathedral of St. James on June 16, 2018. He hopes to see Mr. Glezman, who took his husband's name, become America's First Gentleman.
Mr. Swalwell, a Democratic congressman from California, was featured in The Times in October 2016. He was 35 when he married Brittany Ann Watts, then 32, at the Rene C. Davidson Courthouse in Oakland, Calif. His previous marriage ended in divorce.
Ms. Gabbard, a congresswoman from Hawaii, was 34 when her wedding to Abraham Williams, then 26, in Kahaluu, Hawaii, was reported in these pages in April 2015. Her announcement noted that she was a captain in the Hawaii National Guard 29th Brigade Combat Team who had served in Iraq.
Donald Trump, then 58, gave marriage a third try in January 2005 when he exchanged vows with the former model Melania Knauss, then 34, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Fla.
"When Ms. Knauss came down the aisle of the church to the strains of 'Ave Maria,' she looked magnificent," The Times reported. "Her head was completely covered in a swath of white veil, which fell into a 16-foot train, and she carried a small diamond cross and rosary, with roses on either end."
At the time, Mr. Trump was better known to younger audiences as a reality television star on "The Apprentice" than as a real estate developer. Certainly few at the time thought that Mr. Trump would become the nation's 45th president.
But before that marriage, another one was featured in The Times, as Mr. Trump married Marla Ann Maples on Dec. 21, 1993, at the Plaza Hotel in New York.
"Dr. Arthur Caliandro of the Marble Collegiate Church performed the ceremony in the Grand Ballroom, on an altar decked with white orchids and white birches. Dripping from the birches were cut-glass teardrops," according to The Times report.
"Covering the Trump-Maples nuptials, 'an important personal moment in our lives,' the couple said in a statement, were 17 television crews, a gush of gossip writers, and 90 paparazzi."
The announcement mentioned that "the bridegroom's previous marriage ended in divorce," a reference to Mr. Trump and his first wife, Ivana Zelnickova, who was reportedly "keeping her cool on the ski slopes of Aspen." Her marriage to Mr. Trump in 1977 was not reported in the weddings pages of The Times. Before divorcing in 1992, Mr. Trump and Ms. Zelnickova had three children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric.
Mr. Bennet, a senator from Colorado, was the most recent presidential hopeful to join the ever-growing Democratic field, making his announcement on May 2. A former counsel to the deputy attorney general of the United States, Mr. Bennet, then 32, married Susan Daggett, then 33, on Oct. 25, 1997, at Crystal Lake in Marianna, Ark.
Bill Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts and currently the only Republican willing to take on Mr. Trump in their party's presidential primary, married Susan Roosevelt, a great‐granddaughter of President Theodore Roosevelt, in July 1975. Mr. Weld, whose name appeared in his wedding announcement as William Floyd Weld, met Ms. Roosevelt while both were studying for law degrees at Harvard. They married at Christ Episcopal Church in Oyster Bay, N.Y., and divorced in 2002.
Mr. Weld married his second wife, the writer and novelist Leslie Marshall, in 2005. (That announcement was not covered in our pages.)
Neither were the wedding announcements of Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar, both Democrats running for president. But both were mentioned in the announcements of former staffers Sarah Schrager Gitlin and Laura Ann Cederberg. And former Vice President Joe Biden, another Democratic candidate, was certainly mentioned in the announcement of his daughter, Ashley Biden, in June 2012.
Mr. Trump was also mentioned in The Times's announcements of two of his children.
Donald Trump Jr. married Vanessa Haydon in November 2005 at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, where the groom's family has a home that has since become a more-than-winter White House. Judge Maryanne Trump Barry of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, an aunt of the bridegroom, officiated. (In March 2018, Ms. Haydon Trump filed for divorce in a Manhattan court.)
Ivanka Trump married Jared Kushner on Oct. 24, 2009, at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. Both currently serve as senior advisers in the Trump White House.
Eric Trump's wedding was not mentioned in The Times, but we read about it for sure. He married Lara Lea Yunaska on Nov. 8, 2014, also at Mar-a-Lago.
Should the Democratic hopeful Cory Booker become president -- he is the only candidate in the field to have never married -- he would be the first president since James Buchanan (1857-61) to turn the White House into a bachelor pad.
Mr. Booker, however, does have a significant other in the actress Rosario Dawson, and if they do decide to marry, and Mr. Booker would like to become the seventh presidential candidate to appear in these pages, he can always submit his announcement information.

Texto completo: LONDON -- The list of those who have served as Britain's poet laureate contains many distinguished names. So does the list of those who have refused the job. Both are now a little longer.
The 21st poet laureate of the United Kingdom -- officially appointed by Queen Elizabeth II and named Friday evening in a news release from the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport -- is Simon Armitage, 55, a critically lauded and popular poet from West Yorkshire, in the north of England, whose work is taught in many British schools.
His appointment came two weeks after a report in The Sunday Times of London that the position would go to another acclaimed poet, Imtiaz Dharker, who would have been Britain's second female laureate and its first to be a person of color. Ms. Dharker, who was born in Lahore, Pakistan, and spent her childhood in Glasgow, publicly took herself out of consideration on Friday.
Mr. Armitage told the BBC that he believed there had been "a lot of discussion behind the scenes" about whether it was right for the job to go again to a white man, and that he wanted to use it to amplify the voices of those from "diverse and disadvantaged" backgrounds.
The British laureateship is one of the most famous honors in literature, with a history of more than 350 years. It may also be among the most mocked. The laureateship was formerly a lifetime appointment. But since the death of Ted Hughes, who held the post from 1984 until 1998, it has come with a 10-year term, no specific duties and a salary traditionally paid partly in sherry.
The departing laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, used the cash element of her pay to establish an annual Ted Hughes prize for new poetry worth 5,000 pounds, about $ 6,500.
The culture department's statement about Mr. Armitage describes the laureateship as an honorary position, and adds, "It is up to the individual poet to decide whether or not to produce poetry for national occasions or royal events."
That expectation has weighed heavily on some laureates. Andrew Motion, Ms. Duffy's predecessor, told a literary festival audience in 2008, toward the end of his 10-year term, that the job had been "very, very damaging" to his work.
"Writing for the royals was a hiding to nothing," he said, adding that he had "dried up completely about five years ago."
Sarah Lyall wrote in The New York Times before Mr. Motion's appointment: "Although the job has been filled over the years by some of Britain's poetic heavyweights, including Ben Jonson, who held the post unofficially, as well as Dryden, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Cecil Day-Lewis and John Betjeman, it has rarely inspired their best work."
Ms. Lyall quoted a notorious couplet attributed to Alfred Austin, poet laureate in the late 19th century, about the illness of the era's Prince of Wales:
Across the wires the electric message came
"He is no better, he is much the same."
Those reported to have been offered and refused the role over its long history include Walter Scott and Philip Larkin.
As for Ms. Dharker, she was quoted in The Guardian as saying, "I had to weigh the privacy I need to write poems against the demands of a public role. The poems won."
She added, "It was a huge honor to be considered for the role of poet laureate and I have been overwhelmed by the messages of support and encouragement from all over the world."
Other contenders had ruled themselves out more starkly. The dub poet Benjamin Zephaniah, mentioned as a possible laureate as long ago as 1998, tweeted last year: "I have absolutely no interest in this job. I won't work for them. They oppress me, they upset me, and they are not worthy. I write to connect with people and have never felt the need to go via the church, the state, or the monarchy to reach my people. No money. Freedom or death."
Mr. Armitage, however, has made a case for the power of the laureateship. In November, when the culture department announced that it had appointed a steering group of librarians and arts officials to help select a new laureate, he published an opinion article in The Guardian setting out requirements for the position.
The laureateship should be "the highest office in poetry," he argued. "It should be awarded to a poet of true recognition, a poet admired by both their fellow poets and by the public, a poet who is both expert and enthusiast, and a poet who is an accomplished practitioner of the art as well as its champion and ambassador."
The laureate, he said, should take poetry into "schools, prisons, communities and hospices," and think "about how to encourage and promote the poets of the future, because there will be more of them than us and they will be better."

Texto completo: BY JONATHAN LEMIRE
The Associated Press
NEW YORK - Democrats on Friday denounced a plan by President Donald Trump's personal attorney to push Ukraine to open investigations that he hopes could benefit Trump politically, decrying it as an overt attempt to recruit foreign help to influence a U.S. election.
Rudy Giuliani said he would travel to Kiev in the coming days to urge the Ukrainian government to conduct a pair of investigations: one on the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's recently concluded investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, the other on the involvement of former Vice President Joe Biden's son in a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch.
Giuliani's plan seemed poised to create an unprecedented moment, that of the lawyer of the president of the United States seeking foreign assistance in damaging his political rivals. To Democrats, it was a blatant evocation of Russia's meddling on behalf of Trump when he defeated Hillary Clinton.
"It's stunning that the Trump administration is going down the same tragic path they did in 2016 seeking help from a foreign government again to influence an American presidential election. It's appalling," said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who chairs the House intelligence committee. He said Trump allies were indicating, "We're going to do everything short of what's downright criminal. Ethics don't matter. Patriotism doesn't matter."
Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, pushed back against the criticism.
"Explain to me why Biden shouldn't be investigated if his son got millions from a Russian loving crooked Ukrainian oligarch while He was VP and point man for Ukraine," Giuliani tweeted at Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who criticized him. "Ukrainians are investigating and your fellow Dems are interfering. Election is 17 months away. Let's answer it now."
Giuliani's trip, which was first reported by The New York Times, will be the most high-profile effort yet by Republicans to call attention to growing talking points in conservative circles. They are trying to undermine the special counsel's investigation, call into question the case against Paul Manafort, Trump's imprisoned former campaign chairman, and wound Biden, the early Democratic front-runner in the 2020 presidential race.
Trump and Giuliani have urged scrutiny of Hunter Biden and have raised questions about whether the former vice president helped oust a Ukrainian prosecutor whose office was investigating the oligarch whose company paid his son. Some Trump allies have suggested they can tarnish Biden with questions about corruption, founded or not, much like they did to Clinton in 2016.
Giuliani has said he updated the president about his findings on Ukraine, a nation deeply reliant on the Trump administration for U.S. military and financial aid.
"I'm hearing it's a major scandal, major problem," Trump said on Fox News recently. "I hope for (Biden) it is fake news. I don't think it is."
The Biden campaign has denied that the candidate or his son did anything improper.

Facebook's co-founder says 'It's time to break up Facebook'

Texto completo: Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, is calling for the breakup of the social media juggernaut, citing the threat of the platform's unchecked power and that of founder Mark Zuckerberg.
In an op-ed published Thursday in The New York Times, Chris Hughes, who helped form Facebook in a Harvard dorm, joined the growing chorus of lawmakers and advocates demanding the U.S. government rein in Facebook. Despite its myriad scandals -- Russian propagandists exploiting the platform to spread misinformation and sway U.S. elections, the sharing of millions of users' personal data with the political data firm Cambridge Analytica and companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Netflix -- Facebook's reach continues to grow.
"For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure Americans are protected and markets are competitive," Hughes wrote. "It is time to break up Facebook."
Facebook rejected this argument in a statement Thursday afternoon, suggesting that regulation of the internet -- as Zuckerberg called for in a March op-ed published in The Washington Post -- was the only thing that would bring real accountability.
"Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company," Nick Clegg, vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a statement. "Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the Internet."
The op-ed painted a stark portrait of Facebook's dominance: The company is worth half a trillion dollars and its products are regularly used by billions of people. By Hughes' estimates, Facebook commands "more than 80 percent of the world's social networking revenue."
Another major social networking platform hasn't been founded since 2011, and despite movements such as #deleteFacebook, it's almost impossible to avoid, with many people eschewing the core platform in favor of Instagram or WhatsApp, not realizing they are Facebook subsidiaries.
"Because Facebook so dominates social networking, it faces no market-based accountability," Hughes wrote. "This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern: first outrage, then disappointment, and finally, resignation."
No aspect of Facebook is more troubling than Zuckerberg's total authority, Hughes wrote, calling it "unprecedented and un-American." Zuckerberg controls 60 percent of the company's voting shares and has ultimate oversight.

Texto completo: The opponents of mining recently attacked members of the Lee County Board of County Commissioners on their decision to change mining regulations. They claim these changes will further erode our water quality and cause the proliferation of mines. These claims are made based on misinformation driven by groups pushing an anti-growth agenda.
Here are the facts: these amendments do nothing to increase mining throughout the county or harm water quality. The regulations that have been in place remain the same and require protection of open space, wetlands, wildlife habitat and stringent water monitoring. In fact, most of the proposed changes strengthen the requirements with increased setbacks and additional community meetings for mine approval.
Commissioner Hamman said recently that he had spoken to water experts at all levels of government and academia and found no link between our recent water quality issues and mining.
Commissioners Hamman, Pendergrass and Manning have continuously shown their support of a balanced approach to growth and our environment. They let facts, not emotion, guide good public policy. The facts about mining are there. Do your research and do not be misled by those with a hidden agenda.
Phillip Ford, Fort Myers
Coming soon The Democrats lost with Hillary Clinton and they still haven't recovered from their 2016 convulsions. Still embedded in total shock they lost the never-ending Mueller report that they criminally set-up.
And now even the left-pumping New York Times is writing about the Steele dossier, government overthrow conspiracy as an emerging huge problem for the Dems, Department of Justice, FBI, Intel community and the "Keep me informed" Obama administration.
Yes, the worm has turned and we may very quickly be investigating lots of characters that already have one full leg deeply recorded as evildoers in a treasonous plot to overthrow a rightfully, elected president of the United States. Emails, text messages, hate speech, inspector general testimony and more to come soon, plus finger pointing may soon totally destroy Democrat/Socialist hopes for 2020.

Thank you Whoever is responsible for making changes to the editorial section deserves a hearty thank you. I am now seeing more guest editors with, gasp, conservative views. And I can't tell you how refreshing it is to see the editorial cartoons express conservative views.
In the bad old days when you had the local cartoon writer doing the cartoons, all he ever did was bash conservatives. Not only did that alienate half of your readers, but the biggest fault of it was that it was boring. You are starting to take the view of famous commentators such as Will Rodgers and Samuel Clements. They realized that there is enough buffoonery, corruption, and ineptitude in both parties, and were able to demonstrate this with clarity and humor.
John "Mac" McCarthy, Cape Coral
Totally false I think The News-Press is shirking its' duty to not correct false statements in the letters published. Recently, a contributor commented on the idea put forward by a new member of the House that income taxes should be raised to 70%. The writer stated that at her salary of $174,000 she would then pay over $121,000 of her salary in taxes and how foolish she must be.
That statement is totally false. The 70% tax plan would be levied on unearned income, such as dividends, and would apply to those individuals with incomes of $25 million or more. Currently, unearned income is taxed at a much lower rate. That is a totally different scenario from what was stated in the letter.
Now, it could be the writer is just ignorant of the plan or perhaps feels they get more bang for the buck with a little misinformation. This is when The News-Press should step in and correct the misinformation.

Texto completo: Stephen Moore writes: "The low point of the sleaze campaign was when the media successfully persuaded the Fairfax County, Va., courts to unseal my divorce records from nine years ago -- over not only my objections but my ex-wife's. The Post, New York Times and others unfolded our dirty laundry on their pages" ("My Brush With Personal Destruction," op-ed, May 3).
As a non-attorney, I see only one excuse for such dumpster diving, namely, that the position occupied or potentially occupied by the object of inquiry is so important that no previously established legal contracts need be observed. So why not call this new standard the "Moore Protocol" and apply it immediately to all sitting members of Congress? Reveal any and all of their previously sealed records, contracts and agreements to determine whether these powerful men and women -- after all, they hold the right to impeach, try and perhaps remove the most powerful person in world from office -- deserve to remain in their posts. As a gesture of charity perhaps not offered Mr. Moore, let's give the option of retaining their previously established privacy to any who resign their congressional posts immediately, say, by sundown.

Trouble brewing for front-runner Biden's campaign

Texto completo: Joe Biden's presidential campaign is in trouble. That may sound crazy. The former vice president just opened up (according to one poll) a 32-point lead over the rest of the Democratic field. But beneath the surface, trouble is brewing.
Biden will be 78 on Inauguration Day 2021. That would make him older, if elected, on the day he takes office than President Ronald Reagan was on the day he left office.
With old age comes old baggage - in Biden's case, his handling of Anita Hill's testimony during Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearings. Polls show that 30 percent of Democrats don't approve of Biden's handling of Hill's testimony; 44 percent said they didn't know or had no opinion. That's not surprising. The Thomas hearings took place in 1991, when the Soviet Union still existed, the last apartheid president of South Africa was still in office and something called the World Wide Web was made available to the public. Tens of millions of American voters have been born since 1991, and have no living memories of these events. But Biden's Democratic rivals are going to make sure they do know about Anita Hill. The more Biden's primary lead expands, the more desperate his Democratic opponents will be to bring him down. And Hill is their most powerful weapon.
Biden knows this, which is why he recently tried to reach out to Hill and smooth things over. It didn't work. Hill told the New York Times that "she was not convinced that he has taken full responsibility for his conduct at the hearings - or for the harm he caused other victims of sexual harassment and gender violence." She said "she was troubled by the recent accounts of women who say Mr. Biden touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable." And she said that Biden's handling of her testimony "set the stage" for the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Those words could prove devastating with Democratic primary voters. The Thomas hearings may be ancient history, but Kavanaugh's confirmation is an open wound for Democrats.
Biden said in a speech in March that "to this day, I regret I couldn't come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved." Democrats won't buy that. He was chairman of the committee before which she testified. Perhaps he didn't do more to support Hill because most Americans did not believe her. After three days of hearings, a New York Times poll showed that 58 percent believed Thomas, while just 24 percent believed Hill. Even Biden didn't believe some of Hill's testimony. At one point, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., asked whether Hill was told by Senate Democrats that her charges would be kept secret and used to force Thomas to withdraw. She denied it. Specter recalled in his memoir that Biden said, "It was clear to me from the way she was answering the questions, she was lying."
Biden bowed to the public mood of the times. But in 2019, the public mood of the Democratic electorate has changed. He is running for president in the #MeToo era, against female Democratic rivals such as Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, N.Y., Amy Klobuchar, Minn., Kamala Harris, Calif., and Elizabeth Warren, Mass.
Think they are going to give Biden a pass on his handling of Hill's testimony? Biden is the living embodiment of the era they are running against - a guy who is all too "handsy" with women in professional situations (as captured on video and parodied by late-night TV) and who did not stand up for a woman when she came forward.
The mantra on the left today is that even completely uncorroborated allegations of sexual misconduct must be believed and should be enough to destroy a man's career. Democrats tried to use such uncorroborated accusations to stop Kavanaugh's confirmation, and failed. That failure is a source of continuing frustration for the Democratic base. Biden's rivals are going to harness those frustrations by pinning their party's failure to defeat Kavanaugh on Biden through the prism of the Thomas hearings.
Biden may be the Democratic front-runner. But that does not mean he will be the Democratic nominee.

Texto completo: Co-founder Chris Hughes cites threat of unchecked power, wide reach
Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, is calling for the breakup of the social media juggernaut, citing the threat of the platform's unchecked power and that of its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.
In an op-ed published Thursday in the New York Times, Hughes joined the growing chorus of lawmakers and advocates demanding that the U.S. government rein in Facebook. Despite its myriad scandals - Russian propagandists exploiting the platform to spread misinformation and sway U.S. elections, the sharing of millions of users' personal data with the political data firm Cambridge Analytica and companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Netflix - Facebook's reach continues to grow.
"For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure Americans are protected and markets are competitive," Hughes wrote. "It is time to break up Facebook."
Facebook rejected this argument in a statement Thursday afternoon, suggesting that regulation of the Internet - as Zuckerberg called for in a March op-ed published in The Washington Post - was the only thing that would bring real accountability.
"Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company," Nick Clegg, vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a statement. "Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the Internet."
Hughes's call comes as Facebook faces yet another controversy: An investigation by the Associated Press revealed that the platform automatically generates videos and pages that elevate extremist groups.
The op-ed painted a stark portrait of Facebook's dominance: The company is worth a half-trillion dollars and its products are regularly used by billions of people. By Hughes's estimates, Facebook commands "more than 80 percent of the world's social networking revenue."
Hughes and Zuckerberg co-founded Facebook with Eduardo Saverin and Dustin Moskovitz in 2004 while they were enrolled at Harvard University, an origin story famously chronicled in the Oscar-winning film, "The Social Network." All are now billionaires save Hughes, whose fortune has been estimated at $430 million.
Another major social networking platform hasn't been founded since 2011, and despite movements like #deleteFacebook, it's almost impossible to avoid. Many people eschew the core platform in favor of Instagram or WhatsApp, not realizing they are Facebook subsidiaries. The apparent avalanche of disasters hasn't dented Facebook's finances; its earnings per share increased 40 percent last year.
"Because Facebook so dominates social networking, it faces no market-based accountability," Hughes wrote. "This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern: first outrage, then disappointment, and finally, resignation."
No aspect of Facebook is more troubling than Zuckerberg's total authority, Hughes wrote, calling it "unprecedented and un-American." Zuckerberg controls 60 percent of the company's voting shares and has ultimate oversight over Facebook's algorithms, its privacy settings and community guidelines. He has the money and power to copy, buy or squash his competitors. Although Hughes defended Zuckerberg as a "good, kind person," he cast him as a man hellbent on domination.
"I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks," Hughes wrote.
Facebook's monopoly is stifling innovation and economic growth, Hughes argued, citing the 20th-century breakups of Standard Oil and AT&T by the Justice Department as examples of effective government intervention. The shift toward business-friendly policies in the ensuing years has eroded antitrust enforcement, Hughes wrote, at the expense of entrepreneurship, productivity and consumer health.
Hughes wants the government to correct the Federal Trade Commission's "biggest mistake" by forcing Instagram and WhatsApp to split from Facebook and become competitors again. He also wants the government to create an agency to regulate tech companies. Zuckerberg himself has publicly invited regulation, but Hughes maintains that the CEO is interested only in regulation that is "friendly" to Facebook.
"Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree," Zuckerberg wrote in his op-ed. He also cited privacy, data protection and election integrity as other areas in need of government oversight.
Legislators on both sides of the aisle have made a case for federal intervention with Facebook. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has made the breakup of American tech giants a pillar of her presidential campaign.
"Today's big tech companies have too much power - over our economy, our society & our democracy," Warren said in a tweet Thursday. "They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses & stifled innovation."
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has said he would hit tech companies with antitrust violations or fraud charges, arguing they unfairly censor right-leaning speech. This week, two top senators urged the FTC to go beyond its expected $5 billion fine against Facebook for its privacy practices, calling for tough punishments and accountability measures.
"The public is rightly asking whether Facebook is too big to be held accountable," Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) wrote in a letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons. "The FTC must set a resounding precedent that is heard by Facebook and any other tech company that disregards the law in a rapacious quest for growth."

Texto completo: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a Department of Homeland Security entity, has asked Congress for $18.2 billion to fund operations in fiscal 2020, making it the agency’s biggest annual request for discretionary funds.
In addition to the $18.2 billion ask, CBP asked to use $2.6 billion from fees its customs officers have acquired, for a total proposed budget of $20.8 billion. In fiscal 2019, the White House asked for $14.4 billion.
CBP Deputy Commissioner Robert E. Perez testified Thursday afternoon before the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border Security, Facilitation, and Operations that next year’s budget increase was due, in part, to record-high travel and trade levels, as well as a spike in illegal immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border. Both issues mandated more spending on personnel and resources.
In fiscal 2018, CBP interacted with nearly 414 million travelers at airports, seaports, and land ports of entry — up 4% from the previous year. Seven months into fiscal 2019, Border Patrol agents have taken into custody 460,000 people at the southern border compared to around 400,000 in all of the previous year.

The proposed budget funds the agency’s four main focuses: trade and travel, border security, counterterrorism, and organizational objectives. Border security is expected to eat up one-quarter of the total budget.
Here’s a breakdown of how it wants to spend some of that money:

Along the Border
$82.2 million: Facilities, medical care, transportation, and food for those in custody — on top of $415 million given in FY 2019.
$20.6 million: Procurement of 8,900 Unattended Ground Sensors to track and notify agents of human, vehicular, and tunneling activity.
$1.1 million: Procurement and deployment of Integrated Fixed Tower technology or surveillance radars and electro-optical/infrared cameras that are installed on fixed towers and can be manned from control centers or automatically notify headquarters of activity.
$16.7 million: Acquiring and maintaining 50 drones, known as small Unmanned Aircraft Systems. Border Patrol plans to use them to surveil remote parts of the borders.
$3.2 million: Cross Border Tunnel Threat program, which helps CBP predict where new tunnels may be dug, detect others, and project where those being constructed are starting and ending.
$58.6 million: Upgrading and maintaining Border Patrol’s Remote Video Surveillance System with an additional 14 stand-alone towers on the border from the current eight in use. The new ones will be installed near Brownsville, Texas, and Fort Brown, Texas.

Personnel/Equipment

$19.4 million: Replacing the 95% of CBP service handguns that are expected to exceed their service lifespan in 2019. CBP will purchased 9 mm duty handguns, ammunition, replacement parts, and holsters.
$8.9 million: The acquisition of devices that can test narcotics; overdose resuscitation kits; chemical analysis software; officer training for how to use the devices.
$164.5 million: Hire, train, equip 750 additional Border Patrol agents and 145 mission support personnel.

Border Infrastructure
$8.6 billion: 200 miles of new steel bollard border fence, including the real estate and environmental planning, land acquisition, wall system design, construction, and construction oversight.
$127.4 million: Construction, modernization, and expansion of Border Patrol’s Air and Marine Operations and Office of Field Operations facilities, including Border Patrol checkpoints in Freer, Texas; Carrizo Springs, Texas; Eagle Pass, Texas.
$14.8 million: Improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment at CBP facilities.
$62.6 million: 20 large-scale and 200 small-scale nonintrusive inspection systems at ports, which scan trucks and vehicles without making physical contact.

Air/Sea
$22.4 million: Expanding CBP operations at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, where facial recognition technology is being rolled out.
$56.8 million: Two aircraft capable of flying surveillance operations on the southern and northern borders.
$46.5 million: Converting three Army HH-60L helicopters to CBP’s UH-60 Medium Lift Helicopter configuration.
$13.5 million: Replace up to 10 outdated aircraft sensor systems with better detection capabilities.
$14.8 million: Procurement of 14 Coastal Interceptor Vessels for air and marine agents.

Bob Woodward forecasts 'hydraulic pressure' to get Trump's taxes

Texto completo: Veteran journalist Bob Woodward said on Wednesday that there will be "hydraulic pressure" to obtain President Trump's tax information.
The Washington Post associate editor of Watergate fame said this week's bombshell report from the New York Times about 10 years of Trump's tax information was the "most important thing" to happen.
The New York Times report cited tax information showing Trump lost over $1 billion from 1985 to 1994. Although Trump reacted to the report by calling it a "highly inaccurate Fake News hit job," the president also said “losses for tax purposes” was considered a “sport” among real estate developers such as himself.
[Related: Chasing Trump's tax returns]
“Here we have Trump not paying taxes for years, and losing $1 billion, this man, who presented himself as so successful. And then Trump’s response is, well, I was in the real estate business, so avoiding taxes is sport,” Woodward said on CNN.
“And somebody’s going to look at that who’s been paying thousands of dollars in taxes, who’s this worker, the traditional base for Trump and I think they’re going to be uncomfortable," he said. "I think they’re going to say, hey, wait a minute, what’s going on here?”
Democrats in Congress are already seeking out Trump's tax returns, which he declined to release as a candidate, but Woodward predicted the fight will now get more intense.
"There's going to be hydraulic pressure in the system, not just from the media, but from Congress, because they do have authority to get Trump's taxes," he said. "And it's something he doesn't have in a drawer in the West Wing. It's in the Treasury Department and somebody could potentially force that."
The Treasury Department on Monday declined a demand from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., to review Trump’s tax returns, likely setting up a high-profile court battle over Congress' power to obtain the president’s financial records. In response, liberals called for the arrest of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, while Democrats are deciding whether to go to court and the New York legislature makes moves that could also pave the way to access to Trump's financial records.
Woodward also dismissed the Democrats' politically charged rhetoric related to the fight for access to special counsel Robert Mueller's full report on the Russia investigation.
“I think it’s a constitutional confrontation. I don’t think it’s yet a crisis," Woodward said on CNN. “And this is going to go into the courts and this could take months or a year or more.”
Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., told the press that the U.S. is now in a "constitutional crisis" as his committee clashes with the Trump administration over access to special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russia investigation. The panel voted along party lines to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress on Wednesday, while the White House asserted executive privilege over Mueller's findings.
“What I think is interesting, perhaps, to look at is what’s the impact on a factory worker or a farmer in the Midwest, as they look at all of this. It’s process, it’s legalistic," Woodward said, adding that he thinks Trump's taxes are a more important issue to voters.

ProPublica Wins Hechinger Grand Prize for Distinguished Education Reporting

Texto completo: The Education Writers Association announced this week that ProPublica reporter Hannah Dreier won the Fred M. Hechinger Grand Prize for Distinguished Education Reporting, the top prize in their National Awards for Education Reporting. Dreier was honored for two articles in the “Trapped in Gangland” series, which told the stories of students caught up in Long Island’s effort to crack down on MS-13.
Published jointly with New York magazine and the New York Times Magazine, the stories also won a National Award for Education Reporting in the features category.
Dreier reported on the cases of two asylum-seekers from Central America, Henry and Alex. Both were flourishing in Long Island high schools and getting good grades. In the fall of 2016, Henry wrote an essay in English class about how he belonged to the gang MS-13 but was desperate to escape from its violence. Six months later, bored in algebra class, Alex drew a doodle of a horned devil — which was his school mascot, but also happened to be an MS-13 symbol.
In a pair of compelling narratives based on a year and a half of reporting, Dreier revealed what happened next to the two boys. Henry’s essay and Alex’s doodle were both relayed from the supposed sanctuary of the classroom to federal authorities. Agents used Henry as an informant and then betrayed him, marking him for deportation. Falsely accused of gang membership, Alex was suspended, arrested and deported back to Honduras, one of the world’s most dangerous countries.
As Dreier meticulously documented, the downfalls of these teenagers reflected a threat to student privacy and academic freedom nationwide. Circumventing Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act protections, school-based police officers had passed on the teenagers’ writings to the FBI and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In response to the stories, the Department of Homeland Security opened a civil rights investigation, ICE changed a practice that jeopardizes informants and several Long Island school districts sought a formal agreement with the police limiting officers’ roles in schools.
“This remarkable ‘life and death’ story exposes the complicated relationship not just between schools and law enforcement but educators and troubled students,” one contest judge said. “The reporter’s relentless work to document the harrowing experiences of two teenagers trapped in the violent world of MS-13 is eye-opening and tragic.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Wednesday acknowledged taking massive tax write-offs for real estate losses topping $1 billion from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s, calling it "sport" among developers like himself during that period.
Mr. Trump was reacting to a New York Times report Tuesday that his businesses lost more than $1 billion from 1985 to 1994. The newspaper said its reporting was based on printouts it acquired of Mr. Trump's official IRS tax transcripts, including figures from his federal tax form. Mr. Trump reported business losses of $46.1 million in 1985, and a total of $1.17 billion in losses for the 10-year period.
The president appeared to defend his actions in a pair of tweets early Wednesday.
"Real estate developers in the 1980's&1990's, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases," Mr. Trump tweeted. He contended the reported losses were "non monetary."
"Sometimes considered 'tax shelter,' you would get it by building, or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes .... almost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport," Mr. Trump said.
Harlem fire kills family
A fire that began in the kitchen of a fifth-floor Harlem apartment killed a family of two adults and four children overnight Wednesday, New York City officials said.
Police responded to a 911 call of a fire at about 1:40 a.m. early Wednesday morning. Emergency responders pronounced six people dead at the scene: a 45-year-old woman and a 33-year-old man, two girls ages 11 and 6, and two boys ages 8 and 3.
The cause of the fire will be determined by the city's fire marshal, but there does not appear to be any signs of criminality.
Drug ads to include price
WASHINGTON - TV pitches for prescription drugs will soon include the price, giving consumers more information upfront as they make medication choices at a time when new drugs can carry anxiety-inducing prices.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Wednesday the Trump administration has finalized regulations requiring drug companies to disclose list prices of medications costing more than $35 for a month's supply.
"What I say to the companies is if you think the cost of your drug will scare people from buying your drugs, then lower your prices," Mr. Azar said. "Transparency for American patients is here."
'Magic mushrooms' win
DENVER - Voters narrowly made Denver the first U.S. city to decriminalize psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in "magic mushrooms."
Decriminalization led by a slim 51%, according to preliminary figures on Tuesday's election released by Denver's Election Division. As many as 1,300 votes still remain to be counted, but that figure was not enough to swing the vote the other way, division spokesman Alton Dillard said. Final election results will be released on May 16, he said.
"I think today's outcome really demonstrates that the conversation is going to continue, and the world is ready for it," said Cindy Sovine, chief political strategist for the campaign to decriminalize the drug.
"Psychedelics are already here. Now we can start to have the conversation about using them mindfully," she added.

Texto completo: Some of them barely register any more.
A mass shooting has to be really horrific to penetrate our fatigue, our numbness, our sense of its inevitability.
Deciding whether a particular attack is worthy of our overtaxed attention requires certain calculations: How many were killed? Just one, only four, six, or more? Were they adults or children? Did they look like us or no? Was it close to home, or in some distant place? What religion did the shooter profess to follow? Did they leave a manifesto? Could it have been worse?
So, to Tuesday's attack at a STEM school in Highlands Ranch, near Denver. Is this one sickening enough to be worthy of notice, or remembering?
Two teenagers walked into their own school and shot nine students. One of them, Kendrick Castillo, was killed just three days before graduation, after he charged one of the shooters. The school is not far from Columbine High School, where two seniors murdered 12 students and one teacher almost exactly 20 years ago. The death toll that shocked the nation then has been exceeded many times since, raising our tolerance every time.
Remember Umpqua Community College, in Roseburg, Ore., with nine dead and eight injured in 2015? Or Marshall County High School in Kentucky, where two were killed and 18 wounded last year? How about the Sun Trust Bank in Florida, where five women were murdered in January?
I didn't either, until I looked them up.
It's possible Castillo's heroism at Highlands Ranch breaks through the noise here, or that the school's proximity to Columbine keeps this shooting from blending in with others. Perhaps the fact that a gunman shot six people, killing two, on the last day of classes at UNC at Charlotte exactly a week earlier will make both shootings stick with us. Or maybe we just note the body count, decide we've seen worse, and move on.
They're so common, and we are so lousy at doing anything to stop them, that we've come to view mass shootings almost as natural, like weather events. Schools have adjusted, putting even little children through active shooter drills, in case luck deserts them.
“I heard a gunshot," Makai Dixon, 8, told The New York Times on Tuesday. “I'd never heard it before." The second-grader, the story noted, had been training for Tuesday since he was in kindergarten. Enraging photographs showed baby-faced grade-schoolers walking in line, tiny hands clasped above their heads.
God forbid we should actually do something that might lessen the carnage. Even after 20 first-graders and six teachers were killed in Newtown, Conn., and left us reeling, we did nothing. Legislators voted down pathetically weak gun safety measures, even as grieving Sandy Hook parents looked on.
In the wake of Tuesday's shootings, the Newtown Action Alliance — still fighting, though others have moved on from the horror of that December day six years ago — called for a slew of safety measures, some of which should be no-brainers: raising the minimum age for gun purchases to 21; mandating better storage; requiring security features that would prevent a gun being used by anyone other than the owner; requiring waiting periods for gun purchases; keeping them out of the hands of those deemed a danger to themselves or others.
A majority of Americans believe in some gun safety measures. But they're up against a powerful minority, led by the National Rifle Association, which has grown increasingly radical, casting any gun safety measure as state tyranny.
Its fantasies persist because there's money to be made from them. Recent stories, including an April report in The New Yorker, revealed that NRA officials and their associates have made millions for themselves via “gratuitous payments, sweetheart deals, and opaque financial arrangements," self-dealing that has put the nonprofit's finances in jeopardy. And whatever resources NRA officials can spare go to politicians, who parrot the lobbying group's talking points in return, recasting their heartless gun-rights absolutism as heartfelt patriotism.
Their position is only strengthened by our growing tolerance for mass shootings. The more massacres there are, it seems, the fewer we actually see.
Until we're confronted with one awful enough to shatter even our warped idea of normal.

Conservative views get wide media coverage

Texto completo: I must confess that I scratch my pointy independent voter head whenever I hear a conservative grouse that "the media" is biased.
Fox News appears to meet the definition of "media" — "broadcasting, publishing, and the Internet, regarded collectively" — as does Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., the Wall Street Journal, New York Post, Washington Times, Washington Examiner, Breitbart and many other publications and websites regarded as conservative.
Yet there is still a complaint that conservative views aren't being heard in the mainstream. Again, I scratch. Fox is perennially America's most-watched cable news network, with 2.4 million prime time viewers compared to liberal rivals MSNBC (1.9 million) and CNN (1.058 million).
Among talking heads, Fox's Sean Hannity is king, with 3.12 million viewers. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow pulls in 3.05 million, but Fox holds six of the top 10 cable news program spots.
Most importantly, Hannity and Fox are tighter than spandex with President Trump, thanks to their unabashed support. Hannity's phone interview with him on March 27 drew an audience of 4.3 million. And the pews aren't filled entirely by the faithful. Folks of all political leanings tune in to the left and right if only to aggravate themselves.
Other numbers to chew: Three of the top five radio shows are hosted by conservatives: Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin. (The other two are financial advice guru Dave Ramsey, a conservative evangelical Christian, and the somewhat less reverent Howard Stern.)
Meanwhile, Sinclair is one of America's largest, most diversified broadcasting companies — 191 TV stations, 602 channels, affiliations with all major networks — and the nation's top local news provider.
Then we have media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The recent New York Times feature on his political accomplishments as the owner of Fox and newspapers in the U.S., U.K. and Australia should give conservatives reasons to be cheerful.
All of that ain't small potatoes.
I suspect the right's aggravation is mostly due to differing views being widely heard in major outlets like ABC, CBS, NBC, the New York Times, Washington Post and NPR. Liberals grumble about media bias, too, and bias is always an outrage ... unless it echoes your own. Neither side likes the other to be heard in the war to sway those who are in the middle.
I'm focusing on conservatives here because I'm intrigued by their accusations of censorship and suppression by Google, social media, and colleges.
Trump's Tweets are hard to miss, and I have no trouble finding conservative voices on social media. Even NPR and the New York Times occasionally feature them. However, my Google search of "Mueller Report" on its Chrome browser yielded only one conservative site, Fox, on the second page of results despite Fox carrying Attorney General William Barr's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at the time.
As for free speech at universities, I believe all voices within reason should be allowed a say. My pet theory is that at least some resistance to conservative views is due to the right being so closely associated with strident nationalism of the kind that is hostile to minorities, and contempt for things like environmental protection and social justice. Fair or not, conservatism has an image problem outside its own borders.
High-profile firebrands like white supremacist/avid Trump supporter Richard Spenser or even truculent commentator Ann Coulter trying to spread the word on campuses likely isn't the most effective way to win hearts and minds in these volatile times. Of course, if all you're spoiling for is a fight, then you gotta love what you're getting.
On the whole, I think the word from the right is being heard by the entire nation. Everyone agreeing with what they hear is another matter.
Your Turn

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Donald Trump reported $1.17 billion in financial losses to the IRS from 1985 to 1994, a massive run of red ink that kept him from paying income taxes during most of that period, according to a report published late Tuesday in The New York Times.
The Times said it had documented those losses by obtaining official IRS tax transcripts for those years, showing the figures Trump reported on his IRS Form 1040 returns. The scope of those losses was such that, "year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer," The Times said.
The Times report comes a day after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would not comply with a request from a House committee for more recent Trump tax returns. A 1924 law gives Congress the explicit power to request such returns, but Mnuchin said the request lacked a "legitimate legislative purpose," a stance that is expected to be challenged in court.
The White House and the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent Tuesday. The Times said a private attorney for the president, Charles Harder, called its report "demonstrably false," but he had not cited any specific errors.
Until now, Trump's early career in real estate was believed to have reached a peak in the late 1980s, when Trump wrote "The Art of the Deal" - and then collapsed into loss and debt in 1990 and 1991.
The Times story shows, however, that Trump's losses began earlier. In 1985, he reported $46.1 million in losses from his casinos, hotels and other businesses, according to the report.
Those losses got worse in 1990 and 1991, as Trump's big bets on casinos, hotels and an airline all went bad.
Trump reported $517.6 million in combined losses during those years, The Times said. Because of his losses, The Times said, Trump was not required to pay income taxes for eight of the 10 years it examined.
Trump's most profitable business during this period, The Times reported, was not in real estate but in the stock market. As The Times described it, Trump would buy a company's stock, then make public statements indicating he was contemplating a hostile takeover of that company. The publicity would make the stock price rise, and then Trump - rather than buying more shares to make good on his takeover threat - would sell his stocks at a profit.
That sort of faux takeover talk earned Trump $57 million by 1988, The Times reported. But eventually, investors stopped falling for it: When Trump bought stock in American Airlines and talked about a takeover, the market didn't bite. Trump lost $34.9 million on short-term stock trades that year, The Times said.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
A frantic evening search for the antidote to a toddler's resistance to bedtime; an hourslong hunt on blog after blog for the perfect meal-planning guide for mothers and fathers: Parents everywhere rely on the internet daily to navigate the life-changing experience of raising a child.
But the vast amount of information available -- and constant uncertainty about whether a source is authoritative -- can add to the stress of parenting. With that in mind, The New York Times has worked for a year to develop a single source online where parents can find not only trustworthy, deeply researched guidance on child-rearing, but also relatable advice on maintaining well-being as an adult with a child. NYT Parenting is a new site that starts in beta today and aims to serve families and expectant parents of all kinds, at the same level of quality and expertise readers have come to expect from The Times.
Jessica Grose, the lead editor of NYT Parenting, said the site was intended to take the array of information found in fragments across the internet and filter it down to the advice parents really need to take action. A goal of NYT Parenting, she said, is that it should feel inclusive and nonjudgmental for parents and allow them to adapt each resource to their individual circumstances.
"There are many healthy ways for raising your children, and the best thing for you is based on your situation and the children that you have," Ms. Grose said. "Providing real guidance means being nuanced, not didactic."
The site, which currently focuses on the span from the time a person is considering having a child to that child starting school, includes guides crafted by experts on a wide range of subjects, like pregnancy and parenting burnout, as well as essays, stories and news, along with a newsletter that began in March.
Parents can turn to the site for a few regular features, including "Is This a Thing?" -- a series that answers why children behave certain ways as they grow. (The first segment: "Why Do 4-Year Olds Love Talking About Death?") Another series, "The Hardest Part," will share essays, written by writers who are parents, on their unexpected challenges and how they got through them. Readers can also submit their stories of "Tiny Victories" that celebrate the small but triumphant daily feats of parenthood.
Although NYT Parenting is starting in beta, the site already has a deep library of original content, and the team plans to roll out more each week. There are two sides to the content on the site: evidence-based information on child-rearing and development, and advice about the rest of adult life with a child -- relationships, finances, going back to work and even dealing with in-laws. "We wanted to make it clear that this site isn't just about raising kids," said Farah Miller, director of content strategy at The Times, who brings together the editorial and product sides of NYT Parenting. "It's actually about being a person who is a parent, which is really different."
On the graphic side, Deanna Donegan, NYT Parenting's senior visual editor, has made sure the original artwork -- a mix of illustrations and photography commissioned for The Times -- is designed to relate the diversity of experiences every parent faces. "The writing, research and artwork come together so that readers can get the emotional comfort and answers they need as a parent and as a person," she said.
The NYT Parenting team hopes the site's trustworthy, relatable guidance will help parents save time and reduce anxiety. But behind the scenes, creating NYT Parenting offered a new frontier for The Times to establish guidance of its own -- on how the newsroom and business sides can collaborate to create a successful product that connects with more readers. (The team is building toward eventually creating a standalone subscription product, like Crosswords and Cooking.) "There's been a fair amount of trailblazing in how we work with other teams at The Times," said Youngna Park, executive director of product, who manages cross-team collaboration and oversees the site's development.
Whether raising a child is a far-off venture, or 3 a.m. feedings and toddler tantrums are already a reality, NYT Parenting is now officially available to relate the joys, challenges, hopes -- and hilarity -- of it all.

Texto completo: In a historic change of mind, President Donald Trump has found a reason to support reparations -- for President Donald Trump.
The president retweeted this bright and, oh, yes, unconstitutional idea Sunday after Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, proposed that Trump deserved an additional two years in office to make up for the time allegedly lost in the Russia investigation.
I have a counterproposal. I think the president should leave office two years early -- as in, right now -- to make up for the "executive time" that he reportedly has spent golfing, visiting his personal properties and watching "Fox & Friends" instead of keeping up with his daily intelligence briefings.
Just kidding. Falwell was just kidding, too, I am told. Trump? I'm not so sure.
"Despite the tremendous success that I have had as President," Trump tweeted Sunday (punctuation and ALL CAPS his), "including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history, they have stolen two years of my (our) presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back....
"The Witch Hunt is over but we will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
Could this be a sign that the president doesn't expect to win four more years in office by the normal constitutional route?
As Trump and Falwell's tweets went out, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was warning in a weekend New York Times interview that, even if the president fails to be re-elected in 2020, he won't want to leave -- especially if he loses by a narrow margin.
The party needs to "inoculate against that," she said, by not only winning but winning "big" enough to convince Trump to step aside voluntarily, as every other sitting president has.
Pelosi didn't sound like she was kidding at all. Similar fears that Trump would "poison the public mind" and "challenge each of the races" motivated her in last year's midterms, she said. In the end, Democrats picked up a net gain of 40 seats, their biggest gain in the House since the historic post-Watergate wave election of 1974.
She's not the first to speculate about a Trump who won't go away. When comedian Bill Maher floated that notion last year on his HBO program, not as a joke but as a serious concern, my personal reaction was, hey, don't give him any ideas.
Yet Trump has said more than a little to feed the notion himself. In his final 2016 presidential debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, less than a month before Election Day, Trump promised to "totally accept" the election results, "if I win."
Since he did win the Electoral College, Trump's threat went away. But he went on to complain anyway, tweeting blame on some sort of a ghost-voting conspiracy for allegedly robbing him of the popular vote, "if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."
"In many places the same person in California votes many times," Trump said at the official White House event in West Virginia on tax cuts in April 2018. "They always like to say, 'Oh that's a conspiracy theory.' It's not a conspiracy theory." Again, he offered no evidence to back up that claim.
Speaking at a fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee in April, Trump cast suspicion on the close elections that Democrats won in 2018. "There's something going on," he said, telling his audience that they needed to "be a little bit more paranoid than you are, OK?" Again, he offered no proof to back that up.
And, requiring no proof are the jokes Trump has casually dropped about somehow extending his constitutional term in office. "Well, this is really beautiful," he said, accepting a gift from the Wounded Warrior Project in April. "This will find a permanent place, at least for six years, in the Oval Office. Is that OK? I was going to joke, General, and say at least for 10 or 14 years, but we would cause bedlam if I said that, so we'll say six."
Right. I, too, have an award for the president. It's a copy of a fine old song by Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks: "How Can I Miss You When You Won't Go Away?"
It's got a good beat and he can dance to it.

Texto completo: PENZANCE, England -- Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has given birth to a son, and the British press, which for weeks has been positively giddy with rumor, is released from its stifling wait for actual news of a royal baby.
While they waited, no detail, true or untrue, was too small to print: The duchess will have a home birth. The duchess will have a water birth. The duchess has rejected the gynecologists to the royal household for a female doctor. The duchess will have an organic birth, which is something I just invented. The duchess would have her baby before May 5 because her makeup artist returned to New York that day, according to his Instagram. The duchess was house hunting in California. And on and on.
At the height of baby watch, journalists were dispatched when an ambulance was parked near Frogmore House, the residence of Meghan and Prince Harry, for several hours (it turned out that paramedics had stopped for lunch).
Why does Meghan have the press in such paroxysms? Well, she is an interloper: divorced, American, biracial and, apparently, progressive. And she dares not only to inhabit the role of duchess but also to make it her own. Still, her critics -- energized by their racism, misogyny and snobbery -- can relax. She is not a revolutionary socialist nor a convincing human rights activist who will destroy everything they love. She will not bring down the royal family. In 2019, she is precisely what it needs.

Obsessive interest in the minutiae of monarchy is not new. It may be irritating to the objects of its devotion, but it is essential to their success. If you must have gods -- and that is what they are -- you have a responsibility to believe that they are better than the rest of us. If you don't, what is the point? And so those who dare to ascend to the rank of royalty without the blessing of royal birth are viewed as, at best, suspicious, and at worst, Wallis Simpson 2.0.
The Duchess of Cambridge, formerly the wealthy but not aristocratic Kate Middleton, was nicknamed Waity Katie while she was waiting for Prince William to propose marriage. She was photographed sunbathing topless in France, and the pictures were published. She survived by saying nothing and bearing three children, and is now left alone.
But the Duchess of Sussex, whose marriage is a much more dramatic clashing of worlds, has proved irresistible.
Tabloid newspapers have christened her Duchess Difficult, and she is accused, with more agonizing alliteration, of having had a "tiara tantrum" at a fitting for a bridesmaid's dress for Princess Charlotte, 4, at which the Duchess of Cambridge, 37, cried.
We hear of dawn messages to staff, requests for heating in medieval chapels -- did she ask why Windsor Castle was built so close to the airport, one wag reportedly asked -- and a semi-transgressive attendance at a baby shower in New York City. She moved from Kensington to Berkshire, which was reported as a "schism" between Harry and his older brother, Prince William, potentially as deadly as the feud between Richard II and his cousin Henry of Bolingbroke, which led to Henry usurping the throne. The break is reportedly so bitter that there is talk of Meghan and Harry spending a few years in Botswana to regroup.
Then there is the role that only a self-made actress would have the daring to invent for herself: feminist progressive duchess who writes inspirational mantras on bananas for sex workers and hugs -- hugs! -- well-wishers across metal barriers thick with metaphor.
And now, feminist progressive duchess, and mom. The new royal baby will be raised a feminist, as well as being the first royal to be skilled in yoga. The nursery at Frogmore cottage is reportedly, outrageously, "gender neutral." And the couple will not have a Norland nanny, traditional choice of the British aristocracy, who dresses like a depressed Mary Poppins. They are looking for an American nanny, showing that the duchess's "heart is still very much in her homeland of the U.S.," The Daily Mail lamented.
And yet, Meghan is not a radical. She is a monarchist. Her feminism has nothing to say about solidarity. It cannot. It is the feminism of the 1 percent, a unique woman with great power. It is Elizabeth II's feminism -- hell, it is Elizabeth I's feminism. Under these criteria, Harry is a feminist too for marrying her, which surely came as a great surprise to him.
As to quasi-progressive credentials, the couple is well matched. Harry is a hugger and a moonlight dancer whose public utterances, though likely heartfelt, are like ripples on a pond. Together they talk about a mental health crisis but not its causes; about environmental catastrophe but not its causes; about the Grenfell Tower fire but not its causes. There is nothing on austerity, inequality or poverty. He wore a garland of flowers to announce scholarships to study climate change. She wrote a foreword to a cookbook from the Grenfell Tower community kitchen.
So you see, the duchess's critics have nothing to fear. In the 1970s Queen Elizabeth II was enticed to greet crowds by saying "hello." Previously she had ignored them. In 2019, hugging and other acts are welcome and even necessary as what is considered good manners changes. Meghan's style may be different from that of other members of the royal family, but she is still a monarchist.
Of us and yet above us; exalted and common. People thrill to the knowledge that Elizabeth II uses Tupperware and a two-bar electric fire in her palace, presumably while wearing the Imperial State Crown and National Health Service spectacles. Meghan's status as a feminist who supported women's suffrage in New Zealand a mere 125 years after it appeared is similarly disarming. And the enchantment grows until even I am fascinated by a woman who inspires the headline "Meghan Markle's Inspirational Banana Messages Slammed as Offensive by Sex Worker," and I am a republican.
The royal family has always gathered fresh power when it is useful. It will take George Clooney as a friend if it must. It will delight in Oprah and talk of gang violence, yoga and the shrinking habitat of the polar bear if that keeps it on the throne, and the new royal baby -- soon to be the object of his own commemorative china -- will gild the myth.
Why do you think you are reading about the Mountbatten-Windsors in this newspaper and on Instagram when the Romanovs, the Hohenzollerns and the Hapsburgs are all gone?

Susan Rice slams Trump foreign policy: ‘He and his party over our country’

Texto completo: Susan Rice panned President Trump’s foreign policy, saying he puts his best interests ahead of what is best for the country.
Rice, who served as President Barack Obama’s national security adviser from 2013 to 2017, called Trump’s foreign policy contradictory and self-serving in an op-ed for the New York Times on Monday.
“The unifying theme of Mr. Trump’s foreign policy is simply to service his domestic politics,” she said.
“Mr. Trump welcomes and encourages Russia, a hostile adversary, to interfere in our elections so long as the manipulations benefit him. He discards decades of bipartisan policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to curry favor with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and thus right-wing political support. The president follows a basic, if unorthodox, playbook: He and his party over our country,” Rice wrote.
Rice also cited the administration’s actions toward Cuba and Venezuela as more evidence, which she said are aimed only at “dishing up red meat to energize the Republican base.”
The Trump administration has walked back a deal allowing Cuban baseball players to play in the U.S. and imposed sanctions against the country that Rice said will drive the nation’s leaders closer to Russia and China. Though Rice credited Trump for backing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, she questioned the president’s motives. She said if Trump truly wanted to help Venezuelans he would grant those already in the U.S. temporary protected status, but that would anger anti-immigrant voters.
“Plenty of presidents before Mr. Trump have made serious, sometimes catastrophic foreign policy mistakes; but, few, if any, decided almost every aspect of foreign policy on the basis of what would help him get re-elected,” she wrote.

Amid scrutiny over 737 Max, Boeing to replace 900 inspectors. And union is not happy

Texto completo: Boeing is pushing ahead on a plan to cut about 900 inspectors, replacing their jobs with technology improvements at its Seattle area factories, despite being under fire for software flaws in the 737 Max and quality issues in its other aircraft.
The union has raised an outcry, calling it a "bad decision" that will "eliminate the second set of eyes on thousands of work packages" in its newsletter to members.
Some 451 inspectors will be transferred to other jobs this year, and about the same number next year, out of a total of about 3,000 at its commercial aircraft operations in the Seattle area, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local 751, has told its members.
Boeing, which confirms the plan but won't disclose the number of workers involved, said the changes will result in better quality overall.
The aerospace giant is still facing fallout from the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners – a Lion Air flight in October, killing all 189 aboard, and an Ethiopian Airlines jet in March, which claimed 157 lives.
An automated system designed to make the Max feel like previous generations of the 737 by holding down the plane's nose appears to have factored in both crashes. The jet has been grounded worldwide while Boeing rewrites and certifies the software that runs the system. Boeing has estimated the debacle will cost it at least $1 billion.
More: Southwest Airlines says Boeing didn't disclose it had deactivated safety alert on 737 Max jets
Damage to Boeing's reputation could be even worse and it hasn't been limited to the Max. The New York Times published an exposé last month that alleged shoddy work and weak oversight at Boeing's plant in South Carolina, which makes the 787 jetliner. The Air Force has twice halted deliveries of the KC-46 midair refueling tanker, based on the 767 airliner, after finding manufacturing debris onboard.
But when it comes to paring its inspection staff on the West Coast, Boeing says the "QA Transformation Plan" won't undermine safety. Substituting technology gains, it says, will increase quality and effect only "stable" procedures, those in which there is a low probability of mistakes.
For instance, Boeing says when it is bringing out a new aircraft with wings made out of composites, there is equipment now that can do the inspections more thoroughly than humans. Once the inspection equipment has verified that it can do the job – with humans overseeing the process – traditional inspectors can be redeployed to other tasks.
"As we identify and reduce second-layer inspections for stable processes, quality assurance professionals will be redeployed and take on new roles such as leading and supporting efforts to prevent defects and rework," Boeing said in a statement. It adds that it is working to try to convince regulators and others that the changes "will not jeopardize our quality, but will, in fact, lead to higher levels. "
So far, the Federal Aviation Administration hasn't given the plan a ringing endorsement.
"Our enhanced oversight on this is still underway," FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said.
And skeptics are emerging.
Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate who lost a niece when the Ethiopian Airlines jet crashed and who believes the 737 Max design is fatally flawed, is leery of substituting machines for people when it comes to quality.

"They still haven't learned the lesson that risky automation does not replicate experienced human intelligence," he said. "There is no comparison. There is all kinds of human intuition that can't be translated into computer code. "
But Ernesto Gonzalez-Beltran, Boeing's vice president of quality in the commercial aircraft division, said the QA Transformation Plan is a multi-step approach that identifies problems and uses digital tools to help solve them.
Previously, for instance, an inspector used to have to stamp a document ensuring that a particular worker is allowed to perform a function. Now the system cuts out that step, saving time and boosting efficiency by using a computer that can check workers by their employee number to validate they are authorized for a task.
Boeing samples for defects. When a process becomes defect-free – rows of perfectly drilled holes, for example – sampling is reduced, Gonzalez-Beltran said.
There are some inspections on critical items and procedures that will always remain, said Gonzalez-Beltran, and about one element he is adamant: "We will not stop any inspections involving safety of flight. "
Some aerospace industry observers think Boeing could be on the right track.
"It is possibly true what Boeing is saying," said Todd Curtis of aviation safety site AirSafe. com, who used to work for Boeing. "Technology, in many cases, can do a better job. "
He noted, however, that no matter what kind of technology is employed, it needs human oversight.
Neither the machinists union local nor national would comment directly for this story. Instead, the national IAM would only forward the January and April issues of Local 751's newsletter, the Aero Mechanic, which included the union's position and details of meetings in which it said members packed the halls out of concern about would happen if the changes were implemented.
Local 751 President Jon Holden did not respond to calls or emails requesting comment, but in the April newsletter, he wrote a column in which said the union struck a deal with the company to allow its members to have access to data that can point to problem areas for defects and request inspections be reinstated.
The rollback in inspections will mean "defects will simply be pushed down the line and when discovered, they will result in rework that is more costly and cumbersome to perform," he wrote.
He said the union was trying to arrange a meeting with the FAA in order to present examples that show why the plan is flawed. He did not say, however, that the plan could lead to defective planes leaving the assembly line.
And that, said Gonzalez-Beltran, is the bottom line.
"The priorities are very obvious," he said. "That's the safety and quality of our products. We don't mess with that. "

Texto completo: A husband and wife dissect their marriage in a bar in "State of the Union." And a new HBO mini-series dramatizes the Chernobyl disaster.
What's on TV
STATE OF THE UNION 10 p.m. on Sundance TV (just before "The Breakfast Club"); stream on Sundance Now. The whole first season of this new series, about a couple trying to save their crumbling marriage, is about as long as one episode of "Game of Thrones." The bite-size episodes are roughly 10 minutes, and they all take place in the same pub in London where Louise (Rosamund Pike) and Tom (Chris O'Dowd) meet before their weekly marriage counseling sessions. They go over talking points and make sense of why they need to see a therapist in the first place. (He says it's because she had an affair. She says it's more complicated than that.) We never see them in the therapist's office; the show instead relies on their humorous back and forth. Inevitably, there's lots of dialogue, but that also makes the minutes fly by.
E! LIVE FROM THE RED CARPET 5 p.m. on E! A-list models, stars and designers descend on the Metropolitan Museum of Art for its annual fund-raising gala, which represents the opening of the Costume Institute's spring exhibition and is considered fashion's biggest night of the year. The theme of the 2019 show is "Camp: Notes on Fashion" (inspired by a Susan Sontag essay from 1964). Attendees translate that concept into dazzling costumes.
THE RESIDENT 8 p.m. on Fox. The second season of this medical drama (more along the lines of "Grey's Anatomy" than "The Good Doctor") comes to a close. Faced with financial woes, Bell (Bruce Greenwood) considers selling the hospital to a conglomerate. Meanwhile, Nic (Emily VanCamp) finds Kyle (Corbin Bernsen) and urges him to donate a kidney to her sister Jessie (Julianna Guill).
CHERNOBYL 9 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster gets a dramatic retelling in this new mini-series. It begins with a suicide in 1988, then jumps back to the night of the explosion. What ensues is a messy story of Soviet scientists (played by Jared Harris and Emily Watson) desperately trying to find the cause of the blast and convincing politicians of its devastating consequences. In his review for The New York Times, Mike Hale wrote that the show imposes "a simple narrative on history, the twisting of events to create one-dimensional heroes and villains, the broad-brush symbolism."
What's Streaming
ABYSS Stream on Netflix. What if our appearances were based on our morality? That's the premise of this amusing, albeit superficial, South Korean fantasy series: After Go Se-yeon (Park Bo-young), a jaw-droppingly attractive prosecutor, and Cha Min (Ahn Hyo-seop), a humble businessman, die, they come back to life with the help of a marble called abyss. But they've been given new bodies based on how good their spirits were: Go Se-yeon is revived as a plain Jane, while Cha Min looks like a member of the next K-pop sensation.

Borders: rhetoric vs. reality

Texto completo: In the decade prior to World War II, the organization that claimed the international mantle of virtue, The League of Nations, was plainly aware of, yet studiously ignored, the facts of Germany’s re-armament in violation of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles (ending World War I).
Winston Churchill warned in the 1930s of what was the then a prevalent form of political-correctness, an ignorant opposition to patriotism or national loyalty — both in academia and high office: “In this dark time the basest sentiments received acceptance or passed unchallenged by the responsible leaders of the political parties.”
Luckily he never experienced Facebook, BBC or the New York Times of today.
The lesson that should have been learned then, and is very relevant in today’s politically-correct- instant-media-outrage world is that when you pretend a real threat is non-existent, the whole country – and even the whole world — will pay a very high price sooner rather than later.
Likewise, the same is true today when a non-existent threat is claimed to be universal and pervasive.
Currently a tactic being utilized to prevent or suppress discussion of some very real threats to stability in America is simply an orchestrated smear campaign against those who raise the factual aspects of these problems.
The easiest, and most often dishonest, smear is to call a person or organization “racist,” “islamophobic,” “sexist,” “white privileged,” and etc. This is the rhetorical currency of the radical left that has infatuated the media and readers/viewers so inclined to believe them. Claiming something is “fear-mongering” is another way to appear to make an opinion less credible.
The abusers of our language now gleefully co-opt any term possible to convey an aura of outright evil on any opponent; sometimes subtle, sometimes not. If a portion of a comment can be taken out of context, edited or twisted to suit the malevolent purposes of the smear artist, it is then done enthusiastically.
Think hoaxer Jussie Smollet, or the serial liar/lawyer Michael Avenatti, both used complicit media attention to make claims of outright evil behavior against implied political opponents. This is not new to human behavior, but currently has become a very toxic go-to method for liberals/leftists and their allies.
In 1710, Jonathan Swift wrote “Besides, as the vilest writer has his readers, so the greatest liar has his believers; and it often happens, that if a lie be believ’d only an hour, it has done its work… .”
Swift would be horrified how effective Twitter has become at exactly this tactic.
A very good example of this of late is the false argument made regarding “border security” being a contrived “crisis” that is somehow being manufactured by President Trump as a divisive campaign issue. This canard has been repeated enough times by “journalists” that it deserves its own zip code.
It is beyond dishonest to suggest this issue is one to be solved with “better policy.” Just as in the 1930s, “better policy” ignores the evil behind the intentional coordinated efforts being made to drive tens of thousands of people to breach our border.
To cast this as a “moral imperative” is equally dishonest. Do you have locks on your car door, house or office?
Why?
Because the rule of law, which is the foundation of our representative republic, says you have the right to secure your property. How hypocritical is it then to suggest the nation itself not be allowed to control its borders by whatever means is required?
Who is really behind the caravans that are supposedly spontaneously occurring groups in the thousands, which are invading the Southern border region of America? Make no mistake, it is an invasion, and yes it is highly planned and orchestrated. You cannot move thousands of people, willing or not, over thousands of miles through several countries in Central America without a lot of money and organized effort behind it.
As far back as 2013 this exact aspect was identified as horrifying by a federal judge in U.S. v. Nava-Martinez.
For those who are willing to have their pre-conceived notions of the caravans ruined, watch the interview with documentary filmmaker Ami Horowitz.
One of the groups highly involved in organizing and publicizing these caravans of supposed “asylum seekers” is Pueblos Sin Frontera (“Peoples without Borders”). PSF’s primary activist, Rodrigo Abeja, has spearheaded these efforts for years, so this is not new.
Their goal is to undermine U.S. sovereignty by mobbing the southern border repeatedly, which is a leftist tactic developed by 1960s radicals Cloward and Piven. If the ensuing chaos results in grave political damage and economic depletion to America, the organizers and funders have achieved part of their goals. The Cloward-Piven strategy called for overloading the U.S. welfare system to promote economic and systemic collapse and crisis. What is being forced onto the Southern border region is exactly that tactic.
Are these coordinated efforts humanitarian and moral issues?
Do not kid yourself.
The drug cartels and human traffickers consider this staged distraction a bonus for their evil businesses. Neither they nor the leftists organizing these mobs care about who will be hurt or pay the price (social, cultural and economic), for this invasion.
The preposterous assertion that our immigration system is not “fair” because we do not allow unregulated migration from anywhere to the U.S. is an insult to the tens of millions of people who (my grandfather included) waited years in line overseas in order to immigrate to America legally.

What does the man of 10,000 lies lie about? Pretty much everything.

Texto completo: It sets an extraordinary precedent, yes, for a news organization to brand a president a liar. But these are extraordinary times and a liar, brazen and inveterate, is precisely what Trump is.
"The first thing we do, let's kill all the referees."
Admittedly, that is not quite how the famous line from Shakespeare's "Henry VI" goes. As you may recall, it was actually the lawyers whose demise was proposed.
But though no one is known to have uttered the words above, they still neatly encompass the strategy conservatives have long used against the so-called "liberal media." Namely, undermine them - and thus, their ability to act as arbiters of truth - with relentless attacks on their credibility.
No less an authority than conservative pundit Charlie Sykes admitted as much in a 2016 interview with journalist Oliver Darcy. "We've basically eliminated any of the referees, the gatekeepers," he said of himself and his conservative colleagues.
Sykes spoke during the 2016 campaign when people were still stunned at the barrage of untruths spewing from the Republican candidate.
"We've created this monster," said Sykes, adding that, "At a certain point, you wake up and you realize you have destroyed the credibility of any credible news outlet out there. And I am feeling, to a certain extent, that we are reaping the whirlwind at that."
In related news, Donald Trump told the 10,000th lie of his presidency Friday. This, according to The Washington Post, which maintains a database of all the times Trump has exaggerated, distorted or misled.
Ten thousand.
Feels like there ought to be a statue or something. And what does Trump lie about? Pretty much everything.
He lies about the border wall, claiming it is now being built. It isn't.
He lies about his tax cut, claiming it was the biggest in history. It wasn't.
He lies about the Mueller report, claiming it exonerates him. It doesn't.
Indeed, the very same weekend he notched his dubious milestone, Trump told a particularly gruesome whopper about supposed legislation empowering a new mother and her doctor to "determine whether or not they will execute the baby."
And how did The New York Times respond to this flaming canard? It called it "inaccurate," which raised something of a stink on Twitter. That's not surprising. Calling that hogwash "inaccurate" is like saying the Titanic was "delayed."
The Times is not alone; most news organizations have resisted calling Trump's lies lies.
Their reasoning, it must be conceded, is thoughtful. After all, to call something a lie is to impose judgment. Sometimes, when people are incorrect it's not a lie, only a mistake.
But 10,000 times in a little over two years? How gullible must you be to believe someone could be that wrong that often by accident? If any other man told you half that many untruths, you'd call him a liar. You wouldn't hesitate. Yet here, we do.
It sets an extraordinary precedent, yes, for a news organization to brand a president a liar. But these are extraordinary times and a liar, brazen and inveterate, is precisely what Trump is. In their refusal to call him that, in their insistence upon giving him the benefit of nonexistent doubt, news media compromise their prime directive, which is to present a picture of the world as it is.
That's something we can ill afford with the very idea of truth under attack and the need for news media to do their jobs arguably more critical than ever.
This is a time for forthrightness, yet too often journalists are anything but, from coverage of race, to climate change to this, as the newspaper of record dubs a grotesque lie merely "inaccurate."
It makes you wonder if all the effort conservatives put into neutering the referees was not a waste of time.
Seems the referees have done a fair job of neutering themselves.

Texto completo: In her debut book, writer Casey Cep takes on the almost unbelievable 1970s crime story of an Alabama man who dubbed himself "The Reverend" and went on to commit a spree of murders so outrageous that he would meet a shocking end to his own life – and his offenses would bring Pulitzer Prize-winning author Harper Lee to a decision to write her own account of his crimes.
And although the celebrated author of "To Kill a Mockingbird" spent years dedicated to researching the story of "The Reverend" Willie Maxwell, Lee would never finish the book.
In "Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee," Cep chronicles the dual stories of Maxwell's crimes with Lee's unsuccessful attempt to complete her own narrative of those events, despite her obvious gift for journalism.
A Maryland native, Cep is a graduate of Harvard University and studied as a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford. Her work has appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times and The New Republic, among others.
What drew you to this unique story in "Furious Hours" and to write it as not only a chronicle of "the Reverend" and his crimes, but an inner glimpse into the life of Harper Lee?
I first learned of these murders while reporting on Lee's novel "Go Set a Watchman," so in some ways my book was always going to include her. The more I learned, though, the clearer it became that she wasn't just a coda to the story, but an integral part of it. Her own reporting had been substantial, so I wanted to honor that, but I also thought her struggles provided a useful way of thinking about the aesthetic and ethical challenges that any journalist faces when trying to write about other people's lives, especially with true crime.
Lee, who grew up known by her first name, Nelle, has said that she never felt like she fit in during her school years. Why was that?
Right, Nelle is Ellen backward, which her parents chose to honor her maternal grandmother. Stories about Lee as a young girl map onto her beloved heroine, so if you think about how Maycomb reacted to Scout Finch, then you get a sense of how Monroeville reacted to her: no one knew quite what to do with the clever tomboy who wore overalls and liked playing with the boys. Even when she went off to college, Lee stood out: quoting obscure English poets, wearing blue jeans, smoking, and swearing with gusto. From her letters, though, we know it was a bit of a two-way street: she was odd, but not an outcast; her distance from her peers was as much her own doing as theirs.
Lee longed to be a writer and envied her contemporaries whose personalities allowed them to blossom and share their talents, but there were times she found herself unable to write because she was between "perfectionism and despair." How did this affect her writing?
I think perfectionism can make it hard to finish something and despair can make it hard to start, so if you are a writer who seesaws between the two, it can be paralyzing. Lee could spend an entire day on a single page but also impulsively toss out whole manuscripts, and because she valorized suffering as necessary for artistry, her struggles were self-reinforcing.
But she wasn't like that when she wasn't trying to write, and I found it moving when her friends would share memories of how charming she was, and how raucously funny she could be. Harper Lee would hold court with stories about her neighbors in Monroeville and her neighborhood in Manhattan that were like something out of Chaucer or Dickens, and you just wish she could've written them down as easily as she told them around the dinner table.
As Lee took an interest in the massive story of "the Reverend" and decided to write a book about it, it turned out that she was a keen investigative reporter, a task she obviously loved and was good at. It seems that she felt a sense of energy and pride as she worked on this crime story – but the book was never completed. Why?
You're right that she was an incredible reporter. People she interviewed in Kansas while helping Truman Capote with "In Cold Blood" and people she interviewed in Alabama while working on "The Reverend" say she was the most interesting, inquisitive person they ever met.
She could put any source at ease, and she had the kind of patience it takes to get people to tell you their secrets. She was energized by the social aspects of reporting, but of course the hard part about writing a book is that at some point you have to actually write it, and she really struggled with that solitary work. She was also living in the shadow of her own bestselling, prize-winning masterpiece, so on top of everything else, she was facing sky-high expectations, from herself and from the world.
Your research for "Furious Hours" is impressive, as you give readers an inside look into decades-old crimes and their outcomes as well as information about Lee that many have never heard. How did you approach the research and organization of this book?
Early on, I did what I always do when I'm starting something new: I read everything I could get my hands on. Not just about Harper Lee, but also voodoo, murder, the insanity defense, sharecropping, dams, revivals, insurance fraud, courthouses, and on and on and on. After that, I started tracking down leads about the original crimes, and then doing the same thing for Lee. I always knew the structure – the Reverend, the Lawyer, and the Writer – so I would just file what I found into folders and then organize the folders, and every day I'd hope to find some new document or convince someone new to talk with me. But at some point, you have to accept that some things are lost to time and some people just won't talk with you, so you say a prayer, and start writing.
You say in the book that Lee "was so elusive that even her mysteries have mysteries." Please explain.
I wrote that line when I was particularly struck by the incongruity between the tremendous interest in Lee and the paucity of information about her. She was always private, and she remained that way despite having written one of the world's most popular novels. After years of reporting, and even getting to interview some of those who knew her best, there was still just so much more I wanted to know. I realize that everyone's inner lives are somewhat mysterious – even those closest to us, like our siblings or our parents – so of course the mind and heart of an artist like Harper Lee will always remain a little elusive.

Casey Cep will sign copies of "Furious Hours" at 5 p.m. May 13 at Lemuria Books in Jackson.

Texto completo: ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand unveiled a plan Wednesday to provide each voter a credit of up to $600 to donate to federal political candidates of their choice in their state.
Gillibrand, a Democratic presidential candidate from New York, said her "Democracy Dollars" program is aimed at getting big money out of politics by making politicians less reliant on wealthy donors.
If enacted, Gillibrand's plan — which is based in part on a program in Seattle — would allow voters to request a credit of up to $200 each for House, Senate and presidential race, with the money equally split between primaries and general elections.
Politicians would only be eligible for the contributions if they voluntarily limit themselves to maximum individual donations of more than $200, well under current federal contribution limits.
"My Clean Elections plan is a critical structural change that gets big money and special interests out of politics, and ensures that elected officials in Washington are beholden only to the people who sent them there," Gillibrand said in a statement.
Trying to gain traction in 2020 race Gillibrand's plan comes as she struggles to gain traction in the 2020 presidential race.
Public-opinion polls, including a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday, have put her near the bottom of the crowded Democratic primary race.
And she has not yet surpassed the 65,000 individual donors needed to qualify for Democratic debates, though she will likely qualified based on her having at least 1 percent support in more than three polls, according to The New York Times.
The first Democratic debates are scheduled for June 26 and 27.
Gillibrand's election plan calls for allowing voters to spend their credit in $10 increments.
She told NBC News the credit could only be used in a voter's home state, though they would be able to spend it on House races in their state but outside their home district.
"It will change who has a seat at the table and who gets elected in this country within one election cycle," Gillibrand told NBC.
Gillibrand was first appointed New York's junior senator in 2009 after former Sen. Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.

HORSE RACING NEEDS TO BE MUCH SAFER AFTER HARD WINTER, A TROUBLE-FREE SATURDAY IS MUST

Texto completo: LOUISVILLE, Ky.
Most mornings, the Kentucky Derby happy talk has been the happiest it has been in years:
* After proving that the Triple Crown had not gone the way of the rotary phone, Bob Baffert is back for more. He'll come to Churchill Downs Saturday with not one, not two, but three precocious horses capable of making Baffert the first trainer in more than 60 years to win six Derbies.
* Hardboots still melt at the sound of "My Ol' Kentucky Home."
* Jockey Mike Smith wants his third Derby winner. Shug McGaughey is determined to train his second. You'll hear Hall of Famers like Bill Mott and Steve Asmussen squeal like toddlers if they win their first.
* The Churchill Downs grandstand gets taller, wider and fancier. The best tickets fetch premium prices. The red carpet has TMZ hyperventilating.
* Sources say New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and his posse are primed to enjoy the Derby as much as they enjoy beating the Steelers.
Have I forgotten anything about the mile-and-a-quarter race that will crackle over the Churchill racing surface late Saturday afternoon?
Just this: Racing needs a clean, competitive and injury-free day. No breakdowns. No spills. No euthanized horses.
Derby 145 has already lost two horses, including the likely favorite, Omaha Beach, with injuries. The last thing it needs is an ugly visual on international television.
The sport won't be holding its breath for two minutes and change. It will be holding its breath all weekend.
"It's been fun this week," Baffert said. "It's been fun being out at the barn every morning and seeing all the people who love to come out and watch the horses. It's been a relief to be out of [Santa Anita]."
Santa Anita and horse racing suffered this spring. In just over three months, 23 horses died at the southern California track that is the home to talented horsemen such as Baffert, Richard Mandella and Doug O'Neill. Four horses died during the 16-day spring meet in Keeneland.
Concern from animal rights groups percolated into political pressure that was also stirred by casual fans asking why so many horses died. The discussion escalated from a debate about the ethics of whipping horses and administering medication that masks pain.
The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and Sports Illustrated all opened Derby Week by reporting detailed stories on the complex challenges horse racing faces as it tries to protect its spot in the sports entertainment world.
The headline in the New York Times was particularly stinging:
"Horse Deaths Are Threatening the Racing Industry; Is the Sport Obsolete?"
Obsolete?
Obsolete is a harsh word, one that critics have pinned on boxing. It's a word and story that inspired its share of bristles on the Churchill backside this week.
"I think we're all concerned, we're all trying to improve and we're all trying to make it a safer sport," trainer Todd Pletcher said.
"But, you know, the one thing is when you have Bucket List events like the Kentucky Derby, I think we'll always be OK."
OK? Maybe.
But racing should aspire to be greater than OK. The debate about horse safety has been as overdue in racing as the concussion discussion was in football.
The culture moves. Racing can't pretend it doesn't. A lack of marketing imagination and decisive leadership over the past four decades pushed the game into the niche sport role where it exists today. It can't risk not paying attention to what critics are saying today.
When I covered my first Kentucky Derby 1979, it was a Must Cover event for sportswriting titans like Red Smith, Jim Murray, Furman Bisher, Blackie Sherrod and Dave Kindred. It slipped from Must Cover status many years ago.
What the culture is telling racing today is the game must reexamine its policies on medication, especially on race day, while continuing research on the safest possible racing surfaces. At Santa Anita, Baffert and others argued the issue was excessive rainfall that made the racing surface too hard. Regardless, too many horses died.
"I've never seen so many trainers depressed and beaten down," Baffert said. "We were just waiting and wondering. We didn't know what our future was going to be. Are we going to have jobs? What's going to happen?"
A day like Saturday can be a reminder of the sights, sounds and smells that make horse racing such a glorious sport. It is a sport of hard-working earnest people as well as determined animals, a sport for the multi-million dollar owner as well as the $2 bettor and a sport that will inspire 170,000 people to scream their lungs out as the Derby field thunders into the stretch.
But it is also a sport that needs to be the safest it can be, especially Saturday with the sporting world watching.

Texto completo: The Russians are coming, the Russians are coming
This is in response to Tom Zirpoli's recent column “A shifting story of Russian help during the presidential campaign.” Zirpoli said “Trump is conflicted” and “the evidence is overwhelming” that Russia helped him win the White House. This is liberal fantasy.
Did Zirpoli take 22 months, to interview 500 witness, review over a million e-mails/documents, issue 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants and gather information from 13 foreign governments? No. But, Robert Mueller and his partisan Democratic attorneys did. Mueller, Andrew Weissmann (attended Hillary's 2016 election night party), Jeannie Rhee (Hillary's attorney) and other biased attorneys launched an investigation in search of a crime, and even they found no evidence that Trump, or anyone in his campaign, colluded/conspired with Russia.
Since the Cold War, Russia has attempted to interfere (sow discourse) in our elections and in 2016 the Democrats made sure they succeeded. The problem with Zirpoli and the Democrats is they refuse to provide an impartial analysis of Russia's attempted interference, without their hyper-partisan, wishful thinking to implicate President Trump.
For over two years Democrats Adam Schiff (head of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence), Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Eric Swalwell, etc., all said they have evidence that Trump colluded with Russia. Obama's senior appointees at the DOJ/ FBI/CIA and their servile, self-righteous, mainstream media hacks at ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, New York Times and some local talent picked up their lies and hysterically yelled and screamed Collusion, Collusion, Collusion. They all lied to the American public for two years. That's two years of fake news.
Look at facts instead of opinions, innuendos and wishful thinking. Did Trump pay $168,000 to Perkins Cole and Fusion GPS to obtain the fake Russian (Steele) dossier with dirt on his political opponent? No, Hillary and the DNC did. In 2016, did Trump pay Perkins Cole $800,000 for legal services? No, the Obama campaign did. Did Trump delete thousands of emails/documents and destroy hardware despite a congressional subpoena to preserve them? No, Hillary did. Did the FBI investigate Hillary? No, Loretta Lynch met Bill on the tarmac, told Comey it's a “matter” and Comey contorted the law to exonerate her before she was interviewed. Did Trump have allies in the DOJ/FBI/CIA? No, Hillary did. Did the FBI spy on the Hillary campaign? No, they spied on the Trump campaign.

Endorsing Kate Carter for Westminster Council
I am writing to endorse Kate Carter as a candidate for the City Council of Westminster. I have known Kate and her family for 40 years. I have watched Kate grow into a very bright, articulate, and responsible young woman. She grew up in Carroll County and attended Carroll County Public Schools. She and her husband, Tom, chose to purchase a home in the city of Westminster and have become very involved in their neighborhood and community.
Kate has made a commitment to be involved in the political life of Westminster by attending city council meetings. She also was previously a member of the Westminster Public Safety Advisory Council. She has done so in an effort to make the city a safe place that is welcoming to young families and that is a place that is focused on continuing healthy economic development so that young families have the opportunity to stay and work in Westminster.
I have known Kate to have a strong worth ethic and to be very goal-oriented in her personal life. She also works in the field of information technology, which is a valuable asset for any business and community leader. I feel confident that these same qualities will transfer to make Kate Carter an excellent member of the Westminster City Council.

Why can’t US do what New Zealand did?
In New Zealand, 50 people were massacred at worship. Within 30 days, automatic weapons were outlawed in that country.
In the United States, dozens of people have been killed in mass murders over the past 20 years and absolutely nothing has been done to stop it.
Shame on the United States of America!

Texto completo: On Tuesday past, Jason Rosenthal, the husband referenced in the March 3, 2017, New York Times Modern Love article, "You May Want to Marry My Husband," spoke to nearly 200 people at the Goodwood Museum Carriage House. His compelling story, told with such passion and beauty, left us all thinking about important life matters.
At dinner afterwards and on a morning walk the next day, Jason made the same assessment of our community. "It is beautiful the way you people take care of each other," he said with a bit of wonderment.
He had heard from my husband, Bruce, who picked him up at the airport, about his work as a volunteer with AmeriCorps through Big Bend Hospice. He had heard from me about the Tallahassee Area Threshold Choir singing to my mother in her dying days. He had felt the helpfulness of the Midtown Reader crew who had ordered not only his book for sale, but other popular titles by his late wife, Amy.
He saw the helpful crew of volunteers from Big Bend Hospice and the Community Advance Care Planning Encouragement Task Force assisting in the setup at Goodwood. And then he met you, the people of our community, who made a very positive impression on his spirit. He began his presentation with a short movie by his wife on kindness. It was what he felt in his interactions with you.
We took our walk at the Fred George Greenway, a beautiful, but rustic place to walk. He, a Chicago attorney, and I, a person with absolutely no navigational instincts, really did not know which of the apparent paths to take. A lovely woman named Mary was stretching after her walk. When I asked her which path, she said let me show you the options. Her kindness was icing on the cake for Jason and for me. We do live in a community that cares about each other.
I am so grateful for the care I have received in the past few weeks since my mother's death. Many of you have sent cards with lovely messages of encouragement and hope. One that touched me deeply said, "The very one who rocked you in the beginning needed you most in the end." It was so true and I am so grateful for the caring of many in our community to help me support my mother until the end and now to help me grieve her death.
This week in the faith community, our Jewish brothers and sisters have observed Yom HaShoah. HaShoah is a Hebrew word for catastrophe or utter destruction.
Since 1953 when the observance was established in Israel, persons of the Jewish faith have set aside this day to reflect on what was done to their people, approximately 6 million of them, in the Holocaust, a Greek word for sacrifice by fire. This day is not the United Nations' organized Holocaust Remembrance Day that is held on Jan. 27, worldwide, but a day of reflection within the Jewish faith community.
It grieves my spirit that this year there is more hatred and acts of violence toward Jews across the world than we have seen since we first started documenting anti-Semitism. I think of the ways we need to exercise our caring spirit that is evident to Jason, a stranger coming to our community for the first time, as we support our Jewish neighbors and look for ways to take care of those who are experiencing hate at record levels.
We join our voices with theirs saying, "Never again."
Our Muslim friends in this community and around the world begin Ramadan on Monday, May 6.
One of the five pillars of Islam, Ramadan involves a month of fasting from food and drink during the sunlight hours. Muslims focus instead on self-discipline, gratitude, and compassion during this their most holy month of the year. They come to this sacred time this year with increasing concern over growing hatred toward Muslims worldwide.
Again our community can demonstrate our characteristic caring spirit to the Muslims in our midst.
I felt so proud to hear Jason's observation that we are a caring community and couldn't agree more. May we continue to find ways to take care of each other with all of our differences and our common core of human kindness. Jason's wife Amy said it is fundamental. I agree.
The Rev. Candace McKibben is an ordained minister who serves as the director of faith outreach at Big Bend Hospice and as pastor of Tallahassee Fellowship.

She Had All the Pieces. Why Didn't She Finish?

Texto completo: There are two intertwined mysteries at the heart of "Furious Hours," Casey Cep's meticulously researched narrative about an Alabama preacher accused of multiple murders, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist who tried and failed to tell his story.
The first section of the book, a spellbinding true crime story, follows the Rev. Willie Maxwell, who allegedly killed five family members for insurance money in the 1970s. In a stranger-than-fiction twist, Maxwell himself was killed in 1977, shot at a funeral ceremony for one of his alleged victims by one of her grieving relatives.
But the other mystery proved even knottier. It involved reconstructing years of investigative work done by Harper Lee, who was fascinated by the Maxwell murders and worked on a true crime book about the case that she titled "The Reverend." To this day, it remains unclear how much she wrote, why she stopped writing or whether she finished the book.
Cep first learned about the existence of "The Reverend" in 2015, when the literary world was stunned by the news that Lee was publishing another novel, titled "Go Set a Watchman." When Cep went to Alabama to report on the circumstances surrounding the new book, she learned about another old Harper Lee project that hardly anyone was talking about -- a rumored masterpiece of true crime that people close to Lee said rivaled Capote's "In Cold Blood" (which Lee famously helped to research but received little credit for).
Cep may not have fully solved the cases, but she collected enough clues and vivid details to tell a captivating story. Below is an edited transcript of a recent interview with Cep about how she retraced Harper Lee's steps.
Q. Which was the harder mystery to unravel, the story behind the alleged murders, or what happened to Harper Lee's unfinished manuscript?
A. I'm not sure I solved either of them. But I hope I've given people all the evidence that I can for readers to draw their own conclusions about everything, from did the Reverend do it to how did he do it if he did it, and what did Harper Lee write, what didn't she write or why couldn't she write?
What was the most challenging thing about taking Lee on as a subject?
There's a tremendous amount of her inner life that remains enigmatic even to those who knew her best. She just was exceedingly private. It was not even just a public-facing privacy; it was even with people who knew her well, and I think in some of those core instances, she was inscrutable even to herself.
The thing that was surprising to me in your book was how confident and how committed to the material she seemed to be. Why do you think she abandoned it, or never tried to publish it?
It is the big mystery of what became of Harper Lee, and this is one iteration of it. I think for a lot of readers, it's unsatisfying because I don't put my thumb on the scale. I think a different writer would have made a guess. It's something I really think Harper Lee would appreciate about the book, the degree to which I tried to be scrupulous.
But if you had to make a guess ...
I am an optimist in general, and I'm an optimist about Harper Lee. She was an extraordinary writer and thinker, and there's a way in which she had everything going for her with this book. Look, I did it, so of course she could have, and probably did, and there's probably no one more excited to read whatever exists of "The Reverend" than me. I'm pretty sanguine. I think there's potential for her to have written the whole thing. People who lived around her on the Upper East Side heard the typewriter at all hours of the day and night.
And by your account, she gathered an incredible amount of material.
It was clear she had a mind for the investigation. She had all the pieces. She should be able to write it, and then we have to sit with the question of, what happened?
Were you at all intimidated taking on a literary project that Lee had failed to complete?
I think "Mockingbird" is one of the most extraordinary novels in the English language, and the idea that the woman who wrote that couldn't do it doesn't bode well for the likes of Casey Cep. Imagine if you thought Harper Lee was going to tell your story, and then Casey Cep, this writer you've never heard of who's never written a book, she's not even from Alabama, I think for some of these people it was like, "We get you? We were supposed to get Harper Lee and we get you?"
I felt like there was one thing I could do which she was never going to do, which was talk about her. It's the story behind the story. She would never have included herself.
There's an amazing moment near the end of the book when you get this trove of documents about the Maxwell case that Maxwell's lawyer, Tom Radney, had given to Harper Lee. What were some other breakthrough moments in your reporting?
I had been told the court reporter from the murder trials was dead. At some point I realized I didn't know that for sure, and I was looking for women by that name, and it turned out she was alive and well. I go knock on the door, we get to talking about the Maxwell case and a couple of minutes into that conversation she goes, "Gosh, I haven't talked about this since I talked to Harper Lee."
Were there any questions that you tried really hard to answer that you were unable to crack?
Harper Lee smoked cigarettes like a chimney. You will notice that I do not name the brand of cigarettes she smoked in the book. She's shown holding them in some photographs but the pack is never visible. As much as I want to tell you I think they were Chesterfields, I could not say that with certainty. So I just tell you she smoked.
One gets the sense that you have a real affection for Harper Lee and yet you expose her demons, her heavy drinking, her insecurities, her disdain for her hometown. Was it difficult to draw out sources on those aspects of her life?
People were happy to finally get to talk about it, trusting that it would be represented in a responsible way and not a sensational way. A lot of people felt like they didn't want to embarrass her in her lifetime, but they wanted to let the world know that she struggled.
What do you think Harper Lee would have made of your effort to finish the story she never told?
People ask me sometimes, do I think she would like the book? I respect her enough to say, probably not. I don't think she would have approved of someone looking so seriously at her life. And yet I think that she valued the truth a great deal and would have admired the extent to which this is a book that tried to tell the truth.

Texto completo: Woody Allen shopped around a manuscript for his new memoir, but publishers didn't want anything to do with it.
A New York Times report detailed how executives at multiple publishing houses rejected Allen's memoir that he tried to sell late last year largely due to his increasing persona non grata status.
A-list actors, producers and publishers once flocked to Woody Allen projects, but the directing icon's reputation has suffered in the wake of the #MeToo movement. As greater attention has been paid to allegations of Allen molesting his daughter Dylan Farrow when she was 7, Hollywood has distanced itself from the auteur. Amazon has shelved his most recent film "A Rainy Day in New York" and several actors have either expressed regret over working with the director or vowed never to work with him again, including Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth, Ellen Page, Michael Caine and Timothee Chalamet.
According to the New York Times, some publishing executives described working with Allen as "toxic" in the #MeToo era.
In Europe, Allen's reputation is somewhat less tarnished, and he is in pre-production on a film with a Spanish producer.
Writer and longtime friend of Allen, Daphne Merkin, told the Times that Allen had been working on the memoir for a long time. "He's not one to set the record straight, but presumably, the memoir is his side of things," she said. "He's the kind of person who soldiers on, and someone whose work is his nutrient."

Surgery: Kelly Clarkson had her appendix removed the day after hosting the Billboard Music Awards on Wednesday night. The 37-year-old tweeted she "may or may not have broken down in tears after the show from pain." Despite the pain, Clarkson performed her new song, "Broken & Beautiful," and opened the awards show with a medley of some of the year's biggest hits. Clarkson tweeted she's "feeling awesome" "#TheShowMustGoOn."
Spin-ish: A spinoff of ABC's "black-ish" will focus on a young Rainbow Johnson growing up in the 1980s. ABC said "mixed-ish" will be narrated by Tracee Ellis Ross, who stars in "black-ish" as the adult character with the nickname of Bow. In the spinoff, Bow (Arica Himmel) and her mixed-ethnicity family face the dilemma of assimilation or staying "true to themselves," according to ABC.
Biebs has a secret: Justin Bieber got his start posting cover songs on YouTube and now he's working with the platform on a "top secret project." YouTube announced it is planning a project with the Grammy-winning Canadian pop star, set to premiere next year. No more details about the Bieber special were revealed.

Commentary: Will the BYU Honor Code protests make any difference? Probably.

Texto completo: It’s been nearly three weeks since hundreds of Brigham Young University students gathered on campus to protest aspects of the university’s Honor Code.
BYU students complained that under current rules, they can be punished severely for small infractions, there is little consistency in how the office handles cases, and there is a culture of quasi-McCarthyism in students reporting one another’s behavior.
Students can rat on another out for tiny things. For example, on the movement’s Instagram account, which as of Thursday had more than 37,000 followers, one woman said that a week before her wedding, her fiance helped her carry a heavy box to his car as she was moving out of her BYU student housing. He momentarily entered her bedroom to assist her — violating the university’s strict policy forbidding students from being in the bedrooms of anyone of the opposite sex — only to be filmed by her roommate, who submitted the footage to the Honor Code Office. (Reading this, I had to wonder: why did the female roommate not put down the freaking phone and actually HELP?)
The movement’s Instagram account and the April 12 protest attracted national media attention from The New York Times, NPR, The Associated Press and Newsweek, as well as Utah newspapers and television stations.
The BYU school year has now ended, and with it comes a question: Will the protests make any difference when everyone comes back to school in the fall?
If recent Mormon history is any indication, the answer is yes. And that could be a model for the rest of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
In spring 2016, the university came under fire for a provision of its Honor Code that did not exempt victims of rape from expulsion or other discipline if, for example, they were raped after drinking alcohol or being in the bedroom of a student of the opposite sex.
As a result, critics charged, many rapes went unreported on campus as victims were afraid that their own behavior would be scrutinized in what amounted to an Honor Code inquisition.
A few months and more than 92,000 petition signatures later, the university released a new set of guidelines about how sexual assault complaints would be handled in the future, adopting the recommendations suggested by a council convened for the purpose.
What happened in 2016 and 2017 was a normal, basically healthy process of institutional growth. Some people complained — loudly. Others listened to them, both inside and outside the institution itself. The institution began acknowledging the need for change and taking steps to address the problem.
It would be surprising if something similar does not happen at BYU in regard to the Honor Code — if not in the coming academic year, at least in the near future. It’s unlikely that the student protesters are going to get all of the reforms they’re seeking, but it’s also unlikely the university will try to pretend there aren’t serious problems with the Honor Code’s broad scope and haphazard implementation.
It’s striking how different this is from the way change happens in the contemporary Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a whole, which could stand to take a page from the BYU playbook (if such plagiarism were not a violation of the Honor Code, which it is, so don’t do it or I will have to report you).
In the church, there are many recent examples of grassroots agitation for change being either condemned or studiously ignored — before the church eventually and quietly makes the exact change that was being requested, apparently hoping that everyone will think it was an idea that originated at headquarters.
Consider the early 2013 “Let Women Pray” initiative that was recently discussed in an excellent “Radio West” episode about activism in the LDS Church.
Amber Choruby Whiteley, who helped to initiate the gentle push to have a woman pray in General Conference for the first time in Mormon history, says in the episode that she was pleased by the success of the initiative — a woman prayed for the first time at the April 2013 General Conference, just a few months after the campaign began — and somewhat puzzled that the church did not acknowledge the role of women in making it happen.
At no point did Latter-day Saint leaders ever thank the thousands of letter writers for bringing the matter to their attention or give them credit for urging them to pray about the idea. As Whiteley notes, it requires a pretty big leap of faith for us to believe that after more than 180 years of Mormon history in which no woman had ever prayed in conference, it was a pure coincidence that the first time it happened was immediately after a massive letter-writing campaign to address this very issue.
But that’s apparently what the church would like us to swallow. It stated at the time of the April 2013 General Conference that its lineup of participants had been established “many weeks” beforehand. It’s possible, certainly, but it doesn’t feel likely, given the timing.
I sat in an audience three years later when an official from the church’s public affairs department made a specific point in his speech of claiming that none of the church’s recent changes to make life a little better for women had, in fact, been instigated by women. Some people “inside and outside the church,” he said, had spent “a lot of time and a lot of blogging space” to give women credit for changes like women praying in General Conference or the inclusion of photos of female church leaders in the Conference Center in downtown Salt Lake City. His implication was that women’s advocacy was entirely irrelevant to creating change.
It was hard to hear this well-meaning man be so distinctly tone- deaf. He could not see that it was obvious to everyone in the room that women had a part in galvanizing at least some those changes — and that he made our leaders look like utter jerks by casting them as the kind of men who covertly steal women’s ideas and then take full credit for them. Not a good look.
But here is BYU, a church-owned university that is publicly modeling a better way. It’s far from perfect, but it is listening to students, having dialogues with them, and acknowledging that students have been partners in catalyzing past change. BYU has not always handled student dissent so productively, so this is a step forward.
And the sky has not yet fallen.

Texto completo: "The recession talk in late 2018 got way, way out of hand," New York Times economic reporter Neil Irwin tweeted a few days ago. Indeed it did. Irwin’s tweet came shortly after the government released figures showing the economy grew at a 3.2% annual rate in the first three months of this year. The number was good by anyone’s measure, significantly outpacing predictions. And it raised a question: What about all that recession talk of the last few months? What was going on?
Certainly, there were some economists who looked at various indicators — housing, energy, the international economy — and feared an economic slowdown was on the way. But in the popular conversation — the world of columnists and cable TV talkers — much of the economic chatter was really about President Donald Trump. A worsening economy, some said, would show how wrong the president’s policies have been and would be the worst possible news for his 2020 re-election bid. Now, though, the case is a bit harder to make, with 3.2% growth, plus low unemployment, plus — perhaps most important — wage increases that have not been seen in years.
Still, the presidential campaign is under way, and Democrats will try to portray — actually, they’ll have to portray — the president’s policies as an economic mess. The question is whether it will work. Republican strategists are of two minds. On one hand, some still bear the scars of the 1992 election, when Bill Clinton managed to convince voters that the economy, which was in the early stages of a recovery, was in desperate shape. The lesson: Creating a perception of the economy was more important than the economy itself.
On the other hand, some Republicans believe it will be difficult for any Democrat — Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, anyone — to talk down a healthy economy.
"We, of course, have no idea what the economy will be like in a year and a half," said strategist Curt Anderson in another email exchange. "But if it stays similar to how it is now, the Democrats will not be successful in talking it down."
While an economic downturn would obviously hurt Trump, Anderson sees the possibility of another dynamic entirely.
"When the economy is good, voters don’t say that the economy is their No. 1 issue," he explained. "We have several polls this year where the voters list the economy as their third- or fourth-most important issue ... Often voters will migrate to other issues when the economy is good."
In that rather ironic scenario, a good Trump economy could give voters the freedom to focus on things they don’t like about the president.
In any event, Trump’s job will be to convince voters not only that his economic policies are working, but that Democratic proposals — the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, tuition-free college and more — would destroy the economy that has gone well during the early Trump years.
So far, despite all the pessimistic talk, that’s not a hard argument to make. And if the indicators hold up, the president will hold a strong hand, whatever his real or perceived liabilities, in November 2020.

Texto completo: In their final show of the 2018-19 season themed "Ruptured Romances," The Collective Face Theatre Ensemble will stage Neil Simon's hilarious "Last of the Red Hot Lovers."
Throughout the season, Collective Face has challenged Savannah audiences with plays and musicals that skirt the proverbial edge, pushing patrons to expand their cultural taste.
"The thing was, to see what audiences like around this area," Artistic Director David I.L. Poole said. "To see if newer works, if more experimental works can entice audiences around here. Surprisingly, a lot of our shows were very well received in their content, in their social statements. Trying to get audiences - the next generation of theater audiences into the theater."
"Last of the Red Hot Lovers" debut on Broadway in 1969. Simon, who passed away in August of last year at 91, was a staple of the New York theater scene in the 1960s and '70s. His plays, according to the New York Times, racked up over 9,000 performances, a record rarely touched.
"This is the thing about Neil Simon - I've directed two plays in my career - his plays are deceptively simple," Poole said. "It seems you're going to walk into this cake-walk of a play and it's going to be funny, but really as a director and designer, I sit there and talk with the cast: Why this play, now? We always talk about that. But then also, what is it about this work that is challenging? How do we find the layers and nuances? He's able to write in different people's voices. We start to identify with these characters."
Afraid he is missing out on the sexual revolution of the time, seafood restaurant owner Barney Cashman (Les Taylor), a gentle soul, decides it's time to have an affair. The play is essentially divided into three acts with Cashman attempting to explore with three different women, but finding it much harder than he anticipated.
Elaine Navazio (April S. Hayes) is a sexpot who proves to be a foul-mouthed bundle of neuroses. Bobbi Michele (Kelley Gray) is next, an actress who's too kooky by half. Finally comes Jeanette Fisher (Julie Kessler Sukman), a gloomy, depressed housewife who happens to be married to Cashman's best friend.
"It's just a hoot," Poole said. "It's a time capsule piece. It's one disaster after another. It's hilarious. It's poignant. It expresses the human condition. It's perfect for the Ruptured Romances season. The three women are great. They're all theater people. Les is carrying this thing. It's a stamina play. He's got to keep going for three acts. The women are a hoot. Each is finding all these nuances and goodies that are just so much fun for the audience to discover who these women are."
While some people might write off Simon's plays as dated or unimportant, Poole finds just the opposite to be true.
"The trick is to make it feel like there's no work," Poole said. "These characters are full-bodied characters. Just gems. When people brush off Neil Simon, I am like, you really just don't understand. You don't understand the writer. He's a brilliant writer."
On opening night, May 3, Collective Face will also be announcing their 10th season program.
"We got some oldies, but goodies," Poole said of next season. "We got a piece ... it's a modern classic piece. We'll be the Savannah premiere of this play. We're going to do an African-American play and end with a musical."

Texto completo: Slow the push for legal pot
The Chicago Tribune Editorial Board rightly advised lawmakers to slow down on marijuana ("Should Illinois legalize marijuana? Not so fast," April 14). As the sponsor of a bipartisan House resolution (H.R. 157) advising lawmakers to slow down on their push for legal weed, I couldn't agree more. Both the editorial board and I also agree it's imperative that policymakers learn from other states. But I would argue it's been a failed experiment in every other state that has made the move to legalize marijuana -- and for those reasons, we must not bring legal recreational marijuana to Illinois too.
One of the main reasons many lawmakers are even considering legalization is revenue. With a significant budget deficit, it's easy to think marijuana is a quick answer, but marijuana will cost our state and taxpayers far more than it will bring in.
A recent study found that for every dollar of revenue taken in from the sale of marijuana in Colorado, it cost taxpayers $4.50 through increased regulatory burdens, more hospitalizations, dramatic increases in drugged driving, and the need for more mental health and addiction services. The Tribune's editorial board rightly notes that expected revenue would be a small percentage of our state budget and the "sum should not dazzle legislators into hasty action."
Furthermore, marijuana is causing serious and deadly problems in other states. Since legalization, marijuana-related traffic fatalities have jumped 151 percent, and overall traffic deaths have increased 35 percent in Colorado. That's no coincidence.
And contrary to what supporters predict, legalized marijuana has not curbed large black markets in California, Colorado and Oregon. Plus, numerous studies strongly link marijuana to problems with youth brain development, psychosis and poor educational attainment.
Finally, as policymakers, it's our job to dive into the details of how law changes will affect the communities and people we serve. In the push for marijuana, there has been very little talk about the very real impacts legalization will have in numerous policy areas from increased insurance costs to pot shops being densely located in low-income neighborhoods to issues with employers being able to find workers who can pass a drug test.
With only weeks left to go in the 2019 legislative session, more support lies with my bipartisan resolution to slow down the push for legal marijuana.
Let's learn from the mistakes of other states. Illinois must not join them.
-- Rep. Marty Moylan, D-Des Plaines

Endless Trump bashing
As an American and an Army veteran, I am saddened to witness the vitriol and animus being directed at President Donald Trump. It has become routine for his political opponents to refer to him as a racist and a bigot and a homophobe and an inveterate liar.
"Impeach the mother-----," screams a Michigan congresswoman, and progressives applaud and rally around that cry. Progressives and unprofessional Democrats continue their hate-filled rhetoric as though that, in itself, makes the accusations true.
I believe that history will record these years under President Trump as the "era of hate." But for Civil War days, America has never been so divided.
President Trump and his large base of supporters are pushing for a wall on the nation's southern border to control illegal immigration. He points to the fact that Congress has enacted laws making illegal immigration a crime, and as president, he exercises his duty to enforce federal law. Even New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, a hero to liberal Democrats, has come out in favor of a border wall.
Trump's political opponents should do what they can to defeat the president in 2020. That is how a great country works in a democracy and how it has worked in the U.S. for more than 200 years. The name-calling and animus and disrespect of the 45th president are politically over the top in this country.
-- William Juneau, Huntley

The karma of politics
Republicans complain that Democrats in Congress are unfairly attacking President Donald Trump. But when Republicans regained control of Congress, they used their power to attack and try to hobble Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and candidate Hillary Clinton. If anything, they were even more unfair and biased in their treatment of Democrats.
Republicans should not complain that Democrats are investigating the president. As they say, what goes around comes around. Republicans have only themselves to blame for the present situation.
-- Frank L. Schneider, Chicago

Forget your thesaurus, call every lie a lie

Texto completo: It's a tsunami of lies.
It's an avalanche of falsehoods. It's a deluge, a torrent, a rockslide, a barrage, an onslaught, a blitzkrieg.
President Trump has made more than 10,000 false or misleading statements since becoming president - on the size of the inaugural crowd, the number of steel plants being built in America and whether he knew about hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels, to name just three.
And as unbelievable as it sounds, the tempo is picking up dramatically.
On Tuesday, an oddsmaker predicted that the prevaricator-in-chief will tell 22,500 false statements by Election Day 2020.
"As the election approaches and the number of rallies, debates and opportunities to discuss policy is magnified, we are expecting all-time highs in the number of false statements from President Trump," said odds consultant John Lester of BookMaker.eu.
The gambling site sent out its prediction as an email blast on Tuesday, and when I followed up with Lester, he told me that Trump is more likely to bend the truth when he is "caught up in the excitement of crowd reaction" and when he is discussing policy.
The site - which uses The Washington Post's Fact Checker as its measuring rod - has been burned before by underestimating the president's tendencies.
After Trump gave his first address from the Oval Office (on border security) last January, the site had to pay out nearly $300,000 to people who had bet that he would tell more than 3½ lies during his televised talk.
"We knew we were in trouble early with this one," Lester, at the time, told BuzzFeed News. The Post, as it turned out, clocked six presidential falsehoods in that address. The site's experts had reasoned that Trump would be constrained by the address's short duration and the fact that the world was watching.
Clearly, they didn't know who they were dealing with: the greatest.
At some point, and we've definitely arrived there, the number of presidential falsehoods overcomes the public's ability to care.
The thinking seems to go like this: We get it, already. He lies a lot. Now, back to whether James Holzhauer will win big again tonight on "Jeopardy!" or whether the Nationals' bullpen will get fixed.
But it does matter. Lies - especially repetitive lies - are a crucial part of how propaganda works. Truth is a basic part of a functioning democracy.
And the press is supposed to hold powerful figures accountable for their misdeeds.
So, to do their jobs, the news media can't engage in business as usual.
Yes, they have to do the hard work of fact-checking and keeping track.
But they also have to bring some new tools and techniques - and maybe a new attitude - to the project.
First off, they should stop using euphemisms, such as the New York Times did the other day when on Twitter it described one particularly brutal falsehood by Trump - that doctors and mothers collaborate to execute newborns - as a case of the president reviving "an inaccurate refrain."
As one Twitter wag put it, an inaccurate refrain is when the Jimi Hendrix lyric from "Purple Haze" is bungled as " 'Scuse me, while I kiss this guy." This, on the other hand, is a despicable lie.
The Times is far from alone in this tendency to soft-pedal, as Daniel Dale, the excellent Washington correspondent for the Toronto Star, told Benjamin Hart of New York magazine.
"I think our job as journalists is to call things what they are. And so if someone commits 100 crimes, you don't say, 'We're gonna call the first two 'crimes' and the second one' - I don't know what the softer word would be - 'non-legal behavior.' "
"If we use the word 'lie' 100 times in a week, you know, people are gonna think we're biased or the word is gonna lose its power. But, to me, if there's 100 lies, you use the word 'lie' 100 times."
Editors have noted, reasonably enough, that the word lie denotes intentionality, and it's sometimes unclear if Trump's misleading statements are always intentional or just what some have called his "word salad."
But when appropriate, say so, as a Post editorial did recently with this headline on Trump's border separation policy: "Lie No. 10,000 is really a whopper."
Dale would also like to see reporters challenge the president more directly and more often on false statements, even small ones such as his recently saying that his father was born in Germany, when it was actually New York.
Do it, he suggests, in the president's frequent, informal gaggles with reporters. ("Why did you say that your father was born in Germany?")
"I don't expect that a more confrontational approach would result in him being dramatically exposed and no one supporting him anymore," he said. But it would be worthwhile anyway.
And look for innovative ways to tell the story of the endless lies, as the Times did in a graphic, putting to rest the often-heard argument from Trump supporters that "all presidents lie, you guys are just picking on our guy."
None of this, of course, will solve the problem. It's unlikely to reverse the avalanche or slow the ever-increasing pace.
But it may help an overwhelmed and numbed public find renewed reason to care.

Texto completo: Journalists Hannah Dreier, Derek Kravitz, Alex Mierjeski, Claire Perlman, Al Shaw and Finlay Young have been named finalists for the 2019 Livingston Awards for their work on three ProPublica projects. The award honors outstanding achievement by journalists under the age of 35.
Dreier was named a finalist in the local reporting category for the series “Trapped in Gangland” — co-published with New York magazine, Newsday and The New York Times Magazine — which followed immigrants on Long Island whose lives were shattered by a botched crackdown on the MS-13 gang. After President Donald Trump took office and seized on MS-13’s violence on Long Island to promote tougher immigration policies, Dreier sought to examine the impact of both the gang and law enforcement on the region’s growing Latino community. She told the story through powerful narratives of an informant sold out by federal authorities, Latino MS-13 murder victims dismissed as runaways by police, and innocent teenagers deported.
Kravitz, Mierjeski, Perlman and Shaw were named finalists for national reporting for “Trump Town,” a series of articles and a searchable database of thousands of President Trump’s political appointees, along with their federal lobbying and financial records. For this project the team launched an enormous fact-finding mission that involved filing more than 200 Freedom of Information Act and open-records requests, collecting staffing lists and publishing financial disclosure reports.
Reporter Finlay Young was named a finalist in the international reporting category for “Unprotected,” jointly published with Time magazine. The story looked into an acclaimed charity called More Than Me led by American Katie Meyler, which wanted to save vulnerable Liberian girls from sexual exploitation. Then children in the charity’s care were raped. The story showed the rapes were more widespread than had ever been acknowledged, and that the charity had obscured the truth while failing to safeguard all the victims.
ProPublica contributing reporter Lizzie Presser was also named a finalist for national reporting her work on a secret network of women providing safe, affordable home abortions with California Sunday Magazine.

Texto completo: "The first thing we do, let's kill all the referees."
Admittedly, that is not quite how the famous line from Shakespeare's "Henry VI" goes. As you may recall, it was actually the lawyers whose demise was proposed.
But though no one is known to have uttered the words above, they still neatly encompass the strategy conservatives have long used against the so-called "liberal media." Namely, undermine them -- and thus, their ability to act as arbiters of truth -- with relentless attacks on their credibility.
No less an authority than conservative pundit Charlie Sykes admitted as much in a 2016 interview with journalist Oliver Darcy. "We've basically eliminated any of the referees, the gatekeepers," he said of himself and his conservative colleagues.
Sykes spoke during the 2016 campaign when people were still stunned at the barrage of untruths spewing from the Republican candidate.
"We've created this monster," said Sykes, adding that, "At a certain point, you wake up and you realize you have destroyed the credibility of any credible news outlet out there. And I am feeling, to a certain extent, that we are reaping the whirlwind at that."
In related news, Donald Trump told the 10,000th lie of his presidency Friday. This, according to The Washington Post, which maintains a database of all the times Trump has exaggerated, distorted or misled.
Ten thousand.
Feels like there ought to be a statue, or something. And what does Trump lie about? Pretty much everything.
He lies about the border wall, claiming it is now being built. It isn't.
He lies about his tax cut, claiming it was the biggest in history. It wasn't.
He lies about the Mueller report, claiming it exonerates him. It doesn't.
Indeed, the very same weekend he notched his dubious milestone, Trump told a particularly gruesome whopper about supposed legislation empowering a new mother and her doctor to "determine whether or not they will execute the baby."
And how did The New York Times respond to this flaming canard? It called it "inaccurate," which raised something of a stink on Twitter. That's not surprising. Calling that hogwash "inaccurate" is like saying the Titanic was "delayed."
The Times is not alone; most news organizations have resisted calling Trump's lies lies. Their reasoning, it must be conceded, is thoughtful. After all, to call something a lie is to impose judgment. Sometimes, when people are incorrect it's not a lie, only a mistake.
But 10,000 times in a little over two years? How gullible must you be to believe someone could be that wrong that often by accident? If any other man told you half that many untruths, you'd call him a liar. You wouldn't hesitate. Yet here, we do.
It sets an extraordinary precedent, yes, for a news organization to brand a president a liar. But these are extraordinary times and a liar, brazen and inveterate, is precisely what Trump is. In their refusal to call him that, in their insistence upon giving him the benefit of nonexistent doubt, news media compromise their prime directive, which is to present a picture of the world as it is.
That's something we can ill afford with the very idea of truth under attack and the need for news media to do their jobs arguably more critical than ever.
This is a time for forthrightness, yet too often journalists are anything but, from coverage of race, to climate change to this, as the newspaper of record dubs a grotesque lie merely "inaccurate."
It makes you wonder if all the effort conservatives put into neutering the referees was not a waste of time.
Seems the referees have done a fair job of neutering themselves.

Texto completo: Do you still believe in the Easter bunny? How about the idea that all are equal under the law?
Remember when someone in an bunny costume jumped into a fight in Orlando on Easter, and a video of him pouring rabbit punches on a man went viral?
Many found it hilarious to watch this fluffy, oversized bunny with a pink nose join a bar brawl between a man and a woman and wail away on the guy. Some hailed bunnyman as a hero. The cops dismissed all three fighters, including the costumed character, without charges.
But it seems the rascally rabbit isn't so adorable after all. The hot-headed hare, also known as Antoine McDonald, was charged in a robbery (disposition unknown) and had an outstanding warrant issued in New Jersey for a car burglary, before he hopped to Florida to become an Instagram sensation.
According to a recent Twitter post by the South Brunswick, N.J., police department, McDonald failed to appear in court, and "his warrant remains active."
Speaking of creatures from New Jersey, former Gov. Chris Christie walks free while a former aide, Bridget Anne Kelly, was sentenced last week to 13 months in prison for her role in the Bridgegate scandal of 2013.
Seems Christie's staff thought it fun to virtually shut down lanes to the George Washington Bridge as revenge against a Fort Lee, N.J., mayor who didn't support Christie's re-election bid.
For five days, the decision to block some lanes to the bridge trapped drivers, school buses and emergency vehicles.
"He knew what was going on," Kelly said of Christie, "and any claim that he didn't is absurd."
Finally, President Donald Trump is flouting the law and edging toward a constitutional crisis by telling officials to ignore congressional subpoenas, refusing to acknowledge Congress' oversight authority.
"Congress can call witnesses about problems with the executive branch anytime," Charles Tiefer, a University of Baltimore law professor, told The New York Times. "Otherwise there is no check on whether the executive branch is doing the public's work or just exercising raw power."
Meanwhile, you can bet that on-the-lam Easter bunnyman will eventually be caught and held accountable for the charges against him.
Christie and Trump?

Texto completo: Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground Productions, which the couple launched last year, has partnered with Netflix for a slate of projects that include scripted and unscripted shows as well as full-length features and documentaries.
"We created Higher Ground to harness the power of storytelling," the former president said. "Touching on issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more, we believe each of these productions won't just entertain, but will educate, connect and inspire us all."
Some of the projects are:
"American Factory," about a Chinese-owned factory in post-industrial Ohio; "Bloom," an upstairs/downstairs drama series set in the world of fashion in post-WWII New York that depicts barriers faced by women and by people of color; a feature film adaptation of author David W. Blight's "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom," for which he won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in History; "Overlooked," an adaptation of The New York Times "Overlooked" obituary column, about deaths unreported by the paper; "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents," a half-hour preschool series; "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," a nonfiction series that will portray the importance of unheralded work done by everyday heroes guiding our government; "Crip Camp," a documentary about a 1970s summer camp for teenagers with disabilities.
Higher Ground has made a point of focusing on stories that reflect a range of "interests and experiences" but are "relevant to our daily lives," Michelle Obama said. "We think there's something here for everyone -- moms and dads, curious kids, and anyone simply looking for an engaging, uplifting watch at the end of a busy day."

How should journalists report on data hacks?

Texto completo: For
The phrase in The New York Times story hit a lot of readers — and a lot of journalists — like a slap across the face.
Major news organizations functioned during the 2016 presidential campaign as “a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence.”
It was a harsh assessment of how Russian-hacked emails were turned into news stories, but one that certainly contained an element of truth.
Later, Times reporter Amy Chozick, in her book, Chasing Hillary, mused on the eagerness for the revelations: “I can’t explain it exactly except to compare it to a fever that spread through every newsroom and made us all salivate over the tiniest morsels,” Chozick wrote.
She memorably summed up her own decision-making: “I chose the byline. I always chose the byline.”
The Times, of course, was far from alone in reporting on the revelations from the Democratic National Committee’s internal emails. In fact, it would be hard to find a news organization that didn’t publish its plentiful share.
But what about next time a foreign adversary tries to sway American politics though cyberwarfare?
Should reporters and editors refuse to publish newsworthy revelations — such as, in the 2016 hack, Democratic Party officials working to thwart Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary? (The revelations disrupted the Democratic National Convention and forced the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.)
Or should journalists make decisions on newsworthiness alone? What should they learn?
“The question is an important one because press amplification of the Russian-hacked content is a probable explanation for the 2016 erosion in the public perception that Hillary Clinton was qualified to be president,” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in a recent Boston Globe piece.
There is no perfect answer. It is, after all, not illegal for journalists to report on stolen information, and it is the press’s primary job to tell the public what it can find out about what powerful people and institutions are doing.
But ethical questions abound — and top editors around the country have been grappling with them.
“One takeaway for me is that we should put as much investigative muscle into finding out the source and motivation as we do into the information itself,” New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet told me. “That’s not always easy in the heat of the moment and the heat of competition.” He said, though, that he does not regret publishing revelations from the emails because of their significant newsworthiness.
Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron told me, in an email, that ’s Ellen Nakashima was the first journalist to report, in June 2016, that DNC emails had been hacked and that Russian government hackers were believed to be responsible.
After the hack, he said, was selective in what it published from the available emails, and it repeatedly made clear in its stories that U.S. intelligence officials believed Russia had stolen the emails. “Our standard was whether they contained information genuinely relevant to the public — voters in this case,” Baron said.
In her Globe piece, Jamieson observes that, in general, the news media didn’t do a great job of emphasizing where the revelations came from.
And she notes that the recently released Mueller report concludes that Russian intelligence officers gave reporters early access to archives of leaked files by sending links and passwords to pages on the website DCLeaks.com.
She offers a thought experiment: What if, during the third presidential debate, moderator Chris Wallace had emphasized the source of the emails he was bringing up in a question about Clinton’s supposed desire for “open borders” — perhaps like this: “My next question is based on stolen Democratic materials, whose accuracy we have been unable to verify, gotten by Russian hackers through cybertheft ...”?
Viewers would have been more prone to ask, she suggests, “Why would the Russians and Assange want to defeat the Democratic nominee?”
Julian Assange, who co-founded WikiLeaks — where many of the Democratic emails were first published — is known to be a Clinton antagonist, and Russian officials, we now know beyond a doubt, were working hard to help Donald Trump get elected.
BuzzFeed News has revised its standards guidelines to address hacked material, CNN’s Oliver Darcy and Donie O’Sullivan reported last week.
Stories should “treat the intention of the hacker as a major part of the story,” said Editor in Chief Ben Smith, and “maintain a high bar for news value.”
Columbia Journalism School professor Todd Gitlin told the CNN reporters that “under no circumstances” should hacked material be used “without a clear and unmistakable provenance that can be shared with readers.”
That these issues will come around again is almost inevitable. Recall that the 2014 hack of internal emails at Sony Pictures was credibly blamed on North Korea, and that little has happened to inhibit the exponential growth of cyberwarfare worldwide.
Newsrooms need to do everything in their power to be prepared to handle hacked information responsibly and thoughtfully — even in the heat of a breaking news story.
In short: Don’t publish weaponized gossip. Verify relentlessly. Nail down, and emphasize, the source of the hack and its motivation. And be transparent with news consumers.
Or be prepared to become, in that dreaded phrase, “the de facto instrument” of a foreign adversary’s fondest hopes.

Byron York: Amid good news, can Democrats talk down the economy?

Texto completo: "The recession talk in late 2018 got way, way out of hand," the New York Times economic reporter Neil Irwin tweeted a few days ago. Indeed it did.
Irwin's tweet came shortly after the government released figures showing the economy grew at a 3.2% annual rate in the first three months of this year. The number was good by anyone's measure, significantly outpacing predictions. And it raised a question: What about all that recession talk of the last few months? What was going on?
Certainly there were some economists who looked at various indicators — housing, energy, the international economy — and feared an economic slowdown was on the way. But in the popular conversation, the world of columnists and cable TV talkers, much of the economic chatter was really about President Trump. A worsening economy, some said, would show how wrong the president's policies have been and would be the worst possible news for his 2020 re-election bid.
"A recession is coming. Trump will make it so much worse," announced the Washington Post on Dec. 23 of last year. A slowdown is "overdue," columnist Catherine Rampell wrote, "and the eventual collapse may bear Trump's fingerprints."
"Trump and the slowing economy: A wounded tiger is a dangerous tiger," read the headline of a column, also in the Post, by former Obama economic adviser Jared Bernstein on Nov. 21, 2018.
"Wall Street economists, and in fact economists across the board are calling for a recession," financial reporter Linette Lopez said on CNN on Dec. 30. "They see that a recession is coming in 2019 and 2020 ... It's sad that we can't trust the president to be able to control himself in the face of a slowing economy."
Now, though, the case is a bit harder to make with 3.2% growth, plus low unemployment, plus, perhaps most importantly, wage increases that have not been seen in years.
Still, the presidential campaign is underway, and Democrats will try to portray — actually, they'll have to portray — the president's policies as an economic mess. The question is whether it will work.
Republican strategists are of two minds. On one hand, some still bear the scars of the 1992 election, when Bill Clinton managed to convince voters that the economy, which was in the early stages of a recovery, was in desperate shape. The lesson: Creating a perception of the economy was more important than the economy itself.
"It's not facts and stock market statistics," said GOP strategist David Carney in an email exchange. "Clinton did a good job against us in 1992. All the economists said everything was on track to solid improvement, and they were right. Still, the economy was key — based on the recent past, not current or future."
On the other hand, some Republicans believe it will be difficult for any Democrat — Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, anyone — to talk down a healthy economy.
"We of course have no idea what the economy will be like in a year and a half," said strategist Curt Anderson in another email exchange. "But if it stays similar to how it is now, the Democrats will not be successful in talking it down. We've done a fair amount of polling so far in 2019 and the voters are happy with the current economy, and are even somewhat bullish on their personal economic future. Arguing with the voters is a dumb strategy that has been tried and failed many times. I don't recommend it."
While an economic downturn would obviously hurt Trump, Anderson sees the possibility of another dynamic entirely.
"When the economy is good, voters don't say that the economy is their number one issue," he explained. "We have several polls this year where the voters list the economy as their third- or fourth-most important issue, and that is because the voters feel like the economy is somewhere between good and really good. Often voters will migrate to other issues when the economy is good."
In that rather ironic scenario, a good Trump economy could give voters the freedom to focus on things they don't like about the president.
In any event, Trump's job will be to convince voters not only that his economic policies are working, but that Democratic proposals such as the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, tuition-free college, and more would destroy the economy that has gone well during the early Trump years.
So far, despite all the pessimistic talk, that's not a hard argument to make. And if the indicators hold up, the president will hold a strong hand, whatever his real or perceived liabilities, in November 2020.

Texto completo: Author talks better food choices at Cristo Rey High School
Lisa Leake, New York Times best-selling author of "100 Days of Real Food" cookbooks, visited students at Cristo Rey Philadelphia High School for a talk and recipe workshop on making better food choices.
Leake, a mom of two middle-schoolers, made the visit in partnership with Grassland Butter, a new Project Verified Non-GMO butter, to talk about how better food choices can be easier to make than you think and how kids can make good choices, too.
The students were able to get hands-on in the kitchen with Leake as they prepared a healthy afterschool snack together - Cinnamon Glazed Popcorn - using Grassland butter and simple pantry ingredients.
Leake also taught the students that any changes, even small ones, make a big impact on your health. She showed the students examples of "eat this, not that" - for example, showing them cooking oats from scratch and adding toppings like fruit, syrup, and chocolate is often a better choice than buying processed, pre-packaged choices that include deceptive ingredients. She also taught them that reading and understanding food labels is key to being knowledgeable about better-for-you choices.
Students show off skills at Philly Tech Expo and Competition
About 280 students from 38 schools participated in the 2019 Philly Technology Exposition and Competition held at the Education Center in early April.
Superintendent William R. Hite addressed the students along with the keynote speaker, tech-life expert Stephanie Humphrey.
Students in third through 12th grades presented their technological projects in several categories including coding, animation, 3D design, programming and web page design. They also had workshops while their projects are being judged.
Select first-place winners in middle and high schools were invited to present their projects at the District's Student Technology Project showcase on May 6 where they will receive feedback from tech experts. These students will then represent the region at the Pennsylvania Media and Design Competition in Carlisle, Pa., later in May.

Texto completo: ALBANY – President Donald Trump on Monday criticized New York's leaders for targeting the National Rifle Association, but also warned the group to "get its act together quickly."
On Twitter, Trump also continued to knock his home state, saying "People are fleeing New York State because of high taxes and yes, even oppression of sorts. They didn't even put up a fight against SALT — could have won."
Trump was referring to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's ongoing criticism of the federal tax reform approved in 2017 that limits state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, to $10,000 a year — a move that mainly hurts wealthy New York homeowners.
"So much litigation," Trump continued. "The NRA should leave and fight from the outside of this very difficult to deal with (unfair) State!"
Lawsuit against NRA in New York On Friday, Attorney General Letitia James's office confirmed it opened an investigation into the NRA's tax-exempt status.
On Saturday, the NRA's president Oliver North announced he would not serve a second term amid turmoil in the organization.
"The NRA is under siege by Cuomo and the New York State A.G., who are illegally using the State's legal apparatus to take down and destroy this very important organization, & others," Trump said in the first of two tweets on the issue Monday morning.
"It must get its act together quickly, stop the internal fighting, & get back to GREATNESS - FAST!"
The New York Times reported that James sent letters to the NRA and its charitable foundation to preserve its financial records.
New York has jurisdiction over the NRA because it was chartered in the state in 1871.
NRA and New York The fight with the NRA is the latest in New York.
Cuomo's administration is looking to end an insurance policy run by the NRA, called "Carry Guard." The case is in court.
The Democratic governor has long fought with the NRA, and New York passed a series of gun-control laws in 2013 in the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings.
Earlier this year, Cuomo and the Democratic-led legislature passed another round of gun laws, such as banning bump stocks and allow people to seek a court order to ban dangerous people from having guns.
On Monday, Cuomo responded to Trump's tweets by saying since the Newtown shootings, there have been 2,029 mass shootings in the nation.
Cuomo said that since Trump took office in 2017, there have been 74,600 gun-violence deaths, saying in a statement, "You have done nothing but tweet about it."
"The only thing illegal is the gun lobby's insurance scheme," Cuomo said. "Unlike you, President Trump, New York is not afraid to stand up to the NRA. I will continue to fight for the children of this state. As for the NRA, we'll remember them in our thoughts and prayers."
Trump and Cuomo Trump met with Cuomo at the White House in February to discuss the impact of the tax reforms on New York, but no resolution was reached.
Trump has repeatedly criticized his home state for its sagging upstate economy.
"I love those people," he said in February. "Those people are my voters. They've been treated very badly."
He added: "If New York isn't gonna treat them better, I would recommend they go to another state where they can get a great job."
New York Democrats, meanwhile, are fighting Trump on several fronts, including trying to get a law passed that would require the release of his state taxes to Congress.
Cuomo has been a regular critic of the Republican president, too.
"Nobody makes the anti-Trump case better than Trump. Just let Trump talk, and let Trump act, and let Trump divide," Cuomo said March 26 on WNYC radio.

All should reject enablers of prejudice

Texto completo: On Saturday, a synagogue in Poway, California, was attacked when a man with a gun burst in during the Sabbath service and started shooting, killing one person and wounding three. The violence raises disturbing questions about whether the Jewish community in America is still safe from anti-Semitic violence - especially coming as it does six months after 11 people were killed at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.
But the tragedy in the San Diego suburb has also become political fodder in the ongoing polemics about anti-Semitism on the right and the left.
There seems to be little doubt that the gunman, identified as San Diego nursing student John Earnest, came from the extreme right. Less than a half-hour before the shooting, a white supremacist manifesto in his name was posted online. One of its main themes is that Jews are trying to subvert white American and European culture by promoting nonwhite immigration. This conspiracy theory is an obsession of the white nationalist alt-right; it was also invoked by Robert Bowers, the Pittsburgh shooting suspect, whom the manifesto cited as an inspiration (along with the man accused in the New Zealand mosque shootings).
Yet in online conversations after the shooting, quite a few conservatives focused on what Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), in a tweet, labeled "the anti-Semitic Left." Cruz and some other Republicans pointed fingers at Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), the progressive Democrat who has been under fire for anti-Israel comments that arguably employ anti-Semitic tropes. Omar has suggested that pro-Israel Americans are loyal to another country and that political support for Israel is bought with money.
Others also drew attention to a widely criticized cartoon that appeared the day before the shooting in the international print edition of The New York Times. The syndicated cartoon depicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a guide dog with a Star of David dog tag, held on a leash by a blind, yarmulke-wearing Donald Trump - an image disturbingly similar to caricatures of crafty Jews manipulating the powerful. The Times has apologized and said the cartoon was anti-Semitic and published a harsh rebuke by its columnist Bret Stephens.
The cartoon controversy illustrates the fact that anti-Israel animus and anti-Semitism are often enmeshed. But the Poway gunman was not inspired by the Times cartoons or by Omar, who is Muslim.
Republicans, even some who are critical of Trump, have often reacted with indignation to suggestions that his rhetoric has contributed to inflaming anti-Semitism and white nationalism in this country. Trump has denounced anti-Jewish hatred (though he has often waffled in condemnations of the white supremacist far right), and the manifesto attributed to Earnest slams him as a "Zionist." Yet Trump-style nativist, conspiracy-obsessed populism has, at least on the fringes, undeniable links to anti-Semitism. Trump's own claims that Jewish billionaire George Soros funds migration to Western countries, including the caravan of asylum-seekers who journeyed to the U.S. border last year, have arguably fed into the Jewish conspiracy theory embraced by Bowers and Earnest.
Anti-Semitism on the left should not be ignored, but it also shouldn't be used to deflect from the problem on the right. The danger is at both ends: Anti-Semitism cloaked in criticism of Israel is more "respectable" and insidious while the far-right, white supremacist variety is more likely to be violent. Until we confront both kinds of bigotry, and until conservatives and progressives do some soul-searching about anti-Semitism enablers in their ranks, the problem will get worse.

Texto completo: America's heroes, from George Washington on down, have reflected the greatness and flaws of their times.
This is true also of Kate Smith, who gave voice to America's World War II efforts and buoyed the nation's spirit during uncertain days. She should be honored for who she was and what she gave the nation despite her flaws.
When she died at 79 in 1986, Smith was one of the nation's best-known singers. According to a story recounted in the singer's New York Times obituary, President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced her to England's King George VI by saying, "This is Kate Smith. Miss Smith is America."
Smith cemented her place in history during WWII, when her performances of Irving Berlin's "God Bless America" helped to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in war bonds. Much later, she sang the song at a handful of Philadelphia Flyers' games, causing a sensation. The team seemed to play up a notch when she performed or when her recording of "God Bless America" was played before the puck dropped. The Flyers and New York Yankees, continued to play her recordings for decades after her death.
Until now. The Flyers and Yankees have silenced her contralto, and the Flyers first covered up Smith's statue outside their stadium then removed it. Why? Because a fan alerted the Yankees to racist titles and lyrics in a couple of Smith's most ancient songs.
Never mind that there's some question as to whether one of the songs was intended as satire or that her statue was, as the Philadelphia Inquirer reported, one of the few in that city honoring women.
Never mind, as the Inquirer also reported, that Smith called for racial tolerance on a 1945 radio show. Smith appeared on radio shows thousands of times and was known as the "first lady of radio." What she said mattered.
It evidently did not occur to the Flyers or Yankees that Smith was a product of her times or that history is best remembered, confronted and addressed, not obliterated when its subjects are out of favor, Soviet Union-style. The teams' mindless overreaction is the same as that which led to the removal of the Stephen Foster statue in Oakland last year.
Ernie Troiano Jr., the mayor of Wildwood, N.J. has offered to take Smith's statue and pledged to continue playing her recording of "God Bless America" on the city's boardwalk every day. Is he condoning racism? No, just giving Smith and her place in history the thoughtful treatment they deserve. Good for him.

Times Apologizes for Printing Anti-Semitic Cartoon

Texto completo: The New York Times on Sunday apologized for a cartoon published in the Opinion pages of its international edition that drew widespread condemnation for being anti-Semitic.
The cartoon, which was published on Thursday in the print newspaper, portrayed a blind President Trump, wearing a skullcap, being led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, drawn as a dog on a leash with a Star of David collar.
"The image was offensive, and it was an error of judgment to publish it," The New York Times said in an editors' note that will be published in Monday's international edition.
Eileen Murphy, a New York Times spokeswoman, said the paper was "deeply sorry" for publishing the cartoon.
"Such imagery is always dangerous, and at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise worldwide, it's all the more unacceptable," Ms. Murphy said in a statement on behalf of the Opinion section. "We are committed to making sure nothing like this happens again."
The cartoon drew hundreds of critical comments from people worldwide. The Jerusalem Post, The Times of Israel, CNN, Fox News and others published articles about the cartoon.
"Apology not accepted," the American Jewish Committee said in response to The Times's editors' note. "What does this say about your processes or your decision makers? How are you fixing it?"
The cartoon was drawn by the Portuguese cartoonist António Moreira Antunes and originally published by Expresso, a newspaper in Lisbon. It was then picked up by CartoonArts International, a syndicate for cartoons from around the world.
The New York Times Licensing Group sells content from CartoonArts and other publishers along with material from The New York Times to news sites and other customers.
The Times's United States edition does not typically publish political cartoons and did not run this one, but the international edition frequently includes them. An editor from The Times's Opinion section downloaded Mr. Antunes's cartoon from the syndicate and made the decision to publish it, according to Ms. Murphy.
Ms. Murphy declined to identify the editor, who she said was "working without adequate oversight" because of a "faulty process" that is now being reviewed.
"We are evaluating our internal processes and training," Ms. Murphy said. "We anticipate significant changes."
James Bennet, the editor who oversees all content on The Times's editorial pages, declined to comment in detail. "I'm going to let our statement speak for us at this point," Mr. Bennet said.
Bret Stephens, an opinion columnist for The Times, wrote about the issue on Sunday and called on the newspaper to do "some serious reflection as to how it came to publish that cartoon," which he called "an astonishing act of ignorance of anti-Semitism."
And Vice President Mike Pence tweeted on Sunday, "We stand with Israel and we condemn antisemitism in ALL its forms."
Sergio Florez, the managing editor for The Times's Licensing Group, said the group took in 30 or more cartoons a week from CartoonArts through an automated feed to its website, where publishers can look through the cartoons and buy a license to reprint them. The group's editors sporadically review the feed and remove work that is biased or racist, he said.
"Had we seen this cartoon in one of those sweeps, we definitely would have pulled it," Mr. Florez said. The cartoon has been deleted from the Licensing Group's collection, he said.
Nancy Lee, the executive editor of the Licensing Group, said the group would review its arrangement with CartoonArts.
The company's licensing deal with The Times goes back several decades, Ms. Lee said. CartoonArts, based in New York, was founded in 1978 by the cartoonist Jerry Robinson to bring global cartoons to a wider audience. It is now run by his son, Jens Robinson.
"We receive and post cartoons from around the world of many shades of political opinion," Mr. Robinson said by email. "The cartoon in question was viewed as political commentary. However, we understand the decision to remove it from the website."
Expresso, the Portuguese newspaper, did not respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Antunes could not be reached. He has been a regular cartoonist for the paper since 1974, according to an online biography.
"The profession of cartoonist is a profession of risk," Mr. Antunes said in an interview with the Portuguese Observer in 2015, after the fatal attack in Paris on the staff of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. "There is always fear, but there is no other option but to defend freedom of expression."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Ron Chernow has won a Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. His biography of Alexander Hamilton inspired a musical that revolutionized Broadway.
But comedy? Now that's a tough gig.
As the featured speaker at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner on Saturday, Mr. Chernow had the not particularly pleasant task of keynoting an event under siege from a president who relentlessly attacks the press and from critics who question its purpose.
In choosing a scholar over a satirist, the Correspondents' Association had sought to solemnize a dinner known for its comedic puncturing of the Washington bubble. Michelle Wolf's routine last year scandalized many of the solons in the room and prompted some journalists to call for a formal apology. At an after-party, reporters expressed sympathy to the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who had declined to be photographed with the comedian after her set.
If losing the punch lines was meant as an enticement to President Trump, the move fell short: He skipped out for the third year running. Ms. Sanders demurred, too, appearing with Mr. Trump at a rally in Wisconsin. "Last year this night I was at a slightly different event," she told a crowd that shouted anti-media chants. "Not quite the best welcome."
In an added slight, Mr. Trump decreed last week that members of his administration should not attend, prompting news organizations to scramble to fill seats that had been set aside for cabinet secretaries and White House aides.
But for those lamenting the vitriol of recent years -- "this surreal interlude in American life," as Mr. Chernow put it -- the historian offered a palliative in the form of perspective.
Partisan attacks, he noted in a half-hour speech, flourished in the days of the Founding Fathers. Laws were passed against free expression. Presidents, from George Washington on, fumed about journalists. A century ago, the showman Will Rogers noted that "people are taking their comedians seriously and their politicians as a joke."
"That certainly describes our topsy-turvy moment," Mr. Chernow observed.
It's fair to say the president, famously skewered by Seth Meyers and Barack Obama at the dinner's 2011 edition, may not have enjoyed himself this year, either. Mr. Chernow roasted Mr. Trump in his own wry way.
"Washington committed only one major blunder as president: He failed to put his name on Mount Vernon and thereby bungled an early opportunity at branding," the historian said, mocking Mr. Trump's reported remarks during a tour of the first president's Virginia home. "Clearly deficient in the art of the deal, the poor man had to settle for the lowly title of father of his country. A very sad story."
Mr. Chernow described Hamilton as "an immigrant who arrived, thank God, before the country was full." He noted that John Adams, who took steps to outlaw criticism of the government, failed to earn a second term. "Campaigns against the press don't get your face carved into the rocks of Mount Rushmore," he said, "for when you chip away at the press, you chip away at our democracy." He concluded his remarks by saying: "Politicians and diapers must be changed often, and for the same reason." (Mr. Chernow attributed the quote to Mark Twain, though its origins are murky.)
A year ago, Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, stormed out in the middle of Ms. Wolf's raucous set. On Saturday, he stuck around to the end, though he stopped short of endorsing Mr. Chernow's remarks. "I had a lot of college professors who said the same thing," Mr. Schlapp, whose wife, Mercedes, is a top White House adviser, said as he left the Hilton ballroom.
Another Trump associate in attendance gave better marks. "It was perfectly spot-on for the time and for where we are in the world," Gary Cohn, the president's former chief economic adviser, said afterward. "It sort of hit the spot."
The writer and director Judd Apatow defended Ms. Wolf last year. But on Sunday, he praised Mr. Chernow's performance as "a refreshing new approach."
"On the surface, one might think it is a safe choice, a retreat," Mr. Apatow wrote in an email. "But having someone who actually reads and understands the lessons of history, as opposed to our president, makes a very strong, even aggressive statement about the dangers of having a president with no grasp of history or the true spirit of our country."
Once a high point of the Washington social calendar, the dinner has lost some of its glamour since Mr. Trump came to town. Hollywood agencies still threw parties the night before, but the big celebrity attraction this year was the actor Michael Kelly, who played Doug Stamper on the now-canceled political drama "House of Cards." Sean Spicer, the former press secretary, showed up to an event with a camera crew from "Extra," his current employer.
At a charity brunch on Saturday hosted by the Washington doyenne Tammy Haddad, Jay Leno was the featured guest -- and even he seemed unimpressed. "We've pretty much reached the bottom of the barrel here," the former "Tonight Show" host quipped of his appearance. Mr. Leno's next joke, which compared the event's "spring garden" dress code to a feminine hygiene product, did not exactly kill.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, also made the rounds. Appearing freshly spray-tanned as he kicked back on Friday in the V.I.P. area of the National Portrait Gallery, where The Hill hosted a reception, he said he was exempt from the president's boycott because he did not work in the West Wing.
How about Mr. Chernow as this year's speaker? "I'd rather have a comedian!" Mr. Giuliani said.
The chummy nature of the dinner, where reporters mingle with their sources, has long attracted criticism. (The New York Times stopped attending in 2008.) Its recent diminishment is the rare development of the Trump era that has delighted the president's fans and high-minded media critics alike.
This year's attendees especially welcomed Mr. Chernow's reminiscences of happier times in the dinner's history, when, he said, "our best presidents have handled the press with wit, grace, charm, candor, and even humor." The dinner is held at the hotel where, in 1981, Ronald Reagan was shot. Reagan, Mr. Chernow noted, dialed into the festivities a few days later from his hospital bed, telling the reporters, "If I could give you just one little bit of advice: When someone tells you to get into a car quick, do it."
"That was a touch of class that has been sorely missing in our political culture in recent years," Mr. Chernow said, to applause. "It was a subtle reminder that whether Republicans or Democrats, we are all bona fide members of Team U.S.A., and not members of enemy camps."
Around the time that the historian was speaking on Saturday, an alternative universe of sorts unfolded across town. At a concert hall near the White House, Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared for the latest stop on their national speaking tour, with the comedian Jordan Klepper on hand to introduce them. "You are in the only room tonight in D.C.," Mr. Klepper told the audience, "that has the guts to put a president and comedian on the same stage."
A few thousands votes in the other direction in 2016, and it might have been Mrs. Clinton onstage at the night's more prominent event, with Mr. Klepper cracking wise at the lectern. By Sunday morning, Twitter was abuzz with a video of Mr. Klepper persuading Mrs. Clinton to read aloud portions of the special counsel's report. Comedy still plays.

Sore Warriors Leave Rivals Grimacing

Texto completo: OAKLAND, Calif. -- The Golden State Warriors survived a taut and contentious opening game of their highly anticipated second-round series with the Houston Rockets thanks to a supremely grooved Kevin Durant -- and one crucial late dagger from Stephen Curry.
The Warriors also left little doubt that their unexpectedly significant exertions just to get out of the Western Conference's first round, and how those efforts may affect this title defense, are at the forefront of their thinking.
Clearly feeling a sense of urgency even before the opening tip, Warriors Coach Steve Kerr made a drastic lineup change for Game 1, putting his most accomplished lineup on the floor from the start. Kerr also went deeper into his bench than normal, using 10 of his 13 available players to counter fatigue and Golden State's turnover trouble to secure a 104-100 victory in a raggedy opener for both sides.
With the Warriors playing just 36 hours and change after being dragged by the Los Angeles Clippers to a costly sixth game -- in which Klay Thompson and Curry sustained ankle injuries -- Kerr moved the wily supersub Andre Iguodala into his starting lineup and shifted the 6-foot-7 Draymond Green to center. It was the first time Golden State's so-called Hamptons Five started a game this season, but it was a measure Kerr thought he couldn't resist given the uncertain health of his star guards.
"You get to the playoffs and you've got to do what you've got to do," Kerr said. "You've got to play your best players and see what happens."
Durant responded with 35 points -- 24 in the second half -- to diminish the damage of Golden State's 20 turnovers. He matched James Harden's point total for Houston and boosted his scoring average over the Warriors' past five playoff games to 40.2 points, with nearly 55 percent shooting. Green (14 points, 9 rebounds and 9 assists) and Iguodala (14 points and 6-for-7 shooting in 34 minutes) also responded with strong games to ease the demands on Thompson and Curry.
Thompson, though, still logged more than 41 minutes despite pregame concerns that he might not even be able to play. And Curry survived the final six-plus minutes of regulation with five fouls to drain a decisive 3-pointer with 25.9 seconds left in an isolation mismatch against the Houston reserve center Nene after the Rockets had drawn to 100-98.
The Rockets arrived in the Bay Area on Friday, before the Warriors had even finished off the Clippers, feeling their own urgency. Still stinging from last season's epic conference finals in which it squandered two chances to eliminate Golden State, Houston is well aware that this rematch -- albeit one round earlier -- has again been widely billed as the de facto N.B.A. finals.
"They know this is what it's for," Rockets Coach Mike D'Antoni said of his players before tipoff.
Houston's prevailing postgame emotion, however, was frustration -- not only from a missed opportunity to swipe home-court advantage from the two-time defending champions but also with the refereeing of the game. The Rockets were aggrieved by what they deemed multiple Golden State closeouts on 3-point attempts by Harden that should have been whistled for fouls.
"I just want a fair shake, man," Harden said. "Call the game how it's supposed to be called and that's it. And I'll live with the results."
Eric Gordon scored 27 points in support of Harden's 35, but Houston missed 16 of its first 18 attempts from 3-point range and was just 14 for 47 over all. Harden, who missed 19 of 28 shots from the field, failed to draw a foul from Green on his 3-point try with 9.1 seconds to go, which led to Chris Paul's ejection seconds later for protesting the noncall.
Paul appeared to make contact with the referee Josh Tiven in earning his second technical foul. It was the 12th ejection of the N.B.A. playoffs after just three during the 2018 postseason.
"When you land three feet ahead of where you shoot the ball from, that really ain't my issue," Green said, arguing that Harden did not deserve more than his 14 trips to the foul line because he repeatedly leaned into the defender or extended his arms in search of a whistle.
Nearly a year has passed since the Warriors overturned double-digit deficits in both Game 6 and Game 7 to climb out of a 3-2 series deficit and advance to the title round, but the rivalry between these teams never really goes dormant.
According to four people familiar with the courtships who were not authorized to discuss them publicly, Philadelphia made lucrative attempts last July to hire Warriors General Manager Bob Myers or Houston's Daryl Morey to take over the 76ers' front office. But Myers and Morey elected to stay where they are, knowing they would probably be reunited in the playoffs in a series whose survivor instantly becomes the consensus favorite to win it all.
When Houston slumped to fourth in the West late in the regular season, its tumble almost instantly begot a theory that it might be better for the Rockets to face the dynastic Warriors in the second round -- mostly owing to freshness.
The 31-point lead Golden State blew in Game 2 against the Clippers in the biggest collapse in playoff history, coupled with the Warriors' failure to close out the series in a Game 5 at home, seemed to give the theory even more credence. Especially after Thompson and Curry sustained their Game 6 injuries.
Morey, though, admitted in a podcast interview with the former New York Times reporter Howard Beck that he "did personally want to face the Warriors later." After spending nearly a half-decade trying to construct a roster that could topple the Warriors, without success to this point, Morey was clearly hesitant to publicly declare advantages of any sort for his team in his appearance on "The Full 48."
The Warriors duly made Morey's caution look prudent with the way they kept feeding a patient and efficient Durant in the fourth quarter, rendered Houston's Clint Capela a nonfactor and ultimately secured a 1-0 series lead to take into Tuesday night's Game 2.
"There's never been anybody like him: 6-11, handles the ball, shoots 3s, passes, defends," Kerr said of Durant.
After the Warriors halted a rare two-game playoff losing streak at home, Green credited Kerr's lineup switch as the other key to complement Durant.
"So many times you kind of go in the series and you wait to take a loss to make that first adjustment," Green said. "I think we just got ahead of it."

NYT apologizes for anti-Semitic cartoon a full day after acknowledging 'error in judgment'

Texto completo: The New York Times issued an apology Sunday for an anti-Semitic cartoon it published internationally Thursday.

The cartoon showed President Trump wearing a yarmulke and being led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is depicted as a service dog for the blind with a Star of David collar.

On Saturday the New York Times Opinion Twitter account responded to criticism by saying that publishing the cartoon was “an error of judgment." That statement also said the cartoon was provided by The New York Times News Service and Syndicate, which had since deleted it.

It took another whole day for the Times to issue an apology.

“We are committed to making sure nothing like this happens again,” the Sunday statement said. “Such imagery is always dangerous, and at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise worldwide, it’s all the more unacceptable.”

The news organization said that it appeared publication of the cartoon came from a single editor and that the Times anticipates “significant changes.”

New York Times Columnist Bret Stephens wrote an op-ed in the Times on Sunday expressly condemning the cartoon as anti-Semitic. Noting out the news outlet is "otherwise hyper-alert to nearly every conceivable expression of prejudice," he wondered if an editor would more readily notice the issue with a similar cartoon if it featured a prominent woman like Speaker Nancy Pelosi, an African American like John Lewis, or a Muslim like Rep. Ilhan Omar. Stephens also noted the “torrential criticism of Israel” in addition to “mainstreaming of anti-Zionism.”

“So long as anti-Semitic arguments or images are framed, however speciously, as commentary about Israel, there will be a tendency to view them as a form of political opinion, not ethnic prejudice,” Stephens wrote.

This past month Netanyahu won a historic fifth term as Prime Minister. Netanyahu and Trump have become very close during their time leading their respective countries. Since being elected, Trump moved the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and recognized Israel’s claim to the contested Golan Heights region, where the prime minister announced he would name a settlement after Trump.

Impeaching Trump will only help him

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump has called the Mueller investigation a “witch hunt” nearly two hundred times on social media alone. Well, the special counsel concluded he was not a witch.
After carefully scrutinizing any links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, Robert Mueller definitively declared “the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” He didn’t do it.
Still, several leading Democrats have called for Trump’s impeachment on obstruction-of-justice charges. This is absurd.
The lesson of Watergate, we are told, is that the coverup is always worse than the crime. But in Watergate, there was a crime to cover up. We now know that Trump committed no crime. There was nothing to cover up.
As Mueller put it, “unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.”
This lack of an “underlying crime” is the source of Trump’s justified outrage over the Mueller investigation. Imagine that you were accused of a crime you knew you did not commit, and a special counsel was appointed who spent nearly two years and more than $25 million investigating you. You’d be angry and frustrated. You’d want someone to stand up for you, defend your interests and stop the insanity.
For two years, Trump watched as the investigation dragged on, weighing down his presidency. He had to endure being accused of “treason” and crimes of “a size and scope probably beyond Watergate.” He listened as members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, and former intelligence officials, led Americans to believe that they had seen secret evidence showing he had colluded with Russia -- evidence he knew did not exist.
Of course, he wanted the investigation to end. But he didn’t end it. He didn’t obstruct justice because nothing was obstructed. Mueller was allowed to finish his work. The White House cooperated, sharing millions of pages of documents and giving Mueller access to dozens of senior officials.
The fact that Trump railed against Mueller to aides and told White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller (which McGahn did not do and Trump did not press the matter) is not evidence of obstruction; it is evidence of exasperation. The president has a right to vent in private to his staff. Remember, the only reason Mueller knew about his private exchanges with McGahn is because Trump put no restrictions on McGahn’s cooperation.
The president could have asserted privilege, but declined to do so. He let McGahn spend some 30 hours with Mueller, sharing details, according to The New York Times, “that investigators would not have learned of otherwise.” This is evidence of Trump’s cooperation, not obstruction.
As a result of this cooperation, the special counsel’s report contains some embarrassing moments for the president. But it also proves that Trump was telling the truth when it came to the central question of the investigation: He did not conspire with Russia.
If Democrats want to purse impeachment nonetheless, then to quote Ronald Reagan quoting Clint Eastwood: “Go ahead, make my day.” Impeachment over anything other than a conspiracy with Russia will backfire with the American people and help ensure Trump’s reelection. First, it will fail, because two-thirds of the Senate will not vote to convict the president.
Second, Trump’s supporters will see an impeachment effort as an attempted coup d’état, energizing his base ahead of the 2020 election.
And third, it will be seen as partisan and unfair by persuadable voters, who will not appreciate politicians second-guessing the conclusions of an impartial investigation. Want to push Trump’s approval above 50 percent? Try to impeach him.
While Democrats debate pursuing impeachment, they are also abusing their powers to get Trump’s tax returns in the hope they will provide what the Mueller investigation did not: evidence of something incriminating. Does anyone really believe that the House Ways and Means Committee wants Trump’s returns to assess how “the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a president”? Please. There is no legitimate legislative purpose for this request.
Both the Democrats’ attempt to misuse a 1920s law to violate Trump’s privacy and their partisan response to the Mueller report make clear that they are seeking any pretext to oust Trump. But the only thing they will succeed in doing is eliciting sympathy for an otherwise unsympathetic president.

Texto completo: I have a secret to tell you: You don't need an expensive camera. Don't get me wrong, I love my big digital camera, huge lenses and all. I love taking photos too. It's a hobby as well as part of my job. But it's a myth that a "real" camera instantly makes all photos better. Sure, there are some photographs only possible with big lenses and a real camera, but these situations are less common than you'd think.
A good photographer can take award-winning photos with whatever camera is available. Or to put it another way, your photos aren't going to get better just because you have an expensive camera. Anyone can make sounds with a guitar, but you have to learn how to make music with it, and it takes a lot of work to master it. A camera is the same.
Before you spend money on a new camera, try improving the photos you take with your current camera or phone. You may be happy enough with the results that you'll skip the new camera completely.
How to line up that perfect shot
While there are no "rules" with photography, there are certainly "good practices" worth learning. For example, unless you're specifically going for symmetry with the background, try placing your subject off-center. In the camera settings, enable grid lines. These will help you line up a more visually interesting shot.
Try different angles. Dogs, for instance, look way cuter if you photograph them from their eye line. Photograph children from that same low point of view, they'll look hilariously huge. Adults generally look better with the camera positioned slightly above them. Looking down at a camera puffs out the chin and neck, and no one looks good like that.
Try different distances and positioning. Instead of capturing your family with Big Ben far in the background, you'll have a more interesting shot with the clock tower close behind or towering above them. Photographs with people especially benefit from being close to the camera.
When outside, try to shoot with the sun behind you, as the light will be better. As for timing, the best light is the hour after sunrise and the hour before sunset, the so-called "Golden Hour." Want to get that epic photo of your partner on the beach in Fiji? That's probably the best time to take it. The worst will be midday, with the strong light coming from directly above.
Also, turn off the flash. Only use it if you absolutely have to. Most modern phones and cameras can take decent photos in pretty low light, and your shots will look better if the flash is off. Even so, check the result after you've snapped a photo. It's possible there's not enough light, and you can adjust.
How to make your photos shine before your share them
The next tool in your photography toolbox are free photo editing apps and software, like Adobe's Photoshop Express, Google's Snapseed and even the manual adjustments in Instagram. They all allow you to easily change the look of a photo, often dramatically. Yes, there are stock filters everyone uses on their photos, but play with the toggles and see what each setting does. It may seem daunting at first, but basic adjustments are easy and make a big difference.
Nearly every photo will benefit from subtle tweaks to contrast, brightness, shadows and saturation. If you're not sure what those terms mean, check out the apps and experiment with some of your own photos. On my Instagram account, I adjust my photos to be more visually interesting, a sort of idealized version of what you'd see in real life. Everyone has their own style, though. As you experiment, you'll start to figure out yours, and that variety and personalization are what makes photography awesome.
Don't be afraid to experiment
Experimenting is the key, no matter what camera you're using. For every amazing image a professional photographer takes, there will be hundreds, probably thousands, of images that are terrible and never see the light of day. Like everything, this takes practice and experimentation to see what works.
If you still want a fancy camera for your trip though, buy it well in advance to understand how it works. Play with the settings extensively. A complex camera left in "Auto" mode isn't going to be much different than the camera on a mid- to high-end phone. Maybe it will be a little better at night, or offer a real zoom, but this mode is like owning an expensive guitar and not using half the strings.
Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, has multiple camera suggestions. I recommend one of the smaller ones with a decent optical zoom (digital zooms on most phones are basically useless). A good small camera with myriad manual adjustments is an excellent tool to learn photography. Once you master that, you'll know exactly what you want in a full-size, interchangeable-lens camera.
Oh, and one last crucial tip for phones and cameras alike: Make sure your lenses are clean. Nothing ruins a photo more than a smudgy lens.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The NRA is facing legal scrutiny from state regulators, following internal leadership struggles that have spilled into the open.
In the past few days, discord in the group's leadership has bubbled into the public eye, and potential legal action against the group threatens its existence.
On Friday, the New York Attorney General's Office announced that it would be opening an investigation into the group's tax-exempt status.
The New York Times reported that the Attorney General's Office had sent letters to the NRA and its charitable foundation to preserve relevant financial records. Other businesses related to the NRA received subpoenas from the Attorney General's Office.
Because the NRA was originally chartered in New York in 1871, the New York Attorney General's Office has special jurisdiction over it. Although details were not immediately available as to what potential violations of nonprofit law were committed by the NRA, an investigation by the New Yorker detailed potential legal transgressions — the nonprofit's board might have breached their "duty of care" in not being made aware of malfeasance among the group's leadership. The board of directors has alleged signed off on some transactions and payments to individuals that would raise ethical and transparency concerns.
Breaches of "duty of care" are against the law in New York, which could result in enforcement actions against the organization.
Adding to the turmoil at the organization, also on Friday, a Wall Street Journal report revealed a feud between Oliver North, the group's president, and Wayne LaPierre, the Chief Executive Officer of the NRA. LaPierre had sent a letter to the board of the NRA alleging that North was blackmailing him over potential financial improprieties and was forcing him to resign.
Then, on Saturday, following media reports of financial mismanagement and further strife among the group's leadership, North told members at the NRA's annual convention that he would not serve a second term as president. Normally, NRA presidents serve for two terms. North had previously achieved notoriety for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration.
NRA power struggle: President Oliver North tells Indy convention he won't serve 2nd term
Feds: Russian operative tried to infiltrate National Rifle Association, other groups
The group has faced additional financial troubles over the past year. In November last year, The Trace reported that the NRA had eliminated free coffee and water coolers for employees at its headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia after the organization made budget cuts. It also froze the group's pension plan and raised its dues.
Despite the legal issues piling up at the organization, it will likely remain a formidable political force for the foreseeable future, still able to spend millions of dollars on elections and lobbying. Campaign finance totals calculated by the Center for Responsive Politics show that, during the 2017-2018 election cycle, the NRA spent $9. 4 million on independent expenditures, $10. 2 million on lobbying, and $710,654 on direct contributions to candidates.

Detroit startup has no profits, but could be worth $1B

Texto completo: Can a Detroit-based startup founded just three years ago and with no profits really be worth a billion dollars?
That's the story of StockX, the sneaker exchange and fine goods marketplace co-founded by businessman Dan Gilbert. A recent report in the market journal Recode reports that major investors are ready to put big money into StockX, giving the young firm a $1 billion valuation or "unicorn" status.
There are an estimated 150 or so unicorn firms in the United States, but not so many in this part of the country. StockX would mark the third time in the past couple of years that a Southeast Michigan startup firm has reached that lofty status.
Duo Security in Ann Arbor, which sells digital security systems, reached the billion-dollar valuation in 2017 and was acquired by Cisco last year for $2.35 billion. And OneStream Software, a Rochester-based firm that sells financial management software to major corporations, hit the billion-dollar valuation mark earlier this year with a major infusion of cash from the investment firm KKR.
But StockX remains the most curious example, both because it reached unicorn status faster than the others, and because its business model sounds so strange to more traditional corporate-minded folks.
For sneaker heads The background: Launched in 2016 with support from billionaire businessman Gilbert, StockX serves as an exchange matching those trying to sell collectible sneakers and those who badly want them. StockX accepts the sneakers from the sellers, authenticates that they're not counterfeit, posts them on its website for potential buyers to bid for them, and handles the exchange of shoes and money.
It's an updating of the very old idea of a market exchange. And like other exchanges back through history, StockX makes its money by both taking a flat transaction fee and a percentage of each sale. The privately held StockX doesn't release financial data, but CEO and co-founder Josh Luber told the New York Times that StockX generated about $2 million in gross sales each day. The company is growing rapidly, and already employs some 700 workers. It has added watches, handbags, and other collectibles to its lineup.
Like fine art High demand and a limited supply of product explain StockX's success. If most Americans view sneakers as mere footwear, a sizable fan base devours news of the latest Nike Air Yeezy 2 "Red October" sneaker or whatever the next sensation will be. Fans snap them up upon release, then re-sell them for a tidy profit.
StockX makes that reselling fast and easy. It doesn't make a product, just makes it more convenient for a secondary market in collectible goods to work. "I think the key word is limited edition," said David Brophy, a professor of business at the University of Michigan. "If you missed out on the Air Jordans when they were out and you love them, the price opportunity here is quite possibly secondary to the buyer. ... It's very similar in ways to the art market, anything for which there's one of a kind."
Possible pitfalls If market demand is strong and the business model innovative, unicorns like StockX still face potential pitfalls. The biggest worry is that there's some basic flaw in a business model. Uber and Lyft, the ride sharing services worth billions in the market, may never overcome their high costs, rapid turnover of drivers, and stiff competition to make significant profits.
And some unicorns like WeWork, which matches co-working space with renters who need as little as one desk and a phone, face another challenge. Their investment capital tends to be long term but their revenue comes from short-term leases. If a recession hits and demand collapses, it could find itself in big trouble.
And what Silicon Valley calls "blitzscaling" — incredibly rapid growth to gain market share at the expense of profits — makes sense for a time. But it can fall victim to competition. New entrants, after all, can take advantage of the same things that lured the first innovators, including cloud computing and the ubiquitous nature of smart phones and social media.
Those with longer memories remember the doc.com bust of a generation ago, when multiple promising startups grew fast but flamed out almost as quickly.
More solid ground But while other unicorn startups collapsed in spectacular fashion, Jeff Stoltman, a business professor at Wayne State University, said StockX appears to be on more solid ground.
"It doesn't look like a flawed market," Stoltman said. "They've pretty much established that the marketplace is there. So market risk doesn't seem to be there. I don't see regulatory risk. The competitive risk doesn't look to be all that significant. I don't really see the risk factors."
Brophy agreed.
"I'm very impressed that they'e come up with it and built a business model that seems to be working," he said. And it doesn't hurt that Gilbert, one of the biggest money men in town, is backing StockX.
"I don't think it's so unusual anymore that a company like this gets to the billion-dollar valuation," Brophy said. "It's not at all clear that they don't make it if they're not showing profit. They're reinvesting all of what you and I would call profit into expansion marketing."
Beyond profits Stoltman cites estimates that 80% of today's unicorn startups get to the point of an initial public stock offering before showing any profits.
"There's obviously something going on here that extends well beyond profit," he said. Rather, investors are looking at other signals, including the depth of the demand market and the ingenuity of the business model.
As a result, investors are betting on long-term success rather than short-term profits. That long-term success can come either with an initial public offering of stock, or by agreeing to be acquired by some much larger firm in the same field.
A happy fate like that may await StockX.
"This is not a magic box," Stoltman said. "This is a proven model. The fundamentals are there to get to profitability."
Detroit, accustomed to giant corporations producing billions in profits and enduring for generations, may look askance at this newer business model. But get used to it. There's probably a lot more like StockX, Duo Security, and OneStream on the way.

Texto completo: This is the week of Biden and Buttigieg. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="2222">
It is Joe Biden's week because he has finally declared for president, after much Hamlet-like, or feigned Hamlet-like, contemplation of the race. He is 76 and has been in politics almost all of his adult life (the U.S. Senate much of it). He has twice run for president and failed spectacularly. He served honorably and usefully as vice president under Barack Obama.
Mr. Biden's indecision about running in 2016, partly because he was in a state of deep grief over the death of his son and partly because the Democratic establishment had united behind Hillary Clinton, resulted in the non-run that actually could have worked out. It is very possible that, had he been nominated in 2016, he would be finishing his first term now. Unlike Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden is likable. And, unlike her, he might have held the union vote in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
Such are the ironies of politics and life.
But it is hard to shake the feeling that his moment has passed and that Mr. Biden is an almost impossible fit for this moment - 2020. He is like an actor who walks on stage for the wrong play. And he keeps apologizing.
That never helps any suitor.
He is also hobbled by something that, in a rational politics, would actually help him - long experience and knowledge of the federal system. Americans like something, and somebody, new. And in a presidential race, being new and having much of the press fascinated by you is the greatest advantage imaginable.
Being the front-runner early is never a safe place to be. Ask Jeb Bush.
And that brings us to Pete Buttigieg. He is new. And the press can't take its eyes off of him. There are good reasons, too.
Mayor Pete has three things going for him. First, he has a brain. He thinks. He even thinks about rock music, the New Testament and war. He is, for a politician, uncommonly thoughtful. This would be obvious even if he did not play the piano and speak Norwegian. Just listen to him.
Second, he conveys intellect without intellectualism. He comes off more like a soulful Methodist pastor than an Al Gore or Adlai Stevenson.
And third, he seems to be sincerely idealistic. He went from Harvard, Oxford and McKinsey&Company to the National Guard and service in Afghanistan. (Eight years in the guard and seven months in the war.) Why? He says he simply thought people of his level of privilege should share the burden with the young men and women from the working poor (sons and daughters of deplorables) who normally make up the volunteer Army.
Back in the day, he says, a guy like John F. Kennedy or George Herbert Walker Bush was expected to serve. And that is a good standard.
True enough. But it says something profound about Mr. Buttigieg that he volunteered and that this was his rationale: Of whom much has been given much should be required.
A cynic might say, "Well he knew he was going to be a politician and that war service would be helpful." But, think about it: Military service has not mattered, or mattered much, especially in the Democratic Party, for a long time now. It will not help Mr. Buttigieg appreciably in the Democratic presidential primaries. And the mayor of South Bend is nothing if not a rational actor. You do not risk your life in the hellish, unwinnable muck of Afghanistan for a line on a résumé or the theme for a 30-second commercial.
No, I believe the guy. He just might be a true servant leader. And at a moment when the nation feels weary and beat up, he is new. His appeal reminds me very much of Jimmy Carter in 1975 and Bill Clinton in 1991 and early 1992. Mr. Carter, in particular, was seen as an upbeat, independent and thoughtful. And, like those two men, Mayor Pete is also a centrist and pragmatist, not a leftist ideologue.
Of course Bill Clinton had fatal flaws and Jimmy Carter was not prepared for the presidency. Arguably, neither was Barack Obama or JFK - two others with incredible elan and self- possession at young ages.
Being mayor of a small city, or running a failed race for state treasurer or national party chairman, does not qualify a person to be president. Joe Biden is qualified. Few people know more about foreign policy, the judiciary and the justice system, or Congress than Mr. Biden.
He has also often been wrong. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe his mistakes are behind him. Maybe he has learned. But, mostly, he seems worn.
What a shame that the old and new cannot be combined. Alas, they cannot be. Youth must err with passion and flail and age must rage against the light it knows is dying.
Mr. Biden has a secret weapon. His heart. He has suffered. And this makes his compassion, in a party of fake compassion, real.
The boy mayor has a secret weapon, too. He can talk. He has a Reagan-like talent for direct, witty and unvarnished communication, as when he said he recognized bait when he saw it and would not take it. He's connecting right now. And he's threatening the assumed narrative. "Rivals are scrambling to dig up dirt on Pete Buttigieg," ran one recent headline.
The New York Times published a story with this headline: "How Pete Buttigieg's Meaningless Erudition Made Him the 'Smart' Candidate."
Can erudition be meaningless?
Never mind. If I am Mayor Pete, running as champion of the heartland, the outsider who is the anti-Trump, I want The New York Times against me.

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio confirmed Friday there was an intrusion into Florida's elections systems by hackers in 2016, according to the New York Times.
Rubio would not say who was behind the hacking, saying he was constrained by his position on the Senate Intelligence Committee, but the redacted version of the Mueller Report released April 18 stated the FBI believes "at least one Florida county" was infiltrated with malicious software sent out by Russian intelligence agents.
Rubio's statement contradicts the Florida Secretary of State's office, which maintained last week that its elections systems weren't hacked. Secretary Laurel Lee also said at the time that the FBI hadn't told the state which county they believe was compromised.
Rubio said the information was discovered through an intelligence operation, not a criminal investigation,
"Everybody has been told what it is they need to do to protect themselves from the intrusion," Rubio told the Times. "I don't believe the specific victims of the intrusion have been notified. The concern was that in a number of counties across the country, there are a couple of people with the attitude of: 'We've got this; we don't need your help. We don't think we need to do what you are telling us we need to do.'"
The hackers, were "in a position" to change voter roll information, he told the Times, but it didn't appear they did.
Gov. Ron DeSantis had said at a press conference in Orlando last week that he didn't believe any breach would have affected vote totals.
But in Miami on Thursday, according to Politico, he was critical of the FBI, telling reporters, "They won't tell us which county it was, are you kidding me? Why would you have not said something immediately?"
DeSantis and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott will meet with the FBI in coming weeks to discuss the Russian hacking attempts on Florida counties in 2016.
Scott's office said the FBI has reached out to him and is working on scheduling a briefing in the next few weeks. DeSantis' office said no date has yet been set.
The report stated that in November 2016, Russian intelligence officials "sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. election."
The emails contained an attached Word document with malicious "Trojan" software that would have permitted Russian intelligence to access the infected computer. But none of the 52 Florida counties that had contracts with VR Systems, the Tallahassee company who was allegedly impersonated, has admitted to opening that document.
Volusia County elections supervisor Lisa Lewis said Thursday the office opened one of the infected emails in 2016, but not the infected attachment. Broward County supervisor Peter Antonacci said this week the county received the email, but it was quarantined by anti-virus software and officials wouldn't have had the opportunity to open the attachment.
Last year, then-U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., warned Russians had gained access to Florida voter data but declined to identify which county or counties had been penetrated, saying the information was classified. No other officials backed up Nelson's claim, including Rubio, and Scott and national Republicans attacked Nelson for what GOP campaign emails called his "alarming claims" and "extremely reckless behavior."
Rubio did warn repeatedly in 2016 that "state election systems are potentially vulnerable to Russian cyber attacks."

Rubio contradicts state, says system was hacked
Sen. Marco Rubio confirmed Friday there was an intrusion into Florida's elections systems by hackers in 2016, according to The New York Times.

LAKEWOOD, Colo.
Four dead in fiery pileup caused by errant truck
Four people died after a semitruck hauling lumber lost control and plowed into vehicles on a crowded highway near Denver, triggering explosions and a fire so intense that it melted the roadway and metal off cars, authorities said Friday.
"It was crash, crash, crash and explosion, explosion, explosion," said John Romero, a spokesman for the Lakewood, Colorado, police department, describing the 28-vehicle chain reaction of blasts from ruptured gas tanks.
The truck driver, Rogel Lazaro Aguilera-Mederos, 23, of Houston, was arrested on suspicion of vehicular homicide as police investigate how the crash happened Thursday on Interstate 70.
Six people were taken to hospitals with injuries, but their conditions were unclear Friday.
"There is just a bunch of debris from this crash that took place. The carnage was significant, just unbelievable," said another department spokesman.
SAN FRANCISCO
Police: Man ran down people because of race
An Iraq War veteran deliberately drove into a group of pedestrians because he thought some of the people were Muslim, California authorities said Friday.
Isaiah Joel Peoples, 34, faces eight counts of attempted murder for injuring eight people, including four who remain hospitalized. The most seriously injured is a 13-year-old Sunnyvale girl who is in a coma with severe brain trauma.
"New evidence shows that the defendant intentionally targeted the victims based on their race and his belief that they were of the Muslim faith," Sunnyvale Police Chief Phan Ngo said.

Texto completo: FRONT PAGE
An article on Sunday about a web-based learning platform rolled out by public schools in Kansas mistakenly linked a recurrence of Megan Jackson's epileptic seizures to her middle school's use of the Summit Learning platform. While her school uses some of the same web-based tools that are used by Summit, the school is not on the Summit platform. The error was repeated in a picture caption.
An article on Friday about Anita Hill's reaction to a phone call from Joe Biden misquoted one part of Ms. Hill's response. She said, "There needs to be an apology to the other witnesses, and there needs to be an apology to the American public." She did not say that "he needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public."
PAGES A2-A3
Because of an editing error, an article last Saturday referred incorrectly to Jesus's background. While he lived in an area that later came to be known as Palestine, Jesus was a Jew who was born in Bethlehem.
INTERNATIONAL
An article on Friday about a cyclone in Mozambique misidentified the city from where Déborah Nguyen spoke. It was Johannesburg, not Beira.
NATIONAL
An article on Friday about Joe Biden's chances of winning the Democratic Party's nomination for president misstated the number of Democratic candidates in the race. With his entry in the race, there are 20 candidates, not 19.
NEW YORK
An article on Friday about Anna Sorokin's conviction on grand larceny charges misidentified a hotel that lost $ 11,000 to Ms. Sorokin. It was the Beekman Hotel, not the Beacon Hotel.
ARTS & LEISURE
An article on Page 20 about new operas in Berlin misspells a composer's given name. It is Detlev Glanert, not Detlef.
SCIENCE TIMES
An article on Tuesday about a possible ban on the international trade of Asian small-clawed otters included a quotation from a biologist that described incorrectly an increase in the popularity of pet otters. The increase has been exponential, not logarithmic.
OPINION
An Op-Ed article on Monday about digital privacy misstated who uncovered the selling of location information by AccuWeather. It was the security analyst Will Strafach, not The New York Times.
OBITUARIES
An obituary on April 20 about James W. McCord Jr., who led the burglars in the Watergate break-in, referred incorrectly to the disposition of the cases against Mr. McCord and E. Howard Hunt. Mr. McCord, not Mr. Hunt, was convicted in a federal trial; Mr. Hunt, not Mr. McCord, pleaded guilty.
An obituary on Thursday about Verena Wagner Lafferentz, the last surviving grandchild of Richard Wagner, misstated the difference in age between her and Adolf Hitler, with whom she was romantically linked. He was three decades older than her, not two.
A picture caption with an obituary on Friday about the organist Marilyn Mason, using information from the University of Michigan, misstated when the photograph of Dr. Mason there was taken. It was in the 1960s, not the 1950s.
An obituary on Thursday about Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg misstated the nature of his participation in the Allied invasion of France in 1944. He arrived in Normandy in the days after D-Day, when troops first landed on the beaches there -- not on D-Day itself. In addition, the headline with the obituary misstated his age. As the obituary correctly noted, he was 98, not 88.

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week in Washington: an eye on 2020, a five hour town hall on cable news, and some of the delegation weighs in on impeachment. So let’s get on with it.
Minnesota’s District #1 is Democrats’ #1 target in Minnesota
After five years of running, Rep. Jim Hagedorn, MN-1, finally won a seat in Congress in 2018. But that win came with a caveat: he won with the smallest margin in Minnesota and one of the smallest margins in 2018: .4 percent or 1,311 votes.
Considering Hagedorn’s association with President Trump’s tariffs and razor thin election margin in 2018, it’s not hard to see why Hagedorn is the only member currently being targeted by House Democrats in 2020. Read more here…
The five-hour town hall
On Monday, CNN hosted a five hour “Hunger Games”-style town hall, with several 2020 candidates taking on an hour of questions each. The event kicked off with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who reiterated her positions of moderation in the face of a 2020 field that has shifted to the left. You can read the full transcript here, but here are some highlights:
Free community college
Klobuchar reiterated her position on free college and the possibility of debt cancellation ( essentially: no ), instead advocating for free two year community college: “I wish I could staple a free college diploma under every one of your chairs. I do. Don’t look. It’s not there,” she said. Instead, Klobuchar advocated for free community college, the expansion of Federal Pell Grants, and refinancing student loan interest rates.
Bring back the public option
Again distancing herself from the field, Klobuchar also doesn’t support Medicare for All, instead backing the creation of a public option (or publicly run healthcare plan), as well as a reduction in cost for pharmaceuticals.
Is pizza a vegetable?
Klobuchar apologized for her prior position that frozen pizza would count as a vegetable , after being prompted by Harvard student Thomas Satterthwaite. “Ok that’s a big question,” she said. The student was referring to a letter Klobuchar sent to the Department of Agriculture about the National School Lunch Program, expressing concern that tomato sauce used on pizza and some salsa products would no longer be “factored into the weekly requirements for vegetables.”
You can watch her response here.
Klobuchar’s record as a prosecutor
When she had the chance to address it, Klobuchar took the time to note that when she was a prosecutor in Hennepin County, she made several innovations: working to change the way witness ID worked, as well as emphasize diversionary programs. Something else to note, though, is when Klobuchar said: “We actually did see African-American incarceration — prison incarceration go down by 13 percent.” What she left out, according to Jasmine Heiss at the Vera Institute, was that “American prison admission rates were still 22 times higher than white prison admission rates in 2006,” the time that she left office. You can read about this, and more, in the this piece from Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler: “Klobuchar cites bad data to claim credit for reducing black incarceration.”
What wasn’t asked?
One question for Sen. Klobuchar that didn’t come up: Does she support letting people that are currently incarcerated vote? The conversation was brought into the 2020 field by Sen. Bernie Sanders , who voiced support for the idea. Mayor Pete Buttegieg flatly shot down the idea during the town hall. Earlier in the night, when Klobuchar spoke, she said “There is racism in our criminal justice system and we must pledge to fix it.” While she has in the past advocated that people that were formerly incarcerated should have their voting rights restored, she has yet to be prompted on the question of people that are currently incarcerated.
It’s worth putting those two ideas together, not just for Sen. Klobuchar, but the entire 2020 field: If they believe that the criminal justice system is racist and has put people in prison for the wrong reasons, but don’t believe those people should vote, how do they reconcile these two ideas? MinnPost reached out to the Klobuchar campaign press team for a statement and did not receive a response.
Where the delegation stands on impeachment proceedings
Following the publication of the 400+ page Mueller Report, Democrats (against the urging of House leadership) are again pushing for impeachment proceedings. Several Democrats have tried to initiate impeachment proceedings over the last few years, for a variety of reasons, from the President’s response to white supremacists in Charlottesville, VA to his business dealings both domestically and abroad. Both Attorney General Keith Ellison and Governor Tim Walz called for impeachment proceedings while they were still members of the U.S. House.
As of now, no House Republicans have called for impeachment, but here’s what Democrats in the delegation are saying:
Yes
* Rep. Ilhan Omar: “Impeachment is part of our constitutional responsibility. We have an obligation to investigate whether the President committed impeachable offenses.” – Twitter, April. 18
* Rep. Betty McCollum : “The evidence against President Trump is overwhelming and building daily.” – Press Release, Jan. 29 . McCollum’s call for impeachment was related to the president’s violation of the emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officeholders from receiving gifts or payment from a foreign state, but you can read her statement on the Mueller report here.
Need more information
* Rep. Dean Phillips : “I think we have more to learn. So I think at this point, it’s no, not yet. There is more to learn, the report is deeply troubling.” – WCCO, Apr. 21
* Rep. Angie Craig: “I believe the next step is for Congress to request the unredacted version of the report, for the committee chairmen to call a number of folks forward and for those folks to fill in the facts for the American people.” – New York Times, Apr. 24
* Sen. Tina Smith: “ As the report outlines, Congress now has a role to play, and there are many questions we need to have answered. We need hearings with both the Attorney General and Robert Mueller.” – Facebook, Apr. 18
Other
* Sen. Amy Klobuchar : “ I believe that I am the jury here, so I’m not going to predispose things,” Klobuchar said at the CNN Town Hall, suggesting that because the Senate ultimately passes judgement on impeachment, it would be inappropriate to comment. (It’s worth noting that her colleague on the Senate and in the 2020 field, Sen. Elizabeth Warren , has called for impeachment proceedings.) Klobuchar did, however, say she saw in the Mueller Report “disturbing things that would lead you to believe there’s obstruction of justice.”
Writing Ilhan Omar’s story
Finally, MPR’s Briana Bierschbach wrote an extensive profile of Rep. Ilhan Omar’s rise and eventual seat in the House. Yesterday, the profile was featured on NPR’s All Things Considered. The profile ends on this note from Rep. Omar: “No matter what you do, your story will be written. The best that you can do for yourself and those around you is make sure that you are living the story that you want to be written about you.”
What else
* Former Minnesota Sixth Congressman Mark Kennedy was the sole finalist selected for the position of president of the University of Colorado. “I’m just disappointed the university did not select a leader with a better record on civil rights,” said Mardi Moore, executive director of LGBTQ advocacy organization Out Boulder County.
* The Supreme Court looks ready to decide in favor of allowing a question about citizenship on the next census, potentially driving down the response rate.
* Former Vice President Joe Biden is running for President, likely on a platform of moderation (and infrastructure). As of now, it’s unclear how his platform will differ from that of Sen. Klobuchar, who has already offered a vision of moderation, appeal to “heartland voters,” and an infrastructure plan.
Quote of the week
“No, I didn’t think that frozen pizza with tomato sauce on it, I do not believe should be counted as a vegetable.” – Sen. Amy Klobuchar, CNN Town Hall

Joe Biden’s long history in office has left him with a clear record on how he felt crime policy should look. What did that mean? Harsher sentencing for drug dealers, more prisons, and a “tough on crime” policy record.
That’s all for this week. Thanks for sticking around. Until next week, feel free to send tips, suggestions, and sound advice to: gschneider@minnpost.com. Follow at @gabeschneider .

Texto completo: Some kids play soccer. Other kids make slime. Guess who has more money for college?
Take, for example, Rancho Santa Margarita teen Nick Werfelmann. The Tesoro High student and social media slime sensation just bought a 2019 Tesla Model 3 for $45,000. With cash. He’s 16.
You can meet him Sunday, April 28, at the SoCal Slime Bonanza at The District at Tustin Legacy. He’ll be among 40 of Southern California’s social media slime celebs selling their creations.
Ashley Kua, 16, will also be there. The Valencia girl has 1 million followers on her Instagram account @slimeyoda. Off the top of her head, she said she has about $300,000 in slime profits saved up for college, give or take.
If you are completely confused about how slime turns into money then go online right now and punch in the word slime.
Thousands of videos will pop up: mesmerizing close-ups of hands methodically poking, slapping, stretching and caressing colorful blobs and bowls of slime. This isn’t the gross green slime you see on Nickelodeon, by the way. We’re talking about slime that resembles liquid and makes a splashy sound when you play with it. Slime that is fluffed up with shaving cream or jiggly like Jell-0.
Some slimes are a translucent sea green that you can plunge your hands into, others are like rainbow-colored taffy.
As pretty as they look, the real appeal is the sound they make when they are manipulated. Depending on the ingredients you add (foam beads, Vaseline, instant snow) they might crackle, crunch, or even make a slurping sound. Think of the satisfaction of popping bubble wrap and you get the idea.
Young and old alike have sworn by the therapeutic value of slime videos. Some even say they get an autonomous sensory meridian response: a relaxing tingle, often starting in your scalp and traveling south, triggered by a soft, repetitive sound.
Now, stay alert, because this is where the money comes in. Slimer kids (and most are kids) don’t just make free videos for you to watch; they sell their creations. Nick has sold about 14,000 slimes, he guesses, since making his first video when he was 14 years old — on Feb. 21, 2017 (he has the date memorized). They sell for $5 to $15 (for a 16-ounce container).
Nearly 500,000 fans follow his Instagram accounts @itsslimetyme and @theveganslimer. Most of his customers are girls ages 10 to 15, but he does get comments from older clients saying that playing with his slimes help their anxiety and their arthritis.
Nick’s biggest seller is his Strawberry Twizzler, which smells like strawberry licorice. A video of his hands kneading a giant mound of Strawberry Twizzler has gotten 11 million views.
Perhaps the most viewed slime video of all time, though, was made by a former Riverside waitress named Karina Garcia, a.k.a The Slime Queen, according to a New York Times story.
As of today, a video of her making a 100-pound slime ball has gotten more than 26 million views. When the Times story came out (July 2017), she also had advertising partnerships worth up to $200,000 — a month. But then, she has a YouTube channel with 9 million subscribers.
All slimes, by the way, begin with basic ingredients that are both cheap and easy to find: glue and Borax and food dyes and essential oils. Some of the scents are mouth-watering.
Ashley’s biggest seller is her I Loaf You Puff.
“It literally smells like dinner rolls,” she says. “And it feels super smooth, really velvety.”
Her other top seller is Yummy Gummy Freeze, which smells like tropical fruit and feels cold in your hands, like a Slushee.
The junior at Trinity Classical Academy, a private school in Valencia, dreamed of med school but now that her slime sales are booming she wants to study business or advertising, preferably at Stanford, Duke, University of Pennsylvania or Brown. She’s hoping her slime profits will cover tuition.
Ashley said she got into slime two years ago after seeing a video and instantly feeling relaxed.
“It’s, OK, I have a 10-minute break, let me play with some slime,” she says. “When I’m stressed out, when I feel kind of fidgety, it’s something I can squish; kind of like a stress ball, but better.”
Ashley has sold about 25,000 slimes online and another 15,000 at conventions, mixing up batches when she’s not doing homework or playing in tennis tournaments.
Nick says he ships up to 400 orders a week; thus the Tesla. He uses it to make post office runs.
The car purchase didn’t wipe him out, by the way. He guesses he’s got another $20,000 to $30,000 for college (plus another year of sales before graduating high school). He couldn’t give an exact total because it’s in several accounts and he hasn’t added it all up lately.
The Tesla arrived several weeks ago. In a role reversal, his parents have taken to borrowing it.
“It’s like kinda crazy,” says Nick, who’s only had his driver’s license for eight months. “I just go with the flow. My parents are really supportive.”

MEASLES CASES IN ADULTS ON RISE

Texto completo: Measles cases are on the rise statewide this year, with 15 new cases reported just last week. And those numbers reveal a disturbing new trend: About three-quarters of this year's 38 reported cases occurred in adults who had never received vaccinations or had partial vaccinations.
California public health officials said Thursday that the San Francisco Bay Area has reported 10 confirmed cases of measles this year, most of them linked to unvaccinated adults exposed through international travel. Four were in Santa Clara County, four in San Mateo County, one in San Francisco County and one in Santa Cruz County.
"If you are traveling to a part of the world with elevated measles cases, you should know if you are vaccinated," said Dr. Karen Smith, director of the California Department of Public Health.
This year's pattern of disease is different than in prior years, when the majority of cases were seen in unvaccinated children.
Health officials worry that infected adult travelers could transmit it to children, who could spread the highly contagious virus through day care facilities and schools. UNICEF reported Thursday that "nearly 170 million children worldwide, including more than 2.5 million in the United States and half a million in Britain, missed out on the first dose of the measles vaccine during the past eight years," according to a story in The New York Times.
The measles cases were brought to California from people who visited the Philippines, Thailand, India, Ukraine and Cambodia, where very large measles outbreaks are occurring, Smith said.
"We have an adult population that is unvaccinated in California," she said. "When that pool of unvaccinated adults travels to places where there there is an outbreak  it is imported into California."
Many adults attended school before vaccines were mandatory, she explained. Others moved here from parts of the world where vaccines are less available.
Measles, a preventable disease, once had been effectively eliminated from our country. Now it is resurging.
New cases in the United States have exceeded the highest number on record in a single year since the disease was thought to have been eliminated in 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday.
Nationwide, 695 cases of the illness have been reported in 22 states this year, according to the CDC. That's more than the 667 cases reported in all of 2014, another dangerous year.
The largest outbreak is in New York City, centered in a predominantly Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn, with 334 cases there this year, according to The New York Times. Authorities link it to travel to an annual Hasidic pilgrimage from Israel to Ukraine, nations with major outbreaks.
In a typical year, California experiences between 10 and 25 cases. There were only 22 cases all of last year. The last major outbreak was in 2015, with 125 cases.
There was a major uptick last week, with 15 new cases reported statewide, Smith said. That compares with 11 cases at this time in 2018.
Of the 38 2019 cases, 14 were in international travelers, 22 were spread from travelers to people in California, and two are of unknown origin.
In addition to the 10 Bay Area cases, other affected California counties include Los Angeles with six cases and Placer and Sacramento with three cases each. There have been 16 total cases in Butte, Shasta, Tehama and Calaveras counties.
On Thursday, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health issued a quarantine for the UCLA and Cal State Los Angeles campuses because of possible exposure to a student who was infected, according to a news report by ABC7. The quarantine affected more than 100 people who will be tested for immunity to the disease, the station reported.
While most of this year's cases did not trigger large outbreaks of the disease, there were four incidents, including one in the Bay Area, where one sick person spread it to more than three other people. That Bay Area outbreak is now over.
Health officials confirmed in March that at least three Bay Area residents in Santa Clara, San Francisco and Santa Cruz counties contracted measles, two of them from the other person on the same airplane flight. In February, a Santa Cruz County resident with measles was on an international flight that landed at San Francisco International Airport, according to the Santa Clara County Public Health Department. It's unclear whether that person knew he or she had measles at the time. Since then, two other passengers on that flight caught the disease one from San Francisco and the other from Santa Clara County.
About 65 percent of infected Californians had not been vaccinated, said Dr. Gil F. Chavez, deputy director of the state's Center for Infectious Diseases. About 10 percent had just one dose of the two-dose vaccine. The rest had been vaccinated but were not fully protected, he said.
Exceedingly contagious, the measles virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person who may not yet feel sick has left a room.
"That is why we pay so much attention to vaccination," Smith said. "It is the single most powerful tool to protect public health."

North Korea Gave U.S. Medical Bill For Student

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- North Korea billed the Trump administration $ 2 million for the medical care of Otto F. Warmbier, an imprisoned American student who had fallen into a coma, before agreeing to release him in 2017.
A senior American diplomat negotiating for Mr. Warmbier's freedom accepted the bill, and Mr. Warmbier was released. He died six days later in the United States, after his parents decided to end the life support that was sustaining his vegetative state.
The bill was passed from the State Department to the Treasury Department. As of early 2018, the bill had not been paid, and it is unclear if the Trump administration has since sent any of the amount to North Korea. A payment would be widely seen as handing over ransom money, running counter to the administration's stated policy for hostage negotiations.
The account of the bill from North Korea was first reported by The Washington Post on Thursday. A person familiar with the events confirmed the details to The New York Times.
"We do not comment on hostage negotiations, which is why they have been so successful during this administration," Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday.
Officials at the State Department and Treasury declined to comment.
The death of Mr. Warmbier has remained a persistent shadow over relations between the United States and North Korea, even though President Trump has eagerly opened diplomatic talks with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, to end its nuclear weapons program.
During a February summit meeting in Vietnam between the two leaders, Mr. Trump was asked at a news conference whether he and Mr. Kim had discussed Mr. Warmbier's plight. Mr. Trump said, "He tells me that he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word."
Mr. Warmbier's parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, issued a statement afterward, saying "Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto."
Mr. Warmbier was a University of Virginia student from Ohio who joined a tour to North Korea in December 2015. In early January 2016, right before leaving the capital, Pyongyang, he was arrested on charges related to trying to take down a propaganda poster in a hotel. He was sentenced that March to 15 years of prison and hard labor, but fell into a coma during his detention. American doctors have never been able to determine the cause.
In June 2017, North Korean officials told American diplomats that Mr. Warmbier was in a coma. Joseph Yun, the former special representative for North Korea, traveled to Pyongyang to negotiate for his release. An accompanying American doctor examined Mr. Warmbier, who had been comatose for most of his 17 months in prison.
North Korean officials presented Mr. Yun with the $ 2 million bill and asked him to sign an agreement to pay it before leaving with Mr. Warmbier.
In December, Mr. Warmbier's parents sued North Korea in an American court over their son's death and were awarded with $ 501 million. It is unlikely that the parents will ever collect the money from Mr. Kim's government.
North Korea released three American prisoners in May 2018, one month before Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim held their first summit meeting in Singapore.
In 2016, Mr. Trump criticized President Barack Obama for giving Iran $ 400 million that Mr. Obama contended at the time was meant to reimburse Iran for military equipment it bought before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Iranian government had been trying to recover the money for decades.
Mr. Trump and other Republican politicians have said the $ 400 million was a ransom payment for four American prisoners freed from Iran in January 2016 after successful talks over a nuclear deal.

Anita Hill demands Biden apologize to America for 'gender violence'

Texto completo: Anita Hill said she unsatisfied after former Vice President Joe Biden, who launched his 2020 presidential campaign Thursday, called her earlier this month to say he had regret over “what she endured” while testifying against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

“I cannot be satisfied by simply saying I’m sorry for what happened to you. I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose,” she told the New York Times.

Hill, who testified to Congress in 1991 that Thomas had sexually harassed her, said she would not consider supporting Biden, who was then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, until he accepts responsibility for the questioning she endured while testifying.

She also said recent allegations of Biden inappropriately touching women were troubling.

“The focus on apology to me is one thing,” she said. “But he needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw. And not just women. There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence.”

Biden said in January he thought Hill deserved an apology, but the two apparently did not speak until earlier this month, before Biden declared his candidacy.

“They had a private discussion where he shared with her directly his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country,” said Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager.

Biden said last month that Hill “faced a committee that didn’t fully understand what the hell this was all about. To this day, I regret I couldn’t give her the kind of hearing she deserved. I wish I could have done something.”

Texto completo: The Associated Press
CHEROKEE - Iowa Republican Steve King says the criticism he has faced from fellow members of Congress over his offensive remarks gives him "better insight" into what Jesus Christ experienced when he was persecuted for his beliefs.
King was attending a town hall meeting Tuesday in his home district in northwest Iowa when someone attending voiced concern about Christianity being persecuted in the U.S., the Sioux City Journal reported . King answered, in part, by drawing a comparison to facing his "accusers" on the House floor.
"When I have to step down to the floor of the House of Representatives, and look up at those 400-and-some accusers ... you know we just passed through Easter and Christ's passion ... and I have better insight into what he went through for us partly because of that experience," King said.
The House voted, 424-1, in January to rebuke King for remarks he made to The New York Times in which he asked why the terms white nationalist and white supremacist came to be considered offensive. King was also stripped of his committee assignments for two years.
King did not initially deny making the remarks to the Times and even cast a vote in support of his public rebuke. He has since said the Times mischaracterized his comments and on Tuesday said the newspaper had misquoted him.
The controversy sparked numerous calls for King's resignation, including the editorial boards of at least four daily newspapers with circulations in his district.
King has long been known for making caustic comments, especially on issues related to race and immigration.
Shortly before his November re-election - the closest contest he has faced in his nine terms - the Washington Post reported that King met in Austria with the far-right Freedom Party, which has Nazi ties.
King also has called for an electrified fence on the U.S. southern border, defended racial profiling as a needed component of law enforcement and has suggested white people made more contributions to civilization than other groups.

Texto completo: When he told the president that a “real lawyer” takes notes, then-White House counsel Don McGahn showed he understood a lawyer’s proper function. He knew that a lawyer’s job is to advise clients about what the law allows and also what it prohibits. Notes are a symbol of a deeper reality — that truth and facts are at the core of the rule of law, and that lawyers are the guardians of those values.
President Donald Trump's ongoing assault on the rule of law seeks most basically to prevent lawyers from performing this role. Leading up to the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, we saw multiple news accounts, some based on unidentified administration officials and other sources, about a president directing law enforcement agents to ignore judicial orders; working to hollow out a vital domestic law enforcement agency, the Department of Homeland Security, because its leaders will not bend to his will; and suggesting that he will punish his political opponents by targeting them for adverse actions.
And to facilitate those and other actions, the president has taken steps to remove lawyers and other officials from their positions because they adhere to the rule of law and refuse to permit him to ignore it. A president should not fire his Homeland Security secretary for refusing to follow an illegal directive. A president cannot order the Department of Justice to investigate his political opponents for fictitious crimes, as The New York Times reports, and no president should ever contemplate ordering immigration authorities to release detainees in the home cities of his political opponents.

Barr's Mueller report rollout was disgraceful. I can't believe it but I miss Jeff Sessions.
What would Republicans do with a Mueller report? Build an impeachment case.
I've warned that impeachment talk is dangerous, but the time has come: Laurence Tribe
We should be especially concerned by pressure on lawyers and threats to oust them. They are the ones forcing this administration to hew to statutory and constitutional limitations. The resiliency of the American experiment and the power of traditional ideals of limited government, the rule of law, and checks on executive authority are, to a very real degree, in these lawyers’ hands.
McGahn stood up to Trump, Barr did not
And now the Mueller report gives us even more evidence of the president’s disdain for legal constraints. Three times he asked McGahn to assist him in legally dubious acts. Three times McGahn refused. McGahn refused to tell Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation; he refused to fire Mueller; and he refused to lie about the president’s requests that he fire Mueller. He stood in defense of the rule of law. The president, by contrast, said he wished his attorney was Roy Cohn — a man who was disbarred from the practice of law for his criminality and dishonesty.
Also disturbing is the recent conduct of Attorney General William Barr, our nation’s chief law enforcement officer. Mueller’s report convincingly demonstrates systematic actions by the president to obstruct an ongoing criminal investigation, irrespective of whether a sitting president can be indicted. Despite this, the attorney general, acting more like a presidential defense attorney than a representative of the American public, ignored the impact of Mueller's negative findings and stated refusal to exculpate the president from a charge of obstruction.
Lawyers are a bulwark against chaos
These and other recent steps to secure a narrow political advantage by impairing our legal institutions and undermining faith in them are a gross offense to the idea that no man or woman is above the law. In the end, all of our liberties, and our democratic system of government, depend upon maintaining the rule of law by reliance on the independent judiciary, the separation of powers and limited government.
Shakespeare knew the dangers of what President Trump is doing. In "Henry VI," Dick the butcher and Jack Cade are plotting a traitorous revolution against society and they recognize that the first thing they need to do to create chaos, eliminate liberty, and advance autocracy is to destroy what binds a society together — that is, to end the rule of law that is a bulwark against authoritarian rule. And so they say, “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers. ”

Judge says no beach without ankle bracelet

Texto completo: Ahead of a trip to Hawaii, Michael Lacey, who stands accused of using the shuttered Backpage website to aid prostitution, filed what apparently seemed to him a modest request:
Could he have his ankle monitor removed so he could enjoy the beach on his vacation?
His attorneys said the motion wasn't just for recreation, but for health reasons. Lacey had a brief hospital stay, the motion said, that served as a wake-up call.
Lacey has put on weight and takes high blood pressure medication, according to his filing. His preferred aerobic activity, according to the motion, was swimming, something the ankle monitor prevents him from doing.
He even noted that the officer assigned to monitor him had no objection to the monitor being removed.
The government, in reply, forcefully argued the monitor should not be removed and, in doing so, revealed new details in the year-old case against Lacey and the other former Backpage executives charged in the case. The new evidence, the prosecutors said, could make Lacey a greater flight risk.
But on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Brnovich, who was assigned the case in March, heard arguments and decided the monitor should stay on. Lacey, she suggested, could find activities out of the water.
Lacey has worn the ankle monitor since he was released from custody on April 18, 2018, after posting a $1 million bond.
He was charged as part of a 100-count indictment that included charges of facilitating prostitution and money laundering. Also named in the indictment were James Larkin, the website's other co-founder, Scott Spear, a former executive vice president, and John "Jed" Brunst, the website's former chief financial officer.
All four of those men were also executives of New Times, a Phoenix alternative weekly that grew into an empire that eventually included New York's Village Voice.
The Backpage website took its name from the actual back page of classified ads that sold for a premium in the printed editions of New Times.
A New Times employee named Carl Ferrer, seeing the migration of classified advertising to the digital sphere, convinced Lacey and Larkin to start the website.
Ferrer has since pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit prostitution charges on behalf of both himself and Backpage and has agreed to testify against his former bosses.
Attorneys for Lacey and three other Backpage executives charged in the case filed a motion Monday that the charges be dropped.
"The government's conduct of this case reflects an alarming disregard for the rule of law and constitutional norms," the motion read.
Prosecutors have not yet filed a response to that motion. It was not discussed at length during Tuesday's hearing.
Argument: Fight, not flight Backpage, whose revenue came primarily from adult-oriented ads, became the target of civil lawsuits and criminal complaints. Lacey has vociferously fought charges that his website did anything wrong.
His desire to defend himself in court was used in his motion to remove his ankle monitor. His filing said he wouldn't flee because he remains committed to beating the charges regarding Backpage. The motion also noted Lacey's longstanding ties to the Phoenix area.
The government, in its arguments that the ankle monitor remains, said the case against Lacey has grown stronger over the past year.
"[S]ince his arrest, the weight of the evidence against Lacey has increased," the government wrote in the document, "and so has his exposure to a lengthy prison sentence if convicted."
Among the new evidence prosecutors included in their April motion were emails between Backpage executives, including Lacey, and a public relations firm. Those emails, the government says, include an admission by Lacey that Backpage ads were used for child sex trafficking. That seeming admission came in an email from Lacey to a public relations manager crafting a response to the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, who asked about a 13-year-old girl allegedly sold on Backpage.
In an email, Lacey compared underaged girls being advertised on Backpage with underage patrons at drinking establishments. "Of course there are kids who get through system," Lacey wrote in a January 2012 email included in the government's motion. "As there are in bars."
Plea agreement used as evidence The government also pointed to a pair of cases in which courts imposed sanctions on Backpage for fraudulent statements. In both cases, the courts used the plea agreement entered into by Backpage as evidence against Lacey, Larkin and the other defendants.
Those courts, in Illinois and Washington, argued that Backpage executives were being deceitful while defending themselves against allegations of soliciting prostitution.
The federal prosecutors in Phoenix, in their motion, signaled they intend to use Backpage's plea deal as evidence against Lacey.
Backpage's guilty plea was agreed to by the website's chief executive officer, Ferrer, as part of his plea deal as an individual.
Also pleading guilty to charges in the case was Dan Hyer, who was the sales and marketing director of Backpage.
The government's filing says that "Lacey certainly cannot claim he was unaware of Backpage's facilitation of prostitution, especially in light of Ferrer's, Hyer's and Backpage's recent guilty pleas."
Lacey, in his reply to the government, noted that the plea agreement was based on a sworn statement by Ferrer, not Lacey, who has consistently vowed to fight the charges.
Lacey's reply also cites case law that says courts should be wary of accepting plea deals as evidence as they often reflect what the government wishes to hear, not necessarily the truth.
Ferrer in his guilty plea said that he knew the "great majority" of escort ads on Backpage were ads for prostitution. He also said escort ads provided most of Backpage's revenue.
Hyer, in his plea deal, said he knew ads on the website were offering "illegal prostitution services." Hyer, in his plea, said Backpage edited the ads to make them less overt, but those changes "did nothing to change the services being offered."
Hyer also said he and another executive at the website used the term "models" in emails to refer to girls who appeared under 18. The reason, he said, was to avoid "looking bad in a lawsuit."
'A powerful incentive to flee' The government argued that Lacey, even if convicted of a fraction of the charges, would likely spend the rest of his life in prison. "Such exposure creates a powerful incentive to flee," prosecutors argued.
However, attorneys for the Backpage defendants attempted to toss out the entire case with its motion filed on Monday. That motion argues the government brought the case under a faulty theory of law.
The government brought the charges against the Backpage executives using 50 specific ads that were posted on the website, the motion says, but has no evidence the executives knew anything about those ads.
The motion contends that the government needs to point to specific ads and prove that the executives knew about each specifically and intended them to be used for prostitution.
The government needs to be specific, the motion contends, and not accuse the executives of generalized conduct since they have specific rights under the First Amendment to publish freely.
"Just as the government cannot assume books are obscene if they are sold in an adult bookstore, it cannot presume escort ads are for prostitution," the motion reads.
In more mundane matters in the argument over the ankle monitor, the government said Lacey knew of the conditions of his release, including the ankle bracelet, when he agreed to them and that nothing had changed.
Judge Brnovich said from the bench on Tuesday that Lacey provided no compelling reason why he couldn't partake in cycling, using a treadmill or other aerobic activities besides swimming.

Not criminal, but not ethical either: Mueller reignites a political debate

Texto completo: The Mueller report is bringing questions of ethics and morality in government once again to the forefront of a vigorous public debate.
Jammed with primary sources, special counsel Robert Mueller’s 448-page journey into the inner workings of the Trump campaign and early presidency pops with detail: It is a tale of palace intrigue, deceit, and attempts to collaborate with a foreign power and hinder a federal investigation.
The report lays bare copious contacts between Russians and Trump associates during the campaign, though it finds no criminal conspiracy. It also chronicles 10 episodes that Mr. Mueller investigated for potential obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump, leaving a final verdict to Congress.
“Robert Mueller uncovered a lot of smelly, uncomfortable stuff,” says Gil Troy, an expert on the U.S. presidency at McGill University in Montreal. “As an American citizen, I get encouragement that our law enforcement officials in very high-profile cases are careful not to throw people into the courts, let alone jail, without a very high standard of proof. That’s my happy takeaway.”
Professor Troy’s “unhappy takeaway” comes when he looks more broadly at the behavior of President Trump and some of those around him as well as the scandals that embroiled both President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, the Democrats’ 2016 presidential nominee.
“I find that too many of our leaders think that not being indictable is the moral standard for leadership,” Mr. Troy says. “That’s not my standard.”
Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani inadvertently brought the question of moral versus criminal standards to the fore over the weekend on CNN, saying “There’s nothing wrong with taking information from Russians.” Mr. Giuliani was referring to the infamous Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 between senior Trump campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer offering “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton.
Such a contribution from a foreign national might have violated federal election law, though at the meeting no information about Mrs. Clinton was produced. Still, many observers commented that the offer of help from a hostile foreign power should have led the president’s son to contact the FBI. Instead, the junior Mr. Trump’s emailed reaction was “I love it.”
But when the ethics of a campaign taking information from a foreign source was raised, Mr. Giuliani pushed back. “We’re going to get into morality?” he asked. “That isn’t what prosecutors look at – morality.” 
Politics or principle?  American history is replete with examples of leaders who violated commonly accepted morals. Some were protected from scrutiny at the time, including by the press. Those who were exposed sometimes found a public willing to move on, sometimes not.
Almost always, elections are the preferred reset button.
Public versus private morality remains an important if occasionally murky distinction. Adultery, for example, remains unacceptable to many Americans but isn’t an impeachable offense. It was lying under oath and obstructing justice that formed the basis of President Clinton’s impeachment.
President Richard Nixon, mired in the Watergate scandal, resigned when faced with certain impeachment and expulsion. But no other president has been forced from office early. Short of impeachment, a step twice taken by the House, there’s also the option of a censure in cases of ethical violations. The Senate has adopted such a resolution against a president only once: against Andrew Jackson in 1834.
Some Trump critics, concerned by the political risks and impact on the country of impeachment, have proposed that Congress censure Mr. Trump. To others, censure is not enough.
“This is not about politics; this is about principle,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic candidate for president, in a CNN town hall on Monday. She supports impeaching Mr. Trump.
“To ignore a president’s repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country,” Senator Warren tweeted last Friday.
Among congressional Republicans, the near-silence following the Mueller report has been deafening.
In the Senate’s Republican caucus, Mitt Romney of Utah has been alone in speaking out forcefully. In a statement issued last Friday, the freshman senator said he was “sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the president.”
Some of the Trump loyalists of today, who gloss over the wrongdoing laid out in the Mueller report, went hard after Mr. Clinton during his impeachment in 1999.
“You don’t even have to be convicted of a crime to lose your job in this constitutional republic if [the Senate] determines that your conduct as a public official is clearly out of bounds in your role,” said then-Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., at the time. “Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.”
This week, now-Senator Graham tweeted that “using the Mueller report as a basis for impeachment would be an unhinged act of political retribution.”
Guardrails gone In the first two years of the Trump presidency, a number of key aides served as ethical guardrails, preventing the president from acting on his own worst instincts. According to the Mueller report, many either ignored or slow-walked orders they feared would land the president in trouble.
“The president’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,” the report wryly states.
Mr. Trump now has a team that better fits his style, including an attorney general, William Barr, who shaped the Trump spin around the Mueller report (“No collusion, no obstruction”) weeks before it was released to the public.
Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is seen more as a cheerleader for Mr. Trump’s instincts than a check on them. He encouraged, for example, the president’s recent push in court to overturn the Affordable Care Act despite the lack of a GOP replacement plan.
“They’ve got an acting chief of staff who seems to be reinforcing all of Trump’s worst political instincts,” says Chris Whipple, author of “The Gatekeepers,” a history of White House chiefs of staff.
The most effective chiefs of staff, Mr. Whipple says, are those willing to give the president bad news. But that takes having a president willing to receive it, and with Mr. Trump that’s not always the case. Before resigning, former Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen was told not to discuss Russian interference in the 2020 election with Mr. Trump, according to The New York Times. Such talk raised questions about the legitimacy of Mr. Trump’s election, Mr. Mulvaney reportedly implied.
At least one Republican observing from the sidelines sees the Mueller report as a cautionary tale for the president and his team going forward.
“I hope POTUS, his family and staff realize how close POTUS came to an obstruction charge,” tweeted Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to President George W. Bush, using the acronym for president of the United States.
“Laws are made to restrain presidents, even genuinely frustrated presidents who are accused of things they didn’t do,” Mr. Fleischer continued. “Presidents can’t instruct their staffs to lie. Ethics matter.”

Texto completo: The state's highest court for the first time on Tuesday extended the right to privacy to encompass cellphone location data, but preserved the right of law enforcement to “ping" cellphones in emergencies, such as a search for an armed murder suspect.
In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Judicial Court held that state constitutional protections against unwarranted and excessive government intrusion into personal lives must keep pace with technological innovations.
Cellphones are “almost a feature of human anatomy," with tracking technology that police can “ping" to learn a person's current location without their knowledge, Justice Scott L. Kafker wrote for the court. “This extraordinarily powerful surveillance tool finds no analog in the traditional surveillance methods of law enforcement and therefore grants police unfettered access 'to a category of information otherwise unknowable.' "
The ruling prohibits police from unilaterally demanding that phone companies turn over cell tower location information. In most circumstances, police will now need a search warrant to obtain the information, the court ruled.
“The power of such unauthorized surveillance . . . is too susceptible to being exercised arbitrarily by law enforcement — precisely the type of governmental conduct against which the framers sought to guard," Kafker wrote.
Matthew R. Segal, the legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Massachusetts, hailed the ruling as a “truly important decision."
“It reaches new territory because it's holding that a single ping of a cellphone is a search that would normally require a warrant," he said.
The practices of law enforcement agencies in the state, Segal said, “are a bit opaque."
“Only they know how often they have been warrantlessly manipulating electronic devices to learn information," he said.
The warrant requirement, Segal said, can be “satisfied by good police work." He did not think the decision would be onerous for law enforcement.
In its decision, the SJC ruled law enforcement can still require cellphone companies to ping phones without a warrant if there are “exigent circumstances," such as danger to the public or a threat that the suspect will flee or destroy evidence.
Karen Pita Loor, a Boston University law professor, also applauded the ruling, saying it “places limits on a police officer's ability essentially to obtain data without probable cause."
She said the ruling was “an expansion" of a Supreme Court decision from last year that found that the government generally needs a warrant to collect troves of location data about the customers of cellphone companies. The Fourth Amendment, she said, offers protections from government intrusion.
“Courts are having to grapple with how this applies to this new technology," she said.
Courts in other states have wrestled with similar cases, according to Jennifer Lynch, the surveillance litigation director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. She said in an e-mail that her group filed an amicus brief in a similar case before the Maine Supreme Court and is awaiting an opinion on that matter. In 2014, she said, the Florida Supreme Court held that warrantless, real-time tracking violated the Fourth Amendment.
Tuesday's ruling came in the first-degree murder prosecution of Jerome Almonor, who was arrested by police just hours after he allegedly shot a man to death in Brockton in 2012.
Lonnie Robinson was killed while sitting in the passenger seat of a car parked in a driveway, the ruling stated. The driver identified Almonor as the man who fired the fatal shot with a sawed-off shotgun.
Police obtained Almonor's cellphone number and learned that his former girlfriend lived at a house on Clarence Street. Police ordered the cellphone company to “ping" Almonor's phone, and the data showed he was in one of a handful of houses on Clarence Street — including his former girlfriend's home.
Police were allowed to search the house by the homeowner, and Almonor was found sleeping in an upstairs bedroom — where police also found a sawed-off shotgun and a bulletproof vest. He was arrested and charged with murdering Robinson.
Plymouth Superior Court Judge Cornelius J. Moriarty II ruled that tracking Almonor's cellphone violated his privacy rights and that law enforcement needed a search warrant to obtain the cellphone data. The judge barred the Plymouth district attorney's office from using the evidence against Almonor at trial.
The SJC reversed Moriarty's decision, saying police were justified in proceeding without a warrant.
“We conclude that under the circumstances at the time the defendant's cell phone was pinged, the police had reasonable grounds to believe that obtaining a warrant would be impracticable because taking the time to do so would have posed a significant risk that the suspect may flee, evidence may be destroyed, or the safety of the police or others may be endangered," the court ruled.
In a statement Tuesday, Berkshire District Attorney Andrea Harrington called the ruling “a sound and proper balancing of individual privacy interests and public safety."
“The exigent circumstances exception that the court allowed for in this particular type of search will be an effective tool in protecting the public from ongoing dangers, while ensuring individuals' constitutionally protected expectation of privacy," she said.
Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe said he hoped the ruling will change little in terms of law enforcement's approach to investigations. He said the ruling “leaves room for the police to do their job," and said police are “generally very, very careful that they are not intruding on people's privacy rights."
“Massachusetts has a particular zealous reputation for guarding individual privacy rights," he said during a phone interview Tuesday.

Texto completo: La mano dura de ICE bajo el gobierno de Donald Trump se sigue sintiendo con fuerza en la vida de inmigrantes que nunca han cometido un delito.
Según un reporte del New York Times la deportación de inmigrantes del área de la ciudad de Nueva York sin antecedentes penales, incluidos solicitantes de asilo con órdenes de deportación de años o décadas anteriores, aumentaron a 1,144 en el año fiscal de 2018 pasando de 313 deportaciones en 2016, lo que representa un aumento del 266% por ciento, según un informe reciente del contralor de la ciudad.
“Ese es el mayor aumento porcentual de cualquier oficina de campo de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas en el país”. , asegura el reporte.
La administración de Trump dijo que los agentes de ICE están siguiendo la ley al tratar de devolver a los solicitantes de asilo que han perdido sus casos y que por lo tanto no tienen derecho a permanecer en el país. Política que va de la mano con el aumento de la tasa de denegación de asilo que fue de casi el 62% en 2017, frente a un 57% por ciento en 2016, según el Foro Nacional de Inmigración.
Durante el gobierno de Obama, los jueces de inmigración recibieron instrucciones de utilizar su discreción para permitir que indocumentados sin pasado judicial permanecieran en el país, como solicitantes de asilo que habían perdido sus casos, pero a quienes se les daba la capacidad de permanecer y trabajar legalmente en los Estados Unidos mientras se registraran con ICE. Sin embargo bajo la administración de Donald Trump esa política ha cambiado drásticamente.
Uno de estos es el caso de Indra Sihotang , un inmigrante que literalmente se aferró a una silla cuando los funcionarios de ICE trataron de cargarlo en un vuelo de regreso a Indonesia, donde ” la persecución de cristianos como él” se “intensificó”, continuó el New York Times .
Sihotang al igual que muchos otros inmigrantes, fue arrestado durante lo que supuso que era un registro de rutina de ICE. Los defensores de los derechos de los inmigrantes han apodado este tipo de arrestos como “redadas silenciosas”.
Tras la escena en el aeropuerto, ni a Sihotang ni a ICE se les permitió abordar el vuelo comercial. ICE una vez más intentó deportarlo, y él estaba sentado en una camioneta de camino al aeropuerto cuando los agentes recibieron una llamada para detener su deportación.
Si bien Sihotang había perdido su caso de asilo hace cinco años, “un juez determinó que el Sr. Sihotang enfrentó miedos creíbles de persecución en Indonesia y reabrió su caso de asilo, que sigue sin resolverse”.

Texto completo: Se conocen más detalles sobre Larry Hopkins , el líder de los Patriotas Constitucionales de los Estados Unidos, la milicia pro Trump que detuvo con armas de fuego a un grupo de 300 inmigrantes en la frontera sur.
El líder de la milicia de extrema derecha, capturado por el FBI dos días después de que el grupo publicó el video de la captura de los inmigrantes, presumió hace dos años que los miembros de su grupo habían recibido capacitación para asesinar a figuras como el ex presidente Obama.
Los documentos judiciales conocidos por Reuters dijeron que si bien se había estado investigando las denuncias de “actividad de la milicia extremista” en 2017, los testigos acusaron a Hopkins de decir que su grupo planeaba asesinar no solo a Obama, sino al candidato presidencial demócrata de 2016, Hillary Clinton y George Soros, un rico partidario de los liberales.
Hopkins ahora enfrenta cargos criminales por posesión de armas de fuego.
Reuters informó que el agente especial del FBI, David Gabriel, había descubierto una charla sobre dichos asesinatos en octubre de 2017, cuando estaba investigando informes de que una milicia operaba desde la casa de Hopkins en Nuevo México.
“Hopkins supuestamente también hizo la declaración de que los Patriotas Constitucionales de los Estados Unidos se estaban entrenando para asesinar a George Soros, Hillary Clinton y Barack Obama “, según el reporte de Reuters.
El informe señala que el grupo ha afirmado haber ayudado a los funcionarios de La Migra a detener a 5,600 migrantes en el desierto de Nuevo México en los últimos 60 días.
Por su parte Carlos A. Díaz, un portavoz de la Patrulla Fronteriza, le dijo a The New York Times que la agencia federal “no respalda a los grupos privados u organizaciones que toman los asuntos de aplicación en sus propias manos”.

Trust, leaks and Julian Assange

Texto completo: Legendary journalist Walter Lippmann had sources in the highest places in Washington. Some evenings would find Lippmann seated opposite President Franklin Roosevelt in the Oval Office and Roosevelt would toss a classified cable at Lippmann and ask: "What do you think?"
Lippmann would give his counsel, but not write about what he had read in that cable. He would not break that trust or, most certainly, destroy his most important relationship.
That kind of relationship between officials and journalists goes on every day in Washington and journalists still keep those confidences. It takes years to develop these kinds of relationships and veteran journalists will not blow up a source relationship for one headline that will soon be subsumed by the churn of the daily news cycle. This exchange of information helps those journalists understand what is happening and the American people benefit from that knowledge.
Conversely, one of my former ambassadors referred to Washington as the world’s largest colander, in that leaking is also a daily occurrence. People leak information — some of it classified — to journalists for a variety reasons. It might be a trial balloon or an effort to sabotage a potential policy. Or, sometimes it is just a matter of ego. "Look what I know!"
Roosevelt expected Lippmann to respect the ground rules they had established over many years. Leakers, on the other hand, expect that the information they provide will be made public to achieve their aims whether it is pure politics or an attempt to blow the whistle on government activity that they believe is illegal or unethical.
WikiLeaks takes this philosophy to the extreme, based on the idea that no government secrets are sacred, and that distinction is at the core of the government’s case against WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange. Interestingly, the Assange indictment is narrowly focused on his role in helping former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning attempt to crack a classified system — apparently unsuccessfully. It does not focus on WikiLeaks’ role in publishing thousands of classified cables.
Most assuredly, Justice Department lawyers understood that in the past the Supreme Court has staunchly defended the First Amendment rights of a free press to act as a check on the government. However, even journalists and free-press advocates are more than uncomfortable with Assange’s extreme methods and fear his case could be used to chip away at those rights.
The court’s support for the right of the press to publish leaked materials had one its most forceful expressions in the 1971 Pentagon Papers case (New York Times v. United States) when Justice Hugo Black wrote in the majority 6-3 decision: "In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors. The Government’s power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government."
And … "The guarding of military and diplomatic secrets at the expense of informed representative government provides no real security … ."
Manning might have thought of herself as justified in arranging for the publication of that information and clearly Assange gave little to no thought about the lives that might be put in danger — especially those who were cooperating with U.S. authorities in conflict zones in Afghanistan and Iraq — or the confidential diplomatic relationships that would be upended. Once leaked, major American media outlets published some of the revealed information, no doubt after consultations with their in-house attorneys.
However, as the extradition of Assange goes forward, the journalistic community in the United States will be watching warily. They fear that pursuit of the Assange case could be used to try to chip away at First Amendment freedoms, especially given the adversarial relationship this Administration has with the media. In a remarkable speech earlier this year, Chief Justice John Roberts asserted that he was the strongest defender of First Amendment rights on the court. If and when the Assange case begins its journey through the courts, the American media and those who understand how crucial those rights are to our democracy will be watching closely to see if that is so.
Keith Peterson, of Lake Barrington, served 29 years as a press and cultural officer for the United States Information Agency and Department of State.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram liquor fortune, was among the most high-profile members of a cultlike organization in which some women were branded and compelled to have sex with the leader. Her wealth helped finance the group, known as Nxivm.
But on Friday afternoon, Ms. Bronfman, 40, pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Brooklyn to charges arising from an indictment filed last year against her and several other followers of the group's leader, Keith Raniere.
"I am truly remorseful," Ms. Bronfman told Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis as she pleaded guilty to conspiring to conceal and harbor an undocumented immigrant for financial gain, and fraudulent use of identification. "I wanted to do good in the world."
A few minutes later, the group's longtime bookkeeper, Kathy Russell, 61, pleaded guilty to one count of visa fraud.
The latest guilty pleas mean Mr. Raniere will stand trial alone next month on federal racketeering charges, occupying center stage without the women who once idolized and supported him. In recent weeks, three of his other co-defendants, including the actress Allison Mack, have pleaded guilty to various charges.
[Related: Alison Mack of "Smallville" pleads guilty in case of Nxivm .]
Based near Albany, Nxivm billed itself as a self-help organization, offering workshops that promised self-fulfillment. But it had a dark side. Some women were recruited into a secret order within the group, branded on the pelvis with a symbol containing Mr. Raniere's initials, and coerced into having sex with him, prosecutors said.
Federal authorities began investigating the organization after The New York Times published an article in late 2017 detailing how women had to provide personal secrets as "collateral" to join Mr. Raniere's secret sorority and were warned that damaging or embarrassing information would be made public if they disclosed the sorority's existence.
Since then, federal officials have filed wide-ranging charges against Mr. Raniere and other leaders and officials of Nxivm. An indictment unsealed last year accused Mr. Raniere and his followers of taking part in a racketeering enterprise that was involved in identity theft, money laundering, sex trafficking and extortion, among other things.
In March, Mr. Raniere was additionally charged with having a sexual relationship with two underage girls, including one who was said to be 15 years old when the abuse began.
Ms. Bronfman is the youngest daughter of Edgar Bronfman, the former chairman of Seagram Company who died in 2013. She had been one of Mr. Raniere's most passionate followers.
A former champion equestrian, she joined Nxivm in the early 2000s and eventually became his legal enforcer, filing and financing lawsuits against his enemies, both real and perceived.
A prosecutor, Moira Penza, told the court on Friday that Ms. Bronfman had made a false statement to the government about an undocumented immigrant who provided "labor and service" for herself and Nxivm. Ms. Bronfman had also made it possible for Mr. Raniere to use a credit card belonging to someone who had died, Ms. Penza said.
Ms. Bronfman admitted to the court she had committed those crimes. In a barely audible voice, she told Judge Garaufis that she had been born into "immense privilege," but had broken the law. Ms. Bronfman's plea agreement with the government calls for her to forfeit $6 million, Judge Garaufis said in court.
Ms. Russell was the group's bookkeeper for more than a decade and was indicted on two counts of racketeering conspiracy last July.
She pleaded guilty to a single count of visa fraud, acknowledging to the court that in early 2014, she had made false statements in a document to the United States Consulate in Mexico to help a woman named Loreta Garza Davila obtain a visa.
"I'm very sorry for the trouble I have caused," Ms. Russell told the judge, her voice breaking. "I compromised my own principles."
Ms. Russell faces between six months and a year in prison under federal sentencing guidelines. She will be sentenced on July 31. Ms. Bronfman faces between 21 and 27 months in prison and will be sentenced on July 25.
Mr. Raniere has denied all the charges against him. "We are going to trial," his lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said on Friday. "We don't believe Ms. Russell and Ms. Bronfman should have been charged, and we are happy they're out of the case."
Court papers have described Nxivm as a rigorously hierarchical organization in which Mr. Raniere, who was known as "Vanguard," demanded obedience from followers. High-ranking members who answered to Mr. Raniere could be equally demanding of those below them.
In March, a co-founder of the group, Nancy Salzman, known as "Prefect," pleaded guilty. Ms. Salzman, who founded Nxivm in the 1990s with Mr. Raniere, was charged with identity theft and altering records to influence the outcome of a lawsuit against the organization.
Earlier this month, Ms. Mack, an actress who had appeared on the television show "Smallville," also pleaded guilty to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges.
Prosecutors described Ms. Mack as "a first-line master" in the group's secret sorority, known as D.O.S., an acronym for a Latin phrase that roughly translates to "Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions."
Prosecutors said that group was organized into circles of female "slaves," who were led by "masters," and was meant to groom sexual partners for Mr. Raniere. The women in D.O.S., prosecutors said, were required to give their recruiter, or "master," naked photographs or other compromising material.
When Ms. Mack was arrested last year, officials said she had recruited women as "slaves" and had required them to have sex with Mr. Raniere.
But during her guilty plea, Ms. Mack did not say whether women were blackmailed into engaging in sexual acts with the group's leader. She only acknowledged obtaining "labor and services" from two anonymous women cited in the indictment.
As part of a criminal complaint, an F.B.I. agent said Mr. Raniere had a "rotating group of fifteen to twenty women" with whom he maintained sexual relations. Those women were allowed to have sex only with him, the agent added.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: F. Scott Fitzgerald famously said, "There are no second acts in American lives." But my young, wise friend Sam says something a bit different. He told me a few months back: "There are no second chances in our culture today." No repentance. No forgiveness. No chance to start again.
He was talking about celebrities, partly. But this truth seems to apply generally. Except for the Kennedy family and Donald Trump, and maybe a few others who can power through scandal, real or contrived, American society has become the land of one mistake.
That's all you get. Game over.
We have just concluded the Christian season of repentance, culminating in today's celebration of resurrection, hope and rebirth. And we are in the midst of Passover - the feast of liberation. I wonder if the unforgiving society, the #MeToo society, the gotcha society, the judgment without good or evil society (where hair smelling is verboten but partial-birth abortion is OK) is obliterating second chances.
Some of us are late bloomers, after all. It takes a while for us to process, to get it.
Some of us are slow learners. Where does no second chances leave us?
There is something to be said for slow learners. They take less for granted. They know gratitude. Wynton Marsalis said of Duke Ellington's compositions that each note was lovingly and meticulously etched. It didn't all just flow through him effortlessly, like Mozart, whose notations where quickly and messily scrawled.
For Ellington, the life of the composer came hard. He had to chase the music, which he called an elusive mistress, and fight the bigots and snobs. (He was voted a special Pulitzer citation in 1965, which the Pulitzer board chose not to award - a deeply shameful moment in American cultural life.)
When I was a little boy, age 6 I think, I was in an accident the summer when I was supposed to learn how to swim. My friends learned that summer. I waited for the next summer. Because I was "behind," my parents were anxious that I learn fast. So they hired my cousin Mary Joe to teach me. (Mary Joe became a feminist theologian in later life. )
Mary Joe was a great swimmer - a natural. But she was so natural that she did not know how to teach. She had no patience. She lacked empathy.
She also saw the act of swimming as one, unified thing. She could not break it down: You dive or jump in. Then you swim.
Cousin Mary Joe and I did not connect.
But at our pool was a man named Paul Samuell. He was head summer lifeguard, or "pool director." I remember him as about 60, he was probably 40. He smoked a pipe, had a deep tan from days upon days in the sun and taught at the high school in winter months. (I later knew him as adviser to the school newspaper.) Mr. Samuell was the soul of unflappability. Nothing ruffled him. He kept discipline at the poor with calmness.
And Mr. Samuell knew two great truths about teaching: How to be patient and how to break down a challenge - in this case strokes - into separate, small, manageable challenges.
I don't think I ever actually saw Mr. Samuell swim. So I don't know if he was a natural swimmer or not. But I know he was a natural teacher and he made me a good swimmer. He was smart and he was analytic and he was, in a word, forgiving.
And because swimming came hard and late to me, it meant more than it did to my mates and peers. And I hung on to it.
These days I have a yoga teacher, a young man young enough to be my grandson, who reminds me of Mr. Samuell. He breaks each posture down and, instead of cajoling, coaxes. He is, in a word, forgiving.
I think, too, of my father teaching me and my sisters to ride a bike. We each got a different teacher. For he understood intuitively that human beings are all wired differently and learn in different ways and at different speeds. And, it's interesting, the one who used training wheels the longest became the most ardent cyclist.
In a tolerant and civilized society, there is more than one way to learn; there are second chances; and there is time and space for forgiveness.
We know this in our bones. We know it as human beings and as Americans. That's why we love comebacks. Even if Tiger Woods is not your cup of tea, you have to love his comeback.
I had a famous friend once. When The New York Times informed him that his obit was written and filed and waiting upon his departure from this world, he was both outraged and amused. "How do they know," he asked me in his 80s, "that I won't do something really fine on my last day on earth?"
As is written in "Redemption Song," "We've got to fulfill the book."
So, for all the slow learners and late bloomers comes an Easter message: Second chances are part of the deal.
Or, as a Jewish friend put it to me once: If nothing is forgotten and every experience is used, you have the right to keep trying.
"Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery/None but ourselves can free our minds."
We need to cut each other some slack in our society and our polity today.
Together, we must sing redemption songs.

Texto completo: Nell Freudenberger's "Lost and Wanted," a tribute to female friendship, is set against no less grand a backdrop than the space-time continuum, as explained by Helen Clapp, an MIT physicist. She may understand the cosmos better than the rest of us, but she still struggles to make sense of the recent death of her best -- and lately neglected -- friend, Charlie Boyce.
Charlie is dead, but she becomes a lively character in the book's deft flashbacks .She and Helen met as roommates at Harvard. Charlie, beautiful and individualistic, was born to well-educated, high-achieving African-American parents. She became a successful Hollywood writer after turning away from her original academic path.
Helen, who is white, comes from more modest origins . Until now, she has managed her universe on her own terms, right down to a calculated selection of sperm donor when the time was right to become a mother. (So far, her son, Jack, has not manifested his donor's talent for music or his height.)
No sooner does Helen learn of Charlie's death than she gets a wordless phone call from her. Next come sporadic text messages. When Charlie's parents hold a memorial service in Boston, Helen finds out from Charlie's husband, Terrence, that her phone is missing, presumably stolen.
The messages, however, do not seem random. And on the morning of the service, Jack reports that he has seen Charlie sitting at his mother's desk. These little departures from the empirical occur often enough to tip the reader, and Helen, off balance. Physics, after all, doesn't tie all events and forces into neat bundles.
It's Helen's policy, when Jack has questions, to answer forthrightly. She does the same for Charlie's young daughter, Simmi, who asks what the surface of a star is like. When Helen explains there is nothing but "a hot ball of gas," Simmi replies, "It's like a fire pit. Like hell," leaving Helen to dig herself out of a rabbit hole. The line of inquiry can be traced to Simmi's grandmother, who suggested that Charlie might be "smiling down" on the family from a star.
Helen also makes it a habit to impart amusing scraps of science when she can. One such tidbit that makes a big impression on Jack -- and ultimately Simmi -- is the metaphase typewriter, a device created by theorists exploring the intersection of quantum physics and inner awareness to capture the chatter of disembodied spirits -- ghosts, if you will.
Throughout the novel, Helen's heart bounces from her newly vivid memories of Charlie to her confused feelings for Neel, her former research partner and boyfriend, who is about to marry. At the same time, she is feeling close to Terrence, who has decided to stick around awhile, and for a moment it seems this book, despite its lofty underpinnings, is veering into romance territory. But, no, it's heading straight for what might have been, with intimations of a multiverse or some hiccup in the laws of physics that gives us a glimpse of roads not taken.
As the bizarre occurrences stack up, we wonder, does time really fold back on itself? What does the matter-of-fact Helen believe about the junction of science and the unknown? Does she agree with the Einstein citation in the book that people "who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion"?
Freudenberger leaves that decision to us, but not before she sets up a pyrotechnic ending to this absorbing and intelligent novel.

Texto completo: The wife of a deceased Ku Klux Klan leader in Missouri admitted in court Friday to his 2017 shooting death after initially saying two years ago that her son was the murderer.
Now, she says her son didn't help commit the homicide.
Malissa Ancona, 46, pleaded guilty in St. Francois County Circuit Court in Farmington, Missouri, to second-degree murder in the death of Frank Ancona Jr. , the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported, as well as tampering with evidence and the abandonment of a corpse.
As part of her plea agreement with state prosecutors, she was sentenced to life in prison.
Ancona, who was 51 when he died in February 2017, was imperial wizard of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, which is believed to have only a few dozen members nationwide.
The group, based in Park Hills, Missouri, had a presence last year in South Dakota and Florida, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. The Knights has had chapters in Idaho and Pennsylvania as well.
Frank Ancona Jr. was killed by gun shot wounds to the head, a coroner determined, after he was found dead on a bank of the Big River near Belgrade, Missouri, about 70 miles southwest of St. Louis.
Originally, Malissa Ancona, of Leadwood, Missouri, reported her husband missing. She then said that her son, Paul Jinkerson Jr. – the stepson of Frank Ancona Jr. – killed him while he was sleeping with a 9-millimeter handgun after he had asked for a divorce.
But she later changed her tune again in letters from jail, according to the Post-Dispatch. She said she was "under the influence" when she made her first statements and instead took the blame for the killing.
"I fired both shots that killed my husband,” the Post-Dispatch reported Malissa Ancona told a judge Friday.
In addition, Ancona admitted in court to cleaning the walls of their bedroom and disposing of bloody bedding and dumping Frank Ancona Jr. ’s body near Belgrade, Missouri.
Jinkerson, 26, is facing first-degree murder charges and, also like Malissa Ancona, charges of abandoning a corpse and tampering with evidence. But Malissa Ancona said in court Friday that Jinkerson was not guilty of murder, only the other two crimes.
Frank Ancona Sr. testified in court that Malissa Ancona killed his son because he was going to leave his wife, the Post-Dispatch reported.
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the number of Ku Klux Klan groups, around 30 in 2017, has plummeted.
On its website, the center says that the Klan has tried to form alliances with similar organizations, such as the League of the South and the National Socialist Movement, to "retain some semblance of relevance. "
Frank Ancona Jr. told the New York Times in an interview before his death that he had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan for 30 years and had founded the Traditionalist American Knights of the Klan in 2009.
The New York Times reported that Frank Ancona Jr. 's Ku Klux Klan faction, although not large in number, was successful in distributing pamphlets in the aftermath of the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, that urged using "lethal force" against protesters.
The high-profile shooting brought attention to Frank Ancona Jr. , who appeared on national television, to discuss how the race protests following a white police officer's shooting of an unarmed black man had rallied KKK members.
Among other recent activity, the group under Frank Ancona Jr. 's leadership also passed out pamphlets in several towns in Maine, the Times reported.
In explaining his philosophy, he told the newspaper that his group is nonviolent, supports the separation of races and opposes what he called "equality propaganda. "
“They want to portray us as all toothless, redneck tobacco chewers,” Frank Ancona Jr told The Times. “Some of us are! But some of us are college educated. I am a business owner. . . . We just believe in promoting traditional American values. ”

Texto completo: Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. felt the first stirrings of what would become his latest book, "Stony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the Rise of Jim Crow," during his 1969-70 sophomore year at Yale. He was enrolled in his first African-American history course - no such classes were given at his high school - and was introduced to Reconstruction, the brief period after the Civil War when blacks exerted their newfound rights and leadership in the former slave states. The course also covered the racist reaction to Reconstruction, known as Redemption, Gates writes, "when the former Confederate states 'redeemed' themselves at the expense of black rights" and took up with vehemence and violence the dictates of white supremacy. "I have connected Reconstruction with Redemption ever since, as the apex and nadir ... of the African American experience."
During that academic year, Gates also took a course on the Harlem Renaissance, a period of black intellectual and artistic ferment from the late 19th century to the mid-1920s; he continued to study that period and the emergence in those years of what became known as the New Negro. "In this book," Gates writes, "I attempt to show that the New Negro was the black community's effort to roll back Redemption, which was itself a rollback to Reconstruction, and to do so by coining a metaphor, of all things, and then by seeking to embody that metaphor." The result is "Stony the Road" - as Gates describes it, "an intellectual and cultural history of black agency and the resistance to and institutionalization of white supremacy." His title is borrowed from James Weldon Johnson's 1900 poem, "Lift Every Voice and Sing," known as the Negro national anthem: "Stony the road we trod/ Bitter the chast'ning rod."
Gates' book covers territory well known to scholars and Civil War buffs: how our received wisdom of the "tragic decade" of Reconstruction flows from two polluted streams, the myth of the Lost Cause and the Jim Crow segregation mania that swept American legislatures and popular entertainment after 1900. For those wishing to know more about this dismal story of racial hysteria in places as high as Woodrow Wilson's White House and as low as the blackface minstrel show, "Stony the Road" is excellent one-stop shopping. With a main text of about 250 pages, Gates offers a compressed yet surprisingly comprehensive narrative sweep, in addition to the usual catalog of political sins, an overview of the lesser-known stories of how our "best" universities, such as Columbia and Harvard, allowed two pseudo-disciplines - "scientific racism" and eugenics - to create a false dogma of black misrule and white suffering at the center of the Reconstruction narrative.
With a dazzling selection of cartoon stereotypes, the author shows that in the white supremacist reaction "all along, the issue had been about the fabrication of hateful imagery in order to justify robbing black people of their constitutional rights and their economic potential."
In tracing the emergence of the New Negro, Gates notes that Booker T. Washington "was named the very first new Negro" by the white press. But Washington was "problematic" - he called for a regime of economic cooperation and social separation as a necessary condition of black progress. Gates observes that Washington was gradually eclipsed by more militant followers of Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. Du Bois. The latter's scholarship in combination with the Harlem Renaissance saw the emergence of a "newer New Negro" and vigorous pursuit of the rights of equal treatment first promised by the Reconstruction Congress that passed the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments.
Gates is at his most fluent in defining the newer Negro as a feature of the Harlem Renaissance powered by Alain Locke, Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson and other key figures of the African-American creative pantheon. Locke is depicted as a flawed visionary who believed that artistic achievement would be as sure a path to equality as politics or economics. "They saw themselves as members of the black upper class," Gates writes, "a cosmopolitan mobile elite that could be integrated into American society, even if 'the slow-moving black masses' (as the head of the Urban League Charles S. Johnson would actually call them) could not."
Notwithstanding his high regard for the Renaissance, Gates clearly tilts toward politics, rather than art-for-art's-sake or pure commerce, as the most reliable vehicle for black progress. "No people, in all of human history, has ever been liberated by the creation of art. None," Gates asserts with a sense of certainty that is a signature of his rhetoric.
Analytically, this is a lively, consistently challenging book. I was struck by a sweeping criticism Gates offers in discussing the Harlem Renaissance. He blames Locke's 1925 anthology, "The New Negro," for ignoring "those great geniuses of black vernacular culture, the musicians who created the world's greatest art form in the entire twentieth century - jazz." The grandiose language feels like special pleading, based on personal taste, but Gates usefully reminds us that "jazz and its companion blues," while rooted in black culture, have a unique place in one of modernity's great stories, the African-American experience on the American continent in the previous century. Gates' telling of that story is a contribution to what we ought to be thinking about, given the rocky launch of this newest American century.

Texto completo: Along with the far left and far right in the U.S., Russian President Vladimir Putin holds the pieties of liberal democracy in contempt. His nation's attacks on American hearts and minds, detailed in the long-awaited Mueller report, carried with them the spirit of the Joker in the Batman myth -- a malevolent court jester motivated by venality, contempt for pretense and a craving for relevance and thrills.
In the special counsel's report, one member of WikiLeaks -- the organization that framed, staged, timed and distributed Russian-hacked material to wreak maximum havoc on Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign -- described his feckless goals this way:
"We want this repository to become 'the place' to search for background on hillary's plotting at the state department during 2009-2013. . . . Firstly because its useful and will annoy Hillary, but secondly because we want to be seen to be a resource/player in the US election, because eit [it] may encourage people to send us even more important leaks."

To a ghastly extent, the social media attempts "to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States" (Mueller's words) and the more formal Russian military cyberattacks to demonize Hillary Clinton (and by extension liberals and centrists) succeeded. They've left our cognitive processes in disarray.
It used to be that Americans didn't feel remotely threatened by "invaders" at the border; or thwarted by a phantom "deep state"; or constantly lashed by racist, sexist and violent fantasies. These psychic phenomena, and many more, were seeded in our consciousness on Facebook and Twitter and Reddit, then amplified by traditional media so aggressively that we came to believe and even act on them.
Like Iago whispering to Othello, the Kremlin's operations convinced the prosperous, peaceful United States that it is teetering on the brink of civil war.
Just read the opening -- pages 19 to 62 -- of Robert S. Mueller III's work product. This section closely resembles the 9/11 Commission Report, the exhaustive compendium of facts issued in 2004 not to build a criminal case but just to show us what happened on Sept. 11, 2001.
Likewise, we need to know what happened in 2016, when armies of hostile foreign actors decided to have their way with us. We have to get it straight if for no other reason than that it will clear our heads enough to grasp what follows in the report.
Beginning in 2014, the Internet Research Agency, a network of Russian trolls and other "information war" foot soldiers, went to work online "to undermine the U.S. electoral system" essentially by making trouble.
The will to make trouble is a constant in the report. According to White House Counsel Don McGahn, President Trump wanted his henchmen to "do crazy stuff" (he used an obscenity) to shut down the Mueller investigation. The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, intended to create a dramatic rift between Clinton and Bernie Sanders just to keep things "interesting."
In early 2016, the IRA had moved on to disparaging Clinton nearly full-time, while lavishing fond attention on Sanders and praising Trump as a mashup of Superman, Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman and Jesus. It also staged rallies for candidate Trump, in sync with local activists.
People who should have known better picked up the disinfo campaign. And this wasn't just Trumpites like Kellyanne Conway and Michael Flynn. U.S. Ambassador Michael McFaul, for example, amplified one of the IRA's most prolific "personas" -- accounts manned by intelligence professionals -- on Twitter. The report adds that "U.S. media outlets also quoted tweets from IRA-controlled accounts and attributed them to the reactions of real U.S. persons," citing a 2018 study from the Columbia Journalism Review.
Russian military intelligence -- the GRU -- was more overtly criminal. In short, its operatives hacked both the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee, and then made sure to release only the material that would hurt Clinton and the Democrats. Again, some media outlets recycled what was gouged out of the servers.
Assange middle-managed the hand-off from the GRU to various illustrious newspapers. Readers no less than reporters were enthralled by the stolen materials and the fraternity-style panty raid on Clinton. Amy Chozick, who covered the Clinton campaign for the New York Times, later described herself as "an unwitting agent of Russian intelligence."
We all were.
What makes the attacks on the U.S. so repellent and ultimately tragic is that so few saw them for what they were --viruses, memes and ear worms unleashed in social and traditional media where Americans spend an average of 11 hours every day, and where we are supremely vulnerable to novelty and arousal: #whitegenocide, #invasion, #hillaryforprison -- a lot of us spread this stuff, if only to complain about it.
The hacker's work is to create, prevent and capitalize on disruptions on the internet. Amoral in themselves, disruptions are pure opportunity: to confound enemies, to make money, to achieve renown. Even the good guys, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which develops emerging technologies for use the military, states as a goal "preventing -- and creating -- strategic surprise."
The Mueller report is so rich, and its lessons are infinite. Here's my first one: Refuse to be drafted into the next infowar, and certainly don't enlist. If something you're being fed hurts the brain, don't believe it. It could be a reference to "the Satan" that's not quite idiomatic. Or a photo of mostly naked girls demonstrating in favor of Harvey Weinstein.
Mueller is careful -- to a fault -- to go only where the evidence leads. Trust him on this: If it seems un-American, it is.

The Russian collusion story is a reminder of why media should ‘wait and see’

Texto completo: The special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election has been a uniquely stupid chapter in press history.

Newsrooms got some of it right. They also got a lot wrong.

One of the worst aspects to the news media’s two-year-long exercise in speculation and rumormongering was social media, which allowed for reporters and news commentators to spout off whatever half-cocked thought popped into their head at any given time. And now that the investigation is over, we can really appreciate just how absurd people who pretend they have not been blinded with partisan rage have behaved throughout this entire news cycle.

Washington Post columnist Max Boot, for example, went out on a limb on March 28 when he asked (with a straight face, I presume) how Attorney General William Barr and his team of legal professionals could have possibly read and understood the Mueller report in less than 48 hours, as the Justice Department claimed.

Funnily enough, the following tweet also comes from Boot, who apparently was able to do all by his lonesome self what he could not comprehend from the Justice Department.

“Having read the Mueller report, I can see why Trump was so eager to discredit the investigators – and why Barr felt compelled to spin in advance. And it’s not because the report proves ‘No Collusion - No Obstruction!’ It proves the very opposite,” he claimed on Twitter less than 12 hours after the report was released to the public.

Call me a cynic, but my guess here is that Boot’s real position is the opposite of whatever benefits the Trump administration.

Speaking of “whatever it is, I’m against it,” let’s also consider freelance journalist and New York Times contributor Jared Yates Sexton, who once wrote a sort of winding paean to Robert Mueller in 2017, which read: “Important to remember: Robert Mueller is an independent special prosecutor tasked with investigating possible collusion.”

“He is not a partisan tasked with destroying Trump. That’s what conservatives want people to believe,” he added. “Do not fall into the trap of talking about this in the terms conservatives want you to. This is as much a PR battle as a legal one. The battle Republicans want here is to define it as a partisan witch hunt. It’s not, at all. But words and tone matter.”

“If Mueller didn’t find evidence, he’d walk away. His job isn’t to invent or distort. This seems obvious, but is massively important,” he concluded.

On April 18, just hours after the report’s release, Sexton then tweeted:

"In the midst of all this, it's unbelievably important to remember Robert Mueller is a lifelong, dedicated Republican. A Republican prepared this report. A Republican laid the groundwork for the impeachment of a Republican president."

As it turns out, “wait and see” is a good rule to live by precisely because it saves you from publicly repudiating yourself. It saves you from having the general public realize that even you don't pay attention to what you say. It also saves you from looking like an obvious partisan hack.

Likable vibe, cheeky humor stand out on 'Special'

Texto completo: Go back a few years, and there was a magical moment in the tectonically shifting TV landscape that felt a lot like a sweet spot.
The amorphous narrative entities known then as “Web series" were finding their tiny little ways to the mainstream like hatchling turtles scuttling toward the sea. Free from the constraints of corporate financing and overbearing notes from overlords, these fresh, lithe, digestible, independent projects helped introduce a range of characters, bodies, types, and stories that scarcely ever made it to primetime, and helped set the tone and prime the TV landscape for the streaming revolution. 
 With their tight focus, tighter budgets, and short runtimes (which helped bestow a sense of urgency), Web series didn't just announce the new vanguard of streaming video, they offered a model for short-form series that felt like a natural fit with our short attention spans.
This is where “Special" comes in. The new Netflix series comes from writer, actor, YouTuber, and ubiquitous social media presence Ryan O'Connell, whose popular blogs and videos candidly document his triumphs and travails as a millennial gay man with cerebral palsy.
The premiere episode (“Cerebral LOLzy") opens with O'Connell falling flat on his face, and let's just say it sets the tone.
So, too, does the familiar coming-of-middle-age millennial milieu, which finds O'Connell toiling in an unpaid internship for an Internet “LOLzy satire" mill, basking in anguish over his love life, and otherwise trying to find himself (in part by exploiting himself for clicks). 
The show plays like a loose adaptation of his 2015 memoir, “I'm Special: And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves," but it also feels like a finely-tuned, precision-crafted Web series, with potent little zingers stitched into every exchange — along with the occasional sledgehammer (e.g. “It's hard out here for a gimp," he laments to his PT guy.)
And while O'Connell's story centers on his disability, his performance foregrounds his likable vibe, endearingly cheeky humor, and just enough scream-at-the-screen cluelessness. With its first eight episodes clocking in at just over two hours total, “Special" is a brief affair that feels long overdue. After all, committed long-term relationships with TV shows are all well and good, but as Ryan discovers, sometimes a quick fling can make the biggest impact.

Satisfy your soul with Aretha Franklin concert film

Resumen: Franklin recorded with the 25-member Southern California Community Choir, inside the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church, located in the LA neighborhood of Watts. The call-outs, spontaneous bursts of dance and shouts of affirmation from the choir and the audience, especially during "Amazing Grace" but throughout the entire film, serve as a glorious reminder that sometimes all a filmmaker needs to do is be there, and be awake and responsive to the talent. After a decade or so in series television, Pollack was just coming off his breakout success with "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" Warner Brothers had ideas to synergize (horrible word, I know; gets worse every year) Franklin's gospel album, to be put out in mid-1972, with a concert film, either packaged for a TV special or, according to some reports, to fill out a theatrical double bill with "Super Fly."

Texto completo: A massive rookie mistake -- director Sydney Pollack and his 16-millimeter film crew forgot to use a clapperboard synchronizing the sound with the image for each new take -- delivered roughly 20 hours of footage captured for the 1972 Aretha Franklin concert film "Amazing Grace" into a maddening purgatory. There it stayed for nearly half a century.

But now it's here. For a concert movie of straightforward, self-effacing technique, "Amazing Grace" delivers one of the purest, most concentrated blasts of satisfaction in a long, long time. Franklin was 29 at the time she recorded the best-selling gospel album in history. For anyone who grew up with the double album on the stereo, seeing her record her renditions of the title song, Marvin Gaye's "Wholy Holy" and so many more will bring them closer to what they already adore.

For sinful newcomers to the album, it's 87 minutes of better late than never.

Franklin recorded with the 25-member Southern California Community Choir, inside the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church, located in the LA neighborhood of Watts. Backed by a four-piece band, Franklin, the super-smooth Rev. James Cleveland (on screen nearly as much as Franklin) and exuberant choir director Alexander Hamilton's singers split the session into two evenings.

The second night brought, among others, Mick Jagger (in LA around the time of "Exile on Main Street") into the church. He's seen, fleetingly, sitting in the back; Pollack and his crew can be seen in "Amazing Grace" hustling, weaving around, trying to get as close to the music and what it meant for those people, in that church, on those nights.

The close-ups say it all. Beads of sweat intermingle with Franklin's blue eye shadow, and at times she seems to be blinking back tears. This is hard work in a place of worship; the joy it brings out in the crowd -- at one point, Cleveland simply holds his head in his hands, and sobs -- is the undeniable result.

The call-outs, spontaneous bursts of dance and shouts of affirmation from the choir and the audience, especially during "Amazing Grace" but throughout the entire film, serve as a glorious reminder that sometimes all a filmmaker needs to do is be there, and be awake and responsive to the talent.

On the other hand, remembering to bring a clapper would've been wise. After a decade or so in series television, Pollack was just coming off his breakout success with "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" Warner Brothers had ideas to synergize (horrible word, I know; gets worse every year) Franklin's gospel album, to be put out in mid-1972, with a concert film, either packaged for a TV special or, according to some reports, to fill out a theatrical double bill with "Super Fly."

The album, as it happened, didn't need the movie to become a smash. "Amazing Grace" finally fell together thanks to the tireless efforts of producer and music executive Alan Elliott.

Near the end of her life, Franklin sued and was granted an emergency injunction against the finished film's planned 2015 unveiling at the Telluride Film Festival. Litigation tossed the film off the rosters of other festivals around that time, including the Chicago International Film Festival. Shortly after Franklin's death last year, Elliott came to an agreement with Franklin's estate for the release. And here we are.

There are a hundred little stories going on in "Amazing Grace," some unrelated to the music. Bassist Chuck Rainey told the New York Times recently that Franklin felt marginalized by her own movie, probably owing to the screen time afforded the Rev. Cleveland (her childhood mentor) and, on the second night, the big-footing presence of her father, Rev. C.L. Franklin. His imposing, vaguely patronizing speech seems to turn Franklin into a meeker, compliant version of her adult self.

Even if Aretha Franklin doesn't dominate every second of "Amazing Grace," she's indisputably the reason the film exists, and the reason it's so good. Her voice could lift people straight out of their seats in jubilation; her vocal flourishes and deep readings of the simplest, most elemental lyrics remain incomparable.

When she sings "my soul is satisfied," she's speaking for anyone listening to what she achieved here, in this Watts church with the walls painted various shades of blue, like countless prom tuxes of the era. "Satisfying" doesn't really do it justice, but it's a start.

1 hour, 27 minutes. Rated G. Four stars out of four.

Pot's link to psychosis should be a warning

Texto completo: As Maryland legislators appointed to the "Cannabis Workgroup" begin their study of the pros and cons of marijuana legalization, they should pay particular attention to the mental health risks of this drug. Unfortunately, they may not have heard much about the epidemiology of psychosis associated with marijuana use, since relevant U.S. expertise lags behind Western Europe, Canada and a couple of countries in the southern hemisphere.
Epidemiological studies are observational, not interventional, so our slow entry into the field has nothing to do with the illegal status of marijuana. Instead, I would point to our lack of centralized health care, which would otherwise facilitate collection of data on large populations - data pertaining to health status, history of health-related habits and key demographics. Another factor is how biomedical research here is tightly coupled to the pharmaceutical industry, a sector less interested in environmental factors that cause disease than in developing blockbuster drugs.
From the perspective of many of us who have researched the causes of psychosis in the laboratory or in clinical settings, the book by journalist Alex Berenson "Tell Your Children the Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence" provides an important wake-up call for America. The former New York Times business reporter wrote it after his psychiatrist wife suggested he learn more about the topic. But it's a lone voice of caution on the national stage. While medical associations in the U.S. have issued position papers citing harms of marijuana, these documents are largely buried in their websites out of view.
Here's what you should know: Researchers looking for a dose-response correlation found that the heavier the marijuana use, and the more potent the product, the more likely a psychotic outcome like schizophrenia. Daily use of potencies considered moderate by current U.S. standards increases risk 4- to 5-fold.
Some will argue that individuals with psychosis who use marijuana are merely self-medicating pre-existing symptoms, despite research showing symptoms remit for many who quit using, and return if they use again. Studies in Europe and New Zealand of thousands of teens followed through young adulthood, demonstrated the marijuana habit preceded psychosis in the majority of marijuana users who developed it.
Yes, initial psychotic symptoms associated with marijuana are usually temporary, and only 12 percent to 15 percent of users reported these transient symptoms with lower strength marijuana common in the 1900s - symptoms like paranoia, delusions or auditory hallucinations. But 35 percent of those who experience such occasional symptoms can be expected to transition to a full psychotic break, a cluster of intense symptoms happening at once.
Three studies from Finland and Denmark, again totaling thousands of subjects, further demonstrated that nearly half of those who experience a psychotic break from marijuana progress to actual schizophrenia, a progression shown to be independent of a familial history of psychosis.
Could other drugs laced into marijuana explain these devastating outcomes? The answer is a resounding no. When compared to other recreational drugs that cause a full psychotic break (LSD, PCP, cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine), marijuana-induced psychotic breaks were the most likely to lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia eight years out. As I like to say, lace your LSD with a little marijuana and you're more likely to become psychotic.
Psychiatrists who admit marijuana can trigger schizophrenia will often maintain it does so only in those with a genetic predisposition. If asked, they would not be able to tell you the precise genetic predisposition, just that it derives from family history, much like susceptibility to heart disease. Yet, clinical studies in the U.K. have shown that 40 percent of individuals lacking a 1st degree family history of psychosis will exhibit transient psychotic symptoms when administered a moderate dose of pure THC. And for users and non-users alike, relatively few of those diagnosed with schizophrenia have any family history of schizophrenia in a 1st- or 2nd-degree relative.
The causal link between marijuana use and the development of psychosis is quite simply the most well-replicated, high-impact finding in schizophrenia research today. Given current use rates and the strong potency of the drug available, it stands to be responsible for a larger proportion of schizophrenia cases than any other established factor. Who may be at risk cannot be reliably predicted. The time is long overdue for the surgeon general and American neuroscientists and psychiatrists, along with their universities and professional societies, to inform the public and for journalists to pay heed.

Texto completo: By The Associated Press
Aretha Franklin is still getting R-E-S-P-E-C-T after death: The Queen of Soul received the Pulitzer Prize Special Citation honor Monday, becoming the first individual woman to earn a special citation prize since the honor was first awarded in 1930.
The Pulitzer board said the award was given to Franklin for "her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades."
Franklin died on Aug. 16 at her home in Detroit from pancreatic cancer at age 76.
The superstar musician was the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when she entered the prestigious organization in 1987.
The Pulitzer board most recently awarded a special citation prize in 2010 to Hank Williams, the country music legend who died in 1953. From the arts world, other recipients include Duke Ellington, Bob Dylan, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, George Gershwin, Ray Bradbury, William Schuman, Milton Babbitt, Scott Joplin, Roger Sessions, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II.
Before Monday, only 41 special citation prizes had been awarded since 1930, and winners have ranged from individual people to organizations and groups, including the New York Times, writers E.B. White, Alex Haley and Kenneth Roberts, and Columbia University and its Graduate School of Journalism. Franklin and the Capital Gazette newspaper received special citation honors this year.
"Aretha is blessed and highly favored even in death. She's continued to receive multiple awards - she's received almost every award imaginable and now to get the Pulitzer Prize, it's just amazing," Sabrina Owens, Franklin's niece and the executor of her estate, said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday. "Aretha continues to bless us with her music and just paving the way for women going forward. It's thrilling. She would be so happy right now"
When Owens heard the news that Franklin won a Pulitzer, she and the family were "surprised but in another way we were not because that's just the kind of person Aretha was."
"She was just very gifted and talented, and the world is still recognizing that," she said.
Franklin's inclusion into the exclusive club re-confirms the impact her music - and voice - had and continues to have on the world. She became a cultural icon and genius of American song, considered by many to be the greatest popular vocalist of her time. Her voice transcended age, category and her own life.
Franklin was professional singer and accomplished pianist by her late teens and a superstar by her mid-20s. Raised in Detroit, she recorded hundreds of tracks and had dozens of hits over the span of a half century, including 20 that reached No. 1 on the R&B charts.
But her reputation was defined by an extraordinary run of Top 10 smashes in the late 1960s, from the morning-after bliss of "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman," to the wisedup "Chain of Fools" to her unstoppable call for "Respect," transforming Otis Redding's song into a classic worldwide anthem - especially for the feminist and civil rights movements - making it one of the most recognizable and heard songs of all-time.
She sold millions of albums and won countless awards, including 18 Grammys, the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.
She performed at the inaugurations of Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and even sang at the funeral for civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks and at the dedication of Martin Luther King Jr's memorial.
Rolling Stone ranked Franklin No.1 on its list of the Top 100 singers and she was also named one of the 20 most important entertainers of the 20th century by Time magazine, which celebrated her "mezzo-soprano, the gospel growls, the throaty howls, the girlish vocal tickles, the swoops, the dives, the blue-sky high notes, the blue-sea low notes. Female vocalists don't get the credit as innovators that male instrumentalists do. They should. Franklin has mastered her instrument as surely as John Coltrane mastered his sax."
Franklin was born in Memphis, Tennessee, though her family moved to Buffalo, New York, and then settled in Detroit. She grew up singing in the church alongside her father Rev. C.L. Franklin, a prominent Baptist minister who recorded dozens of albums of sermons and music. She joined him on tour and she released a gospel album in 1956. Four years later, she signed with Columbia Records and when her contract ran out in 1966, she joined Atlantic Records.
That's when she blazed the pop and R&B charts with a string of hits, including "Respect," "I Say a Little Prayer," "Think," "Chain of Fools," "Day Dreaming," "(Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You've Been Gone," "Rock Steady" and "Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)."
Her Grammy-winning album, "Amazing Grace," is one of the seminal albums in not only Franklin's discography, but the canon of American pop music. It is the basis for the recently released concert film "Amazing Grace," filmed over two sessions in January 1972 at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in the Watts section of Los Angeles.

Texto completo: Israeli Spacecraft Crashes Onto Moon
THE ISRAELI BERESHEET spacecraft crashed onto the moon on April 11, ending a disappointing sequence that saw the main engine cut off before being restarted - but communications were cut off, The New York Times reported.
"Well, we didn't make it, but we definitely tried," said Morris Kahn, an Israeli telecommunications entrepreneur and president of SpacelL, the Israeli nonprofit that undertook the mission. "I think we can be proud."
Israel was aiming to be the fourth country to land on the moon, following the United States, the former Soviet Union and China.
Beresheet was a $100 million joint project between SpacelL and Israel Aerospace Industries. It launched Feb. 22 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and repeatedly orbited the Earth. It moved into lunar orbit on April 4 after being captured by the moon's gravity, BBC.com reported.
Once on the moon, Beresheet was going to take photos with high-resolution cameras then measure the magnetic field of Mare Serenitatis, the area where it landed.
Kahn announced on April 13 the establishment of Beresheet 2, a second attempt to land on the moon.
Foreign Investment in Israel Climbs
Between 2015 and 2017, foreign investment in Israel increased from under $100 billion to $129.1 billion, according to an April 7 report from the Central Bureau of Statistics, JNS.org reported.
The biggest chunk of that investment came from the United States ($21.1 billion), which was followed by the Netherlands, the Cayman Islands, Canada, China, Luxembourg, Singapore and Switzerland.
About 60 percent of that investment in 2017 went to the trade and services field, with the rest divided between high-tech, industry and advanced technologies.
Statistics also showed that Israelis abroad were increasing investments outside the country - $100.3 billion went into foreign ventures, about two-thirds of that into industry.
Animals Removed from Gaza Zoo
An international animal welfare group rescued 40 neglected animals from a Gaza Strip zoo on April 7, JNS.org reported.
Five lions, five monkeys, four ostriches, three peacocks, two wolves, foxes, porcupines, 10 squirrels and a hyena were evacuated by veterinarians and volunteers from Four Paws International from the zoo in Rafah in southern Gaza. The animals will be resituated to Jordan and South Africa.
Four Paws staff said the animals - which apparently were smuggled into Gaza from tunnels in Egypt - were suffering from trauma and neglect. Zoo animals were rescued three previous times from Gaza zoos. Four lion cubs died at a Rafah zoo in January.
West Bank Medical School Approved
A medical school will be established at the West Bank Ariel University after Israel's Council for Higher Education granted approval on April 11 via a 13-5 vote, JTA reported.
The school plans to launch in October with 70 students. If accreditation hadn't been granted, the students wouldn't have been permitted to train at Israeli hospitals. There are five other medical schools in Israel.
Sheldon Adelson, a wealthy American casino magnate and philanthropist, donated $20 million to the university in 2017 for expansion purposes. That included a medical school named for him and his wife Miriam. She is a doctor born in Israel. *

Reporters see the Mueller report as vindication; they're happy to ignore the parts they got wrong

Texto completo: “Close enough” is not a good standard for journalism. In fact, seven out of ten is a losing score.

You would think otherwise from observing how certain journalists are celebrating the release of the findings of the special counsel’s two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

There is plenty of good news for the press in the report, which was released Thursday morning to the public in all its redacted glory. It shows that many of the palace intrigue stories concerning the Trump administration were accurate, including the ones detailing squabbling and power struggles between White House aides. It confirms the stories alleging various staffers balked when the president requested that they engage in extremely unethical and/or apparently illegal behavior. The Mueller report also confirms that the Trump administration is a chaotic mess, filled with abject liars, amateurs, and backstabbing power-seekers.

However, this does not absolve the press from the fact that it also got a lot wrong in its oftentimes reckless pursuit of a theory alleging the president is a Kremlin asset. A lot. Celebrating a 70 to 80 percent accuracy rating for your news coverage is setting the bar remarkably low.

But try telling that to the New York Times Maggie Haberman, who tweeted triumphantly Thursday, “As the president now embraces this report and says it exonerates him, it's worth noting that the report confirms a lot of the reporting by NYT, WaPo and others about the president's actions, many of which he or his advisers denied in real time.”

Okay, but don’t forget that it was the Times that claimed incorrectly that K.T. McFarland, the former deputy national security adviser, conceded in a private email that Russia stole the 2016 presidential election for Trump. McFarland had said no such thing.

The Times also repeated the bogus Clinton campaign talking point throughout 2017 alleging “all 17 intelligence agencies agreed Moscow interfered in the U.S. election to get him elected.”

The paper also reported former national security adviser Michael Flynn said in a tweet that he is “the sole scapegoat for what happened" (he never said that). Of these three examples of shoddy work, Haberman’s byline is on two of them.

There’s also the Washington Post’s Philip Bump, who said Thursday, “This report makes clear that the vast amount of reporting by mainstream outlets about Trump and Russia was on the mark.”

So, too, were vast amounts off the mark. The Post, you may remember, helped kickstart the collusion news cycle with a false report alleging that Russian operatives hacked the Vermont Burlington Electric Department. The Post later had to publish a separate report acknowledging that this was not true.

The paper also reported former Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with a Russian envoy twice in 2016, which he did not disclose on security clearance forms for his attorney general confirmation hearing. Their incorrect insinuation, of course, was that the former senator tried to conceal secret contacts with foreign entities who were engaged in a conspiracy to steal the 2016 election. What the Post did not report in that article is that the former attorney general was instructed specifically by the FBI officials who walked him through the application process that he did not need to list meetings he had taken as a senator.

Lastly, there’s CNN reporter Shimon Prokupecz, who said Friday the Mueller report has "really corroborated a lot of the good journalism that was done."

But let's not forget CNN’s collusion coverage included a retracted story, three resignations, and one “colossal fuck-up.”

Oh, also, we were promised collusion, based on all these reports and others. Now we know there was no collusion. That seems like a pretty big problem overall.

It is fine to cheer that the Mueller report confirms part of the media coverage of the Trump White House. What is irritating is that there has been little public acknowledgment of what newsrooms like the Times and the Post bungled along the way, which is a large enough share of the work as to make their corpus seem unreliable. Owning up these false reports is important not just for transparency's sake, but because of media missteps have a much bigger effect on newsrooms' credibility than getting it right.

Yes, Austin is weird, and so are some of the homes within its city limits. This self-paced and self-driving tour features eight of the city's most eclectic houses, including returning favorites like the OMG House with memorabilia from the Beatles and Cheech & Chong. There are new ones to explore, too, such as the Home of the Mysterious Planchette, a historian’s home filled with an expansive collection of automatic writing planchettes, Ouija boards, séance relics and a host of other occult antiquities. Ten percent of all ticket sales benefit LifeWorks.
2. Aaron Franklin at BookPeople
7 p.m. April 19. Free. 603 N. Lamar Blvd. 512-472-5050, bookpeople.com
The owner of Franklin Barbecue may be regarded as the bona fide brisket expert in Texas, but the meat he really loves to eat and cook at home is steak. In "Franklin Steak," his follow-up to the New York Times best-selling book "Franklin Barbecue," the pitmaster demonstrates how to make his favorite food to complete perfection. Listen to Franklin talk at BookPeople about his latest cooking guide; afterward, he'll sign your copy of the book.
3. Pipes 'n' Pints at Independence Brewing

Texto completo: Last year, I published an article that changed my life.
I was a few weeks into my job at The New York Times when I realized I was never taught how to love another gay, black man.
I mean, I'd done it. I've had fulfilling relationships and I've said "I love you" and meant it. But did I really know what I was doing? Did any of us? It's hard to do something you've never seen. For most of my life, the most visible queer couples in media have been white. I'd always been aware of this, but I didn't realize what it was doing to my head.
So I made a list of all the things in my life I started to question soon after working here.
■ The truth is hard. So hard that The Times, where I'm a digital storytelling and training editor, built an entire advertising campaign around it. Is it too hard for me? Do I even know how to do journalism? Do I have a basic grasp of the English language?
■ How do I single-handedly reverse over a century of problematic representation and erasure of minority communities by the media? Will it make me Twitter-famous?
■ How do I learn to love other gay men? When I figure this out, how do I teach the rest of the gay community?
I got to thinking.
Six months earlier, I had been in Orlando, at a gay bar with a young man named Josean, whose two best friends were murdered in the Pulse Nightclub shooting 357 days earlier. We were searching for Khia, rapper of "My Neck, My Back" fame, who was performing a benefit show for survivors of the shooting and their families. (We never found her.)
Late that evening, I met another young man, who, upon learning I was a journalist, lamented the media's coverage of the Pulse shooting and its aftermath, and the focus on bloodshed and tragedy over the community's continuing story of strength and triumph.
I was emotionally overwhelmed by both that story and that moment and felt a clarity of mission that I'd never felt before.
I remember wishing I had someone to talk to. Or alcohol. Or tacos. (There are great tacos in Orlando.)
Instead, back at my hotel, I cried and watched TV and eventually I was no longer awake.
About a year after crying myself to sleep in that Orlando hotel room, I wrote and photographed an article called "Queer Love in Color" for The New York Times. That was a life-changing experience, too, in the literal sense. I grew more optimistic about love, the queer community and our ability to honestly represent the two in our reporting.
And queer couples of color started approaching me, randomly, to show me their love, which is a thing that can happen when @NYtimes retweets you (and your profile picture) to its 42 million followers.
Very late one weekend night, between the hours of 4 a.m. (when most New York City bars close) and 5 a.m. (when the Artichoke Pizza in Bushwick, Brooklyn closes), a young black man approached me as I was waiting to buy a crab slice. He pulled me out of line and introduced me to his partner. He mentioned my article, told me a bit about their story and left me with: "I just wanted you to know that our love is possible."
I'll be spending the rest of the year continuing the journey I unwittingly started after publishing "Queer Love in Color." I'll be making a narrative photography book to be released by Ten Speed Press, an imprint of Penguin Random House, in early 2021. (Hopefully. I don't know how any of this works.) I'm hoping to meet 100 queer couples of color across the country and the world, to the extent that my budget and time management skills allow. I'm going to collect stories and photographs and, I hope, answer those three big questions I'd asked myself way back in January 2018.
I recently went to my hometown, Mobile, Ala., home of America's first Mardi Gras celebration (and a leprechaun people love to tell me about). Between Mardi Gras parades, I went to visit the house I grew up in, which has been abandoned for about a decade. I hadn't been there since I was 12: an age at which I was bullied mercilessly and still felt dirty saying the words "I'm gay" out loud. I'd thought about taking my life, but only once, because I still held hope that I could live a life like the one I do now.
This book is for that kid.
If you'd like to be a part of it, send me an email at queerloveincolor@gmail.com. I'll be working on it for the rest of the year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: After more than a decade of involvement in women's soccer, Mariyam Mohamed felt she had a shot of making a convincing case to voters picking Asia's female representative on FIFA's governing council. She did not realize a powerful Arab sheikh would play a significant role in deciding exactly who gets a seat at soccer's top table.
The Asian Football Confederation last week decided to re-elect Bangladesh's Mahfuza Akhter Kiron, who was practically unknown when she beat more experienced challengers in 2017, and has rarely spoken during her tenure in the $250,000 a year post.
Kiron, though, had the backing of Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah of Kuwait, who steered voters toward his desired outcome, according a complaint Mohamed filed with A.F.C.'s election oversight panel and numerous officials involved with the process. The complaint, which was reviewed by The New York Times, was also sent to FIFA.
The sheikh, who runs the Olympic Council of Asia, an umbrella group for Olympic committees created by his late father, was identified as a co-conspirator in a Department of Justice soccer corruption case in 2017. He subsequently resigned from FIFA's ruling council and pledged to withdraw from soccer while the case was being litigated.
His continuing involvement shows how the most influential figures at the highest levels of international sport often find ways to maintain their grip on the levers of power even when they are not supposed to.
At the A.F.C.'s elections, the sheikh's luxury suite at Kuala Lumpur's Hyatt Hotel, close to the venue where voters had gathered, was where decisions were taken, according to officials that met with him, including Mohamed, a soccer official from the Maldives, who met with him in his suite.
In the complaint and in an interview with The New York Times, Mohamed provided a rare glimpse of how power functions at the highest levels of soccer, and how little has changed even in the aftermath of a major scandal in 2015.
Sheikh Ahmad, she said, told her to drop out of the election because he had already decided to back Kiron. If she did as she was told, he would be able to place Mohamed in another position, either at FIFA or within Asian soccer. If she didn't, her career was effectively over, and her country, would also suffer, he suggested.
"He said this is how it works in politics, it's not football," Mohamed recalled of the meeting in a telephone interview. "He said: 'It's not based on experience, it's the relationships we have with each other.' And that was the end."
Mohamed tried to convince him to change his mind, but he would not.
"I said, 'Please don't do this,"' she said. "I didn't want to withdraw. I just wanted to tell him not to use his powers to influence this."
A spokesman for Ahmad at the Olympic Council of Asia did not respond to a request for comment.
The elections determined which officials would represent Asia at FIFA and on the confederation's ruling council. The voting was also supposed to confirm Sheikh Salman Bin Ibrahim Al-Khalifa for another term as president, but his opponents withdrew before the poll.
The night before the elections on April 6, several members present said they received a list of 16 candidates promoted by Ahmad. All of them won seats in the elections.
The A.F.C. said in a statement that the elections are supervised by an independent body and according to guidelines to "ensure fair, honest and credible elections."
In April 2017 Ahmad was described as "co-conspirator 2" in the guilty plea of a former associate in the United States, who claimed he had received about $1 million, to influence soccer elections at the A.F.C. Following the revelations, Ahmad, who denies any accusations of wrongdoing, quit soccer, but retained powerful positions on the International Olympic Committee. Ahmad had previously lobbied for Thomas Bach to secure the International Olympic Committee presidency in 2013.
In November last year, he was forced to temporarily step away from his I.O.C. positions after being implicated in a new scandal. Swiss authorities indicted him on forgery charges. He denies those accusations, too, describing them as "politically motivated."
He didn't, however, step down from the Olympic Council of Asia, which wields considerable influence throughout the region because it distributes money from the I.O.C. for sports programs in Asia.
Ahmad's support also boosted Qatar, the biggest winners at the Asian soccer elections. A candidate from the tiny emirate that is preparing to stage the 2022 World Cup secured both the vice presidency of the A.F.C. and a position on the FIFA Council. Those victories came at the expense of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, two nations that had been lobbying against Qatar amid a bitter political dispute.
Qatar's soccer federation president, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa bin Ahmed Al Thani, a member of its ruling family, was present at Mohamed's meeting with Ahmad, said Mohamed. Vahid Kardany, head of international relations at the A.F.C., was also there. Kardany had worked directly for Ahmad earlier in his career. Kardany didn't respond to a request for comment, neither did officials in Qatar.
Two years ago, Australia's Moya Dodd lost her seat as Asia's female representative to Kiron, then a completely unknown candidate from Bangladesh, a soccer backwater where women's soccer was almost non-existent.
Members of the 37-member council said Kiron has yet to speak at a meeting.
Kiron hasn't spoken because "things are O.K.," Bangladesh soccer president Kazi Salahuddin said by phone. "Things are going so well she said she doesn't need to speak. There's no point repeating the same things as everyone else."
He said the support from the Olympic Council of Asia "probably helped" her re-election efforts.

It's OK to be rich, Senator Sanders

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders is being weirdly defensive about being a millionaire.
“I wrote a best-selling book," the Vermont senator shot at a New York Times reporter, after news emerged that he had joined the ranks of the 1 percent thanks to his 2016 book. “If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too."
Easy, killer. Just being wealthy doesn't make lefty you a hypocrite.
But feeling free to be such a public grump, on this and so many things, does mark you as a man. Imagine, for a moment if Liz Warren — just as progressive but with much more clearly framed ideas — had said any such thing, even half as testily? Game over.
Still, being wealthy, by itself, is and should be no big deal. History is replete with examples of leaders who enjoyed immense privilege, yet managed to relate to, and fight for, working people who didn't share their good fortune. That FDR guy was pretty good, to name one.
There have been plenty of the other kind, too, of course: most notably, the current occupant of the White House, born into wealth, with a long record of dodging taxes, and stiffing working people.
That guy definitely has a credibility problem when it comes to protecting ordinary folk. But Sanders? Nope. Not even now.
The Democratic presidential hopeful is all about making the richest Americans pay their fair share in taxes. Neither his commitment nor his authority is diminished by the fact that he is now one of them. His long-awaited tax returns show he paid what he owed.
Sanders and his campaign have managed to set aside the crustiness and say the right thing a few times over the last few days: “These tax returns show that our family has been fortunate," he said in a statement posted to his website. “I am very grateful for that, as I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck and I know the stress of economic insecurity," adding that he considers paying more in taxes “both an obligation and an investment in our country."
That's the perfect position to take. Of course Fox News — that ideological annex to the Trump White House — will hammer away at the democratic socialist senator for supposed hypocrisy, but Sanders is on solid ground here.
But Sanders' prickliness about his wealth plays into the hands of the thought police on the right. It's as if he buys into their notion that being rich is a problem for him. He fed speculation that he was trying to hide something by delaying the release of his tax returns. Then he has bristled defensively at questions about what they revealed.
“I didn't know that it was a crime to write a good book which turns out to be a bestseller," he said in Gary, Ind., on Saturday. And on Monday night in a Fox News town hall: “If anyone thinks I should apologize for writing a best-selling book, I'm sorry, I'm not going to do it."
Again — imagine the response if Liz Warren let herself sound half so cranky? She can be angry on the stump, and rightly so. But she draws on apparently endless reserves of politeness and patience when it comes to answering questions, even from those who disagree with her. If she didn't, she'd be cooked.
As you might sense, Bernie Sanders isn't my favorite candidate in the Democratic field. I'd love to be wrong about all of this, especially if he's the nominee, but: He's too combative, too egotistical, and too 2016, for my taste. He buys too heavily into the notion that economic anxiety — rather than appeals to racial animus — drove white working class voters into Trump's arms. I don't see how he beats the incumbent on his own turf, and beating the incumbent is the only thing that matters in 2020. If Sanders somehow does prevail, it is hard to see how he translates his big ideas into policies that pass Congress or win broad acceptance. It is so much harder to do than to say.
But one thing that doesn't bother me about Sanders is the size of his bank account. It won't bother thinking voters, either. Senator moneybags (kidding!) should give them more credit.

Texto completo: Support Assange
Early in 1973, Daniel Ellsberg released the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times, which courageously published them. Ellsberg, who leaked this information to help end the Vietnam War, was charged under the 1917 Espionage Act. Due to government misconduct, Judge Byrne dismissed charges against Ellsberg on May 11, 1973. The New York Times was never investigated or charged for publishing the documents.
In June 2012, Julian Assange, the editor of WikiLeaks, sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in the U.K. to avoid extradition to the United States for publishing the Iraq and Afghan War Logs and confidential U.S. State Department diplomatic cables. Immediately after WikiLeaks released these diplomatic cables, Attorney General Eric Holder said the U.S. government had launched an “active, ongoing criminal investigation” into that release. The investigation focused on possible violations of the Espionage Act, a law under which no nongovernment employee has ever been convicted for disclosing classified information. About 5:45 a.m. on April 11, Assange was physically dragged from his embassy sanctuary. Extradition will bring him to the United States to face charges of violating the Espionage Act.
Do we the people have a right to the truth? Do we the people still believe in the First Amendment? In the United States, is publishing the truth now a crime? Or is this just our government gone out of control? To support the First Amendment, we need to support Assange and WikiLeaks. We need to stand up and support the people's right to know.

Party of Trump
Glenn Currie (Monitor letters, April 12) forgot to mention that the 1964 Civil Rights and 1965 Voting Rights acts were shepherded through Congress by Southern Democrat and President Lyndon B. Johnson. It's another red herring. Trump Republicans are trying to reclaim the awesome days of the Republican Party, i.e., the Civil War, when they fought physically and politically for freedom and equality. Trump's Republican Party is supported by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klan members. “Trumpers” (as I am told followers like to be called) appreciate their presence: “Very good people.”

Fix building codes
New Hampshire's building codes are outdated, and the energy-efficiency portions may well be the most egregious. Making buildings tighter and better insulated adds a few hundred dollars to the initial cost but pays back in three to four years. House Bill 562, which has passed the N.H. House and has moved on to the Senate, would fix that (although it sadly contains a 30-month delay).
Since this perspective has opponents, it's worth mentioning that the payback comes in the form of lowering heating and cooling bills, not just for the life of the mortgage but the life of the building. Critics who express concern about affordable housing – and high energy costs – should note that it's folks who need affordable housing who also struggle with the costs of heating and cooling.
Taking this a little further, energy-efficient buildings are the foundation that will allow a transition to increased use of renewable energy and slow the path of climate change. Even the proponents of fixing building codes don't like to highlight that, for fear of opening a can of worms, but it's getting a little late for nuance. That wolf is at the door.

Siding stories
I read with a great deal of enthusiasm the April 15 front-page article on vinyl siding being melted by reflected sun, written by David Brooks.
I have a single-story home in Belmont covered with vinyl siding that was set (modular home) in September 2006. The garage forms an L with the side of the house, which has a large bow window.
I watched some of the siding on the front corner of the garage “wither” over time and scratched my head on the reasons. That same area has a black vinyl shutter that is not affected. I just assumed the cause was a construction problem and replaced the damaged siding, proudly saying “that takes care of that.” Nope. The following summer that same patch of new siding started to form the same wavy pattern indicative of someone using a torch on it. I eventually deduced that the window in the house was somehow collecting the sun rays and focusing on the siding but could not identify how to stop it. Since the black shutter is not affected, I am planning to double the shutter width to embrace the damaged siding. I am so glad Brooks has shown that I am not unique with this little problem.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump recently traveled to the Mexican border and delivered one of the most foolish and fallacious statements of his entire presidency. Speaking to the surge of immigrants seeking asylum here, he said, "We can’t take you anymore. Our country is full."
No, it is not full. It is not close to being full. In fact, the opposite is true. As aging baby boomers leave the workforce and depend more heavily on costly government services, more immigrants are desperately needed to fill jobs, pay taxes, have babies and revitalize areas that are losing population. Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric serves only one purpose: to energize his supporters by inflaming the nativist fears that have periodically engulfed the country throughout our history. He firmly believes those fears helped elect him once, and will again.
From a political standpoint, that calculation is questionable. Trump’s denunciation of brown-skinned rapists and gangsters pouring across the southern border certainly helped his campaign in 2016, but last year, when he tried the same cynical scare tactics, his party lost 40 seats in the House. Clear majorities in national polls have consistently opposed his immigration policies.
From an economic standpoint, however, his war on immigrants is a disaster that would suffocate the sustained growth he loves to brag about. Under great pressure from business interests, Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security doubled the number of visas available for temporary guest workers this summer. Indeed, Trump’s own resorts and golf courses have long employed foreigners — a graphic rebuttal to his own inane comments.
There are short- and long-term implications here. Since June, for the first time since 1970, there have been more jobs available than workers seeking them. Many industries, from agriculture and food service to construction and health care, are frantically seeking immigrants to hire.
Dallas homebuilders tell the New York Times that a lack of workers is adding $6,000 to the cost of every new home and delaying completion by two months. Larry Cox, who farms in California’s Imperial Valley, said the labor shortage is driving "a large transition of growing from California down to Mexico." The problem is aggravated in areas like New England that are losing population. Older cities from Philadelphia to St. Louis are actively recruiting foreigners to restock urban neighborhoods as earlier settlers depart for the suburbs. "One of the key solutions" to urban blight is "to welcome immigrants into these communities," said Brooks Rainwater of the National League of Cities to the Times.
If anything, immigrants are even more important to the nation’s future economic health. U.S. birthrates are plummeting, and last year, population growth sank to its lowest level in 80 years. Newcomers accounted for nearly half of that increase. And by 2030, foreigners will be "the primary contributor to national population growth," estimates demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution. These demographic trends, says Frey, require "a more serious discussion of U.S. immigration policy because of the future contributions that immigrants will make to growing America’s society and economy."
True, that serious discussion is imperative. But Trump’s tirade about a "full" America is totally wrong, and typical of his damaging determination to believe half-baked fantasies instead of proven facts.

Texto completo: They say that guests are like fish; after three days they become a bit whiffy. By this measure, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange smelled like an overladen fishing vessel adrift in the searing sun.
Upon his arrest Thursday by British authorities, ending his nearly seven-year asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, revelations emerged that he was less than an ideal guest. He reportedly was rude and aggressive toward his hosts and demonstrated little interest in hygiene. In his grossest display of disaffection, he apishly smeared his feces on the embassy walls, according to Ecuador’s interior minister.
Assange’s behavior makes one wonder about his mental health. Maybe he lost his mind while being confined for so long. On the other hand, he seemed quite cognizant as he left the embassy, offering peace signs and a thumbs-up to bystanders.
If Assange is, indeed, of right mind, then we can only conclude that he’s a solid jerk. Certainly, his non-fans — including many in the U.S. media — long have viewed him as a sociopathic interloper operating under the protection of free speech. More on that anon.
No stranger to legal problems, Assange has been indicted by the U.S. on one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. This sounds more like a stay-after-school offense than what one might expect given the potentially disastrous ramifications of Assange’s publishing activities.
Then again, Al Capone was brought down on tax evasion.
While the government seems to want to avoid a battle over the First Amendment, focusing mostly on conspiracy, it can later charge Assange with something more. Meanwhile, media talk has turned to whether Assange is really a journalist and if free-speech protections ought to apply to someone who is (allegedly) a criminal first? Despite the recent surge in "citizen journalists," saying you’re a journalist doesn’t make you one. (Granted, some are better than the "real" ones.) The difference between someone like Assange publishing whatever leaks land in his lap and, say, The Washington Post, which published the leaked documents known as the Pentagon Papers, is mostly a lot of worry and process. Most responsible reporters and editors routinely ask themselves questions such as: Should we publish this? Does the public interest override other concerns? Is it justifiable to expose someone’s personal emails and under what circumstances?
One supposes that Assange never bothered himself with such pesky queries. But then, why should he? He is not, after all, a journalist, despite his claiming to be, because he isn’t accountable to anyone. No filters, no standards.
In the case of the Pentagon Papers, former Rand Corp. military analyst Daniel Ellsberg stole thousands of pages of a top-secret report detailing the U.S. government’s decadeslong campaign of deceit, mayhem and murder related to the war in Vietnam. Ellsberg first gave the documents to The New York Times, which published three articles about them before the White House obtained a court injunction. Ellsberg then provided copies to the Post, which, after due consideration, began publishing its own stories.
In deliberating whether to run them, Post publisher Katharine Graham deployed lawyers and editors to weigh the potential legal and commercial consequences against allowing the government to continue lying and sacrificing lives. Graham’s bravery in standing up to the U.S. government and the courts — all while risking great personal and financial loss — was epic.
Assange’s process, on the other hand, is largely to dump secrets in the town square and let the scavengers sort it out. No filter. No conscience.
It isn’t hyperbolic to say we’re at a hinge point regarding how we gather and disseminate information. Does anyone have the right to publish stolen/classified materials? Should the manner of obtaining information inform the right to publish? For now, at least, the Assange case provides little help, but precedent may offer clues.
On the surface, Ellsberg and Assange seem similar. Ellsberg stole — and newspapers published. Assange allegedly conspired to steal — and he published. The difference may be mostly political.
The Vietnam War was unpopular, and the government demonstrably lied to the American people for decades, unconscionably committing tens of thousands of young Americans to their early graves. Ellsberg’s charges on theft, conspiracy and espionage were eventually dismissed.
WikiLeaks leaked hundreds of thousands of secret documents that potentially endangered Americans and allies around the world and, possibly, helped get Donald Trump elected.
One was a historic act of bravery; the other seems more like feces-smearing by a fishy-smelling "cypherpunk." Then again, maybe that’s just me.

Texto completo: Shortly after he disclosed his tax returns for the last 10 years, Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday rejected the idea that his newfound millionaire status was a testament to capitalism and the "American dream."
Appearing on Fox News in a town-hall style event, Mr. Sanders defended his wealth as the honestly earned result of a popular book that he wrote.
"If anybody thinks I should apologize for writing a best-selling book," he said, "I'm not going to do it."
But he did not directly answer the question, asked by an audience member, about whether he himself should pay more in taxes now that he is a member of the "1 percent," from whom he has spent years calling for greater contributions.
[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]
Then Bret Baier, one of the Fox moderators, asked Mr. Sanders, "When you wrote the book and you made the money, isn't that the definition of capitalism and the American dream?"
"No," Mr. Sanders replied. "I mean, you know, what we want is a country where everybody has opportunity. You know, I have a college degree. I'm a United States senator. But a lot of people don't have a college degree. A lot of people are not United States senators. I want everybody in this country to be able to have health care, to have education, to, when they turn on the water, have drinkable water, not toxic water."
The message appeared to be that his financial success had been possible because he had systemic advantages that many other Americans did not. "So what we are fighting for, Bret," he said, "is a society not where a just few people can make a whole lot of money, but a society where everybody in this country has the opportunity to live in security and dignity."
Mr. Sanders's tax returns showed that he earned $561,293 last year and paid an effective tax rate of 26 percent. Last week, in an interview with The New York Times, the Vermont senator acknowledged that his book earnings had made him a millionaire.
Mr. Sanders is the first Democratic candidate to appear on a 2020 town hall event on Fox News, known for conservative prime time hosts and their forceful defenses of President Trump. The Democratic National Committee has said it will not hold any 2020 debates on Fox, citing troubling ties between the network and the president.
[Who's running for president in 2020? Keep up with who's in and who's out with our candidate tracker.]
Mr. Sanders occasionally sparred with Mr. Baier and his co-host, Martha MacCallum, and at points was noticeably defensive, pushing back on questions. For instance, while he reiterated that wealthy people and corporations should pay more in taxes, "whether it's me or you or anybody else," he did not directly answer when asked whether he would personally be willing to pay a top marginal tax rate of 52 percent, as he proposed for high-income Americans during his 2016 campaign.
Instead, in a tone of frustration if not outright agitation, he tried to turn the question on the moderators, saying Mr. Baier and Ms. MacCallum surely made more than he did.
When the moderators noted that Mr. Sanders had benefited from the tax legislation that the Republican-controlled Congress passed in late 2017, he emphasized that he had voted against it.
Mr. Sanders, who is Jewish and lost many family members in the Holocaust, also defended Representative Ilhan Omar, who has come under fierce attack from President Trump for her comments about 9/11 and Israel. Mr. Sanders said that while she perhaps needed to improve her communication with Jewish Americans, he did not believe she was anti-Semitic.
"It is not anti-Semitic to be critical of a right-wing government in Israel," he said to applause.

Julian Assange is a political prisoner for revealing the truth

Texto completo: Last week’s arrest of Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange by the British government on a U.S. extradition order is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on the U.S. Constitution. It is an attack on the free press. It is an attack on free speech. It is an attack on our right to know what our government is doing with our money in our name.
Julian Assange is every bit as much a political prisoner as was Cardinal Mindszenty in Hungary or Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
They, and so many more, were imprisoned because they told the truth about their governments.
Repressive governments do not want their citizens to know that they are up to so they insist on controlling the media. We are taught, at the same time, that we have a free press whose job it is to uncover the corruption in our system so that we can demand our political leaders make some changes or face unemployment. That, we are told, is what makes us different from the totalitarian.
The arrest of Assange is a canary in a coal mine to warn us that something is very wrong with our system.
What’s wrong? The U.S. mainstream media always seems to do the bidding of the U.S. government. That is why they rushed to confirm Washington’s claim that the Assange indictment was not in any way about journalism. It was only about hacking government computers!
As the New York Times said in an editorial, sounding like a mouthpiece of the U.S. government, Julian Assange committed “an indisputable crime.” But was it? As actual journalist Glenn Greenwald wrote last week, what Julian Assange did in 2010, for which he is facing extradition to the U.S., is no different from what New York Times and other journalists do every day! He attempted to help Chelsea Manning shield Manning’s identity as Manning blew the whistle on U.S. government crimes to a publisher. The information in question included a video showing U.S. military personnel participating in and cheering the murder of Iraqi civilians. Why is it criminal for us to know this?
The difference is that what Assange and Manning did embarrassed the U.S. government, which was lying to us that it was “liberating” Iraq and Afghanistan when it was actually doing the opposite. Mainstream journalists publish “leaks” that help bolster the neocon or other vested narratives of the different factions of the US government. That’s why the US media wants to see Assange in prison, or worse: he upset their apple cart.
The lesson is clear: when you bolster the government’s narrative you are a “brave journalist.” When you expose corruption in government you are a criminal. Do we really want to live in a country where it is illegal to learn that our government is engaged in criminal acts? I thought we had an obligation as an engaged citizenry to hold our government accountable!
As long as Julian Assange is in prison, we are all in prison. When the government has the power to tell us what we are allowed to see, hear, and know, we no longer live in a free society. Julian Assange will be extradited to the U.S. and he will have dozens of charges piled on. They want him to disappear so that the next Assange will think twice before informing us of our government’s crimes. Are we going to let them steal our freedom?

Everyone agrees the US needs to fix the border. But how?

Texto completo: Xochitl Rodriguez crossed the Rio Grande a few weeks ago to visit her aunt’s old studio in Ciudad Juárez. It had been years since she had visited, her aunt having fled to El Paso a decade ago amid intensifying cartel violence.
Born and raised on the United States side of this binational metroplex, Ms. Rodriguez is no stranger to the six bridges that cross the Rio Grande. On her way back, she saw something she had never seen before: hundreds of migrants sleeping behind chain-link fencing under the Paso del Norte Bridge.
“Two hundred people and they were yelling up at us: ‘We’re already four days here in the dirt,’” she recalls. “How as a human do you allow that to happen?”
For months, asylum-seekers – predominantly families and unaccompanied children from Central America – have been arriving at southern border cities like El Paso in numbers not seen in a decade. Community members like Ms. Rodriguez have been working round the clock to help shelter and feed migrants released by overwhelmed immigration agencies.
“El Paso knows how to do it. I wish we didn’t know. I wish we didn’t have to do this,” she says. “From the perspective of this community, it’s especially frustrating to see no help and no real policy change.”
Immigration agencies are working around the clock as well, taking unprecedented steps in response to a migrant surge they say they are ill-equipped, physically and legally, to handle. Two children died in U.S. custody in December, and medical screenings are being conducted for every child under 17. Extra agents are being drafted in from across the southwest border to help process migrants, and wait times at ports of entry now last hours.
While immigration is a notoriously divisive political issue, the current crisis has reinforced a widespread consensus, stretching from federal agencies to immigrant activists, that America’s immigration system needs an overhaul. A tougher question is whether consensus can be found over what that overhaul should look like, particularly given how inaction has become a fruitful response for the politicians who would need to do the overhauling.
The issue with prioritizing changing laws, experts say, is that immigration has become a political wedge issue.
“Wedge issues don’t get resolved. They get used by both sides to mobilize their base,” wrote Sonia Nazario, a veteran immigration journalist, in a New York Times op-ed last October.
Border as an ‘ecosystem’ In addition to legal and policy changes to a system geared toward quickly deporting adult Mexican men, some experts believe a structural rethink is necessary.
“We’ve treated border security, really for the last 35 years, as the fence of a static line,” says Victor Manjarrez, a former Border Patrol sector chief.
“We should look at border security more of as an ecosystem,” he adds, “an ecosystem that is affected by a bunch of variables near and distant, things that border security folks don’t touch but certainly affects them.”
A shake-up in the higher ranks of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) this month hints at how the Trump administration may now seek to plug what it calls “loopholes” in immigration law.
“The only way to fundamentally address these flows is for Congress to act and to reinstate integrity into our immigration system,” said Kevin McAleenan, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), in a late-March press conference. Commissioner McAleenan is expected to become the agency’s acting secretary after a number of forced resignations last week.
Specifically, there are two areas of the law the Trump administration is seeking to change. A settlement in a 1997 class-action lawsuit called Flores requires the government to hold families for no longer than 20 days. In addition, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), enacted in 2008, requires the government to put all unaccompanied migrant children into immigration court proceedings unless they’re from Mexico or Canada. The administration is also seeking to raise the standard by which an asylum-seeker can claim “credible fear,” The New York Times reports.
American and international asylum laws, combined with the likelihood of a quick release from detention via the Flores settlement and TVPRA and yearslong backlogs in U.S. immigration courts, form a relatively simple route to life in the U.S. for migrants until at least 2021. A majority of asylum claims are denied – around 60% in fiscal year 2017. That year, 11,022 migrants released from custody were ordered deported after failing to appear for their immigration court hearings, a 21% increase from the year before, according to the Justice Department.
The “border” could be pushed out, says Dr. Manjarrez, now a professor at the University of Texas, El Paso (UTEP), in terms of asylum-seekers being vetted before they arrive at the U.S. border and need to be housed or transported. Could credible fear claims be evaluated in the asylum-seekers’ home country? Could asylum cases be adjudicated in Mexico?
Such proposals would likely be challenged in court. American and international asylum laws are premised on the notion that refugees request asylum once they reach the refuge country because they are in too much danger elsewhere. Last week a federal judge in San Francisco temporarily blocked a DHS policy requiring asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims made their way through U.S. immigration court in part because it violated laws ensuring migrants “are not returned to unduly dangerous circumstances.”
Also likely to face court challenges is a plan the White House says it is mulling to release detained migrants in so-called sanctuary cities, many of which are Democratic strongholds. On Monday, the chairmen of three House committees asked the White House and agency officials for internal documents on those deliberations, according to The Associated Press.
‘The border story is the blowback’ Instead of tightening asylum requirements, or extending U.S. border control infrastructure into other countries, others believe the current immigration system could work provided it’s resourced appropriately. Just look at Annunciation House, a nonprofit in El Paso that has been sheltering migrants released by immigration agencies, says Ms. Rodriguez.
“If Annunciation House can process 700 people a day ... as an NGO with a minimal budget, a federal government can figure out how to do this,” she adds.
With the CBP budget having increased more than tenfold between 1990 and 2015, the government should be able to detain more asylum-seekers and hire more immigration judges so asylum claims can be adjudicated faster, says Josiah Heyman, director of the Center for Inter-American and Border Studies at UTEP.
“The border story is the blowback from an increasingly dysfunctional and failing immigration court system,” he says.
“The immigration judicial process needs to be quick, efficient, and fair,” he continues, and “everyone needs representation because if they did I think a lot of the inadequate cases would drop by the wayside.”
The CBP is planning to open a new migrant processing center in El Paso in April. Last week U.S. Attorney General William Barr told Congress the Department of Justice is requesting $72 million for 100 new immigration judges, though he also said that “the problem with the asylum laws” needs to be addressed first.
The blame game The current crisis has been brewing for at least five years, when 2014 saw a surge in unaccompanied minors from Central America at the southern border. The situation has only become more complicated since then, experts say.
CBP announced last week that more than 103,000 migrants were apprehended or found inadmissible at the southern border in March, an increase from 76,500 in February. However, the number of arrested migrants with criminal convictions has been declining. The rise of sophisticated smuggling operations through Mexico and fears that President Donald Trump’s threats to close the border to everyone may actually be realized have supersized migrant flows, meaning those with weaker asylum claims, like economic migrants, are making the journey. But economic migrants can also be indirect victims of violence and government corruption in their countries.
“The dysfunctionality of the U.S. immigration system is something that goes way back,” says Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at the George Mason University Schar School of Policy and Government. But “it seems like the Democratic Party, and Republicans and the Trump administration, they’re only blaming [each other].”
“This might be the end of an era,” she says, referring to the ousters at DHS. “What we might see now is a real attempt to address the issues that need to be addressed.”

Texto completo: For New Jersey residents, it all feels very new. After years of emotional debate, lawmakers approved a measure last month to allow terminally ill patients to end their lives with medical help, and last week Gov. Phil Murphy signed it into law.
But so-called aid-in-dying laws have been in effect for over two decades in the United States. Oregon was the first to approve such a measure, in 1994, followed by Washington in 2008 and four other states in the past six years.
Litigation has closely followed just about every successful vote to decriminalize assisted suicide, but courts have generally allowed such laws to be implemented, and polling has shown the policies to be popular among residents with access to them.
Now that New Jersey is the latest state to permit strictly regulated, medically assisted suicide for its residents, here's a look at the events that led to the gradual spread of the policy across the country.
Oregon the pioneer In a victory for groups trying to wrest end-of-life choices away from the state and the medical profession, Oregon voters narrowly approved a measure in 1994 to make it the first place in North America where doctors could legally help patients end their lives.
Oregon's ballot question came in the wake of failed attempts to legalize assisted suicide in Washington and California. But unlike the measures in those states, the Oregon measure did not allow doctors to administer a lethal dose.
Nonetheless, the backlash was fierce. The Vatican, which viewed the measure as a half-step from euthanasia, condemned the Oregon vote as "a day of mourning for all humanity," according to a report in The New York Times.
Such depth of emotion spawned more than a decade of litigation that twice brought Oregon's policy before the U.S. Supreme Court. It would be years before another state followed Oregon's example.
Legal challenges Within weeks of the Oregon referendum, implementation of the law was put on hold after lawyers for the National Right to Life Committee challenged the measure as unconstitutional, arguing that it violated the rights of terminally ill people to equal protection.
Around the same time, other cases challenging bans on medically assisted suicide in New York and Washington made their way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the summer of 1997, justices ruled that the Constitution does not provide a general right to assisted suicide, but they left the door open to states to experiment with such laws.
Four months later, the high court removed the last legal obstacle to the Oregon law taking effect, and voters there again endorsed the measure when they roundly defeated a ballot measure aimed at repealing the law.
After more threats, assisted suicide laws spread A series of threats from Washington, D.C., over the next decade had a chilling effect on other states considering assisted suicide laws. After unsuccessful attempts by members of Congress to overturn Oregon's law, U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft announced in 2001 that doctors who prescribed lethal medication under state law risked losing their federal licenses to prescribe controlled substances.
That directive, too, was met with a legal challenge, culminating five years later in the U.S. Supreme Court again defending the Oregon law, ruling that Ashcroft had overstepped his authority.
Washington was the next state to approve an assisted suicide law in 2008, followed by Vermont in 2013, California in 2015, Colorado in 2016 and Hawaii in 2018. The District of Columbia also allows medically assisted suicide.
Montana does not have a statute permitting the practice, but a 2009 state Supreme Court ruling said state law protects doctors from prosecution for helping terminally ill patients die. Since the ruling, Montana lawmakers have introduced several bills to ban the practice, but none has passed.
What to expect in New Jersey If New Jersey is like other states that have legalized medically assisted suicide, participation rates will gradually increase over time. In Oregon, the first state to allow the practice, 249 people received prescriptions for lethal medication last year, up from 24 in 1998, according to state data. Cancer has been the most common underlying illness there, followed by neurological and respiratory diseases.
Deaths under so-called aid-in-dying laws have accounted for a tiny fraction of overall deaths in other states. Still, it's possible some people from neighboring states could establish residency in New Jersey to take advantage of its assisted suicide law. Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old with terminal brain cancer, for example, made international news when she moved from her home state of California to Oregon in 2014 to legally end her life.
Under the New Jersey measure, patients can prove their residency by showing a doctor their driver's license or non-driver ID card, proof they are registered to vote in New Jersey, a resident income tax return or "any other government record" that demonstrates residency.
The new law will take effect Aug. 1.

Mark Meadows: 'Highly likely' FISA abuse investigation spawns more criminal referrals

Texto completo: Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., says he expects more criminal referrals will be sent to the Justice Department based on an inspector general's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse investigation.

Last week, House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., sent a notification letter to Attorney General William Barr saying his team "identified several potential violations of the law" as part of an investigation into origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and hopes to set up a meeting to discuss.

During an interview on Fox News, Meadows said it is "highly likely" more criminal referrals will follow that "correspond with what [Congressman] Nunes has already put forth."

"The big story that has not been told ... [are] leaks to the Washington post and the New York Times that would indicate well beyond what the FBI should have been doing in terms of classified information and I'm sure that the IG will look at that, but more importantly go even beyond that when attorney general Barr looks at the broader accept of this investigation," the GOP investigator said on "Sunday Morning Futures."

Meadows, a member of the House Oversight Committee, met with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz last week along with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. In a Fox News interview on Tuesday, Jordan said Horowitz told them he "expects" a report on his investigation into possible FISA abuse by the DOJ and FBI "in May or June," confirming what Barr testified earlier in the day to a congressional panel.

Horowitz announced the initiation of the FISA abuse investigation in March 2018 after requests from both then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Republican members in Congress. The lawmakers claimed the Justice Department and FBI had abused the FISA process and misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in their investigation and surveillance of President Trump and his associates during the campaign, as well as during the Trump administration.

Onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page was the subject of a FISA warrant and three renewals.

During his interview Sunday, host Maria Bartiromo asked Meadows to explain how the FBI "used" the media by leaking "fake news" to use as evidence for the FISA application process.

"What we would find is people within the department of justice primarily the FBI would actually give information to the media, then those reports would actually come out and they would say 'Wow, we have these reports now,' and then they would take the actual reports and use those as the probable cause to do a further investigation," Meadows said. "It was a big circular reasoning. You'll see all of that come out, I believe, when inspector general's report comes out."

Meadows stressed that he has not yet seen Horowitz's findings, but claimed the evidence is plain for everyone to see.

"Well I'd say the lions share of all of this after August of 2016 leading up to the election, the lions share of this, over 90-95% of this, was either the dossier or open source Intel which came from media reports, so there's not any there there there, and that's what even [former FBI agent] Peter Strzok said early on," Meadows said. "And so when we look at this, this is a large fabrication which predicated much of the investigation that we've been reporting on for two years."

Barr is putting together a team to examine the FBI's initial investigation into President Trump's campaign in the summer of 2016. He testified last week it will be substantiated by Horowitz's findings.

Bartiromo said there was a "strong suggestion" by Barr that alleged misconduct may have taken place beyond the FBI, at the CIA, State Department, and elsewhere. Meadows said Barr is "spot on" to expand his investigation beyond Horowitz's probe, and specifically cited former CIA Director John Brennan, an outspoken Trump critic.

"I can tell you based on unclassified documents we've reviewed, we saw that [John] Brennan's name with the CIA, we've seen others within the State Department mention very early on and they were actually coordinating back and forth with the FBI in the early stages the investigation," Meadows said. "So I think part of the problem we have here is is that it was not just a few people within the FBI. It was a coordinated effort with the intelligence communities outside of the FBI and to the extent of that I think AG Barr is going to look at that."

In addition to the DOJ inspector general’s probe, U.S. Attorney John Huber is also conducting an investigation. A March 2018 letter from Republicans in Congress asked then-Attorney General Sessions to appoint a second special counsel to look into “certain decisions made and not made by the Department of Justice and FBI in 2016 and 2017” which they believed showed “evidence of bias, trending toward animus, among those charged with investigating serious cases.” Instead of a special counsel, Sessions tasked Huber with this mission later in March 2018. The status of his parallel probe is not known.

Senate side, Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says there will be investigations into the origins of Mueller’s investigation and potential bias in the Justice Department and FBI, including a look at FISA warrants.

Democrats have long argued that the FBI acted appropriately in obtaining the authority to spy on the Trump campaign due to concerns about Russian influence. In a rebuttal to the House Intelligence GOP memo which alleged the FBI did not reveal the dossier's Democratic benefactors or Steele's anti-Trump bias in obtaining FISA warrants to spy on Page, Democrats argued the DOJ and FBI "met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement."

Nunes' criminal referrals, which include two related to charges of conspiracy to lie to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, came together as special counsel Robert Mueller concluded his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Although Barr said in a summary of Mueller's team could not establish criminal conspiracy between the Trump team and Russia, some Democrats, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., insist there is clear evidence of collusion.

Meanwhile, House Democrats are sounding the alarm over plans by Nunes to meet privately with Barr to discuss the criminal referrals.

Parenting tip: Let's just be present

Texto completo: Every generation has a fresh take on parenting, its own personal stamp on how children should be raised. Lately, though, it seems we hear of a new style every few weeks. First there were attachment parents and helicopter parents, and now come the snowplow parents.
This last group is particularly infuriating because it means just what one might expect: to remove all obstacles in the path of a child. In other words, instead of preparing the child for the road ahead, the parent prepares the road itself. They plow it and pave it and block traffic. Sometimes, as in the case of the parents in the college admissions scandal, they even commit fraud.
As far as parenting styles named for heavy machinery are concerned, it seems that snowplows deserve more ire than helicopter parents — characterized as those who hover too close — because snowplows do more than hover. They do the work, sometimes even the dirty work, for the child.
Of course there's a big difference between over-parenting and engaging in criminal activity. Either way, I'm curious if there's anything positive to glean from the revelation of how far some parents go to shelter their children from the travails of growing up. How did we get here, by the way? And what can parents of more modest means (and probably stronger ethics) do instead to better prepare their children to succeed in the world?
First, let's remember: Failure is good. Not all the time, not as a way of being or way of life. But failure teaches kids resilience, creativity, and prioritization. Through failure, we learn what matters enough that we are willing to work relentlessly toward it no matter how many times we fail; or we learn to adapt and recognize new opportunities when something doesn't work out.
Jessica Lahey, New York Times best-selling author of the book, “The Gift of Failure: How the Best Parents Learn to Let Go So Their Children Can Succeed" and a longtime educator, puts it this way: “Kids need to have a positive, adaptive response to failures in order to learn from them, so every time we swoop in and save kids from a consequence, that's a learning opportunity lost."
When it comes to parenting, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Each kid is different. The strengths and resources of parents vary greatly. And yet, one technique stands out for me, which can be summed up in two words: Be present.
Practically speaking, babies and toddlers do not exist anywhere other than the present moment. When they are hungry, hunger is all that exists. When they are in pain, pain is all-encompassing. Older children understand the concept of time, but their needs are only slightly less immediate. You can reason that you'll go to the playground not today but tomorrow or request that no one wake you before 7 a.m. on Saturdays, but a child of any age still often needs a response in the moment.
When it comes to parenting, the most important question might not be which style we choose, but how we show up for our children in a given moment. One moment after the other. Every day. Year layered upon year, like tiers of birthday cake or bricks. Granted, no one is perfect, never distracted, or immune to a bad mood or short fuse, but before we can be “good" parents, we must first be present ones. We can borrow wisdom from all kinds of parenting styles: from Montessori or Tiger Mamas, attachment or anything goes, but it all seems secondary to the question of whether our faces light up when they enter a room. Do we take the time to be attentive in their presence?
We teach kids to stop and look both ways before crossing the street. It's a crucial safety precaution, but it can also serve as mindfulness inspiration as parents. How often do we take pause, stopping to consider what is happening as it's happening, rather than merely reacting? As parents, do we have a stop-and-look equivalent as the moment is unfolding?
To be present involves seeing a child for who he or she is, rather than, say, a variation of his/her face Photoshopped onto the body of an Ivy League soccer player. Ludicrous as it sounds, parents in the college admissions scandal used this technique. It's extreme and fraudulent and laughable to the rest of us, but it also stems from a place to which even the most well-meaning among us can probably relate. Haven't we each felt at some point that our own parents wished we might be a little different: more like a sibling, studying to be a doctor, or at least married by now?
Before becoming a mother, I confess to thinking that parenting might be a code that could be cracked if I read enough books. So, before my daughter was born, I started with sleep. I read all the sleep books. I polled friends whose children slept through the night early and easily. I would do what they did. I would read what they read. I highlighted these books, dog-eared important pages, read paragraphs aloud to my husband.
When the time came for our baby to sleep through the night, our pediatrician was adamant: We were not candidates for that approach yet. Our daughter was underweight, not dangerously so but worrisome enough, and the instructions were clear. If she awoke, she was to be fed. Not shushed, soothed, or left to cry as various sleep training methods suggest.
I never cracked those books again. I nursed our baby in the middle of the night, whenever she needed, until one night, she slept through. She made this determination of readiness on her own, and we followed her lead. This revelation was one of the first and most formative parenting lessons I experienced as a new mom. I had such a predetermined vision for how things would go, only to discover that it would be detrimental (if not dangerous) to proceed with it. The decision to recalibrate was easy and obvious, but I have thought about it a lot since because it was such a powerful example of how children have agency from the beginning. They are small people with their own needs and timing, and our role is not to enforce a future agenda but be as open and loving as we can with the realities we face together in the moment.
It should be noted that reality can often be a drag. Last week, my daughter vomited directly in my ear. If there's a parenting lesson there, it's probably that another human being can vomit directly in your ear and if that human being is your child, all you will think is, “Oh, god, I love you so much; I just want you to feel better."
Even when the moment is disgusting or disappointing, heartbreaking or tedious, our kids will notice and respond most to who we are being in the moment more than what we say or will them to accomplish. But amid the everyday parenting pressures, along with social media's drive to parent performatively, it's easy to forget. Our vision gets obscured by the cello lessons, test scores, and acceptance letters. This one speaks three languages. That one does Russian Math. It can feel like our report card, maybe more than theirs.
Stop. Breathe. Be here, in this moment, with yourself, with your kid whom you love. That's the job. Leave the plowing of snow and hovering at 460 rotations per minute to the heavy machinery.

Texto completo: MOSCOW - Russia took a step toward government control over the internet on Thursday, as lawmakers approved a bill that freedom of information advocates worry will open the door to sweeping censorship.
The legislation is designed to route web traffic through filters controlled by Roskomnadzor, the state communications watchdog, increasing its power to control information and block messaging or other applications.
It also provides for Russia to create its own system of domain names that would allow the internet to continue operating within the country, even if it were cut off from the global web.
The bill's goal, according to its authors, is to "ensure a stable, secure and seamless" internet. Advocates hailed it as an important step toward an independent Russian internet, not reliant on traffic routed through other countries.

Hungary opera asks 'Porgy and Bess' cast to be African American

Texto completo: When the Hungarian State Opera's white cast of singers came together in Budapest earlier this month to revive a production of George Gershwin's opera "Porgy and Bess," they received letters carrying an unusual request: to declare themselves African-American.
According to the Hungarian news website Index, which said it has seen a copy of the letter, the singers were asked to sign a declaration stating that "African-American origins and spirit form an inseparable part" of their identity. At least half the group signed, according to Index.
The letter was from the Hungarian State Opera's general director, Szilveszter Okovacs, who last year defended the company's decision to perform the work with white singers against the wishes of the Gershwin estate.
"Porgy and Bess," which premiered in the United States in 1935, tells the story of an African-American community's struggles with violence and racism. George Gershwin famously turned down companies that wanted to perform the opera in blackface, and his estate stipulates that the work should be performed by an all-Black cast.
The letters seemed to be part of a defiant publicity stunt by Okovacs, who spoke cryptically and evasively with reporters. In an interview with the Hungarian news network ATV on Monday, Okovacs said that "Hungary does not keep records of skin color," and therefore he could not "tell whether the cast suits that requirement."
Speaking to another TV network, Euronews, Okovacs acknowledged the oddity of his request to the singers. "If we have to play on absurd grounds," he said of the Gershwin estate's requirements for the performance, "we can't do anything but join the field in absurd outfits."
Okovacs added that he was opposed to allowing "the presence of people in a production to be determined by skin color or ethnicity."
A spokesman for the Hungarian State Opera declined to comment.
Sargent Aborn, the chief executive of Tams-Witmark, the New York-based agents of the Gershwin estate, said in an email on Tuesday that the Hungarian State Opera production was taking place without a license. Hungarian news media reported that the cast had prepared the current performances with photocopied musical scores.
Okovacs told The New York Times last year that the company had signed a contract with Tams-Witmark that didn't contain specifics about the singers' ethnicity. Still, when the production premiered, playbills and posters carried a note stating that the production was taking place without authorization and "contrary to the requirements for the presentation of the work."
But Tuesday, Aborn of Tams-Witmark contested that version of events. He said that after the Hungarian State Opera confirmed "in writing that they understood the need to cast Black singers to present the work dramatically, a license was issued for the 2018 production." That license has since expired.
"It subsequently came to our attention that the production was in clear breach," he said, adding that Tams-Witmark and the Gershwins were examining legal options.

Texto completo: If news-deprived travelers were to land in the middle of a Democratic presidential rally, they might walk away thinking the country is desperately trying to liberate people trapped in the nation’s capital, or that some strange university called the Electoral College is the greatest threat to American life and must be eliminated.
None of that, of course, mirrors the reality of average American priorities, but such is the way of a candidate trying to prove his or her loyalty to party insiders.
Distractions, not discussions, have captured America’s attention.
Gravitating to the extremes only to dance toward the middle during the general election has long proven an effective campaign strategy for Democrats and Republicans alike. But racing too quickly to validate fringe ideas in so crowded a primary could entirely remove from the public debate the conversations Americans actually need.
Among those are solutions on health care, the economy and immigration — the top three voter concerns according to Gallup’s poll during the 2018 midterm cycle. Statehood for Washington, D.C., did not make that list. Nor did eliminating the Electoral College or disposing of all airplanes.
Many voters said climate change was “extremely/very important,” but only after first listing trade policy, taxes, foreign affairs and gun policy. As New York Times columnist David Brooks describes it, the Democratic rush to the left isn’t a primary, it’s a purity test.
Pleasing party faithfuls can lead to some early campaign cash, but the risk is large. Sound bites spread across the internet ad nauseum and give the average voter more reason to believe politicians are out of touch with general society.
Republicans, too, are complicit in sidestepping top voter concerns. President Donald Trump pledged recently to keep fighting the Affordable Care Act in the courts and touted a forthcoming Republican health care plan — a good sign productive congressional debate on the nation’s highest concern was around the corner. Now, the country reportedly won’t see that plan until after the 2020 election.
To their credit, Senate Republicans have floated a bill to protect people with pre-existing conditions, and most Democratic candidates have at least outlined the type of health care system they would support. But the country isn’t much closer to cheaper premiums or lower drug costs.
Nor has anyone from either party brought to a vote a viable immigration solution since the situation of asylum-seekers at the southern border has reached crisis levels.
It’s time for a reality check. Politicians need to see what their constituents want, and candidates must anticipate what the country actually needs. The sad truth is political campaigning demands candidates raise funds and gain the support of the active (and more extreme) party members. That means initially cozying up to donors and party purists, but that must not distract from the key issues with which they will ultimately wrestle once in office. Doing otherwise is a failure to represent the American people.

Church groups flock to movie 'Unplanned' Planned Parenthood takes issue with how it's depicted

Texto completo: Following a nationwide trend, members of Covenant Church Spokane packed Village Centre Cinemas at Wandermere last weekend to view "Unplanned," the new movie that follows the path of Abby Johnson, a Planned Parenthood director turned anti-abortion activist.
"It was very hard to watch, we literally had people that went out to the lobby area that couldn't remain in the theater because it was so gut-wrenching," said Ken Peters, senior pastor at Covenant Church.
Peters is the organizer behind The Church at Planned Parenthood, a group that leads a monthly service on the lawn outside Spokane's Planned Parenthood center. The group has also held events in Yakima and Everett.
Peters said after the showing, one of his parishioners came up to him. "He said to me, 'It's just murder, it's just murder,' " Peters said. "We are murdering little kids in our country."
Paul Dillon, spokesman for Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho, said the movie's depiction of Planned Parenthood is inaccurate.
"It's just trying to show shock and gore and build a world around misinformation," Dillon said. "It's distorting fact in service of an extreme agenda."
The movie received an R rating for its depiction of abortions. ComScore reported the movie was eighth in sales in the country last week, generating $3.2 million.
Joe Knopp, "Unplanned" producer, said not everyone who worked on the movie agreed with its rating, but he thought it was appropriate.
Knopp credits part of the movie's success to its grassroots marketing campaign that led churches like Peters' to organize showings.
"It's actually been amazing to hear the amount of groups that have been either renting out the actual theater, a screen itself, or taking a large number of groups to go see that at a time," Knopp said.
The movie's plot pivots around Johnson (Ashley Bratcher) assisting in an abortion at 13 weeks by handling the ultrasound wand while a doctor performs a suction abortion. In the movie, the fetus wriggles away from the suction while the abortion is taking place. This causes Johnson to have a crisis of conscience and become a pro-life advocate.
The New York Times interviewed Jennifer Villavicencio, a fellow at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, who said the fetus's movements in the movie were inaccurate.
"If you watch an ultrasound, certainly there is movement, but it's not kicking its legs or recoiling," Villavicencio said.
Reports in Texas Monthly also question Johnson's accounts, noting that there were no ultrasound-guided abortions on the day Johnson specified, and that she had negative performance reports from Bryan (Texas) Planned Parenthood leading up to the date she quit.
Anna Bohach, Selkirk Prolife Alliance communications director, saw the movie at Regal Cinemas in Spokane Valley on opening day. She characterized it as "hard to watch" and "heartbreaking."
Bohach is a parishioner at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Spokane Valley and said she discussed the movie with women from her prayer group outside the group's regular meetings, encouraging the women to see the film.
Bohach said most of the people in the theater with her - which she said was full - were also women, and she felt that the portrayal of the women who worked at Planned Parenthood was fair and accurate.
"I don't have a problem with people who work at Planned Parenthood, my heart goes out to them because I just don't think they realize what they're doing," Bohach said.
Bryan Planned Parenthood, where Johnson worked, closed in 2015 and was replaced by Hope Pregnancy Center, a faith-based nonprofit that offers pregnancy tests, ultrasounds and counseling services. Texas is one of the handful of states where legislators filed "fetal heartbeat bills" that would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.
In an article written by Johnson for the Federalist, she said the form that proves there was no ultrasound-guided abortion is a false document and that Planned Parenthood frequently falsifies dates.
Knopp said he doesn't doubt the veracity of Johnson's story because Planned Parenthood issued a gag order on Johnson soon after she quit and the judge overturned the order.

Texto completo: Britain British wildlife populations have seen a resurgence.  Extinction seemed inevitable for some of Britain’s carnivorous species in the 1970s because of factors including pollution, habitat destruction, and hunting. Since then, conservation efforts have contributed to population growth among carnivores, but each species’ story has been different. Banning pesticides and outlawing hunting led to the resurgence of otter populations, whereas warmer winters have helped badgers survive and raise more cubs. Researchers say the stability of carnivore populations depends on gamekeepers’ willingness to coexist with them. (The Guardian)
Afghanistan A wrestling club that was bombed by the Islamic State is back and stronger than ever. The Maiwand Wrestling Club in Kabul was known as an institution responsible for producing champions. But last September, dozens of club members were killed in a bombing that also left the building in ruins. After the global wrestling community heard reports of the bombing, enough money was raised to rebuild the Maiwand club, with some to spare to support other Afghan wrestling clubs. Now the Maiwand club hosts up to 400 wrestlers a day and has become a place for survivors to come together. (The New York Times)
United States Binge drinking for teenagers is at a record low. Underage drinking in the U.S. has been on the decline for the past three decades, thanks to educational initiatives. Survey data from 2018 show binge drinking is at its lowest rate since the survey began 27 years ago. And while vaping among teens has recently spiked, alcohol consumption began declining before vaping among young people became popular. That means it’s unlikely that vaping has been taken up as a substitute for alcohol consumption. (Quartz)
Kenya Farmers are prospering by growing a native “money tree.”  Prolonged drought in Kenya has sent many farmers into poverty. Soil quality has also worsened over time from deforestation and erosion. To improve the soil and help crops grow, farmers are planting the  Melia volkensii  tree in their fields.  M. volkensii  is drought-resistant, its fallen leaves replenish the ground’s nutrients, and shade from the tree allows other crops to thrive. Farmers can also sell the tree’s timber for quick cash. (Reuters)
India A new bridge in India will benefit millions. The government has finalized plans to build the Dhubri-Phulbari bridge, which will be the country’s longest. It will cross the Brahmaputra River, substantially cutting travel time for commuters and improving accessibility. Until now, the fastest way to cross the river was by motorboat, requiring three hours of travel time. The journey was sometimes impossible during the rainy season. The Dhubri-Phulbari bridge will connect communities, increase trade opportunities, and foster economic development. However, the building site is also home to an endangered species of river dolphins. Plans have been made to monitor the dolphins’ whereabouts throughout construction to ensure the population’s safety. (The Print)

Texto completo: SEOUL, South Korea - In a major reversal, South Korea's Constitutional Court on Thursday ordered the easing of the country's decades-old ban on most abortions, one of the strictest in the developed world.
Abortions have been largely illegal in South Korea since 1953, though convictions for violating the restrictions are rare. Still, the illegality of abortions forces women to seek out unauthorized and often expensive procedures to end their pregnancies, creating a social stigma that makes them feel like criminals.
The court's nine-justice panel said that the parliament must revise legislation to ease the current regulations by the end of 2020. It said the current abortion law was incompatible with the constitution and would be repealed if parliament fails to come up with new legislation by then.
The ruling is final and cannot be appealed, court officials said, but current regulations will remain in effect until they are replaced or repealed.
Current exceptions to the law only allow abortions when a woman is pregnant through rape or incest, when a pregnancy seriously jeopardizes her health, or when she or her male partner has certain diseases.
A woman in South Korea can be punished with up to one year in prison for having an illegal abortion, and a doctor can get up to two years in prison for performing an unauthorized abortion.
Thursday's verdict was a response to an appeal filed in 2017 by an obstetrician charged with carrying out about 70 unauthorized abortions from 2013-2017 at the request or approval of pregnant women.
4 in Senate GOP signal their opposition to Cain on Fed
WASHINGTON - A swift defection of at least four Senate Republicans has all-but-doomed the chance of Herman Cain to win a seat on the Federal Reserve's board of governors, serving as one of the most striking rebukes to President Donald Trump's personnel choices since he took office in 2017.
Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., all said they would oppose Cain's appointment to the Fed. Republicans control 53 seats of the 100-chamber Senate, and losing the support of four members means Cain would need help from Democrats, which appears unlikely.
Cain ran for president in the 2012 GOP primary, but lost momentum amid accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct, among other things.
Cain has denied wrongdoing.
Navy drops criminal charges against ex-Fitzgerald officers
Two former officers involved in the June 2017 collision between the USS Fitzgerald and a commercial ship off the coast of Japan will no longer face criminal charges, the Navy has announced.
"This decision is in the best interest of the Navy, the families of the Fitzgerald Sailors, and the procedural rights of the accused officers," the Navy said in a news release late Wednesday. "Both officers were previously dismissed from their jobs and received nonjudicial punishment."
Former commanding officer Cmdr. Bryce Benson was sleeping in his quarters the night of the collision, while former crew member Lt. Natalie Combs was manning the ship's Combat Information Center.
Two other officers were also charged in the collision, which killed seven U.S. sailors.
Trump's sister retires, negating judicial ethics complaints
NEW YORK - President Donald Trump's sister has retired as a federal appellate judge in Philadelphia, ending a civil misconduct inquiry launched after a report that she participated in Trump family schemes to dodge taxes.
The retirement of Maryanne Trump Barry was revealed in an April 1 order signed by a top court official in New York, where the misconduct case was assigned to prevent conflicts of interest for judges who knew Barry.
A judicial panel began the review in response to four citizen complaints filed in October after The New York Times published a story alleging the president and his siblings evaded inheritance taxes.
Barry, 82, was not identified by name in the order, but the facts matched her circumstances.
Ohio governor signs fetal heartbeat abortion bill
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Ohio's governor has signed a bill imposing one of the nation's toughest abortion restrictions.
Republican Gov. Mike DeWine followed through Thursday on his pledge to sign the heartbeat bill. It cleared the state Legislature on Wednesday.
It makes Ohio the fifth state to ban abortions after the first detectable fetal heartbeat. That can come as early as five or six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they're pregnant.
DeWine's support for the bill breaks with his predecessor. Former Republican Gov. John Kasich twice vetoed it on grounds it was unconstitutional and would spark a costly court challenge.
Even before the bill was signed, the ACLU of Ohio said it was preparing a constitutional challenge on behalf of four Ohio abortion clinics.
Senate confirms ex-lobbyist to lead Interior
WASHINGTON - The Senate on Thursday confirmed acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to lead the department on a permanent basis, despite complaints by Democrats that the former oil and gas lobbyist has used his federal position to benefit former industry clients.
Senators voted 56-41 to approve Bernhardt's nomination to oversee more than 500 million acres of public lands and other resources, including national parks, monuments and wildlife refuges. He succeeds Ryan Zinke, who resigned in January amid a series of ethics investigations.
Bernhardt was confirmed to the No. 2 position in July 2017.
Three Democrats - Sens. Martin Heinrich, N.M., Joe Manchin, W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona - voted for Bernhardt.
In space: An Israeli spacecraft crashed into the moon Thursday just moments before touchdown, failing in an ambitious attempt to make history as the first privately funded lunar mission.
The Beresheet robotic spacecraft lost communication with ground control as it was making its final descent. Moments later, the mission was declared a failure.
Opher Doron, general manager of the space division of Israel Aerospace Industries, general manager of the space division of Israel Aerospace Industries said the spacecraft was in pieces scattered at the planned landing site.
He nonetheless called the mission an "amazing success," for reaching the moon and coming so close to landing successfully.

Texto completo: Nevada moved quickly to replace one big-name coach with another.
Nevada hired former UCLA coach Steve Alford, 54, on Thursday, four days after Eric Musselman left for Arkansas.
Nevada athletic director Doug Knuth said Alford will be formally introduced at a Reno news conference Friday at 2 p.m.

Musselman built up the Wolf Pack in four seasons, leading them to the NCAA tournament three straight years before leaving for the SEC and the Razorbacks.
Alford was fired by UCLA on Dec. 31 with the Bruins at 7-6 on the season. He was 124-63 in five-plus seasons with the Bruins, reaching four NCAA tournaments.
Louisiana State senior associate athletic director Robert Munson said the school and suspended basketball coach Will Wade have set a meeting for Friday that will include NCAA compliance officials. The meeting will mark the first meaningful face-to-face communication between all parties since LSU suspended Wade for initially refusing to meet with school officials on March 8. Also, LSU freshman guard JaVonte Smart said he plans to enter his summer's NBA draft.
Stanford sophomore forward KZ Okpala declared for the NBA draft. The 6-foot-9 Okpala, who is projected to be a first-round draft pick, announced his decision through the school. Other players declaring for the draft were Texas big man Jaxson Hayes and Duke freshman Cam Reddish, who has already hired an agent.
A Michigan State University student who accused counseling center staff of discouraging her from reporting a 2015 rape by three men's basketball players said that she is no longer afraid and wants to encourage other "silent survivors" of sexual assault to tell their stories. Bailey Kowalski, 22, who will graduate in May with a biology degree, held a news conference on the fourth anniversary of the alleged incident. She spoke a day after going public with her name for the first time in a story in the New York Times.
Long Beach State baseball coach Troy Buckley was fired in the wake of the Dirtbags' 5-26 start to the season, athletic director Andy Fee announced. Associate head coach Greg Bergeron and pitching coach Dan Ricabal will share head coaching duties for the remainder of the season. Buckley is in his ninth season at Long Beach State. He has a 260-231-1 record and won the Big West Conference title in 2017.

U.S. women triumph, in hockey semifinals
Kendall Coyne Schofield scored a tournament-leading fifth goal to help the United States beat Japan 4-0 and advance to the semifinals of the women's world championship in Espoo, Finland.
Cayla Barnes had a goal and an assist and Hilary Knight and Dani Cameranesi also scored for the Americans, who have won the last four world titles and seven of the last eight.
The United States will play Russia in the semifinals on Saturday. The Russians beat Switzerland 3-0 behind a goal and two assists from Anna Shokhina.
In another quarterfinal, Canada defeated Germany 5-0.
Canada will face Finland after the hosts ousted the Czech Republic 3-1, with veteran defender Jenni Hiirikoski scoring one goal and setting up the other two.
In Houston, former top-10 player Janko Tipsarevic, 34, reached his first ATP Tour quarterfinal in 21/2 years by beating third-seeded Cameron Norrie 6-3, 6-4 at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship. Tipsarevic will face No. 8 seed Sam Querrey, who eliminated Guillermo Garcia- Lopez 6-4, 6-3.
A federal judge gave the U.S. Justice Department two weeks to clarify its stance on laws regulating internet gambling after hearing arguments from New Hampshire officials.
The case has potential implications for the future of state lotteries and the programs, often educational, that they fund.
Jacksonville Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette was arrested for driving with a suspended license and released a short time later. Fournette paid a $1,508 bond and was freed after spending less than 30 minutes in the Duval County Jail, according to jail records. His license was suspended last month after he failed to pay or protest a speeding ticket, court records show.
The New York Jets signed former Baltimore and Green Bay running back Ty Montgomery.

Donald Trump and the 'Eediat Bwoy' syndrome

Texto completo: Headnote IMMIGRATION KORNER
After a week that has left many shaking their heads in disbelief at the lunacy being spewed by the president of the purported greatest country in the world, the dialogue has again shifted to the mental competency of the so-called leader of the free world.
Words such as "dunce," "fool," "idiot," "ignorant," "moron," "lunatic" and other choice adjectives have littered social media platforms after Donald Trump's latest alternative fact diatribes of the past week, on everything from immigration and immigrants, the border, Mexico, wind farms, Puerto Rico, Israelites and "your prime minister," Benjamin Netanyahu.
But the one phrase that to me completely sums up the condition is not found in the English dictionary but in Jamaican patois. It is "eediat bwoy," and while it does mean "idiot" or "foolish" in the translation, somehow the two Jamaican terms strung together with an emphasis on the ee's seem like a more accurate analysis of the degenerative syndrome troubling El Trumpeto.
In case you missed it, here are 10 "eediat" things spewed by Trump just this past week on the immigration front:
1: Trump denounced a landmark immigration case by blaming it on an imaginary "Judge Flores." Or as he added: "...whoever you may be." The reality is there is no "Judge Flores." The case in question was named for Jenny Flores, a 15-year-old migrant teenager from El Salvador who entered the U.S. illegally in the 1980s who sued the U.S. and won in the case of Reno v. Flores.
2: Trump used his favorite tool, Twitter, to declare: 'Our Country Is Full,' while calling on Mexico to stop illegal immigration hours after Kirstjen Nielsen resigned as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. "Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States, or we will have no other choice than to Close the Border and/or institute Tariffs. Our Country is FULL!," he tweeted.
3: Yet the DHS and the Labor Department plan to grant an additional 30,000 H-2B visas this summer on top of the 33,000 H-2B visas they had planned to give out, the agencies confirmed. With the additional visas, the Trump administration is on track to grant 96,000 H-2B visas this fiscal year, the most since 2007, when George W. Bush was president.
4: Trump, during his border visit, downplayed the claims of people seeking asylum at the border, declaring again-without evidence-that many are gang members with MS-13. The reality is that many are families fleeing crime, gang threats and poverty in Central America.
5: Trump claims Mexico is doing "NOTHING" about migrants coming north. Yet data show the country markedly tightened migration controls during the Barack Obama administration and detained over 30,000 foreigners in the first three months of this year. But that hasn't stopped Trump from tweeting: "Mexico is doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country. They are all talk and no action. Likewise, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador have taken our money for years, and do Nothing. The Dems don't care, such BAD laws. May close the Southern Border!"
6: Trump, who has not pushed or passed any significant immigration reform bills since taking office, claimed in a new interview with his favorite channel, Fox News that he could change America's immigration laws in just "15 minutes."
7: In that same interview, Trump blamed other countries for not "giving us their finest." This has been a recurring theme of his diatribe against immigrants since launching his campaign by claiming Mexico is sending criminals and rapists.
8: Asked whether it was time to set up a summit with the leaders of Central American countries like Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to discuss immigration, Trump quickly brushed off that idea by stating: "No I don't need a summit. I think we've done very well without a summit."
9: After threatening to close the border with Mexico, which would impact the U.S.' own economy, Trump on April 7 said if Mexico does not continue to apprehend migrants, he is going to have to no choice but to "close up the border."
10: Trump, according to a report published Sunday by the The New York Times, berated Nielsen regularly, calling her at home early in the mornings to demand that she take action to stop migrants from entering the country, including doing things that were clearly illegal, like blocking all migrants from seeking asylum despite the federal laws, court settlements and international obligations of the U.S.
Sounds like a serious case of "eediat bwoy" syndrome or as my Jamaican brethren would say: "A eediat ting dat bwoy!"

Bret Easton Ellis turns to nonfiction to talk Trump, Kanye West, ‘American Psycho’ and our whiny culture in ‘White’

Texto completo: By the fall of 1990, Bret Easton Ellis had enjoyed the success of his debut novel “Less Than Zero,” seen it adapted by Hollywood, and published a second novel all before he’d turned 27.
And then “American Psycho” happened.
Or more accurately, at first it didn’t happen: Just weeks before publication, Simon & Schuster canceled the book amid outcry over the violence in the black satire about a yuppie Wall Street serial killer.
And then it was back on. Knopf plucked “American Psycho” off its rival publisher’s scrapheap and published it 1991 to widespread publicity that zigzagged between acclaim and scorn.
While Ellis found success with the book, and the movie adaptation that followed years later, in that moment of controversy something changed. These events would influence his perspective on the world, on the role of the independently minded individual and on the ability to be truly free. All this flows across the pages of “White,” his first-ever book of non-fiction, and first book at all in nine years.
“That for me was a wake-up call,” Ellis says recently from his home in West Hollywood just over the hills from the San Fernando Valley of his childhood and adolescence. “That a corporation was making decisions about what creatively a subsidiary could do creatively. What a publishing house was allowed to publish and was not allowed to publish.”
It was, Ellis says, his close-up look at a mob mentality, a hysteria over fiction that nearly no one, including all of the individuals and organizations arguing against “American Psycho,” had read.
“Like the cancellation was going to save something in America,” he says. “It was a moment. My friends were right. Jay McInerney (author of “Bright Lights, Big City,” which made a similar splash to that of “Less Than Zero”) said recently in the New York Times that he believes that’s where my freedom of expression and hating censorship and self-censorship really began.”
In “White,” which is crafted as a series of loosely themed essays, many of them adaptations of pieces originally written as monologues for “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast,” Ellis shows readers where that mindset – fiercely independent, sometimes controversial, and always outspoken – has led him today.
“It came together very quickly in terms of the mood I was in at this moment,” he says. “And the changes I was feeling as a member of a generation who really, you know, was mostly noted for not really be able to take offense at anything, and finding myself forced into a way of thinking that I never that I would before.
“I never thought I would have been labeled or considered, as my democratic socialist boyfriend calls me, very much in the center, rather than what I always thought was a progressive gay guy.”
So what offends the 55-year-old Gen X-er today? He points to groupthink and virtue-signaling, trigger warnings and safe spaces, the culture of victimhood, and perhaps most of all, what Ellis views as the tension between the righteousness of rationality and logic and the wrongheadedness of emotion-fueled sensitivity, though he admits that inside his own home that distinction depends on one’s particular point of view.
“He thinks I’m nuts,” Ellis says of his 32-year-old millennial boyfriend of more than a decade now. “I’m over-emotional, I’m a drama queen, I don’t see anything rationally or with logic whatsoever.
“That is where we are,” he says, and laughs.
The book runs in a relaxed chronology, from an adolescence in the Valley focused on horror movies, the beauty of Richard Gere in “American Gigolo,” and the furtive pursuit of porn in the pre-digital age, to the publication of “Less Than Zero,” the unsatisfying adaptation into a movie starring Robert Downey Jr. and Andrew McCarthy, the “American Psycho” controversy, and eventually, his dismay at the dismay of Democrats and the mainstream media at the rise of Trumpism in the United States.
Not because he agrees with Trump on much of anything, but because of his distaste for what he considers the dishonest arguments and overkill with which Trump foes attack him.
“I do think if this had been written, I don’t know, 10 years ago, I would have totally gone after the Tea Party and the birther movement or whatever,” Ellis says. “It’s always an extreme or something that is hysterical or so rooted in kind of fundamentalism that bothers me. I sensed that a lot in the last four years, and it’s just kind of gotten out of control.”
“White” will surely anger some readers, but if they’ve followed Ellis’ writing in fiction, journalism, or social media they shouldn’t be that surprised. His Twitter feed, in particular, was home to some of his darkest humor, eventually sparking so much outrage that he largely abandoned the platform but includes a chapter titled “Tweeting” in the book.”
“I loved Twitter,” he says. “A lot of it was funny, it was exciting. It was to titillate and outrage people, which is what creative people do. That is their instinct, to push boundaries. And then it started morphing.
“I guess it’s about power-grabbing, one group trying to shut down another group. Now it’s all negative, and it is not fun anymore.”
“White” closes with a section on Kanye West, a creative artist who like Ellis has had his share of public controversy. West approached Ellis to write a script for him, and they’ve worked on other projects in recent years, and Ellis says he quickly came to admire West for his iconoclasm and refusal to change to appease his critics.
“He has this notion of freedom that is extremely appealing to a lot of people,” he says. “Regardless of whether you agree with it all or not, he is really his own man. He’s contradictory, he makes mistakes, he falls down, he picks himself up.
“It’s not that I agree with Kanye 100 percent, I don’t,” Ellis says. “But I like the notion of Kanye, and I like that kind of person who is unencumbered by feeling he has to tell a narrative that he doesn’t believe in just to placate the press.”
Like West, Ellis has no interest in pacifying his public critics, though he says at home he and his boyfriend have reached a truce of sorts as the 2020 presidential campaigns begin, and his partner – “a committed Bernie bro” – rededicates himself to MSNBC’s coverage.
“There are two rules in our house,” Ellis says. “We don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election, and we don’t don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election.”
Of course, he is talking about it that moment and eventually, he gets caught.
“He just opened the door and is glaring at me,” Ellis says, interrupting a different line of conversation to give a little play-by-play from his home office. “See? This is how I’m living. He opened the door, glared at me, and hissed. And then he closed the door.
“There it is, in a nutshell,” he says, and then he laughs some more.

Ex-MSU student talks of alleged rape

Texto completo: Four years after she says she was raped by Michigan State University basketball players, a former MSU student plans to hold a news conference Thursday about her federal lawsuit against the school.
"I don't want any other girl who has gone through this, or who God forbid may have to go through something like this, to feel for one second that they should be too afraid to come out and do something," Bailey Kowalski said in a phone interview last week with the New York Times, which published it Wednesday.
Kowalski, who had not previously been named, filed a federal lawsuit in April 2018 against MSU over the case. She has not named the players involved.
MSU has fought the case in federal court and a motion to dismiss it is pending. MSU's lawyers have argued that Kowalski can't sue them because the rape didn't happen on campus.
"Plaintiff has every right to pursue appropriate criminal and civil remedies against the students who assaulted her," the filing says. "Plaintiff, however, cannot show that MSU is responsible for criminal actions that did not occur on its campus. Nor can she fault MSU's conduct after the assault where she never told any MSU employees who were in a position to take action, and she never requested any remedies from MSU that were not provided."
Kowalski told the Times that MSU has attacked her in an effort to stop others.
"They went out to the press and essentially addressed my lawsuit as a lie," Kowalski said, "which basically was a message to anyone else coming forward with allegations similar to mine that, 'If you're going to do that, we're going to completely exploit you.' "
The suit alleges three unnamed players — identified only as John Doe 1, 2 and 3 — took the 18-year-old student, Jane Doe, home from an East Lansing bar between the evening of April 11, 2015, and the morning of April 12.
Kowalski alleges she was at Harper's Bar when the Spartans' basketball team arrived after midnight. One of the players offered to buy her a drink and asked whether she would like to meet "other guys" from the team. The woman, who was a sports journalism major, alleges one of the players then invited her to a party at an apartment and one player "lied" and told the woman her roommate was on her way to the party.
The lawsuit says the woman was having a difficult time holding her glass, though she said she did not have a lot to drink. She then accepted a ride to the party from two players — the party was at one of their off-campus apartments — but there was no party and her roommate was not there.
'Feeling discombobulated' The lawsuit alleges the woman "was feeling discombobulated" and tried to send a text but could not control her thumbs and believed she may have been drugged. Then the first player allegedly pulled her into a bedroom and told her, "You are mine for the night."
After the woman asked for water and to see basketball memorabilia, the second player then took her to another room when the lights went out.
According to the lawsuit, the woman said she was forcefully thrown facedown onto the bed and held so she could not move while the second player raped her from behind. The woman was crying and could not speak, her lawsuit claims, and she did not consent to the activity.
The lawsuit alleges the first player and a third player took turns raping her after the second player. The woman claims she does not remember anything until waking up on a couch a few hours later, then called a taxi back to her dorm. There, her roommate told her she did not know about a party.
The woman reported the rape to a counselor at the MSU Counseling Center on April 20, 2015, and completed an initial intake and assessment. When she disclosed to the counselor that the three men who allegedly raped her were MSU basketball players, the female counselor's demeanor reportedly changed and she told the alleged victim she needed another person in the room with them. According to the lawsuit, it was not clear who the additional person was or why the person was brought into the room.
'An uphill battle' According to the lawsuit, the MSU Counseling Center staffers then "made it clear to Plaintiff that if she chose to notify the police, she faced an uphill battle that would create anxiety and unwanted media attention and publicity as had happened with many other female students who were sexually assaulted by well-known athletes."
The staff members, per the court filing, then advised the woman they had seen a lot of these cases with "guys with big names" and the best thing to do is to "just get yourself better."
Kowalski never reported the alleged sexual assault to police, said Karen Truszkowski, the woman's attorney. The lawsuit asserts that the counseling center failed to properly advise her and even implied it would not be in her "best interest to report the incident to law enforcement."
After the lawsuit was filed, MSU issued a statement denying the counseling center suggested she keep quiet. That statement included details about her visits. After the Free Press wrote about how the statement likely violated student privacy laws, MSU apologized for the statement and took it down from its website.
The Free Press later reported that then-interim President John Engler was directly involved in the crafting of the statement. Engler has since been forced out of office.

Texto completo: Jesus said the poor will always be among us, but there are a lot of people in Canada testing that proposition.
According to recently released data, between 2015 and 2017, Canada reduced its official poverty rate by at least 20 percent. Roughly 825,000 Canadians were lifted out of poverty, producing the country's lowest poverty rate in history. How?
The economy has been decent but not robust enough to explain these striking outcomes. Instead, one major factor is that Canadians have organized communities differently.
Before I describe their methodology, let's consider American poor areas. Everything is fragmented. There is usually a bevy of public and private programs doing their own thing. In a town, there may be four food pantries, each of which does its own thing.
A common model is one donor funding one program. Different programs compete for funds. They justify their existence using randomized, controlled experiments, in which researchers try to pinpoint one input that led to one positive output. In other words, the Americans who talk about community don't have a community of their own. Every day, they give away the power they could have if they did mutually reinforcing work together to change whole systems.
In Canada, it's not like that. About 15 years ago, a disparate group of Canadians realized that a problem as complex as poverty can be addressed only through a multisector comprehensive approach. They realized that poverty was not going to be reduced by some cool, new program nobody thought of before. It was going to be addressed through better, mutually supporting systems able to enact change on a population level.
So they began building citywide and communitywide structures. They started 15 years ago with six cities but now have 72 regional networks covering 344 towns.
They begin by gathering, say, 100 people from a single community. A quarter have lived with poverty; the rest are from business, nonprofits and government.They spend a year learning about poverty in their area, talking with the community. They don't want better poor; they want fewer poor. Their focus is not on how to give poor people food so they don't starve. It is, how do we move people out of poverty? Second, they up their ambitions. How do we eradicate poverty? Third, they broaden their vision. What does a vibrant community look like in which everybody's basic needs are met?
After a year, they come up with a town plan. Each town's poverty is different. Each town's assets are different. So each town's plan is different.
The town plans feature a lot of collaborative activity. A food pantry might turn itself into a job training center by allowing the people being fed to do the work. The pantry might connect with local businesses that change their hiring practices so that high school degrees are not required. Businesses might pledge to raise their minimum wage. The plans involve a lot of policy changes on the town and provincial levels - improved day care, redesigned transit systems, better work-force development systems.
By the time Canada's national government swung into action, the whole country had a base of knowledge and experience. The people in the field had a wealth of connections and a sense of what needed to be done. The two biggest changes were efforts in city after city to raise the minimum wage and the expansion of a national child benefit, which can net a family up to nearly $6,500 a year per child. Canada essentially has guaranteed income for young and old.
The process of learning and planning and adapting never ends. The Tamarack Institute serves as a learning community hub for all the different regional networks. Paul Born, the head of the institute, emphasizes that the crucial thing these communitywide structures do is change attitudes. In the beginning, people are sluggish, fearful, isolated, looking out only for themselves. But when people start working together across sectors around a common agenda, communities realize they can do more for the poor. The poor realize they can do more for themselves. New power has been created, a new sense of agency.
Mr. Born says social change requires communitywide structures. But in many American communities, we're scattershot. That's the problem with our distrust and polarization. We often don't build structures across difference. Transformational change rarely gets done.

Texto completo: En el juicio de Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera hubo varias revelaciones sobre la operación del Cártel de Sinaloa, homicidios, traiciones y un largo etcétera, pero hubo temas que no fueron tratados en la Corte de Brooklyn, debido a limitantes que fiscales federales lograron, ya que podrían afectar a sus cooperantes.
También los abogados del líder del Cártel de Sinaloa tuvieron que acceder a que alguna información fuera retenida, como la supuesta compra de menores por parte del mexicano para drogarlas y tener sexo con ellas .
Esa historia se hizo pública a pocos días de que el juicio terminara, lo que incluso desató una polémica con los miembros del jurado, quienes afirmaron no haber leído al respecto en internet, debido a que una de las reglas que se les impuso era no buscar historias sobre Guzmán Loera en redes sociales o cualquier página en la web.
Tras una batalla legal de abogados de VICE News y del New York Times, algunos documentos serán liberados, como uno hecho público hace unos días, donde se indica que Alex Cifuentes , ubicado como W1 (Testigo 1) era un testigo complicado, debido a sus creencias y práticas esotéricas.
Cifuentes, quien vivió con Guzmán Loera en las montañas de Sinaloa, creía en la brujería, además de tener “creencias poco ortodoxas “, innecesarias para el caso, consideraron los fiscales.
El colombiano, quien acusó que su exsocio pagó $100 millones de dólares al expresidente Enrique Peña Nieto , podría haber sido descalificado también por creer en los extraterrestres y de que habría un apocalipsis en el 2012 .
También creía en los Illuminati, la masonería y otras teorías de conspiración que afectarían su testimonio ante el jurado y la opinión pública, ya que fue quien reveló el estilo de vida de Guzmán Loera, cómo escapó de las montañas, explicó su círculo de seguridad, los negocios de drogas con socios de Colombia y Ecuados y la apertura de nuevos mercados, como el de Canadá.

Texto completo: Democratic lawmakers in New York are trying to amend state law to obtain President Trump’s tax returns.

State lawmakers are expected to introduce a bill this week that would allow the commissioner of the New York Department of Taxation and Finance to release any state tax return requested by leaders of three congressional committees for any “specific and legitimate legislative purpose,” according to the New York Times.

The bill would allow the release of tax filings for personal income taxes, corporation taxes and real estate transfer taxes.

New York is the president’s home state and the Trump Organization is headquartered there. Democrats control the legislature and governorship.

In Washington, Democrats are trying to obtain Trump’s federal taxes, which he has refused to release over claims that he is being audited. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., has requested six years’ worth of Trump’s personal and business tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department.

Chairs of the congressional tax policy committees are legally permitted to request tax information without having permission from businesses and individuals.

Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney vowed Sunday Democrats will “never” see Trump’s tax returns.

Letter: Sen. Lee should make climate change a bridge issue

Texto completo: From Stephen Colbert to Twitter postings to letters and commentaries in The Salt Lake Tribune, Sen. Mike Lee created quite a buzz when he claimed that “babies” are the solution to climate change.
Was he serious? As he has put forth no other solutions, I’m inclined to take him at his word.
Fortuitously, five days before Lee’s speech, Paul Hawken delivered the keynote address for the Sustainability Summit at Weber State University.
Hawken is renowned for editing The New York Times best-selling book, “Drawdown: The most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming.” In this assembly of the best solutions from 270 world experts, “fall in love, get married and have some kids” is nowhere to be found. In fact, their seventh-most impactful solution is family planning.
Rather than mock the Green New Deal, why doesn’t our senior senator make climate change a bridge issue in Congress? He has successfully worked across the aisle on issues such as prison reform and immigration. I want to hear an Earth Day Senate speech in which Lee outlines a conservative, science-based policy that addresses climate change. In doing so, he will build healthier, more vibrant and stronger communities.

Trump's open secret on Secret Service, security clearances

Texto completo: Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigators didn't establish that Donald Trump criminally conspired with Russia in the 2016 presidential election. But it wasn't for lack of trying by Moscow.
Russian affiliates made "multiple offers" to help Trump, according to Attorney General William Barr's synopsis of Mueller's report. A presidential campaign with even a shred of security-minded rectitude would have quickly notified the FBI about Russians dangling dirt on an opponent, rather than eagerly taking a meeting, but Team Trump evidently didn't give it a thought.
Now this carelessness has followed the president into the Oval Office where, as it turns out, top-secret clearances are handed out like Halloween candy, and a Chinese woman with a thumb drive of malicious software (along with four cellphones and a laptop) talked her way past the Secret Service recently to enter Trump's "Winter White House" estate in Palm Beach, Florida.
It all adds up to a fast-and-loose attitude toward security:
►News reports last year described scores of White House officials lacking long-term security clearances while background checks dragged on endlessly. Last month, Tricia Newbold — an 18-year career White House employee who handles those reviews — came forward as a whistleblower to reveal how 25 officials who failed background checks were subsequently granted access to the nation's secrets.
The initial denials were based on such concerns as "foreign influence, conflicts of interest, concerning personal conduct, financial problems, drug use and criminal conduct," but higher-ups in the White House ordered denials reversed "without proper analysis, documentation, or a full understanding and acceptance of the risks," according to a summary of Newbold's interview by congressional staffers.
The Washington Post, citing people familiar with documents and testimony provided to the House Oversight and Reform Committee, identified one of the 25 as Trump's son-in-law, senior adviser Jared Kushner, who adjudicators worried might be compromised by foreign influence, outside business activities or personal conduct uncovered in a background check. Even the CIA expressed serious concerns. But Trump intervened to order that Kushner receive top-secret clearance, overruling then-Chief of Staff John Kelly, according to The New York Times.
OPPOSING VIEW: President Trump gets final say on security clearances
►Trump's frequent visits to Mar-a-Lago, his private Florida resort, challenge a Secret Service that says it must defer to club employees in crosschecking visitors. This might explain why Chinese national Yujing Zhang managed to enter the resort March 30 with all her electronic gear. After a receptionist grew suspicious, Zhang was arrested.
Prosecutors said Monday that a search of her hotel room later turned up a slew of additional suspicious items, including a signal detector that can ferret out hidden cameras, another cellphone and nine USB drives. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the incident evidence of threatening behavior by China. According to the Miami Herald, Zhang's case has been added to an ongoing FBI investigation involving former Florida massage parlor owner Cindy Yang, who has allegedly been selling Chinese businesses access to Mar-a-Lago and the Trump family.
Trump dismissed Zhang's arrest as a fluke ("No, I'm not concerned at all"), but word came Monday that Secret Service Director Randolph Alles is on his way out. Senior Democratic leaders in Congress have rightly asked FBI Director Christopher Wray to assess whether the Mar-a-Lago operation is a national security risk, and one of the new Secret Service director's priorities should be to improve procedures at all of Trump's private clubs. Separately, the House Oversight Committee is investigating how the Trump White House issues security clearances.
When it comes to guarding against foreign influence, it's hard to know whether Trump is naive or foolish, or whether he views the responsibility as a nettlesome inconvenience. Sure, he can vacation where he wants and, by law, hand out clearances to whomever he pleases. But he also has a duty to protect the nation's secrets.

Insider couldn't fix bank's culture

Texto completo: It's actually possible to feel a little sorry for Tim Sloan, the departed chief executive of Wells Fargo & Co.
Like the time Sloan's own lawyers argued in federal court that what he said publicly was nothing more than classic "corporate puffery" that no sensible investor would take seriously.
Sloan probably didn't find this argument all that funny when he first heard about it, which appeared to be while the Wells Fargo CEO was getting pounded at a congressional hearing.
The legal argument appeared in a kind of lawsuit that's barely worth mentioning, yet it seems to perfectly illustrate why putting Sloan into the CEO job in the first place was a mistake.
It wasn't long after that congressional hearing that he abruptly gave up the CEO job. Last week he seemed to acknowledge that it would've been a lot better when he got promoted in 2016 to find a leader from the outside.
The corporate puffery argument was one response to investors who were mad at Sloan, in part, for what he said after he got the job. He'd been with the company almost 30 years and was the clear successor, yet it was still something of a battlefield promotion to CEO.
After Wells Fargo's fake account scandal erupted, Sloan had provided assurances of transparency and trustworthiness. Yet the bad news kept coming months into his tenure, including that about 800,000 Wells Fargo car loan borrowers had gotten saddled with insurance they didn't need and might not have been able to afford.
How's that for being open and transparent?
Sloan was right to say rebuilding trust was a top priority. It's what anybody new to the top job would say. Yet he was the wrong messenger.
He'd been there while millions of dummy accounts were opened up, fees were charged improperly for mortgage loans and thousands lost their cars to the repo man because of insurance they didn't need.
And maybe the biggest problem with turning to an insider for leadership after these problems first surfaced was that it reinforced the idea that Wells thought it had a compliance problem, that there hadn't been enough rule-following.
Instead Wells had a problem with its work culture, the broadly shared understanding of what's important, how decisions get made and how people get treated. The rules and expectations not only didn't fix the culture problem, they helped create it, going back more than 30 years to Minneapolis and the predecessor of the modern Wells Fargo, called Norwest.
The Wells Fargo approach to banking took root here because Norwest had gone outside for new leadership. Lloyd Johnson was brought in as CEO to lead a turnaround, and he hired former Citigroup executive Richard Kovacevich to be his right-hand man.
Kovacevich had a clear idea for what bank managers ought to be doing. Instead of worrying excessively about costs they should be trying to grow revenue. And by far the least costly way to do that was to get more of the banking business of the customers they already had.
The shorthand for this approach is cross-selling, and a measure that really came to matter was the number of financial products per customer -- mortgages, savings and checking accounts, credit cards and so on.
Kovacevich followed Johnson as CEO, as Norwest used acquisitions to grow. While other bankers might have sought deals to grow assets or deposits, Norwest looked at acquisitions as the best way to get more customers it could sell more stuff to.
In the late 1990s, Norwest had an opportunity to take over Wells Fargo in California, which had a more traditional model. As the two companies merged and took the Wells Fargo name, the all-important average products-per-customer number initially slipped, given how far behind the old Wells Fargo had been in cross-selling compared with Norwest.
Kovacevich, by the way, had implemented a fundamentally good idea, widely followed in the industry. Doing more business with existing customers can work well. But what happened with the tracking of accounts per customer looks a little like a problem sometimes called Goodhart's law, named for a British economist.
As it's usually explained, this is what happens when some measure becomes the target, making the measure no longer very useful.
The point of tracking financial products per customer is what it shows about what the company really wants, increased revenue and customer loyalty. Yet as the scandal unfolded, we learned some of the accounts that unwittingly got opened in the customer's names didn't even charge fees.
But if senior management really wants more accounts -- and lets the frontline staff get micromanaged to get them -- then that's what the bosses will get.
This year employees have still been complaining to the New York Times about a high-pressure work environment of quotas and goals.
Some of this seems entirely reasonable for a normal workplace, like expecting a specific number of loan files to get processed in a month. The only thing that makes this stuff news is that it's coming from inside Wells Fargo, where sales management once went so far off the rails that all over the company employees tried to game the system.
As Wells Fargo seeks a new leader from the outside, what's important is how the candidates will explain how the language to describe the work will have to continue to change. How people are hired, trained and promoted will have to change some more, too.
Wells doesn't seem to have the option of a new fundamental strategy. Unlike its peers at the very top of the American bank rankings, Wells is much more like a giant community bank. It really needs its millions of customers to keep doing business there.
And when the new CEO reports for work, he or she will meet midcareer managers who will not have known any other business model or approach to growing the company than what they learned at Wells Fargo.
Even before that new CEO's first day, it might be good for all these old Wells Fargo hands in leadership to get together in one place, look at each other and remind themselves that one thing that maybe still needs to change some more is them.

Texto completo: No fue una sorpresa en Washington la salida de la encargada de implementar las duras políticas migratorias de Donald Trump.
Kirstjen Nielsen, quien estuvo al mando de la política de cero tolerancia en la frontera renunció hoy a la dirección del DHS.
La titular de la cartera de Seguridad Nacional abandonó este domingo el gabinete de Trump después de que éste le hubiera reclamado en público y en privado una mayor dureza en materia migrator ia, aunque sus labores hayan sido criticadas por defensores de derechos humanos en el país.
Nielsen fue la encargada de poner en marcha una agresiva política migratoria abanderada por Trump que ha incluido la separación de familias de inmigrantes con menores cuando cruzaban la frontera con México irregularmente durante meses, un veto migratorio contra países de mayoría musulmana y regulaciones para limitar el asilo en el límite con México.
Sin duda, una de las mayores sombras que quedará en el legado de Nielsen serán los llantos y lamentos desesperados que fueron grabados a los niños inmigrantes separados de sus padres cuando estos estaban detenidos en celdas.
Sin embargo, el desempeño de estas tareas no ha saciado las demandas de Trump de una mayor rigidez en temas migratorios, lo que ha generado múltiples desencuentros internos entre ambos que han sido recogidos por medios locales.
La secretaria saliente fue nominada para dirigir el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) en octubre de 2017 para convertirse en la tercera persona en hacerlo bajo la batuta de Trump, tras el paso del general John Kelly y de la secretaria interina Elaine Duke.
Precisamente, hasta ese momento, Nielsen había sido la jefa de gabinete de Kelly hasta que éste se convirtió en el jefe de Gabinete del presidente.
El general había sido hasta su salida a mediados de diciembre el principal defensor de Nielsen en la Casa Blanca.
Nielsen, una experta en ciberseguridad y gestión de desastres que formó parte del consejo de seguridad nacional durante el Gobierno de George W. Bush (2001-2009), comenzó a trabajar con Kelly a finales de 2016, cuando se encargó de preparar al general, nominado entonces como jefe de DHS, para sus audiencias de confirmación en el Senado.
Kelly quedó entonces impresionado por la dedicación de Nielsen, que tras contagiarse de una severa gripe tosió tanto que se rompió una costilla, y en lugar de tomarse una baja, se vendó el torso y siguió trabajando al mismo ritmo, según la revista Politico.
Dentro del Gobierno de Bush, al que entró en 2004, Nielsen trabajó en la Administración de Transporte y Seguridad (TSA), que depende de DHS.
Graduada en derecho por la Universidad de Virginia y en servicio exterior por la Universidad de Georgetown, Nielsen creó la década pasada su propia consultoría de gestión de riesgos y trabajó en un centro de estudios sobre seguridad nacional y cibernética; estuvo ligada a esta entre 2012 y 2016.
Fue su cercana relación con Kelly la que elevó a Nielsen a la Casa Blanca, donde se convirtió en jefa adjunta de gabinete y aplicó una marcada rigidez.
La escasa tolerancia de Nielsen por las luchas internas de asesores presidenciales se reflejó en su costumbre de cancelar las reuniones con altos funcionarios de la Casa Blanca si alguien llegaba tarde a reuniones y en su minucioso control de la agenda de Kelly.
La disciplina militar implicó que se ganara entre algunos el mote de “enfermera Ratched”, el autoritario personaje de la novela y película “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”, mientras que, según el diario The New York Times, otros se refieren a ella como Joseph Ratzinger, el cardenal que pasaría a ser el papa Benedicto XVI.

Texto completo: Is Uber saving lives?
There was a heinous killing of a 21-year-old college student in Columbia, S.C., last weekend, after she'd evidently gotten into a car that she mistook for the Uber she had called. Such calculated evil has shaken some who use ride-hailing, and the likely fallout is more precaution: ride-hailers double-checking the driver's name and car model against those on their apps before opening the car door.
That's only wise. But it's human nature to change behavior because of relatively unlikely encounters, if the report is dramatic enough. Surveys suggest Americans feel pretty safe when they're behind the wheel, but less safe in planes where they don't have control, and all the data showing that planes crash much less often than cars won't change those minds.
"The great mythological symbol of America - the lone-wolf individual, out there challenging the world and all comers - makes Americans devalue some kinds of risks and elevate others," Kirk Johnson of The New York Times wrote in a July 2000 report on the things Americans choose to fear.
It's no stretch to say that Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing services are built on millions of individual decisions and thousands of lone wolves deciding they want to make some money with their cars. And data have begun to dribble in showing that maybe, just maybe, that's why we're seeing fewer drunken-driving deaths in Pittsburgh.
Statisticians always warn against making too much of small sample sizes, but recent trends are encouraging. ValuePenguin, a personal finance research website owned by LendingTree, was looking into auto insurance data in Pennsylvania when it came across numbers that seemed worth a stand-alone report: Drunken-driving fatalities dropped by 17% from the three-year period ending in 2014 to the period ending in 2017 - and they dropped 83% in Allegheny County.
Lyft and Uber arrived in Pittsburgh in 2014.
No change of this magnitude ever comes down to a single factor. It's the nature of such statistics that one terrible crash can skew the numbers. It could be this good news is a blip on the screen. It also should be noted that urban areas always have had lower rates of traffic deaths than the countryside. (Speed limits are lower and mandatory stops are more frequent.) But the increasing likelihood of drinkers, particularly urban/suburban drinkers, leaving the driving to someone else after a night on the town can't be ignored here.
According to ValuePenguin, the number of drunken-driving fatalities per capita in metropolitan Pittsburgh's most rural county (Armstrong) is five times as high as its most urban county (Allegheny). And since Uber and Lyft arrived in Pittsburgh, the gap has widened.
Drunken-driving deaths are down 83% in Allegheny, 92% in Beaver, 32% in Washington, 25% in Westmoreland and 22% in Fayette. Meantime, Butler County stayed even while such fatalities rose 14% in Armstrong.
Again, the smaller a county's population, the more likely one or two bad accidents skew the numbers. ValuePenguin looked at 60 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, tossing out the smallest ones, and within that group Beaver and Allegheny counties had the second- and third-lowest rates of drunken-driving fatalities, respectively.
An Uber spokesman said it operates across the state. He would not offer any comparisons of ride-hailing among the seven counties in metro Pittsburgh, but said there are hundreds of thousands of Uber rides a week in Allegheny County, and the number of rides rose 50% between 2016 and the end of 2018.
In short, there is evidence that ride-hailing is saving lives, but it's all circumstantial. It could also be people are drinking less or finding bars within walking distance.
Whatever the reasons for the downturn in drunken-driving deaths, this data set came too early to gauge the impact of a stricter ignition interlock law that went into effect in Pennsylvania in August 2017. Under that law, people with a first-time DUI conviction and a blood-alcohol content of at least 0.10 are required to blow into a tube that measures the presence of alcohol before turning the ignition key. If the device detects too much booze, the engine won't start.
That should prevent accidents, too. In a few years, if the number of drunken-driving deaths keeps falling, we won't know if it's attributable to ride-hailing or ignition denial, but we're not likely to care.

Texto completo: Every theater has qualities inscribed in its DNA, and they're always about more than just the art. At the Public Theater, the fervor for Shakespeare is matched by a relish for politics. And the devotion to new work is matched by a commitment to inclusiveness. So a festival focused on democracy? Seems like an ideal fit.
Presented with the Onassis Foundation USA, the Onassis Festival arrives at the Public this week, anchored by Tim Blake Nelson's new play, "Socrates" (through May 19), starring Michael Stuhlbarg. The busy slate of performances and panels also includes the Greek shows "Relic" (Wednesday through Saturday), a solo piece by Euripides Laskaridis, and "Antigone -- Lonely Planet" (April 18-20), Lena Kitsopoulou's comic twist on Sophocles.
Continuing the celebration nearby at La MaMa is 600 Highwaymen's "The Fever" (through April 21), seen at the Under the Radar festival in 2017. While it's a participatory show about human connection, Charles Isherwood wrote approvingly in The New York Times, "I never had the feeling that we were about to be asked to sing a chorus of 'Kumbaya."'

Corporal punishment against children is never acceptable

Texto completo: The New York Times posted an article Feb. 25 that stated, "When report cards were sent out on Fridays, child maltreatment seemed to increase on the Saturdays immediately following." Whoever found evidence that letter grades are more important than the welfare, safety, stability and development (i.e., emotional, mental, relational) of our children?
When I was a child in the '70s, my female cousin (7 years old) and her dad came to live with us. They had only been with us for a couple of weeks when report cards were sent home. I recall walking through the door and her dad was standing there with his hand out asking for the report card. As my cousin slowly drew the report card from her backpack and handed it to her dad, I noticed her head drop and her posture went limp. In a deep angry voice, he began ridiculing her about the D she had received. As he removed his belt from his jeans, there were pleas of forgiveness and "sorry, sorry, sorry...!" With no hesitation, he proceeded to grab her tiny wrist and whip her - over and over and over. It was horror as her body contorted and struggled to break free. Tears streamed down her face (and mine) as I watched her scream and beg for him stop, but there was no mercy; she had gotten a D.
The results of this encounter resulted in skin lacerations and bruising from the top of her shoulder blades to her ankles. Some of you may read this article and say, "When I was a kid..." and then go on to share how you had it so much worse. It's 2019, people! We live in an era of internet, hotlines, community resources, television, and smartphones. All the information you need about healthy parenting is at your fingertips. Are grades important? Sure, if you're applying for an Ivy League or state college. However, most anybody can get into a community or technical skills college if they want to, and those who don't are probably too afraid to try. Either way, there's no reason to hurt children over their academic performance. It doesn't teach them to be better people. It only teaches them that the people who say they love and care about them are not safe to be around.
It's time to implement a Parenting with Compassion class that will cover critical topics such as nurture, diet, discipline, education, support and health risks that address all development stages, birth through age 18. The Parenting with Compassion class would be offered daily, so parents can take it pre- or post-delivery. There would be an incentive for participating in the program (e.g., gift card, diapers, etc.). No, it's not the "manual" that all parents wish they had, but I think it's the next best thing. Children are our future leaders, parents, and criminals. It's time to reconsider our investments and educate our parents.

Texto completo: United veteran midfielder Ethan Finlay came through his first start last Saturday just fine, playing 75 minutes on his way back from knee surgery early last season.
"I've recovered really well," Finlay said. "Physically, the body is good. Now it's just getting through the mental challenge of what the experience gives you and dictates, and that will take a couple more games. But I'll get there."
Kevin Molino (knee) is close to returning, too. United upgraded him Friday from out to questionable for the first time for Saturday's game against the New York Red Bulls. Star Darwin Quintero (groin) and Rasmus Schuller (thigh) are questionable, too.
Blazing their way
Among the festivities celebrating next Saturday's Allianz Field opening is a Friday night show at St. Paul's Ordway Theater that features Men in Blazers. They're an English duo that offers its comedic take on soccer in America and football everywhere else in the world.
Roger Bennett and Michael Davis have their own website, podcast, NBCSN show and New York Times bestseller. Bennett is an Everton supporter who had a poster of star Adrian Heath -- now United's coach -- over his bed when both were young.
"Everybody has a different take on football, but they are funny," Heath said. "They've made a real name for themselves."
Hook 'em, Raiders
Defender Brent Kallman is the favorite to win the Loons' NCAA men's basketball tournament pool and Heath probably will pull for Texas Tech in this weekend's Final Four because he once coached in Austin, the home of the University of Texas.
"The March Madness thing, it reminds me so much of the F.A. Cup in England," Heath said, "where teams that shouldn't play against each other do and there always are big upsets."
After all, you're my …
United officials reached out to British musicians Liam and Noel Gallagher about having some part in Allianz Field's opening. Loons supporters adopted their band Oasis' 1995 hit "Wonderwall" as their own. The two once washed Everton players' cars in Liverpool when Heath played there.
"They don't do that anymore," Heath said. "… The dialogue is ongoing with them. I think Liam is doing a new album and that takes precedent."

Texto completo: The House Judiciary Committee should not have had to vote Wednesday to subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller's report. It should already have been sent to Congress. The fact that the body's Democrats had to take this forcing action underscores why Attorney General William Barr's handling of the document so far is irresponsible - and, yes, suspicious.
Let's look at the timeline. Mueller submitted his report March 22. Two days later, on March 24, Barr issued his four-page letter that included not one complete sentence from the report. Barr quoted the report as saying: "[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." Note that the quote leaves out the beginning of the original sentence.
And note also that Barr's own words said Mueller "did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia." The phase "did not establish" is not the same as "did not find," but we have no way of knowing, absent the report itself, how significant that difference is. What we do know is that Barr seems to have put the best possible spin for Trump on what Mueller himself wrote.
Indeed, The New York Times reported Wednesday evening that there is dissatisfaction on the Mueller team with Barr's account.
"Some of Robert S. Mueller III's investigators," the paper reported, "have told associates that Attorney General William P. Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr. Barr indicated."
Yet another reason why Congress and the public need to see the real thing.
And The Washington Post reported that "some members" of Mueller's team "were particularly disappointed that Barr did not release summary information the special counsel team had prepared." Barr needs to release those summaries, too, and be asked why he didn't make them public in or with his March 24 letter.
On obstruction, Barr quoted the Mueller document saying that "while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him." Then, Barr made an astonishing assertion: "The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime." Barr, who had already criticized what he took to be Mueller's theory on obstruction before he became attorney general, went on (surprise, surprise) to absolve the president, writing "that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense."
But wait a minute: Did Mueller's decision not to make a call mean that it was Barr's decision to make? There is nothing that automatically gives Barr that power. Perhaps Mueller intended to leave the decision on obstruction to Congress, not to Barr. Maybe Mueller was silent on this issue in his report. Maybe he wasn't. We can't know, because we haven't seen the report.
And then came a strange letter from Barr on March 29 in which he complained that many were "mischaracterizing" his March 24 letter.
"My March 24 letter was not, and did not purport to be, an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsel's investigation or report. ... I do not believe it would be in the public's interest for me to attempt to summarize the full report or to release it in serial or piecemeal fashion."
So a summary was not a summary, and his first letter was, well, incomplete, or at least not "exhaustive" or ... well, what was it? A news release? President Trump certainly had no problem crying from the heavens that Barr's letter was a good-enough summary for him and that it cleared him of everything.
Which means that looking at everything Barr is doing with a suspicious eye is, at this point, the only safe thing to do. Especially when Trump, who had previously said he had no problem releasing the report, complained on Tuesday that it was a "disgrace" that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., was now demanding the very sort of disclosure the president had once endorsed. Trump, it would seem, was for releasing the full report before he was against it.
When the committee voted for the subpoena on Wednesday, Nadler said: "The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct. That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves - not the attorney general's summary, not a substantially redacted synopsis, but the full report and the underlying evidence." In light of everything that has happened since Mueller turned in his report on March 22, how could Congress settle for anything less?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Friday twice jokingly referred to complaints from several women that he had made them uncomfortable with his physical contact, and then offered a convoluted apology about their concerns and his behavior.
"I'm sorry I didn't understand more," he told reporters about his hugs and kisses to women over the years. "I'm not sorry for any of my intentions. I'm not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I've never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman."
Speaking at an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers conference in Washington, the former vice president used his first public remarks since the complaints emerged to try to push past the weeklong controversy that has overshadowed his expected presidential campaign. In his address, he largely stuck to his long-running political themes, highlighting the importance of uniting a divided nation and restoring the "great American middle class" -- save for two notable asides.
As he took the stage, he hugged Lonnie R. Stephenson, the union's president. "I just want you to know I had permission to hug Lonnie," he said, and the largely male crowd burst into laughter.
The joke came as Mr. Biden was fending off criticism from some Democrats, who worry that the 76-year-old is out of step with the party's current sensibilities around gender and race. In recent days, he has struggled to address complaints from women that his hugs, kisses and other expressions of his physically intimate style of politicking were unwelcome.
[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]
Even as Mr. Biden sought to move past the accusations, they were plainly on his mind.
Several minutes into his remarks, Mr. Biden spotted children in the audience. After welcoming them to the stage, Mr. Biden wrapped his arm around a young boy. "By the way, he gave me permission to touch him," he said, to laughter.
"Everyone knows I like kids more than people," he added.
In his comments to reporters, made just a few feet from where President Ronald Reagan was nearly assassinated in 1981, Mr. Biden all but announced his third presidential bid, saying he had been "told by the lawyers" that he had to watch his words to avoid triggering certain campaign finance rules that start with an announcement. He indicated that he viewed a late entry into the crowded field as a strategic advantage.
"Give everybody else their day. Then I get a shot, and then we're off to the races," he said.
But Mr. Biden also said he "wouldn't be surprised" if more women came forward. He acknowledged that his physically intimate style of campaigning would have to change -- a shift he compared to his efforts to adjust to the practice of snapping selfies with voters.
"It's going to have to change somewhat how I campaign," he said. "It's a new thing. It's important, and I'm sure it's going to take a while for it to settle out. But it's settled out for me."
But the public joking by Mr. Biden struck a nerve among some of the women who had expressed discomfort with their interactions.
"Biden's consent joke is a clear indication Biden doesn't get it and doesn't take the voice of the women who have come forward seriously," said Amy Lappos, who told The Hartford Courant that Mr. Biden had crossed "a line of respect" in their 2009 encounter at a fund-raiser in Connecticut.
And Lucy Flores, a former Nevada assemblywoman who published an essay last week that described Mr. Biden touching and kissing her inappropriately at a 2014 campaign event, wrote on Twitter: "It's clear @JoeBiden hasn't reflected at all on how his inappropriate and unsolicited touching made women feel uncomfortable. To make light of something as serious as consent degrades the conversation women everywhere are courageously trying to have."
Tarana Burke, the founder of the #MeToo movement, tweeted that Mr. Biden's making light of the controversy was "disrespectful and inexcusable."
Others praised Mr. Biden's remarks as an indication that he was listening to criticism of his behavior and trying to change.
Celinda Lake, a pollster who specializes in female voters, said Mr. Biden's comments would resonate within a Democratic primary electorate in which a majority of voters are expected to be over 50 -- and may identify with Mr. Biden's struggles to understand shifting norms around interactions between men and women.
"I thought he showed that he accepts responsibility, recognizes the issues and is changing," said Ms. Lake, who worked on Mr. Biden's 2008 presidential bid. "No one is perfect. His intent was clear. And he is changing."
And Mr. Biden's comments added more grist for a controversy spinning in several directions at once. Judith Shulevitz, who writes on feminism and other topics, including as a contributing op-ed writer for The New York Times, said the furious backlash about Mr. Biden's long-public behavior reflected opposition to his candidacy more than his suddenly controversial personal style.
"Don't pretend to be having an elevated discussion of public policy when you're conducting character assassination," she wrote in Politico. "You have come to bury Uncle Joe, not review his record. Own up to it."
The union conference offered a friendly and comfortable setting for Mr. Biden, but it represented only one element of an increasingly diverse Democratic Party base. Mr. Biden proclaimed he felt at home with the crowd, liberally sprinkling his comments with the mild profanity that he often deploys at political rallies.
"We've gotten so damn sophisticated. We've gotten so damn elitist," he said, referring to what he said was a tilt away from valuing blue-collar labor. "I hate the way things have changed over the last 15 to 20 years."
He used the bulk of his speech to critique economic inequality and partisanship, offering an argument for American renewal that could form the basis of his campaign. He also leveled a full-throated indictment of Mr. Trump, perhaps previewing an opening salvo.
"What in the hell is happening? Our children are listening," he said. "This country can't afford more years of a president looking to settle personal scores."
Some Democrats view the former vice president, with his decades of legislative experience and a folksy, blue-collar political brand, as the most formidable potential challenger to Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden, who also enjoys broad name recognition, leads in most early polling of the race for the Democratic nomination.

But others fear that Mr. Biden, who would enter the White House as the oldest president in American history, and his team are unprepared to deal effectively with the political pitfalls posed by his decades-long legislative record and old-fashioned style. Mr. Biden was slow to respond personally to the furor surrounding the women's complaints, relying at first on statements issued by aides and supporters.
As criticism mounted and more women came forward, Mr. Biden released an online video on Wednesday, in which he tried to explain his approach to "connecting" with people over the years. He has described himself as a "tactile politician" who tries to comfort people with hugs, kisses and touches on the shoulder when they appear nervous or upset.
In the seemingly homemade two-minute video, Mr. Biden promised to "be more mindful and respectful of people's personal space" in the future. Reaction to his comments was divided, with critics questioning the lack of a clear apology for his behavior and supporters praising his willingness to address the issue.
Mr. Trump taunted Mr. Biden about the accusations on Thursday, tweeting a 15-second video that mocked Mr. Biden, accompanied by the text "WELCOME BACK JOE!" With his remark, the president seemed to be practically inviting a re-examination of his own record with women, including multiple claims of sexual harassment and the "Access Hollywood" tape that nearly derailed his 2016 campaign.
While Mr. Biden fashions himself as a fierce defender of women's rights, frequently citing his work as the architect of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, he has already faced obstacles in his efforts to win over female Democrats. Women are expected to make up a majority of voters in the Democratic primary, which includes six female candidates.
Recent comments that he wished he "could have done something" to treat Anita Hill's claims of sexual harassment with more respect during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991 drew fierce backlash from critics, who pointed out that Mr. Biden had been chairman of the Senate committee that questioned Ms. Hill. His shifting position on abortion rights over his 36 years in the Senate has also drawn fresh scrutiny.

Texto completo: Stephen Moore, President Trump's planned nominee for the Federal Reserve Board, was found in contempt of court in 2013 for failing to pay his ex-wife more than $330,000 in alimony and child support, court documents show.
A Fairfax County, Va., court ordered Moore to sell his home to pay his ex-wife, Allison Moore, the money he legally owed her but had failed to pay for months. Stephen Moore ended up paying $217,000, which Allison Moore told the court was enough that she no longer wanted to force her ex-husband to sell the property.
Stephen and Allison Moore have three children and were married for two decades before divorcing in 2011. Allison Moore began divorce proceedings in 2010, and her divorce complaint said her then-husband opened a Match.com account and had a mistress.
Allison Moore says in the divorce filing that she was a good wife who "suffered emotional and psychological abuse by [Stephen Moore] throughout their marriage," including having to flee the family's home with their youngest child in the fall of 2009.
Stephen Moore signed a document saying he "admits all allegations" in his ex-wife's divorce complaint.
The contempt of court was first reported by the Guardian. Allison Moore then petitioned to seal the records. The divorce records were unsealed Friday after an appeal by The Washington Post, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Guardian.
Stephen Moore appeared on TV and radio shows this week accusing the media of trying to derail his nomination by drudging up a messy divorce and a $75,000 tax lien against him stemming from an error on his 2014 tax return. He said he and his ex-wife are now on better terms and that he has been working to settle the tax lien with the Internal Revenue Service, including overpaying his taxes in recent years.
"They don't want to talk about my economic ideas; they want to assassinate my character. That's what the left does," Moore said Monday in an appearance on Fox News's "The Ingraham Angle." "I'm not backing down."
Numerous economists have raised concerns that Moore is unfit to serve on the Fed board because he doesn't have much expertise in central banking, also arguing he could taint the Fed's independence with his close ties to Trump. His seeming failures to follow the law have also raised some questions about his ability to be one of the nation's top economic policymakers.
"He better pay 'em!" Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said after hearing of the potential nominee's unpaid taxes.
Moore has repeatedly praised marriage and homes with a "devoted husband and wife" as the best cure against poverty and other social ills. He wrote a commentary in the Washington Examiner titled "Marriage, the surest economic stimulus," in October 2014, about a year after the court had to compel him to pay his ex-wife child support and alimony.
Allison Moore says her husband slept with his mistress in the family home and stated at one of their son's graduation ceremonies, "I have two women, and what's really bad is when they fight over you."
Trump has been irate at the Fed for months and has blamed the central bank for any dips in the stock market or weak economic data. In the past week, Trump announced his plans to nominate Moore and former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain to fill the two remaining seats on the Fed's seven-member board.
Both candidates are likely to face intense scrutiny in the Senate confirmation process. In addition to Moore's past issues paying his ex-wife and his taxes, he also led the conservative advocacy group Club for Growth during a period when it was found to be in violation of Federal Election Commission regulations. The Club for Growth ultimately paid $350,000 to settle with the FEC.
Moore has a master's degree in economics and spent much of his career as an economic commentator for various media outlets and a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Fed governors have traditionally been PhD economists, bankers or business leaders. Every word a governor says is closely monitored since they set interest rates and many banking regulations.
Moore has called for higher interest rates while Democrats were in the White House and now advocates for lower interest rates, which are typically used to stimulate the economy, even though he says the nation is thriving economically.
The White House has stood by Moore in recent days as details of his past have surfaced.
"President Trump has every right in the world to make his appointments," Larry Kudlow, head of the National Economic Council, said Friday on Fox Business.

Texto completo: It’s long been a foundation of its coverage of President Trump, and now the Washington Post is making the final report from special investigator Robert Mueller dismissing Russia collusion charges against Trump's 2016 campaign part of the bottom line.

The newspaper is set to publish the released version of the report and has priced it at $15.

“This is the full text of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. It is the report and nothing but the report, presented as released by the Attorney General of the United States, with no positioning or framing apparatus—such as a celebrity introduction—that would give it bias or impede its clarity,” said Melville House.

Hen class-action lawsuits against a popular baby product brand started surfacing a few years ago, Emily Kress took notice.
The Dubuque mom wanted to know more about what was in the skin care products her family was using. As Kress learned more about the ingredients in her family's products, she was no longer comfortable with the status quo - and gradually began swapping them for cleaner alternatives, including everything from shampoo and conditioner to moisturizer and makeup.
Along the way, Kress' mission for cleaner beauty took a personal turn when she was diagnosed with a form of Sheehan's syndrome, which causes her pituitary gland to not produce enough pituitary hormones.
One of the first things Kress' doctors had her try: An estrogen patch placed on her skin.
"I started to feel so much better. My joints didn't hurt as much, and my brain was clearer," she said. "My husband could see that I was physically changing from the medicine I was receiving on my body. That's when he bought into the concept that what you put onto your skin truly matters."
Others are taking notice, too - pushing for more government regulation in the beauty industry. That's because thousands of chemicals, in billions of dollars' worth of products, are being governed by regulations that haven't been updated in decades, according to a February New York Times editorial.
"Most of the products on store shelves are probably safe, but many may not be; how is anyone supposed to know the difference?" the newspaper said. "When it comes to cosmetics, it is nearly impossible to determine which products to worry about."
Courtney Mihalakis, an esthetician at Potosa Spa at Hotel Julien Dubuque, is fielding more questions than ever from clients wary of what's in their skincare products.
"It's a good concern to have. And I personally wish it was a little easier for people to know what's in the products," she said. "I always tell people that your skin is your biggest organ, and you need to take care of it."
Not sure whether your products pass the safety test? Here are some tips to help you navigate stores in search of safer, cleaner products for your skin:
1. Learn some of the big names.
If you've ever looked at an ingredient list on one of your skincare products, you know how lengthy they can be. And oftentimes, the names are difficult to pronounce.
Mihalakis' suggestion: Familiarize yourself with a few ingredients to steer clear of.
The Environmental Working Group, an organization that tracks and rates chemical safety in cosmetics, among other products, provides a list of ingredients it deems hazardous. Here are the big ones, listed by product type, the EWG says to avoid:
Soap: Triclosan and triclocarban.
Skin moisturizer and lip products: Vitamin A (listed as retinyl palmitate, retinyl acetate and retinoic acid and retinol) in daytime products.
Sunscreen: SPF above 50, oxybenzone, spray sunscreens, retinyl palmitate and added insect repellent.
Hair care: Dark permanent hair dyes and chemical hair straighteners.
Toothpaste: Triclosan.
Nails: Formaldehyde or formalin in polish hardeners and other nail products and toluene, triphenyl phosphate (TPP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in polish.
Anti-aging products: Alpha and beta hydroxy acids (lactic acid and glycolic acid).
Fragrance: Look for products that disclose their fragrance ingredients. The EWG and the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics found an average of 14 chemicals in 17 name-brand fragrance products, none of which were listed on the label.
"Remembering a couple of these ingredients can make a big difference in the health of your skin," Mihalakis said.
2. Use available resources.
As Kress reviewed the products her family was using, she relied heavily on the EWG's research. The 25-year-old nonprofit organization maintains a Healthy Living app and Skin Deep website, which allow you to either scan product barcodes or search products by name to review their ratings.
The EWG's app features ratings for more than 120,000 food and personal care products, and it breaks down the factors behind each rating.
"It's been really helpful to look at their website and app," Kress said. "I'm not a chemist, and I don't have the time to research every ingredient."
When in doubt about a product or ingredient, reach out to a trusted esthetician, encourages Ashley Lau, an esthetician at Fringe Salon in Dubuque.
"Don't be afraid to ask. That's how you learn," she said. "Learning is a lifelong journey, and if you're passionate about it, you have to educate yourself."
3. Consider simpler products.
Sometimes, switching to healthier ingredients is simply a matter of turning to products you already have. With many plant-based products gaining in popularity, you might find beneficial skincare ingredients in your kitchen, Mihalakis said.
Here are three to consider:
Coconut oil: It can be used to remove makeup, moisturize your skin and even condition your hair.
Sugar: Sugar, when mixed with coconut oil, can be turned into an exfoliant, with the granules helping to scrub away dead skin cells.
Lemon: Simply placing a lemon slice on blemishes can help clear up acne. And drinking lemon water can add a refreshing glow to your skin.
Even following a healthy diet can help you attain healthier skin, Lau said.
"Those basic vitamins and minerals do wonders, especially when you use them how you're supposed to," she said. "I love to make my own things, too. There are so many things you can make on your own, and then you know exactly what is going on your skin."
4. Start small.
When Kress started using EWG's app to scan the products in her home's bathrooms, she was appalled by the negative ratings assigned to so many of her purchases, including ones marketed for "sensitive skin."
Rather than replace everything at once, Kress started with her kids' products, then moved to her makeup and slowly worked her way through their other products.
"Once we would run out of a product, I would replace it with a cleaner version," she said. "I think people could go crazy trying to totally clean out everything at once, and it would be expensive and wasteful."
5. Cleaner doesn't always mean costly.
Kress has found that cleaner doesn't always equate to more expensive. And, even when she does spend more on a product than she once did, she's found that it lasts longer.
"A lot of times, because there are less fillers in cleaner products, you don't need to use as much of it, so it lasts you much longer," she said. "I've used the same stick of deodorant for going on two years."
Mihalakis agrees - and says there's another reason to support skincare brands that might cost a little more.
"I always tell people that every dollar you spend goes to the kind of world you want," she said. "When you buy a little more expensive product, but the brand is doing what they should be doing, you're supporting them so they can give you healthier products."
Lau recommends setting aside as little as $5 a week to slowly build a skincare budget that allows you to buy the products that best help take care of your skin.
"You don't have to spend hundreds of dollars to take care of yourself," she said. "It could be adding or replacing one or two things in your skincare regimen."
6. Cleaner can do the job, too.
Mihalakis talks to many clients who question whether a product is working, because they don't feel anything when it's applied. They expect a tingling or burning sensation, which oftentimes is caused by products containing the elusive ingredient "fragrance."
"A lot of times, when you feel the product reacting on your skin, it's actually a bad thing," Mihalakis said.
For Kress' family, the journey to cleaner skincare has equated to healthier skin.
Kress' daughter deals with eczema and, over the years, has been on doctor-prescribed steroid creams to help control it. Ever since swapping her children's hair and skincare products, Kress has no longer needed to apply steroid cream on her daughter.
"Once people try cleaner products, I think they would be surprised by how easy it is to find things they can use and like," Kress said. "And because the fillers aren't there, the products actually work better."

Texto completo: Members of special counsel Robert Mueller’s team say Attorney General William Barr has soft-pedaled their investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election, according to the New York Times and the Washington Post.

The Times' report, titled “Some on Mueller’s Team Say Report Was More Damaging Than Barr Revealed,” doesn’t include any actual quotes, anonymous or otherwise. It doesn't quote anyone from the special counsel’s team but rather hinges entirely on its authors paraphrasing anonymous “government officials and others familiar with [the Mueller team’s] simmering frustrations,” anonymous “government officials familiar with [Attorney General William Barr’s] thinking,” and anonymous “government officials familiar with the investigation.”

The Post’s headline reads, “Limited information Barr has shared about Russia investigation frustrated some on Mueller’s team.” Unlike the Times, the Post provides quotes, though they are also anonymously sourced.

“It was much more acute than Barr suggested,” one person told the paper. A “U.S. official” who was “briefed on the matter” also said, “There was immediate displeasure from the team when they saw how the attorney general had characterized their work instead.”

The Mueller report was prepared “so that the front matter from each section could have been released immediately — or very quickly,” the “U.S. official” added. “It was done in a way that minimum redactions, if any, would have been necessary, and the work would have spoken for itself.”

Like the Times, the Post’s article doesn’t quote or even paraphrase members of Mueller's team. Rather, the article attributes its findings to “people familiar with the matter,” “two people familiar with their reactions,” and “people familiar with their responses.”

You’ll forgive my skepticism. I’m going to wait until someone goes on the record or provides evidence to back up what these nameless “government officials” suggest. That's based on the track record of such anonymous Mueller bombshells, which previously guaranteed prosecutions or even impeachment.

Barr announced on March 24 that Mueller’s team had failed to “establish that the members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” Barr also said the special investigation's 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, and 500 witness interviews could not find enough evidence “to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.” Whatever complaints Mueller underlings may have, that there will be no further prosecutions speaks volumes.

And Barr's track record for accuracy is at least better than the Post or the Times. Barr has put his name on his assessment, taking on reputational risk, whereas the Times' and the Post’s sources remain anonymous. Moreover, the newspapers' sources are just vague enough as not to be open to obvious and easy refutation, but not so vague that they don’t sound like major, scandalous developments. The supposedly “familiar” sources declined to elaborate what , specifically, Barr downplayed. We don’t even know how many members of the special counsel’s team supposedly feel this way.

Meanwhile, Mueller himself has not disputed Barr's assessment. And Mueller has gone on the record before to refute mischaracterizations of his team’s findings. If Barr has supposedly undersold the special counsel’s investigation, Mueller has picked a funny time to go silent.

California politicians disrespect our rights

Texto completo: The Constitution’s very specific list of inviolable human rights sets the United States apart from almost every other nation on Earth.
Unfortunately, California’s Democratic politicians tend to ignore the Constitution’s Bill of Rights in their zealous efforts to impose “progressive” dogma on their constituents.
Periodically, therefore, federal judges must remind them that Californians are also American citizens who must have their constitutional rights, even unpopular or politically incorrect ones, respected.
It happened twice last year.
First, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a California law requiring clinics offering non-abortion alternative services to pregnant women to post notices telling them about the availability of abortions.
“By compelling petitioners to speak a particular message, it alters the content of (their) speech” and thus violates a previously enunciated judicial principle, the majority opinion declared.
Just days later, the Supreme Court did it again, ruling 5-4 that laws in California and other states requiring non-members to pay union dues, a practice known as “agency shop,” violate “the free speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern.”
Last week, federal Judge Roger Benitez invalidated a California law (Penal Code Section 32310) that makes it illegal to sell or even possess firearms magazines holding more than 10 rounds, the latter provision added by a 2016 ballot measure sponsored by Gov. Gavin Newsom when he was lieutenant governor. The law, Benitez declared, violates the Constitution’s right to “keep and bear arms.”
“California’s law prohibiting acquisition and possession of magazines able to hold any more than 10 rounds places a severe restriction on the core right of self-defense of the home such that it amounts to a destruction of the right and is unconstitutional under any level of scrutiny,” Benitez wrote in his 86-page decision.
The judge sliced and diced every argument that Attorney General Xavier Becerra offered to defend the prohibition, declaring that Becerra offered no credible evidence that the law would make Californians safer.
“Where are the actual police investigation reports?” he asked. “The attorney general, California’s top law enforcement officer, has not submitted a single official police report of a shooting. Instead, the attorney general relies on news articles and interest group surveys. Federal constitutional rights are being subjected to litigation by inference about whether a pistol or a rifle in a news story might have had an ammunition magazine that held more than 10 rounds.”
Becerra will probably try to overturn Benitez’s ruling on appeal, and the case may eventually wind up in the U.S. Supreme Court, but Benitez repeatedly cited the court’s previous gun rights rulings as a basis for his decision, implying that the state has little chance of succeeding.
So, having seen their abridgments of constitutional rights slapped down, will California’s politicians become more judicious?
They should, but Becerra himself ventured very close recently to violating the right to a free press by demanding that UC-Berkeley’s Investigative Reporting Program return or destroy records of police misconduct that it obtained via a Public Records Act request.
Becerra warned that “unauthorized receipt or possession” of the data is a misdemeanor, and added, “If you do not intend to comply with our request, the department can take legal action.”
That smacks of the “prior restraint” case that the New York Times won in 1971 regarding publication of a secret military history of the Vietnam War known as the “Pentagon Papers.”
Becerra should know better than to threaten journalists, but then as the firearms ammunition case showed, he’s somewhat tone deaf on constitutional rights.

Texto completo: Joe Biden finally gets it.
The former vice president promised Wednesday to give up his old-fashioned ways and be "more mindful" of "personal space" in light of several women accusing him of being too handsy.
Biden - who is widely expected to launch a 2020 bid for the White House - broke his silence on the misconduct allegations in a mea culpa video posted to his Twitter handle, in which he acknowledged his long-held penchant for touching people.
"I shake hands, I hug people. I grab men and women by the shoulder and say, 'you can do this,'" Biden said.
However, the 76-year-old ex-veep said he understands that's no longer okay.
"Now it's all about taking selfies together. Social norms have begun to change," he said. "The boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset, and I get it, I get it. I hear what they are saying. I understand it, and I'll be much more mindful. That's my responsibility."
At least four women have accused Biden of inappropriately touching them.
Among the accusers is Caitlyn Caruso, a 22-year-old sexual assault survivor who alleges Biden rested his hand on her thigh during an event about sexual misconduct at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, even though she says she twisted in her seat out of discomfort.
Caruso, who was 19 at the time of the alleged incident, told The New York Times on Tuesday she was stunned by Biden's behavior, especially considering the topic of the event and the ex-vice president's work on the 1994 Violence Against Women Act.
"It doesn't even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that," she told the newspaper. "These are supposed to be people you can trust."
Biden brushed off such concerns in the video and doubled down on his commitment to combating sexual misconduct.
"I've worked my whole life to empower women," Biden said, "so the idea that I can't adjust to the fact that personal space is more important than it's ever been is just not thinkable. I will, I will."
The allegations against Biden have prompted other Democratic 2020 hopefuls to speak out.
"We need to listen to those who are raising their stories, who have the courage to come forward, to share their experience and also to be part of the conversation about his candidacy," Beto O'Rourke told reporters after speaking at the National Action Network's annual conference in Midtown Wednesday.
However, the former Texas congressman, who's widely considered a top contender in the crowded Democratic primary field, stopped short of calling on Biden to drop his 2020 aspirations.
"Ultimately that's going to be a decision for him to make, but I'm glad that people are willing to and have the courage to step up," O'Rourke said. "They must be heard and listened to."
The Democratic Party has taken a zero tolerance approach in the #MeToo era, presenting itself as a stark alternative to the GOP of President Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by 23 women and frequently fields allegations of misogyny.
But some Democrats contend Biden should be cut some slack because his alleged behavior isn't that bad.
"Certainly nothing I've seen or heard about Joe Biden would be anywhere remotely near disqualifying in my opinion," long-shot presidential contender Andrew Yang told reporters after also delivering a speech at the NAN conference.
Biden has yet to announce a campaign, but is rumored to be seriously considering one.
The former right-hand man to President Barack Obama is one of the only Democratic 2020 hopefuls who's not slated to speak at Rev. Al Sharpton's NAN conference, which spans four days and will feature speeches from 12 presidential candidates.
O'Rourke's Wednesday speech kicked off the marathon event, and Sharpton introduced the Texas Democrat to roaring applause as a "rock star" with a strong record of advocating for civil and voting rights.
Mayor de Blasio, on the other hand, did not get as warm of a welcome from the hometown crowd.
De Blasio's NAN appearance came on the heels of Quinnipiac University releasing a poll showing abysmal figures for the mayor's 2020 chances.
A whopping 76% of New Yorkers believe de Blasio should not run for president, while only 18% support his potential bid, according to the survey.
"De Blasio's flirtation with a 2020 White House bid is prompting a rare moment of unity among New Yorkers," said Marry Snow, an analyst for the Quinnipiac poll. "Three-quarters of them say, 'Mr. Mayor: Don't do it.'"
The mayor was unfazed by the voter disdain.
"Time and time again people will tell you what you can't do. But don't let anyone tell you what you can't do. Don't let anyone talk you out of your own power," de Blasio said. "What we have learned time and time again, we have to focus on what we can do."

Texto completo: A comedy-drama about a 20-something thrust into a murder mystery begins on the CW. And "Marvel's Cloak & Dagger" returns to Freeform.
What's on TV
[Video: In The Dark | TCA 2019 Trailer | The CW Watch on YouTube.]
IN THE DARK 9 p.m. on the CW. The latest comedy to debut on the CW centers on Murphy, a 20-something with a taste for cigarettes, liquor and sex who is also blind. The first episode introduces Murphy and her roommate, Jess (Brooke Markham), while setting up the pieces for the mystery: the possible murder of Murphy's teenage friend, Tyson (Thamela Mpumlwana). While out for a walk, Murphy discovers what she believes to be Tyson's body, but the police doubt her story; for one thing, the body is gone by the time the police arrive. So Murphy must take matters mostly into her own hands. The show was created by Corinne Kingsbury, who also created the sitcom "Fam," which debuted on CBS this year.
BABY BOY (2001) 6 p.m. on BET. After painting complex portraits of South Central Los Angeles in the early '90s with "Boyz N the Hood" and "Poetic Justice," the director John Singleton returned to that area with this coming-of-age drama. Tyrese Gibson stars as Jody, a 20-year-old who lives with his mother, Juanita (A. J. Johnson). He struggles to do good in a society that, the movie shows, gives him little opportunity for growth. Taraji P. Henson plays Yvette, the mother of Jody's son, who has an imprisoned former lover played by Snoop Dogg. The film "disarms any facile analysis or easy judgment of its characters," A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. In the same review, Scott called the movie "a powerful, compassionate and tough-minded critique of contemporary black manhood."
MARVEL'S CLOAK & DAGGER 8 p.m. on Freeform. It's been a bit more than three weeks since "Captain Marvel" opened at theaters. We're just over three weeks away from "Avengers: Endgame." Squeezed in between those two releases -- and onto smaller screens -- is this additional deposit into the ever-growing Marvel vault. The new, second season of the family-friendly "Cloak & Dagger" reintroduces the titular characters from the first season, Cloak (Aubrey Joseph) and Dagger (Olivia Holt), two high-school-age heroes in New Orleans. The first season spent several episodes fleshing out the pair's back story, showing the radically different lives -- and levels of privilege -- that shaped their experiences in the city. With those backgrounds already established, the second season promises to dive quickly into action.
What's Streaming
LOVE, DEATH & ROBOTS Stream on Netflix. This new animated anthology series for adults mixes both genres and animation styles. One episode centers on a gang of cyborg thieves. In another, a couple finds a lost civilization in the back of their freezer. One bleaker story in the collection follows the trials of an astronaut stranded miles above Earth. The director Tim Miller ("Deadpool") created this cartoon potpourri, which also counts David Fincher among its executive producers.

Thomas: The New Zealand massacre

Información de publicación: Savannah Morning News ; Savannah, Ga. [Savannah, Ga]. 03 Apr 2019.

Texto completo: There are at least three condemnations that should result from the massacre.
The first condemnation is for the act itself. The callous slaughter of people at prayer is part of an age that has devalued life, from unrestricted abortions, to street shootings and other terrorist attacks. That some of these assaults are motivated by twisted views of religion, or in this case, a white supremacist opposed to immigration, is all part of the same piece. Murder and hate should not be categorized.
The second condemnation goes to politicians and special interest groups who blame President Trump and the NRA, seeking to make political hay out of an action that had nothing to do with either. That the shooter mentioned the president as "a symbol of white supremacy" does not make him one. Critics will use anything in an attempt to discredit and weaken Trump's appeal before next year's election. Shame on them.
The gunman, whose name shall not be mentioned here, posted online a 74-page "manifesto" and details of his evil intent. Reports say he sent it to the prime minister's office and media outlets just nine minutes before launching the attack. New Zealand Prime MinisterJacinda Ardern's office said the message came too late for police to respond. Since the shooter had made his racist beliefs known in previous social media postings, why did no one take him seriously and monitor him as a walking time bomb? If police failed to take his threats seriously, are authorities also in danger of condemnation?
Did no one see it? If someone did, why didn't they call police? If they did call, why did the police not pay him a visit? Social media is often quick to take down "inappropriate" postings. How did the gunman manage to escape censors for a heinous act far worse than offensive speech? Press reports say the shooter had also planned a terror attack on Muslims last December. Did no one hear about that? If they did, why weren't police contacted? Again, if they were, why didn't they visit the man's home?
Ardern promised to strengthen her country's gun laws. Would stronger laws have deterred a man intent on mass murder? The police mainly determine who is qualified to own a gun. The New York Times reported: "While New Zealand's laws governing the purchase of semiautomatic rifles are more restrictive than those in the United States, the country is much freer with firearms than Australia is, allowing most guns to be purchased without requiring them to be tracked." The prime minister can start there.
Investigators will find how the shooter, who is a gun club member, obtained his weapons and whether he was licensed to possess them.
Meanwhile, houses of worship are finding it necessary to employ armed guards, which is a judgment on our increasingly anti-life culture. More guards will likely be hired in the aftermath of the mosque shootings.
New Zealand is a popular location for film companies. Perhaps the most famous film series produced there is "Lord of the Rings," based on the books by J.R.R. Tolkien. In "The Fellowship of the Ring," there is this quote: "Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement."
The shooter dealt death in his judgment. New Zealand no longer imposes capital punishment. If ever there was a person who deserves the death penalty it is this shooter, and not just because it might deter others. More importantly, capital punishment imposed on this monster would exact justice for those innocent people who were killed or wounded and for their families.

Texto completo: OCONOMOWOC - Even though Jack Hamilton lived through the horrendous Chosin Reservoir battle of the Korean War, or maybe because he survived it, he still wants to read about it.
So when his daughter gave him a copy of "On Desperate Ground: The Marines at The Reservoir, the Korean War's Greatest Battle" for Christmas, he was eager to dive into it.
The 87-year-old Oconomowoc man was still reading the book when he got a call from Stars and Stripes Honor Flight. Hamilton is flying on the April 6 Honor Flight to Washington, D.C., from Milwaukee's airport, but he did not have a guardian.
That's when he learned his companion would be Hampton Sides, the New York Times bestselling writer whose book he was reading.
"I'm delighted. It's an honor for me — he's a well-known author," Hamilton said in a recent interview at his book-filled apartment.
Hamilton joined the Marine Reserves in 1949 for "free clothes and beer money" and was working at a lodge in the Grand Canyon when his mom phoned to tell him he was being called to active duty just days after the North Korean Army invaded South Korea. Within days, the 19-year-old Chicago native was on a train to Camp Pendleton for six weeks of training, then a ship to Japan, then a ship to Korea, arriving in September 1950 shortly after the Inchon landing.
Hamilton was assigned to the 1st Marine Regiment, "which turned out to be the luckiest thing of my life because they were a regular Marine unit, not reservists, and I was with well-trained guys," he said.
Had he been placed in the 7th Marine Regiment with many other reservists, Hamilton's chances of surviving would have dropped precipitously; the 7th Marines were involved in some of the fiercest fighting at the man-made lake known as the Chosin Reservoir. During the 17-day battle, United Nations troops of around 30,000 fought a Chinese army of 120,000. The second enemy for American soldiers and Marines was brutally cold weather.
Hamilton remembers being served Thanksgiving dinner in the harsh subzero conditions, noting that service members knew when they were heading into battle by the chow they were given.
"If they gave you steak and eggs for breakfast you know the afternoon wasn't going to be good," he joked.
Sides, author of the 2002 bestseller "Ghost Soldiers: The Epic Account of World War II's Greatest Rescue Mission" about the Bataan Death March, said the Chosin Reservoir battle was the turning point of the Korean War, the moment when China first entered the conflict and tried to spring a trap on the Marines on the steep shores of the frozen lake.
"The reason the Chosin Reservoir battle is so widely celebrated, studied and embraced by the Marine Corps is because it was a fighting withdrawal," said Sides. "It's one thing when you're dug in and defending yourself, but fighting while you're marching down a very narrow road is a complicated endeavor to pull off and they did."
Hamilton's unit, B Co., 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, was ordered to hold mountains next to the reservoir. Despite the frigid temperatures, Hamilton was told not to zip up his sleeping bag because Marines in his battalion had been killed when they were ambushed at night in their bags.
Eventually, the Americans were given the order to fall back. Hamilton's unit was one of the last to leave, marching along one road, waiting for a bridge to be rebuilt, and ultimately walking 75 miles while eating frozen World War II C rations. Hamilton recalls chipping out beans to eat one by one, holding them on his tongue to warm them up before swallowing.
"Our mind-set? 'Keep moving.' I just wanted to get out of there," said Hamilton.
The Americans who survived the battle call themselves the Chosin Few and the Frozen Chosin.
"They're special," said Sides, who interviewed many Chosin veterans for his book, which was published last October. "They're mystified about why the war isn't better known but they're resigned to it."
When Karyn Roelke of Stars and Stripes Honor Flight learned that Hamilton was a Chosin veteran who needed a guardian — many Honor Flight veterans travel with a family member or friend — she asked Adam Makos, author of the Korean War book "Devotion" who had appeared by Skype last month at a Stars and Stripes Honor Flight book club.
Makos was busy with appearances for a book tour and recommended his friend Sides, who is traveling to Milwaukee this week from his home in New Mexico.
"Because of our knowledge of the Chosin Reservoir, we thought it was important that somebody who understood it was with Jack" Hamilton, said Roelke.
Sides, who is now working on a book about Captain Cook, got the idea to write about the Chosin Reservoir battle when he met a Korean War veteran years ago at a book signing for "Ghost Soldiers."
"To be able to spend the whole day with one of these guys, it's going to be a great joy to see a smile on his face and share some laughs. And for him to realize in a visceral way that he is not forgotten and that his comrades who fought and died are not forgotten," said Sides.
When he returned home from Korea, Hamilton attended Drake College and became a human resources administrator. He was vice president of human resources for the Harley-Davidson Co. from 1979 to 1984, worked 10 years for Allis-Chalmers in Illinois and started a temporary services company before retiring in 1996. He has three children, four grandchildren, one great-grandchild and one on the way.
"I'm almost finished with the book. I already know the ending," Hamilton said smiling.
Jack Hamilton, 87, fought in the Chosin Reservoir battle during the Korean War. The Oconomowoc man is traveling on a Stars and Stripes Honor Flight on April 6 with Hampton Sides, the author of the recent book about the Chosin Reservoir battle, "On Desperate Ground."

Trump team called out over security clearances

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A Democrat-led House committee voted Tuesday to subpoena a former Trump administration official to discuss how the White House granted security clearances to people despite problems with their background checks.
The House Committee on Oversight and Reform voted along party lines to subpoena Carl Kline, who was the personnel security director for the first two years of the Trump presidency.
The White House "cannot stonewall and stall this committee for months and then just offer us general information about their policies, not when there are such serious allegations of a risk to national security," said Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D-Md., chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.
The subpoena is based on testimony to committee aides from a whistleblower, a longtime White House security adviser who said she and colleagues denied security clearances to about 25 applicants but saw those decisions overturned by higher-ups in the Trump administration.
"I would not be doing a service to myself, my country, or my children if I sat back knowing that the issues that we have could impact national security," testified Tricia Newbold, a career employee who has returned to work at the White House.
The group of 25 applicants may include President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was granted a top-secret security clearance despite concerns from officials, The New York Times and The Washington Post reported in February.
Issues with some applicants includes ties to foreign influence, conflicts of interests, questionable or criminal conduct, financial problems and drug abuse, according to testimony. Cummings and the committee did not identify the 25 applicants recommended for rejection. But in the past they have asked the White House to provide information about clearances for Kushner, his spouse (and the president's daughter), Ivanka Trump, and national security adviser John Bolton.
The White House has rejected the document requests, citing privacy and saying Congress does not have the authority to see these documents. Kushner has dismissed Newbold's complaints.
Kushner told Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Monday that he did not want to discuss the clearance process but that "I can say over the last two years that I've been here, I've been accused of all different types of things, and all of those things have turned out to be false."
House Democrats are planning subpoenas in a number of investigations of the Trump White House.
Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, top Republican on the oversight panel, accused Cummings and the Democrats of politicizing security clearances and exaggerating.
"For instance," he said, "the 25 examples of overruled recommendations by Ms. Newbold heralded by the Democrats include nonpolitical officials such as a GSA custodian."
Cummings said the evidence suggests the administration has been careless with security clearances and access to the nation's secrets.
Newbold's testimony reflected "the grave security risks she has been witnessing firsthand over the past two years," he said.

Texto completo: Capt. Jonathan Bratten, historian for the National Guard, will give "A History of Camp Keyes"
National Guard historian to present ‘A History of Camp Keyes’ Tuesday
The Sidney Historical Society’s April public presentation “A History of Camp Keyes” will begin at 2 p.m. Tuesday at the Sidney Grange on Middle Road in Sidney.
For more than 100 years, Camp Keyes has been known as the headquarters of the Maine National Guard in Augusta. But how did that site on the hill come to be chosen? Who is it named for? Who trained there and why?
Capt. Jonathan Bratten, historian for the National Guard, will answer those questions and describes the role that Camp Keyes has played in five different conflicts for generations of Maine soldiers and airmen, according to a news release from the historical society.
In this capacity, Bratten has produced multiple articles on the history of Maine’s soldiers, appearing in such publications as The New York Times, The Washington Post, Army History, On Point and Army Magazine.
He has also appeared in a Smithsonian channel documentary, “Americans Underground: Secret Cities of WWI” and served as a historian in France for the Army’s World War I centennial commemorations.
Bratten is the commander of 251 Engineer Co. and a veteran of the Afghanistan war. He and his wife live in Portland.
To ask questions or get more information, call 242-6913.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
"What makes you different from your friends?"
That question, posed in January to members of Generation Z -- people born from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s -- by editors at The New York Times, drew an immediate response.
In a call-out on nytimes.com, readers were asked to identify themselves however they wished and invited to submit a self-portrait.
Within 48 hours, there were over 2,500 submissions from people in all 50 states.
"I'm the only person I know at my college that pays their own rent," Jess from New York City, who described herself as a Korean/Caucasian female, wrote.
"I like to read," Phoenix, from Minneapolis, who described himself as an American man with a white mother and Vietnamese father, wrote.
"I have red hair and I would like to be called not texted thank you very much," Lizzie, a white woman from Boston, responded.
Nearly 1,000 similar responses appear online in the recent article, "Gen Z: In Their Own Words," and hundreds were featured in a special print section in Sunday's paper.
Generation Z, which includes the younger siblings of millennials, is the most ethnically diverse generation in United States history, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data.
The editors on the project, Lauretta Charlton, lead editor of Race/Related, a newsletter covering race issues, and Lindsey Underwood, editor of The Edit, a newsletter focusing on youth culture, wanted to reflect the myriad identities of Generation Z. But they also wanted to give them room to define themselves.
"We all don't fit in the narrow boxes," Ms. Underwood said.
"The way, I, a 30-year-old black woman, would talk about who I am is different than how my mother, a 62-year-old, would talk about who she is," Ms. Underwood added. "And I know that a 20-year-old, someone in Gen Z, would talk about it a little bit differently, too."
The Times published nearly 1,000 images with this article, more than have ever accompanied any one project. For the digital version, Antonio de Luca and Adriana Ramić, designers on the project, created an interactive slide show.
"I think when the public sees a reflection of themselves, a lot more people will spend time with it," Mr. de Luca said. "It's not our editorial voice; this is just them."
For the print component, Andrew Sondern, an art director on the project, wanted to showcase as many people as possible without overwhelming readers. He used a folded pullout section and created a collage of self-portraits alongside the responses.
It was no coincidence that the team responsible for the project consisted mostly of millennials -- the generation born from 1981 to 1996, which has been subjected to numerous sweeping articles poking and prodding at who they are, with often absurd claims, including the contention that they couldn't afford homes because of, among other things, their spending on avocado toast.
"You have to start with recognizing that monolithic definitions don't serve anybody well," Ms. Charlton said. "We can't just say the black community, we can't just say Generation Z feels this way. We kind of have to get our hands in there and let them speak."
The team wanted to include as many different voices as possible. The Times reached out to Native American communities; diversity offices at colleges throughout the country, with specific efforts made to contact historically black colleges and universities; Muslim communities; and many other organizations.
Then came the work of parsing them down. The editors worked together to weed out spam and violent imagery as well as verify that the submissions were from real people who still wanted to be featured in the final project.
In response to the prompt, Elias Tzoc-Pacheco of Hamilton, Ohio, wrote, "I speak several languages, hold conservative and progressive views, and always seek to lead my community not just my school."
He described himself as a Guatemalan bisexual, and said participating in the project and sharing his identity on a large platform felt "impactful."
"It gave credibility to my experience and the others," he said.

NY Times readers weigh in: Biden was ‘acculturated to behave’ like that, ‘we need to relax’

Texto completo: Readers of the New York Times weighed in on former Vice President Joe Biden’s unwanted touching, with some arguing the media and his critics are missing the mark.

The newspaper published a handful of letters to the editor on Monday that were mostly supportive of Biden, who is widely expected to enter the 2020 presidential race in the coming weeks.

“We are missing a genuine opportunity to have an open conversation about what change looks like as it relates to the treatment of women. Instead, we are unable to hold two truths at once,” Laura Petiford of Connecticut wrote. “Men were acculturated to behave in ways that ignored the sensibilities of women, and that is no longer acceptable.”

Susannah Sard of New York said she was at a restaurant in Delaware last week when Biden stopped by her table to chat.

“The whole time he was talking to us, his hand was on my shoulder,” she wrote. “I figured that he was a touchy guy, nothing more. Sometimes we need to relax.”

Eileen West of New York said Biden touching women on the shoulders does not compare to President Trump bragging about grabbing a woman’s genitals without her consent.

“Joe Biden has plenty to answer for, especially his treatment of Anita Hill. Let his challengers question him on that, rather than being distracted by the media frenzy of the day,” West wrote.

Illinois resident Barbara Ellson praised former Nevada assemblywoman Lucy Flores for speaking out about how Biden’s alleged behavior made her feel uncomfortable.

“Joe Biden echoes assumptions long protected in our culture. It’s past time that men in power are held accountable for actions that range from creepy to criminal,” Ellson said.

Flores is one of two women in recent days who have accused Biden of touching them inappropriately. Flores said Biden grabbed her shoulders and kissed the back of her head at a campaign rally in 2014.

Amy Lappos, a former congressional aide to Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., accused Biden of putting his hand around her neck and pulling her toward him to rub noses at a political fundraiser in 2009.

In a statement Sunday, Biden said he did not believe he had ever acted inappropriately toward women.

“If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention,” the statement said. “I may not recall these moments the same way, and I may be surprised at what I hear. But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will.”

Texto completo: A group backed by liberal billionaire George Soros contributed millions of dollars to firms connected to Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele, the author of the so-called Trump dossier.

Internal Revenue Service filings reveal The Democracy Integrity Project, founded in 2017 by a former staffer to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., $3.3 million was paid to Bean LLC., a holding company that oversees Fusion GPS. Separately, $250,000 was paid to London-based Walsingham Partners Ltd., which is owned by Steele and his business partner Christopher Burrows, the Daily Caller reports.

Similarly, hundreds of thousands of dollars were also paid to other firms with ties to Fusions GPS as contractors or law firms that represented Fusion GPS on legal matters concerning the dossier, according to TDIP’s tax filings.

Jones claimed he oversaw a “shadow media organization helping the government” investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election and that he intended to share his findings with federal investigators, the media, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

A lawyer from Perkins Coie, the law firm that represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic national committee, hired Fusion GPS to conduct anti-Trump research and paid the firm a total of $1 million.

Fusion GPS then paid Steele almost $170,000 for a project that led to the dossier, which contains salacious information about President Trump and his relationship with Russia, and was published by BuzzFeed in January 2017.

Jones told the FBI in 2017 that seven to 10 donors financially backed the nonprofit. Additionally, attorney Adam Waldman who has ties to Steele, told the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2017 that Soros was one of the donors behind the nonprofit. The New York Times reported in 2018 that Soros contributed at least $1 million to the group.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Tricia Newbold, the Trump administration's latest whistle-blower, did something unexpected only hours after a House committee released her deposition that the White House had overruled career staff members who denied officials their security clearances: She went back to work.
"As you can imagine," Ms. Newbold, a 39-year-old employee of the White House Personnel Security Office, wrote in an email during her commute on Monday, "I am extremely nervous for how people at work will treat me."
But according to people close to her, she was not afraid to tell them about the things she had seen. Ms. Newbold's decision to accuse her own office of rampant mismanagement of the security clearances of at least 25 employees came after months of what she characterized as personal discrimination and professional retaliation from Carl Kline, the office's former director, after she spent roughly a year trying to raise issues internally.
In a White House where aggressive leak investigations are conducted in service of President Trump, who has aides sign nondisclosure agreements, Ms. Newbold's account represents the rarest of developments: a damning on-the-record account from a current employee inside his ranks.
"She wasn't looking for trouble," Ms. Newbold's lawyer, Edward Passman, said in an interview on Monday. "And she wasn't looking to go public. But her back was to the wall and she did what she had to do."
Described as both "no nonsense" and "intense" by people who have interacted with her during the clearance process, Ms. Newbold has served under four presidential administrations, beginning with the Clinton White House in 2000. Eventually she worked her way up to adjudications manager, a job that required her to help make determinations about the security clearances of administration employees. Her office is filled with holdovers from other administrations, and it is meant to be nonpartisan.
Yet in the Trump administration the office was filled with people who had little experience in vetting employees in the interest of national security, Ms. Newbold said in a nine-hour deposition with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform last week.
"There was no resolution," Ms. Newbold told the committee, according to a lengthy summary letter the panel's Democratic chairman published of her interview, which contained verbatim quotes. "And I feel that right now this is my last hope to really bring the integrity back into our office."
Ms. Newbold told the committee that at least two senior administration officials had been granted security clearances -- which gave them access to classified information -- despite possible disqualifying issues. She also told the committee that she had compiled a list of at least 25 individuals, including contractors and senior advisers, who had a "wide range" of disqualifying information, including drug use, financial problems and criminal conduct.
In February, The New York Times reported that the president overruled several senior officials in order to reinstate the security clearance of Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, despite issues raised during his clearance process.
John F. Kelly, the president's former chief of staff, wrote a contemporaneous internal memo about how he had been "ordered" to give Mr. Kushner the top-secret clearance. In her interviews with the House committee, Ms. Newbold said that Mr. Kelly and Joe Hagin, the former deputy chief of staff, had been attentive to the national security issues she had tried to raise.
Mr. Hagin resigned last June and Mr. Kelly in December. Mr. Trump has the legal authority to grant a clearance, but in most cases, the Personnel Security Office makes a determination about whether to grant one after the F.B.I. has conducted a background check.
Democrats on the committee are also demanding information from the White House about Ivanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter and adviser, who was granted a security clearance shortly after Mr. Kushner got his. In an interview with ABC News in February, Ms. Trump insisted her father had no hand in either her clearance or her husband's.
Ms. Newbold, who has a rare form of dwarfism, also accused Mr. Kline, the former director of personnel security, of retaliating against her when she repeatedly pointed out to him that actions he was taking, including overriding recommendations to issue clearances to two senior officials, were violating protocol. Ms. Newbold said that Mr. Kline oversaw a workplace where files -- including extensive and sensitive background check documents -- were not secured properly, and stopped the performing of credit checks for potential employees. She told the House committee that she had "never seen our office so ill-staffed and with such lack of experience."
Last fall, Ms. Newbold filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, accusing Mr. Kline of moving office files to a shelf several feet above her, deliberately out of her reach, beginning in December 2017. That month, she hired Mr. Passman, her lawyer.
"As little as I am, I'm willing to fight and stand up for what I know is right, and they've always respected that about me," Ms. Newbold told the House committee last week. "It's humiliating to not be able to independently work and do the job that you need."
In January, Ms. Newbold was suspended for two weeks without pay after NBC News reported that Mr. Kline had approved a security clearance for Mr. Kushner despite staff objections. The office's new director, Crede Bailey, said at the time that Ms. Newbold had refused to "support new procedures your supervisor implemented."
Within the past two weeks, Mr. Passman said she was also removed from her supervisory role at work. On Monday, the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether she could expect to continue in her job. In the evening, Ms. Newbold's lawyer said she had gone back to work without incident.
Also on Monday, Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and the committee's chairman, called for a subpoena for Mr. Kline, who now works at the Defense Department, to learn more about his work when he was the director of the office and about his interactions with Ms. Newbold. In a letter to Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, Mr. Cummings said that the Trump administration had refused to provide information about "the problematic practices of the White House Security Office over the past two years."
Republicans on the committee quickly sought to minimize what Ms. Newbold actually knew about the senior officials whose clearances were overturned. In a memo released on Monday, they said Mr. Cummings used only "cherry-picked excerpts" from Ms. Newbold's deposition, and said she had acknowledged that the president had the "authority to grant access to national security information to anyone he chooses." The Republican members also pointed out that she had positive things to say about Mr. Bailey, her current supervisor.
Mr. Passman said Mr. Bailey's two-week suspension of Ms. Newbold was "unwarranted," but added that "he's not personally attacking her like Kline did."
It did not surprise Mr. Passman or other people close to Ms. Newbold that she returned to work -- her choice to continue "kind of speaks for itself" about the kind of person she is, her older sister, Melissa Rahming, said in an interview on Monday. "She's not afraid for what she's said," Ms. Rahming said, adding that her sister had "held her integrity this entire time."
Daniel Jacobson, a former associate counsel in the Obama White House, called Ms. Newbold a "serious security professional" and a "total straight shooter" in a tweet on Monday.

Texto completo: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that it is investigating a multistate salmonella outbreak linked to pet hedgehogs, and warned owners of the pets not to touch them.

The CDC cautioned hedgehog owners not to “kiss or snuggle hedgehogs, because this can spread Salmonella germs to your face and mouth.”

More than half of the sick people contacted by the CDC said they had touched or been around a hedgehog, and three hedgehogs responsible came from two sick people’s homes.

“The fact that hedgehogs are a risk is not new,” Jane Sykes, professor of small animal internal medicine at the University of California, Davis, said to the New York Times.“ But we don’t know how common the shedding of salmonella is among hedgehogs specifically.”

The CDC also said hedgehog owners should wash their hands after playing with hedgehogs, clean their habitats and toys, and keep them from the kitchen or wherever food is stored.

Two people have been hospitalized since the CDC issued a first warning in October 2018. Hedgehogs were responsible for a similar outbreak from 2011 to 2013, infecting 26 people and killing one.

The CDC said children under five, adults over 65, and anyone with a compromised immune system should keep their distance from hedgehogs and that families should consider choosing a different pet.

Burger King apuesta por ‘Impossible Burger’, la hamburguesa vegetariana que sangra

Texto completo: La cadena de comida rápida Burger King está ofreciendo en pruebas una hamburguesa vegetariana, llamada “Impossible Whopper”, en 59 restaurantes de la ciudad de St. Louis, con miras a expandir esta opción en sus menús de todo el país, informa este lunes The New York Times.
Se trata de una curiosa colaboración entre Burger King y la empresa Impossible Foods , conocida por haber creado una hamburguesa hecha con vegetales y con la proteína “heme”, que imita incluso el “sangrado” que luce el producto de carne de ternera habitual.
Según dijo al diario el jefe de marketing de la cadena, Fernando Machado, ni clientes ni empleados logran diferenciar la hamburguesa de carne de la vegetariana y esta opción podría pasar de ser un “nicho” de mercado a un negocio en sí para la firma.
Machado indicó que Burger King ha visto incrementarse el número de consumidores que quieren comer menos carne, especialmente procedente de ternera, y la “Impossible Whopper” permitiría satisfacer esa demanda sin “comprometer el sabor”.
La versión vegetariana de la hamburguesa tiene aproximadamente el mismo valor proteínico que la tradicional Whopper , pero un 15 % menos de grasa y un 90 % menos de colesterol respecto a la estrella de la cadena, de acuerdo al NYT.
El presidente de Burger King Norteamérica, Chris Finazzo, dijo a CNN que la firma espera “dar a quien quiera comer una hamburguesa todos los días, pero no necesariamente quiera comer ternera, permiso para venir a los restaurantes más frecuentemente”.
Yes, the Impossible #Whopper does taste this good. Thank you @DAVID_Miami_ for such a great Ad campaign! #marketing #advertising pic.twitter.com/unxtIAJHua

Por su parte, David Lee, el jefe financiero y de operaciones de Impossible Foods, una “startup” de Silicon Valley, indicó que pese a tener sus productos ya introducidos en unos 6,000 restaurantes del país, la alianza con Burger King supone un “hito” porque está “a una escala diferente”.
En un vídeo promocional del “test” publicado en su canal de YouTube corporativo, Burger King dice reunir a algunos de sus clientes más leales y les ofrece la hamburguesa vegetariana sin que sepan que no es de carne, ante lo que reaccionan con incredulidad asegurando que sabe como la “Whopper” original .

Coincidiendo con el día de “April Fool’s” en EE.UU., en el que abundan las bromas en los medios nacionales, muchos no se han tomado en serio la noticia, pese a que se están sumando a la tendencia de ofrecer opciones sin carne en los menús otras cadenas de comida rápida como Taco Bell o Chipotle.

Analysis: The good, bad and the unknown of Apple’s new services -BYLN- By BARBARA ORTUTAY AP Technology Writer

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — It took a while, but finally — and with the carefully curated help of Oprah, Big Bird and Goldman Sachs — Apple has at last unveiled a new streaming TV service, its own branded credit card and a news subscription product.
The moves have been largely expected and so far don’t appear to drastically alter the competitive landscape the way Apple has done with previous products such as the iPhone and the iPad.
Still, the announcements represent an important step for the company as it seeks to diversify how it makes money amid declining sales of the iPhone, even if by themselves they are unlikely to turn Apple’s big ship either way. But it’s a way to keep fans sticking with Apple even when they aren’t buying a new iPhone every year.
Monday’s announcements lacked some key details, such as pricing of the TV service. Here’s a rundown on what Apple unveiled — what’s good, what’s not so good and what we still don’t know.
— APPLE TV PLUS The good: Oprah, Jason Momoa, Big Bird, Steven Spielberg and a host of other stars have lent themselves to original Apple shows that range from documentaries to science fiction, drama and preschool television programming. The focus on "quality storytelling" is consistent with Apple’s image and analysts say is likely to produce some hit shows.
The bad: Even so, "it will lack the full range and diversity of content available through Netflix, Amazon and others, and that is set to limit its appeal," said Martin Garner, an analyst at CCS Insight. Apple also joins a crowded market and it’s not clear how many more monthly subscriptions people have the money and the bandwidth for.
The unknown: Apple hasn’t said how much it’s going to cost.
— APPLE NEWS PLUS The good: The price, $10 per month, looks like a good deal compared to separate subscriptions for newspapers and magazines (Apple will include more than 300 of the latter, including The New Yorker and Sports Illustrated). Apple is touting "richly designed articles" that let people read publications tailored to Apple devices in all their glory. Apple has also included privacy protections, and says it will collect data about what people read in a way that it won’t know who read what — just how much total time is spent on different articles.
The bad: While The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal have signed on, other big-name news publishers, such as The New York Times, have not. Nor have, in fact, most other major U.S. newspapers.
The unknown: It’s not entirely clear how much news you’re getting for your money. The Journal, famous for its business and industry coverage and commanding nearly $40 a month, will make "specially curated" general-interest news available for Apple customers, for example. Other stories will still be there — but Apple says users will have to search for the articles themselves.
— APPLE CARD The good: Security and privacy, two areas Apple prides itself on, are a clear focus. The physical version of the card has no numbers, and the digital version lives in your Apple Wallet on your phone, where it’s protected by Face ID or Touch ID so even if someone steals your phone they won’t be able to use the card to buy things. Apple says it won’t get information on what you buy with the card or where or for how much. There are no late fees.
The bad: The rewards (2 percent cash back for all purchases using the digital version of the card, 1 percent using the physical version and 3 percent cash back at Apple stores) are nothing to write home about. The card is meant for Apple users, so if you aren’t, it’s probably not for you.
The unknown: What sort of credit score you need to get approved, as well as exact interest rates.
— APPLE ARCADE The good: Apple’s new game subscription service, which will launch this fall, will be free of ads and in-app purchases, which can quickly add up and have become common in mobile games. Apple promises more than 100 games, and they will be exclusive to the service, so there will be plenty of fresh adventures.
The bad: The service will only be available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple TVs. That could be frustrating for those who don’t own Apple products.
Unknown: Apple said all games would be available with one subscription, but did not say how much it would cost or when exactly the service will launch. It has partnered with a few well-known game creators, including Hironobu Sakaguchi of "Final Fantasy" fame, but it’s unclear how well all the new games will work or how fun they’ll be to play.

The collusion hall of shame

Texto completo: The news that special counsel Robert Mueller "did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government" has left a lot of people in Washington with a lot of explaining to do.
Put aside the rogues' gallery of reporters and pundits who assured us that Donald Trump had conspired with Vladimir Putin to steal the presidency. What is most insidious are those who did have access to classified intelligence and led Americans to believe that they had seen what we could not: actual evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.
Recall that in 2016, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., released a letter to FBI Director James Comey claiming the FBI had proof of Trump-Russia collusion. "In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government," Reid declared. When asked what information Reid was referring to, a spokesman said, "There have been classified briefings on this topic. That is all I can say."
Trump has called for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to resign. He is absolutely correct. Schiff repeatedly said that his committee had dug up "plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy." In March 2017, he said on "Meet the Press," "I can't go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now" and last May he told ABC that Trump's Russia conspiracy is of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate."
Schiff is a disgrace. But he is not alone. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "In our investigation, we saw strong evidence of collusion" and declared Trump an agent "working on behalf of the Russians." House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., claimed, "It's clear that the campaign colluded, and there's a lot of evidence of that." Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Judiciary Committee, assured us last year that "the evidence is pretty clear that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians." Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "There is no longer a question of whether this campaign sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America's democracy." And recently, the committee's vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., declared that "enormous amounts of evidence" exist of collusion between Trump and Russia and that "there's no one that could factually say there's not plenty of evidence of collaboration or communications between Trump Organization and Russians." Except for Mueller, of course.
These comments by people with access to intelligence were shameful. But the most sinister of all is John Brennan, who used his authority as former CIA director to suggest that Trump was a traitor and a compromised Russian asset. After Trump's Helsinki summit, Brennan declared "he is wholly in the pocket of Putin." When challenged by Chuck Todd on "Meet the Press," Brennan stood by his assessment. "I called [Trump's] behavior treasonous, which is to betray one's trust and aid and abet the enemy, and I stand very much by that claim."
This month, MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell told Brennan this investigation was "developing while you were still on the job" and asked, "Did you see enough at that stage to believe ... that that would result in indictments?" Brennan replied, "I thought at the time there was going to be individuals who were going to have issues with the Department of Justice. Yes." In a New York Times op-ed, he wrote that "Trump's claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash." Now, Brennan feigns contrition. "I don't know if I received bad information, but I think I suspected there was more than there actually was," he said, adding, "I am relieved that it's been determined there was not a criminal conspiracy with the Russian government over our election."
Hogwash. He wanted it to be true, and he relied on his CIA credentials to convince Americans that it was. That is a violation of the public trust. Trump was right to revoke Brennan's security clearance. He is among the worst of the worst, the Trump-Russia collusion hall of shame. We have long since passed the point where Americans expect objectivity from the press. But we should hold our elected and appointed officials handling sensitive national security issues to a higher standard.

Mueller report: Collusion by media, not Trump

Texto completo: The mountain has labored and brought forth a mouse. After two years of hype, special counsel Robert Mueller has reported to Attorney General William Barr that there was no "collusion," as Donald Trump would put it, between Trump or the Trump presidential campaign and the Russians regarding the 2016 election.
There will be no new indictments from Mueller beyond the few already issued, none of which charges a U.S. person with anything related to collusion. This is a big disappointment to the people in politics and the press who were openly hoping to see Trump, and his family, kicked out of the White House and thrown into jail.
And there were a lot of those people, as Grabien editor Tom Elliott noted last week:
In December 2017, MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski said the Trump team might be going to jail "for the rest of their lives."
Last December, CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Delaware Sen. Chris Coons – as he often does – whether he thought Trump might be facing jail time. Coons said yes, "the issues outlined against both Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, I think, continue to sharpen the ways in which it is clear that the Mueller investigation has produced a whole series of actions not previously exposed to the public."
Also in December, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Trump could be the first president "to face the real prospect of jail time."
In April 2017, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said the evidence he had already seen suggested "people will probably go to jail."
Actually, it was always a crock, dreamed up immediately after Hillary Clinton's election-night defeat by her staff to explain away failure. As reported in the campaign book "Shattered," by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, Clinton refused to take responsibility for her defeat, and the day after her concession, top officials gathered "to engineer the case that the election wasn't entirely on the up-and-up. ... Already, Russian hacking was the centerpiece of the argument."
Though this was a matter of record – the book was hardly obscure – the news media chose to run with the Russia story, which quickly morphed from "hacking" to the more nebulous "collusion," quite credulously. They did so because they wanted it to be true, because they hoped it would hurt Trump, whom the press almost universally despises, and because it was good for ratings and clicks.
The irony, of course, is that while purporting to worry about Russian interference in American politics, by advancing this story the press was actually doing the work of President Vladimir Putin, sowing division and confusion through the American polity.
As former Clinton pollster Mark Penn tweeted, we wasted two years, at least $30million and a lot of institutional credibility at the FBI and Department of Justice over "a false story of Russia collusion based on oppo research that was always unsubstantiated and preposterous."
Liberal journalist Matt Taibbi was even harsher, calling the Russia-collusion story WMD times a million. Taibbi noted that the news media's credibility is a major victim:
Nothing Trump is accused of from now on by the press will be believed by huge chunks of the population, a group that (perhaps thanks to this story) is now larger than his original base. As (New York Times' Peter) Baker notes, a full 50.3percent of respondents in a poll conducted this month said they agree with Trump the Mueller probe is a "witch hunt."
Well, that's because it was. Leftist journalist Glenn Greenwald administered a Twitter beat-down to some of his colleagues in the news media, saying: "If you constantly went on TV or wrote things to mislead millions into believing Mueller was coming to arrest Trump, Jr., Jared and a whole slew of others for conspiring with the Russians, just admit it. Save yourselves the embarrassment of all this whitewashing & pretending."
Don't expect any such apologies.
We might someday need a press we can trust. But I hope not, because we certainly don't have one.
So what's next? Well, there may not have been Russian collusion, but there certainly was collusion between FBI agents and journalists, with agents leaking information and journalists paying them off with "tickets to sporting events, golfing outings, drinks and meals, and admittance to nonpublic social events," according to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice.
And the connections between the Justice Department and the political opposition-research firm Fusion GPS (where the wife of senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr was paid to dig up dirt on Trump) were particularly egregious.
Roger Simon of of PJ Media writes that there is a lot of corruption yet to be investigated and prosecuted, on the part of Trump's accusers: "It was a conspiracy and, worse yet, a conspiracy ignited and carried out from within the FBI and the Department of Justice. Nothing could be more dangerous to a democratic society than that. How high this conspiracy went is still somewhat unclear. I say 'somewhat' because the likelihood of it having reached into the White House of the previous administration is great. It's hard to imagine how it could have happened otherwise."
Will we see any accountability for the many ethical – and probably legal – breaches involving Trump's bureaucratic opposition? Stay tuned. But the "Russian collusion" narrative has now imploded.

Texto completo: JERUSALEM -- When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sat down for an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network in a hotel in Jerusalem earlier this month, he made a remark that was perhaps the most revelatory of any in his nearly one year in office.
An evangelical Christian, Mr. Pompeo had just returned from tours of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, built on the ground where Jesus is said to have been crucified and buried, and of tunnels beneath the Western Wall, by the holiest site in Judaism. The interviewer posed a question around a biblical tale about a queen who saved Jews from slaughter by a Persian official: Did Mr. Pompeo think President Trump had been "raised for such a time as this, just like Queen Esther, to help save the Jewish people from the Iranian menace?"
"As a Christian, I certainly believe that's possible," Mr. Pompeo said. "It was remarkable -- so we were down in the tunnels where we could see 3,000 years ago, and 2,000 years ago, if I have the history just right -- to see the remarkable history of the faith in this place, and the work that our administration's done, to make sure that this democracy in the Middle East, that this Jewish state, remains. I am confident that the Lord is at work here."
White evangelical Christians are a powerful force in the Republican Party. Vice President Mike Pence is a staunch believer and former President George W. Bush is an adherent, too.
But no secretary of state in recent decades has been as open and fervent as Mr. Pompeo about discussing Christianity and foreign policy in the same breath. That has increasingly raised questions about the extent to which evangelical beliefs are influencing American diplomacy.
On Monday, in a speech at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel group, Mr. Pompeo told an anecdote about Tibor Baranski, a Christian who saved 3,000 Jews in Hungary during World War II. Then he said, "As secretary of state and as a Christian, I'm proud to lead American diplomacy to support Israel's right to defend itself."
The next day, Mr. Pompeo announced an expansion of Trump administration anti-abortion policies, saying the United States would stop funding foreign organizations that support other groups that perform abortions. It is a policy popular with conservatives, Catholics and evangelical Christians.
Though Mr. Trump is secular, white evangelicals are a big part of his voter base, and some of his major foreign policy moves, planned or supported by Mr. Pompeo, are intended to shore up political support.
The most notable examples involve Israel. When Mr. Trump moved the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, evangelicals applauded.
Studies show that white evangelicals are much more likely than other Americans to believe that Israel fulfills a biblical prophecy. Known as Christian Zionists, they believe God promised the land to the Jews, and that the gathering of Jews in Israel is foretold in the prophecy of the rapture -- the ascent of Christians into the kingdom of God.
Mr. Pompeo talks about the rapture. "We will continue to fight these battles," he said at a "God and Country Rally" in 2015, because there is a "never-ending struggle" until "the rapture."
"Be part of it," he said at the meeting, at the Summit church in Wichita, Kan. "Be in the fight."
In November, Mr. Pompeo told a reporter for The New York Times Magazine that the Bible "informs everything I do." The reporter noticed an open Bible in his office, with a Swiss Army knife marking his place at the end of the book of Queen Esther.
Mr. Pompeo, 55, became a devoted Christian at West Point, where he joined a Bible study group. After moving to Kansas, he joined the Eastminster Presbyterian Church in Wichita, which is affiliated with the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, a relatively conservative denomination.
The State Department did not respond to questions about the intersection of Mr. Pompeo's Christian beliefs and policy.
American evangelicals who supported Mr. Trump's embassy move might also approve if Israel annexes part or all of the West Bank. After Mr. Trump formally recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights in a meeting on Monday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, many conservative Israelis said they are hopeful that annexing part of the West Bank will be next.
Then there is the question of what an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, as drawn up by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's adviser and son-in-law, will recommend for the disputed territories of Jerusalem and the West Bank.
Martin Indyk, a former assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs, noted the evangelical influence on the Trump administration in saying he doubted that the peace plan would propose ceding any Israeli-occupied territory in the West Bank to Palestinians. Nor was it likely to provide a route to Palestinian sovereignty, Mr. Indyk said.
"In the view of evangelicals, that is the land that God gave to the Jews," he said. "They're strongly opposed to any territorial concession there. If there is any of that in the plan, I think there will be strong evangelical opposition to it."
Mr. Trump's decision in December 2017 to move the American Embassy was intended to please evangelical voters in the United States, as well as some Jews. Mr. Netanyahu has embraced evangelical support for his right-wing policies, and sees evangelicals as more reliable American allies of Israel than liberal American Jews.
An evangelical pastor, Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Dallas, gave an opening prayer at the embassy building's dedication ceremony in May. His presence made many Israelis uncomfortable; he has said Jews, Muslims and Mormons are bound for hell. In 2017, during a conference call of Mr. Trump's top evangelical supporters, Mr. Jeffress led a prayer for the protection of Mr. Pompeo, then C.I.A. director, and thanked God for putting him in the job.
Mr. Pompeo has gotten rid of a diplomatic consulate in Jerusalem for Palestinians and merged its work into the new embassy.
Elsewhere in the Middle East, Mr. Pompeo also has broadcast his Christian beliefs. At the start of a January speech in Cairo, Mr. Pompeo said the trip was "especially meaningful" for him "as an evangelical Christian, coming so soon after the Coptic Church's Christmas celebrations."
He added, "In my office, I keep a Bible open on my desk to remind me of God and his word, and the truth."
Observers found it remarkable that Mr. Pompeo would open a speech in a majority-Muslim country by highlighting his Christianity. And some critics have pointed out that Mr. Pompeo, before becoming secretary, made us-versus-them statements about Christians and Muslims while talking about terrorism and war.
At Mr. Pompeo's confirmation hearing in April 2018, Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, asked him about his ties to prominent anti-Islam activists. Mr. Pompeo acknowledged the ties but said he had a strong record "with respect to tolerance and the equal treatment of people."
When Mr. Pompeo traveled to Lebanon after his recent stop in Israel, he toured a church and a Crusader citadel and talked with a bishop about religious freedom, one of his favorite themes. He plans to host a second conference on religious freedom at the State Department in July.
Mr. Pompeo has made Iran a signature issue, blaming it for stirring unrest in the Middle East. He reliably calls the country by its full name -- the Islamic Republic of Iran -- to highlight its religious identity.
Last year, Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Pence led an extraordinary campaign to pressure President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a proponent of political Islam, to release an American evangelical pastor, Andrew Brunson, who was arrested in 2016.
But Mr. Pompeo, citing the mission of religious freedom, has also defended the rights of Muslims oppressed by some Asian nations.
He has criticized Myanmar for its ethnic cleansing of Rohingya, though he has declined to describe it as genocide. And Mr. Pompeo has denounced China for its detentions of one million or more Muslims.
Hours before leaving for Kuwait, Israel and Lebanon, Mr. Pompeo hosted an on-the-record conference call with just "faith-based media," barring journalists who regularly cover the State Department.
Though widely criticized for the move, Mr. Pompeo and the State Department have refused to say who was on the call or release a transcript.
Representative Susan Wild, Democrat of Pennsylvania, told Mr. Pompeo during a House hearing on Wednesday that his action "raises concerns about First Amendment violations."
Mr. Pompeo said it was "no different" than giving selective interviews. He added, "I am confident I will do so again."

Saudis Hacked Bezos' Phone, Security Expert Claims

Texto completo: SEATTLE -- Jeff Bezos's security consultant accused the Saudi government of gaining unauthorized access to the Amazon chief executive's phone, as part of an effort to harm the world's richest man.
In an opinion article in The Daily Beast on Saturday, Gavin de Becker, Mr. Bezos's security chief, alleged the Saudis wanted to hurt Mr. Bezos because he owns The Washington Post. The Post has aggressively reported on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, one of its columnists, who was killed last year in Turkey. United States officials have concluded Mr. Khashoggi, who was critical of Saudi leaders, was killed on the orders of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.
Mr. de Becker said he had turned over his findings about the Saudis and their role against Mr. Bezos to law enforcement.
"Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos' phone, and gained private information," Mr. de Becker wrote.
Mr. de Becker's claims about the Saudis are difficult to verify and raise many questions. Throughout his article, the security consultant was vague on details. He did not reveal direct evidence of his accusations and wrote that he would not speak again publicly on the issue.
Amazon did not immediately have a comment about Mr. Bezos. An official with the Saudi embassy in Washington declined to comment on Saturday.
Mr. de Becker's allegations are the latest twist in a bizarre situation that has embroiled the largest U.S. tabloid publisher and Mr. Bezos, who runs Amazon and owns The Post. The unusual set of circumstances began in January, when Mr. Bezos announced that he and his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, were divorcing. The next day, The National Enquirer published an exposé revealing that Mr. Bezos was romantically involved with Lauren Sanchez, a former Los Angeles TV anchor.
Then in February, Mr. Bezos published a post on Medium accusing the parent of The Enquirer, American Media Inc., of "extortion and blackmail." Mr. Bezos said AMI had threatened to publish graphic photographs of him, including a "below-the-belt selfie," if he did not publicly affirm that The Enquirer's reporting on his affair was not motivated by political concerns. He said AMI, which has had ties to the Saudis, was "apoplectic" about The Post's reporting on the Saudis.
Mr. Bezos added that he had asked Mr. de Becker, his longtime security consultant, to investigate who had leaked information and photos about him.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that two people with direct knowledge of The Enquirer's reporting said that everything the tabloid received on Mr. Bezos's affair, including the "below-the-belt selfie," came from a single source. The Wall Street Journal later reported that AMI had paid Ms. Sanchez's brother, Michael Sanchez, $ 200,000 for the texts.
But Mr. de Becker on Saturday said that the effort against Mr. Bezos went beyond Mr. Sanchez and also involved the Saudis. Mr. de Becker pointed to an article published on Saturday by The New York Post in which Mr. Sanchez said The Enquirer "had seen text exchanges between the secret couple" before he was in touch with the tabloid on the matter.
"Reality is complicated, and can't always be boiled down to a simple narrative like 'the brother did it,"' Mr. de Becker wrote.
He did not say whether the Saudis provided any of Mr. Bezos's personal information from the phone to AMI.
"As of today, it is unclear to what degree, if any, AMI was aware of the details," Mr. de Becker wrote.
Mr. de Becker said his investigation included interviews with cybersecurity experts and "people who personally know the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman." But he stopped short of saying what methods he believed the Saudis may have used to access Mr. Bezos's personal information.
He added that AMI had wanted him to make a public statement "saying that my investigation had concluded they hadn't relied upon 'any form of electronic eavesdropping or hacking in their news-gathering process,"' and that the tabloid's story was not "instigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or otherwise."
Mr. de Becker said he told AMI in a recorded call that those claims were "not my truth."
AMI declined to comment.

Texto completo: A New York City woman sued TGI Friday's Inc. on Wednesday, claiming the company had engaged in deceptive advertising practices by selling potato skins snacks that do not contain any potato skins.
The proposed class action suit filed by Solange Troncoso claims that the bagged snacks are appealing to some consumers because of the perceived health benefits of potato skins. The lawsuit also claims that those skins are discarded during the manufacturing process of the snacks.
Rather than potato skins, the products contain “potato flakes” and “potato starch,” the lawsuit claims, citing the products' ingredients list. It goes on to allege that in the industrial creation of potato flakes and potato starch, potatoes are peeled.

March 26: $125 million lawsuit filed against Weather Channel for 'horrific' crash that killed 3 during a 2017 tornado chase
The lawsuit claims that the "potato skins" branding attempts to capitalize on health-conscious consumers. "This labeling deceives consumers into believing that they are receiving a healthier snack, but Defendant’s products do not live up to these claims," the lawsuit reads.
Troncoso filed the lawsuit after buying a $1. 99 bag of TGI Fridays Sour Cream & Onion Potato Skins chips from a Bronx convenience store in June 2018, the lawsuit says.
A USA TODAY request for comment from TGI Fridays was not immediately returned on Friday evening.
A similar lawsuit against the makers of Poland Spring water was allowed to move forward this week, the New York Times reports. That lawsuit contends that the water, which markets itself as “100% Natural Spring Water,” does not contain water from a spring.

Texto completo: La Cruz Roja anunció este viernes que distribuirá la ayuda humanitaria destinada para Venezuela, luego de que el mandatario Nicolás Maduro aceptara la intervención de este organismo internacional para aliviar la crisis humanitaria, que hasta ahora se ha negado a reconocer oficialmente.
Según reportó el diario The New York Times, Maduro autorizó a la Cruz Roja para que reparta toneladas de ayuda humanitaria que se destinarán a unos 650,000 venezolanos durante los próximos meses.
“Estimamos que en un plazo de aproximadamente 15 días estaremos preparados para brindar la ayuda”, dijo Francesco Rocca, presidente de la Federación Internacional de la Cruz Roja.
La Cruz Roja destacó que se trataba de “una labor técnica”, que no debía ser utilizada como munición política en la disputa por el poder entre el presidente interino Juan Guaidó y el mandatario Nicolás Maduro.
El enviado especial de Estados Unidos a Venezuela, Elliot Abrams, dijo a la agencia de noticias EFE que estaba contento de ceder a un “instrumento fiable” las toneladas de ayuda estadounidense que actualmente se encuentran almacenadas en Cúcuta, Colombia.
“Estaríamos felices de hacerlo, si hubiera un instrumento fiable para distribuir la ayuda, puede ser la Cruz Roja, la Iglesia, Cáritas, que le den la ayuda a la gente que la necesita sin ninguna base política, entonces estaríamos felices de hacerlo por ese canal”, dijo Abrams.
Anteriormente, Guaidó había intentado sin éxito introducir la ayuda a Venezuela, pero la oposición de los militares leales a Maduro y de grupos armados afines a su Gobierno imposibilitó su traslado.
“Estamos abiertos a todas las donaciones”, dijo Rocca. “Estamos dispuestos a negociar con cualquiera”, añadió.
Guaidó aplaudió de inmediato el anuncio de la Cruz Roja, en lo que pareció una inevitable politización de la medida.
“Esto es resultado de nuestra presión e insistencia. La lucha por el bien de todos da frutos”, dijo el presidente interino.
Guaidó y Maduro se disputan la presidencia del país desde que Guaidó se autoproclamó como el mandatario legítimo, según las disposiciones constitucionales, y más de 50 países lo reconocieron.
Luego Guaidó intentó llevar alimentos y medicinas para aliviar las necesidades de la población, sin embargo, el gobierno de Maduro negó que hubiera una crisis humanitaria en Venezuela.
Desde entonces Maduro ha recibido cargamentos con suministros provenientes de China y Rusia, mientras que Guaidó hizo lo mismo con ayuda enviada por Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea.

Texto completo: A rapidly spreading fungus is threatening frogs everywhere, causing mass amphibian die-offs, according to a new study.
The study published online Friday in the peer-reviewed journal Science calls the loss from chytridiomycosis "catastrophic," saying the disease has "caused death and species extinction at a global scale. " At least 501 amphibian species have died over the past 50 years, including 90 that are presumed extinct, the study says.
Chytridiomycosis is caused by two fungal species that likely originated in Asia, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (discovered in 1998) and B. salamandrivorans (discovered in 2013). When contracted, the disease can eat away at skin. It's been known to kill frogs for decades now, but recently its spread has caused global alarm.
Study authors say the outbreak is contributing to "the Earth's sixth mass extinction. " Deaths have been most extreme in wet climates of the Americas and Australia, peaking in the 1980s. Just 12 percent of the declined species are showing signs of recovery, the study notes, as 39 percent continue to decline.
More: More than 40 percent of insect species declining, could have 'catastrophic' results, study says
Wendy Palen, a biologist at Simon Fraser University who is a co-author of a commentary accompanying the study, called the fungus associated with the disease "the most deadly pathogen known to science," The New York Times reports.
Researchers are calling for new research and monitoring to stop the spread of the pathogen, and save at-risk species.

Texto completo: 'Empresses of China's Forbidden City, 1644-1912' When this exhibition on China's Qing Dynasty empresses opened at Massachusetts's Peabody Essex Museum last year, the New York Times called the show "huge and opulent," but also "gratifyingly rigorous." Now coming to the District, the show includes a pair of pearl-bedecked platform boots that "would not have been out of place on 'Soul Train,' " according to the Times. Beyond such eye-popping fashion items, "Empresses" also offers insight into changing female power dynamics. One of the show's subjects - the dowager empress Cixi (1835-1908) - rose much further than many other wives (who were, despite their high status, considered the emperor's property). After her husband's death in 1861, Cixi effectively ruled China as regent for 47 years. On opening day, museum festivities will include live performances, food to sample from imperial court recipes, kite-flying and art-making activities.
When: Saturday through June 23.
Where: Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, 1050 Independence Ave. SW. asia.si.edu
Admission: Free.
Cherry Blast Cherry blossom season is full of parties, and one of the liveliest each year is Cherry Blast. Previous incarnations have centered on sumo wrestlers and anime, but this year's fest will turn the theater at MGM National Harbor into a photogenic secret garden. The party starts at 7 p.m. with an hour-long open bar, and entertainment includes CeeLo Green, DJs and Japanese cultural performances. VIP tickets ($100) offer up to four hours of open bar and a buffet.
When: Saturday at 7 p.m.
Where: MGM National Harbor, 101 MGM National Ave., Oxon Hill. nationalcherryblossomfestival.org
Tickets: $25.
'Voyagers' Each planet has its own personality and sound in composer Gustav Holst's masterwork "The Planets." Now D.C.-based Company E adds movement to Holst's orchestral suite with the premiere of "Voyagers: A Dance Among the Planets." This show, created for young theatergoers (5 and older), blasts off for a spin around the solar system, with dancers interpreting Mars and Mercury against a backdrop of images and video from NASA. Composer Eric Shimelonis's arrangement of Holst's music will be played live in this mash-up of astronomy and art. (A sensory-friendly performance will take place March 31.)
When: Friday through March 31. Times vary.
Where: Kennedy Center, 2700 F St. NW. kennedy-center.org.
Tickets: $20.
'The Peculiar Patriot' Mass incarceration is the subject of Liza Jessie Peterson's solo show "The Peculiar Patriot," which is headed to D.C. after premiering at New York's National Black Theatre in 2017. Woolly Mammoth is just the latest stop for Peterson's play; it's been staged at more than 35 penitentiaries across the country. The show takes place in a prison visiting room as Peterson's character meets up with an incarcerated friend.
When: Monday through April 20. Times vary.
Where: Woolly Mammoth, 641 D St. NW. woollymammoth.net.
Tickets: $20-$69.

D.C. Underground Comedy Festival In recent years, the capital has been home to some quality comedy festivals - Bentzen Ball, D.C. Comedy Festival among others - but check out the remaining shows from homegrown organizers Underground Comedy. The group hosts weekly shows and open mics around town, and for this year's festival, they're highlighting a mix of national and local names. Friday night will feature a doubleheader at Dupont's the Big Hunt, with D.C.-based Paris Sashay at 8 p.m., and Mia Jackson, who has appeared on "Last Comic Standing," at 9:45 p.m. Closing out the festival at Black Cat will be comedians Nick Mullen, Stavros Halkias and Adam Friedland. The trio got their start around the District but have gone on to success in New York with a popular podcast (which has an unprintable name). They'll do a standup set at 8 p.m. and a podcast taping afterward, but get your tickets soon. Their last appearance at the venerable club sold out.
When: Friday and Saturday. Times vary.

HOPE BEYOND REACH

Texto completo: Lucas was 5 before his parents, Bill and Marci Barton of Grand Haven, Michigan, finally got an explanation for his difficulties standing up or climbing stairs. The diagnosis: muscular dystrophy.
Bill Barton turned to Google.
“The first thing I read was, ‘no cure, in a wheelchair in their teens, pass in their 20s,’ ” Bill Barton said. “I stopped. I couldn’t read any more. I couldn’t handle it.”
Then he found a reason to hope. For the first time ever, there are clinical trials - nearly two dozen - testing treatments that might actually stop the disease. The problem, though, as Bill Barton soon discovered, is that the enrollment criteria are so restrictive that, in the end, very few children qualify.
As a result, parents like the Bartons, clinging to the hope that an experimental drug might help, often are turned away.
“There is so much hope, but it’s not for them,” said Kristin Stephenson, vice president for policy and advocacy at the Muscular Dystrophy Association in Chicago.
Even for the parents whose lucky child qualifies, good news may be followed by agonizing, life-or-death choices. What treatments seem most promising? Should he be enrolled in a trial with a placebo arm?
Should he be placed in a less risky study that aims to slow the progress of the disease but will not stop it? Should the parents take their chances with a trial now - or wait a year or two, as their child’s condition worsens, until something better comes along?
Often there is no easy way to decide.
“We talk to families every day,” said Debra Miller, who founded the advocacy group Cure Duchenne after her son was found to have the disease. “So many times they are looking at us and saying, ‘What do I do?’ ”
To help, her group has constructed detailed decision trees and leads families through them. Miller’s son, who is 22, does not qualify for the new clinical trials.
Ryan and Brooke Saalman know hard it can be to know what to do. “We did a lot of praying,” said Brooke Saalman, mother of two boys with Duchenne in Columbus, Georgia.
They decided to enroll their oldest son, Jacob, 6, in a trial of a highly experimental drug. The trial requires weekly infusions at a site 100 miles from their home. He is one of the first boys to be treated.
The investigators are testing a strategy called exon skipping: putting a molecular bandage over a tiny mutation in a large gene. The Saalmans also considered a gene-therapy trial, in which scientists were attempting to insert a new gene that makes dystrophin.
But they discovered that gene therapy may be irreversible. And if it didn’t work, Jacob would be ineligible for an even more promising approach in the future: gene editing, to snip out the deadly mutation that causes Duchenne, an effort now in preclinical development.
Gene therapy and gene editing both depend on a disabled cold virus to deliver the treatment. Once exposed to that virus, the body makes antibodies to it. Essentially, patients like Jacob get one shot at genetic modification.
The Saalmans made a different decision for their younger son, Hudson, 2. He was offered a spot in two trials by companies that will accept younger boys.
The Saalmans could not decide what to do. Hudson’s disease is steadily progressing; muscle that he loses now is gone forever.
But they finally made the difficult decision to wait.
Hudson is still very young. If they wait, the Saalmans concluded, researchers will have learned more. Other trials are bound to begin.
About 15 out of every 100,000 males age 5 to 24 have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common kind. They all lack a functioning dystrophin gene, which is on the X chromosome, transmitted to boys by their mothers.
Without dystrophin - a protein that is important for maintaining the membrane of muscle cells - muscles atrophy. Patients usually lose the ability to walk by age 12, and die in their 20s.
According to Stephenson, of the MDA, drug trials are seeking 2,500 patients. But most only want to enroll boys between the ages of 4 and 7 who are affected by the disease but not yet too debilitated, and who meet other clinical criteria, such as having a mutation in the right place in the dystrophin gene.
The trials usually require functional tests, including one that measures how far a boy can walk in six minutes or how quickly he can get up from lying flat.
For many, the criteria are just too stringent. “There are not enough patients,” Miller said. “It will be difficult to fill all these clinical trials.”
The Bartons found out about a gene-therapy trial at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, testing a treatment by Sarepta Therapeutics.
They watched a miraculous video of a little boy struggling to walk up a flight of stairs before treatment - and then doing it easily afterward.
“This was what we were hoping for,” Bill Barton said.
Lucas was the right age, and he seemed to qualify. But testing showed that he carries antibodies to the virus used to deliver the treatment. It would not work for him.
The Bartons were drained, devastated. And for now, there is no other trial that Lucas qualifies for.
“I had put my hopes into this,” Bill Barton said. “It was the miracle.”
Dr. Jeffrey Bigelow, a neurologist, and his wife, Alexis Bigelow, of Millcreek, Utah, hoped against hope that their son Henri, 8, would qualify for the only gene therapy trial that will accept boys his age.
Then the Bigelows found out that boys Henri’s age have to be able to lie down and then stand up with their hands at their sides in less than 10 seconds.
It took Henri 10 seconds to do that last spring, when he was evaluated for another trial. Now it would probably take him 20 seconds, his father said.
“It feels like Henri is being punished for losing the ability to stand up from the ground too soon,” Jeffrey Bigelow said.
He also worries about older boys with Duchenne who are lucky enough to still walk. They are shut out from the trial because they are not yet in wheelchairs. And other trials won’t accept boys that old.
“These are boys who, like Henri, desperately need the treatment, and if they don’t get it in the next one to two years, likely will be confined to a wheelchair, to never walk again,” Jeffrey Bigelow said.
“This just feels unjust.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The news that special counsel Robert Mueller "did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government" has left a lot of people in Washington with a lot of explaining to do.
Put aside the rogues' gallery of reporters and pundits who assured us that Donald Trump had conspired with Vladimir Putin to steal the presidency. What is most insidious are those who did have access to classified intelligence and led Americans to believe that they had seen what we could not: actual evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.
Recall that in 2016, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., released a letter to FBI Director James Comey claiming the FBI had proof of Trump-Russia collusion. "In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government," Reid declared. When asked what information Reid was referring to, a spokesman said, "There have been classified briefings on this topic. That is all I can say."
Trump has called for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to resign. He is absolutely correct. Schiff repeatedly said that his committee had dug up "plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy." In March 2017, he said on "Meet the Press," "I can't go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now" and last May he told ABC that Trump's Russia conspiracy is of "a size and scope probably beyond Watergate."
Schiff is a disgrace. But he is not alone. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "In our investigation, we saw strong evidence of collusion" and declared Trump an agent "working on behalf of the Russians." House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., claimed, "It's clear that the campaign colluded, and there's a lot of evidence of that." Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Judiciary Committee, assured us last year that "the evidence is pretty clear that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians." Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said, "There is no longer a question of whether this campaign sought to collude with a hostile foreign power to subvert America's democracy." And recently, the committee's vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., declared that "enormous amounts of evidence" exist of collusion between Trump and Russia and that "there's no one that could factually say there's not plenty of evidence of collaboration or communications between Trump Organization and Russians." Except for Mueller, of course.
These comments by people with access to intelligence were shameful. But the most sinister of all is John Brennan, who used his authority as former CIA director to suggest that Trump was a traitor and a compromised Russian asset. After Trump's Helsinki summit, Brennan declared "he is wholly in the pocket of Putin." When challenged by Chuck Todd on "Meet the Press," Brennan stood by his assessment. "I called (Trump's) behavior treasonous, which is to betray one's trust and aid and abet the enemy, and I stand very much by that claim."
This month, MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell told Brennan this investigation was "developing while you were still on the job" and asked, "Did you see enough at that stage to believe ... that that would result in indictments?" Brennan replied, "I thought at the time there was going to be individuals who were going to have issues with the Department of Justice. Yes." In a New York Times op-ed, he wrote that "Trump's claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash." Now, Brennan feigns contrition. "I don't know if I received bad information, but I think I suspected there was more than there actually was," he said, adding, "I am relieved that it's been determined there was not a criminal conspiracy with the Russian government over our election."
Hogwash. He wanted it to be true, and he relied on his CIA credentials to convince Americans that it was. That is a violation of the public trust. Trump was right to revoke Brennan's security clearance. He is among the worst of the worst, the Trump-Russia collusion hall of shame. We have long since passed the point where Americans expect objectivity from the press. But we should hold our elected and appointed officials handling sensitive national security issues to a higher standard.

Texto completo: THURSDAY
Tuareg guitar hero
Mdou Moctar, a guitarist from a small village in central Niger who built his first guitar, performs at the Andy Warhol Museum, North Side, touring behind the new album "Ilana (The Creator)," which blends Western blues and rock with West African rhythms.
Stereogum said of "Ilana" that it "rips as hard as you'd hope, but often with a playful brightness that has been lost in much of the Western rock scene."
Of note, the guitarist wrote and starred in the first-ever Tuareg language film, 2015's "Rain the Color Blue with a Little Red In It," a Saharan remake of Prince's "Purple Rain."
It's at 8 p.m. in the entrance space. Tickets are $15; $12 members/students; warhol.org.
Nazi Hunter
The North American tour of the off-Broadway production "Wiesenthal: Nazi Hunter" has interrupted its tour for three performances at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Downtown, to raise funds for Tree of Life. This is the final night in Pittsburgh.
Playwright Tom Dugan performs the title role of this one-man show that tells the true story of the man --nicknamed the "Jewish James Bond" - who survived the Holocaust, then devoted his life to bringing more than 1,100 Nazi war criminals to justice.
It's at 7:30 p.m. Tickets start at $35; TrustArts.org.

More than 350 dealers will be buying and selling rare coins, paper money, gold and silver daily, and many of the experts will provide free informal appraisals of the public's old coins and paper money. There will be free educational seminars and a children's treasure trivia game.

The show is 7 p.m. Tickets are $12; trustarts.org.
CureRockers
New Jersey indie-pop band Young Rising Sons headlines the eighth annual CureRock, a concert that benefits programs that fight cancer in children, adolescents and young adults undergoing treatment in Pittsburgh.

Among the highlights will be a 9-foot-tall topiary peacock in the South Conservatory, the sound of chirping chicks accompanying bird-themed plants in the Sunken Garden, interactive fountain and kaleidoscopes, supersized sculptures showing flowers through the eyes of bees and butterflies, and the rare spectacle of Himalayan blue poppies.

Texto completo: ALGONA, Iowa -- For nearly two decades, Representative Steve King pummeled Republican primary challengers, dispatched Democrats, even a former Iowa governor's wife, and glided to victory in his conservative district. He spent little energy on fund-raising, put few controls on his racist language and made little effort to hold town halls with constituents.
Then in November he was re-elected by just 10,000 votes in what he called "the nastiest, most dishonest political gauntlet that any Iowan has been put through"; two months later he was stripped of his committee assignments and rebuked by the House for comments that seemed to endorse white supremacy. Now the nine-term Iowa Republican is under attack from both the left and the right.
Far from folding, though, Mr. King is returning to basics, reasserting an aggressive presence in his northwestern Iowa district, scheduling events in every county and holding as many as three town halls in a week, where constituents pack in, then linger to take photos and shake hands.
"This is a really important part of our civic activity," Mr. King told constituents crowded into a room in a library here in Algona, a northern town of about 5,000. "We have always done so, we just haven't always told you that."
The winds have shifted, even Republicans concede.
"Things are different than they've been before," said Craig Robinson, a former political director of the Republican Party of Iowa. "Steve King can only be so good for so long. A lot of eyes were opened when they saw just how close he came to losing that seat in the last election cycle."
Hoping to win over prominent conservatives tired of putting out Mr. King's fires, three Republicans -- widely considered the most serious challengers Mr. King has faced in years -- have already pledged to run in the 2020 primary race, including an assistant majority leader of the Iowa State Senate, Randy Feenstra, who represents one of the most conservative swaths of the district.
The campaign arm of the House Democrats has also put a target on his back, and the state Democratic Party has deployed an organizer to set up a ground game for next year, the earliest Democrats have ever begun such efforts in a district that backed President Trump by nearly 30 percentage points.
"We see him being held accountable. We really put a spotlight on something that was overlooked for a very long time," said J. D. Scholten, the Democrat who lost to Mr. King in November. "You're seeing his reaction to things where he hasn't been held in check for years."
Regardless of scrutiny, Steve King will be Steve King. Last week, he declined to answer a question at a town hall here asking whether a "white society is superior to a nonwhite society" because the query was "so hypothetical." At another town hall last week, he complained that Hurricane Katrina victims, who were mostly black, asked for help for only themselves, not their neighbors, while "Iowans take care of each other."
The Cedar Rapids Gazette issued a scathing editorial accusing Mr. King of choosing to "embarrass Iowans with inflammatory rhetoric."
For many western Iowans, that's part of his appeal.
"He's a straight talker," said Art Cullen, the Pulitzer Prize-winning editor of Mr. King's hometown newspaper, The Storm Lake Times. "He ain't afraid of the man. He ain't afraid of the system. That's powerful."
The system is clearly against him. House Republican leaders removed Mr. King from his committee assignments in January, after comments he made to The New York Times questioning why "white supremacist" was considered offensive. A number of powerful party leaders, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican, suggested he should resign, and the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution disapproving of Mr. King's statements.
Even before then, in October, the head of the House Republican campaign arm at the time, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, all but jettisoned Mr. King just a week before his election, declaring, "We must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms."
Mr. King has long made remarks denigrating immigrants, and they were long overlooked. Republican presidential candidates genuflected toward him as a kingmaker before the critical Iowa caucuses. Republican House leaders ducked and dodged rather than answer for Mr. King as he enmeshed himself in one scandal after another: retweeting a Nazi sympathizer, saying young unauthorized immigrants have "calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert," displaying a Confederate flag and adopting white nationalist language such as "we can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies."
But his close race in November signaled to members of his own party that voters' patience may be wearing thin. Mr. Feenstra announced his primary challenge a day before Mr. King's incendiary comments on white supremacy were published, then raised $100,000 in the next 10 days, according to The Des Moines Register.
"Today, Iowa's Fourth District doesn't have a voice in Washington because our current representative's caustic nature has left us without a seat at the table," Mr. Feenstra said in January.
Mr. King's younger son and spokesman, Jeff King, was quick to fire back, telling The Register that Mr. Feenstra's challenge amounted to "misguided political opportunism, fueled by establishment puppeteers" and "the lies of the left."
Republican strategists say the conservative tilt of Mr. King's district and his entrenched presence will make for an uphill battle even for conservative challengers like Mr. Feenstra. But in a presidential year, when a wide-open Democratic field and antipathy toward Mr. Trump will energize liberals, Republicans should be worried.
"There will be a lot of Republican activists who will defend him until the very end," Mr. Robinson said. "But I think when we get closer to Primary Day, people's opinion might change, because he barely held on last time, and I think it would be concerning, especially in a presidential year, that Republicans could lose this seat, which would be unfathomable."
Before 2018, the last scare Mr. King faced was in 2012, when Democrats pumped resources behind their challenger, the former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack. She mustered less than 45 percent of the vote.
This time Democrats face something of a conundrum.
Mr. Scholten, a 39-year-old former minor league baseball player, must decide whether to run again for the House or shoot higher. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, flew him to Washington to discuss challenging Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, according to Democrats familiar with the meeting.
"The dilemma I'm having right now is that Democrats won the House, and so in order for us to pass some of these things, we need to have at least one senator from the state of Iowa be a Democrat," Mr. Scholten said. "It's difficult because King is the most vulnerable he has ever been, but do we advance the things that I'm fighting for if I go back to the House seat?"
The decision may not be all Mr. Scholten's to make. Mr. Schumer and his staff have also made overtures to State Senator Liz Mathis and freshman Representative Cindy Axne -- and it is also unclear whether another breakout Democratic candidate exists in the Fourth Congressional District.
Mr. King's supporters say he has been unfairly treated by the national news media, and they praise him as a steadfast ally of agriculture and an anti-abortion crusader. Confronted with the question about white societies at the town hall meeting, Mr. King demurred. But his rambling anger ended with a proclamation of his belief that life begins at conception -- and left his questioner agreeing with him.
"Ask anyone who talked to him: Didn't you think he was kind of like your crazy uncle?" Mr. Cullen said. "Didn't you kind of like the guy when he was talking about white supremacy?"
Many will answer yes.

But Mr. King is aggressively reasserting his presence with a series of town halls, as in Charter Oak, Iowa, last week.

Kraft pleads not guilty, requests trial by jury

Texto completo: WEST PALM BEACH — New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft formally pleaded not guilty Tuesday to misdemeanor charges that he twice solicited prostitution at a Jupiter day spa in January.
Attorneys for Kraft, a part-time Palm Beach resident, filed a written notice of his plea Tuesday and waived arraignment, two days before he was scheduled to be in court for a formal reading of the charges. Court records show that Thursday’s hearing
has been canceled, and that the next hearing in the case is scheduled for April 9.
Tuesday’s filing also formally notified the court that Kraft would seek a jury trial, although cases like his rarely go that far.
In other developments in the day spa case, the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office said Tuesday that it will formally file charges today against two women accused of running a prostitution operation at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter.
Owner Hua Zhang and manager Lei Wang each face 26 counts of soliciting another to commit prostitution as well as other prostitution-related charges.
In all, 25 men including Kraft face solicitation charges connected to the Jupiter day spa.
Tuesday’s maneuvering by Kraft’s team “was very standard procedure” and doesn’t indicate “this case is going to trial,” according to West Palm Beach criminal defense attorney Barry Paul.
“There’s no telling what could be going on behind the scenes,” Paul said.
Kraft has denied any wrongdoing since the charges were first revealed last month, although on Saturday he said he was “truly sorry” for his being charged in the day spa crackdown.
Earlier this month, the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office offered Kraft and 24 other men a deal that would drop charges against them.
Terms of the deal call for the men to perform community service, pay a $5,000 fine and court costs, complete an education class about prostitution, get screened for sexually transmitted diseases and admit in court they would have been found guilty at trial. In exchange, the misdemeanor charges they are facing would be dropped.
Paul said it’s a deal most offenders will take and adds he can’t remember a single case of soliciting prostitution that ended up before a jury.
“Why on earth risk it?” Paul said. “But Kraft is in a different position because of his association with the NFL and his public persona.”
In addition to his legal trouble, Kraft could also be punished by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell regardless of whether he is convicted. The league’s personal conduct policy prohibits “conduct detrimental to the integrity and public confidence” of the NFL and adds “it is not enough simply to avoid being found guilty of a crime.”
Another part of the NFL’s policy points out that owners and management-level officials are “held to a higher standard” and can face “more significant discipline” if they violate the policy.
Jupiter police say Kraft visited Orchids of Asia Day Spa on Jan. 19 and 20 and paid spa workers to perform sex acts on him. Police say the encounters were caught on video surveillance.
“If what’s on that video is what they say is on that video, I would be very surprised if this case goes to trial,” Paul said.
The New York Times reported Tuesday that Kraft and other men accused in the case are unwilling to admit guilt because “they believe police mishandled aspects of the case,” including improperly obtaining the search warrants that allowed police to install the surveillance cameras inside the Jupiter spa.
A Jupiter arrest report released Tuesday details 26 incidents between Jan. 18 and Jan. 22 in which men came to Orchids of Asia and paid spa workers to perform sex acts on them.

Texto completo: A recent magazine cover featured a close-up profile image of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the firebrand Democratic congresswoman from New York City, darling of the far left, with these words: "Read my lips: Yes, new taxes. Lots. Big ones, too. Plus, Medicare for all. And free " One infers that meant "free tuition," but the Bloomberg Businessweek cover parodying her rhetorical style was designed to run off the bottom of the page.
The sub-headline described her as the "nightmare of the right."
Hardly, I thought. It might be just the opposite.
In a recent edition, the New York Times led its print front page with a story about the Democratic feud over Medicare for all.
"I reject the idea that single payer is impossible," Ocasio-Cortez said in the article.
But the story said that Nancy Pelosi, the shrewd Democratic Speaker of the House, is reluctant to put Democrats from Trump-friendly districts on the spot by putting Medicare for all up for a vote.
The story also quoted a Democratic congressman from the New Democratic Coalition, a moderate group. "Most people receive health care from their employer," Scott Peters of California said. "They do not want to replace it with an untested government system."
Instead, many moderates want to repair damage inflicted by Republicans on the Affordable Care Act and work within its framework to deliver on the pledge the party made in last year's campaign to improve health care.
As President Trump busies himself smearing John McCain, the deceased U.S. senator whose legacy he apparently so envies, the national press is defining the crowded Democratic presidential primary as a choice between a passionate and impatient far left and those damn boring moderates.
This rift is further exemplified on the issue of impeaching Trump. Pelosi angered many when she said recently that impeachment hearings would be "so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path."
Some on the far left howled, but a recent poll showed 86 percent of Republicans oppose impeachment hearings, so there appears little chance of actually removing Trump. Instead, the risk is that his base would only be energized for the 2020 election.
Sadly, that's what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings for the U.S. Supreme Court. Progressives regarded the Kavanaugh interrogation as fully justified, and saw him as an entitled, aged frat boy defined by allegations of sexual assault, but polls showed his grilling helped Republicans in November by enflaming the GOP base.
And yet, most of the time, it is the fire-andbrimstone left that is portrayed as courageous; moderates are squishy and pliant. Take, for example, the print sub-headline on that New York Times story about health care: "A push for bold change vs. a more cautious approach."
Wow, I'd take bold over cautious every time. The headline could have cast the choice as between the "unachievably radical" and the "potentially attainable," but those words would not have fit, literally or figuratively.
Here's the thing.
It is primarily the moderate Democrats running for president or politicians from Trumpleaning congressional districts who genuinely are the "bold" politicians. It is they who will dictate whether the Trump nightmare ends next year.
If this were a war, those Democrats would be engaged in front-line combat, fighting to convince ordinary Americans across large swaths of the country that they understand their economic and cultural anxiety and are not backing far-left policies that are unlikely to win for the foreseeable future in such a divided nation.
To extend this metaphor, one might argue that Ocasio-Cortez and many others sit safely far from the front lines; in her case, in a deep, deep blue district in the Bronx and Queens, demanding policies that threaten Pelosi's ability to maintain a fragile majority in the U.S. House.
Consider what's happening in Wisconsin.
Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is no one's idea of a far-left progressive. He was derided in the 2018 campaign as rhetorically cautious, even boring and old.
But look at him now.
He is fighting to improve health care, infrastructure and education. And, hugely, he stands in the way of unconscionable GOP gerrymandering after the next census. Evers is bringing science back to the Department of Natural Resources and endeavoring to make the state income tax system more progressive, among many other initiatives.
To do all this neat progressive stuff, he first had to win, and he knew he could only do that by running as a moderate technician, the anti-Trump both in moral compass and ego.
The far left will howl that only by energizing new generations of voters with hugely ambitious promises will Democrats prevail. But if you understand the Electoral College, you know presidential elections are decided in states across the rust belt, not in New York's boroughs or in other coastal urban areas.
I suspect the far left is unenthusiastic about presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who talks about improving the Affordable Care Act as doable and free tuition as unaffordable.
On "Meet the Press" recently, she was asked what she tells people who insist Medicare for all is the answer. "I tell them that we have had some major successes with the Affordable Care Act," she said. "We have made sure kids get on their parents' insurance until they're 26. We have stopped people from being thrown off their insurance for pre-existing conditions."
In my view, her approach is the one requiring political courage. A path of timidity, especially in a Democratic primary, would be to demand Medicare for all and free tuition.
Klobuchar and other moderate Democrats running for president will sort themselves out in months to come. Pundits will jabber incessantly about which can survive the gauntlet to occupy the moderate "lane" as the primary narrows to two or three choices. That candidate will likely be guided by a political realism and a sense of the temperament across the entire electorate, not just its fringes.
That, to me, sounds "bold."

Texto completo: "You have a president who, in my opinion, beyond a shadow of a doubt, sought to, however ham-handedly, collude with the Russian government, a foreign power, to undermine and influence our elections." - Beto O'Rourke, presidential candidate
"I think there's plenty of evidence of collusion and conspiracy in plain sight." - Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee
"I called (Trump's) behavior treasonous, which is to betray one's trust and aid and abet the enemy, and I stand very much by that claim." - John Brennan, former CIA director
"The biggest scandal in U.S. history is coming into focus. On Friday, Rachel Maddow made it clear. Donald Trump conspired with the enemy." - Rob Reiner, film director
Maybe it's time to declare a national sabbath. Maybe it's time to step back from the scandalmongering and assess who we are right now.
Democrats might approach this moment with an attitude of humility and honest self-examination. It's clear that many Democrats made grievous accusations against the president that are not supported by the evidence. It's clear that people like O'Rourke and Brennan owe Donald Trump a public apology. If you call someone a traitor and it turns out you lacked the evidence for that charge, then the only decent thing to do is apologize.
Republicans and the Sean Hannity-style Trumpians might also approach this moment with an attitude of humility and honest self-examination. For two years they've been calling the Mueller investigation a witch hunt. For two years they've been spreading the libel that there are no honest brokers in Washington. It's all a deep-state conspiracy, a swamp. They should apologize for peddling the sort of deep cynicism that undermines our country's institutions.
And what about the rest of us? What about all the hours we spent speculating about the Mueller report, fantasizing about the Trump ruin or watching and reading speculation about these things? What about the superstructure of scandal politics we have built and live in today?
The sad fact is that Watergate introduced a poison into the American body politic. Richard Nixon's downfall was just and important, but it opened up the mouthwatering possibility that you don't need to do the hard work of persuading people to join your side. Instead, you can destroy your foes all at once through scandal.
Politics since Watergate has been defined by a long string of scandals and pseudo-scandals - Iran-Contra, Whitewater, Valerie Plame, Benghazi, Solyndra, swift-boating. Politico last year compiled a list of 46 scandals that were at one time or another deemed "worse than Watergate."
The nation's underlying divides are still ideological, but we rarely fight them honestly as philosophical differences. We just accuse the other side of corruption. Politics is no longer a debate; it's an attempt to destroy lives through accusation.
The political media, especially on TV, now has a template it can apply whenever a scandal looms into view, to hook viewers into the speculative storyline. According to the Tyndall Report, the three main broadcast networks made the Russia collusion investigation the second-most-covered news event of 2018, trailing only the Kavanaugh hearings, another scandal.
All the players slip into their assigned roles. Straight reporters are doing good, hard work. But the flow of information is not fast enough to keep up with 24/7 programming, so you get this toxic deluge of raw speculation.
The accused's political opponents assume maximum guilt. Imaginative pundits take a few dots of information and connect them to vast, if speculative, constellations of guilt. "I hear the indictments are coming down next week," they whisper to one another.
Members of the accused's party attack the investigators themselves. They get to enjoy their own sense of spiritual superiority when it turns out the scandal is much smaller than it appeared, which is almost always the case.
It's all a wonderful game. You don't have to know anything about a boring policy subject like economics, poverty or foreign affairs. You can have a long career in politics and media by simply treating public life as an arena of life-or-death gossip.
Since Watergate launched this Age of Investigation, government has become much more transparent. As a result, public trust in institutions has plummeted. The scandal culture hasn't ultimately helped one party over the other. It's just spread a corrosive cynicism that has disabled government altogether.
The ray of hope is that out on the campaign trail voters rarely ask about the scandals du jour, which obsess the cognoscenti. Most of the Democratic presidential candidates spent the past few months trying not to talk about Russian collusion. They have found a vein of voters who would rather focus on the substance of our historical moment: How do you provide affordable health security? Is China a mortal foe?
The Democrats won the 2018 midterms by focusing on the issues, not collusion. For most voters, politics is about their lives, not a self-righteous TV show.

Texto completo: Valley News Columnist
William Moyers has never spent time behind bars — unless you count one night in a police station holding cell 40 years ago — but he still can relate to what many residents of Hartford Dismas House go through.
Drugs and alcohol were Moyers’ demons for 20 years. Dismas, the nonprofit organization that provides affordable housing in a group setting for people just out of prison, has no shortage of residents — past and present — who have battled substance use disorders. It’s often what landed them in prison in the first place and prevents them from staying out of trouble.
Moyers will be the keynote speaker at Hartford Dismas House’s annual fundraising dinner on April 14 at Hilton Garden Inn in Lebanon.
For baby boomers, like myself, the name William Moyers has a familiar ring. His father, Bill Moyers, hosted a PBS public affairs program off-and-on, starting in 1972, for years and was a CBS News analyst in the 1980s. Before embarking on his broadcasting career, for which he won a dozen Emmy Awards, Moyers was President Lyndon Johnson’s press secretary.
William Moyers followed his famous father and mother, Judith, a TV news producer, into the news biz. But crack cocaine and alcohol took over.
Moyers’ memoir, Broken: My Story of Addiction and Redemption, was a New York Times bestseller in 2006. After I finished reading it last week, I see why.
In 1988, Moyers was a 29-year-old reporter at Newsday on Long Island, N.Y., when he tried crack.
“That first hit off the crack pipe marked the exact moment when I turned my back on marijuana, warm whiskey, cold beer, chilled vodka tonics, and powdered cocaine,” he wrote. “Crack was everything I had ever wanted, and it gave me everything I had ever needed.”
Over the next five years, Moyers’ parents literally pulled him out of crack houses in Harlem and Atlanta, where he worked for CNN, to get him into treatment.
Three times he relapsed.
By his own admission, Moyers was lucky. His family had the means to pay for four stays at inpatient treatment centers when they weren’t covered by health insurance benefits.
His last name came in handy as well. In December 1980, Moyers was a 21-year-old college senior home for the holidays in Garden City, N.J., when he joined friends from high school at a neighborhood bar.
Before the night was over, Moyers, in a drunken stupor, had smashed a window at a fish market next door and crawled inside. He filled his pockets with $20 in change that he found on the counter.
When he started back through the window, “two squad cars and four Garden City policemen were waiting,” Moyers wrote.
His father wrote a $5,000 check to a prominent defense attorney for a retainer fee. The prosecutor reduced the charge from burglary, a felony, to disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor. The judge went along. It probably didn’t hurt that CBS News’ Dan Rather wrote to the judge on Moyers’ behalf.
In a phone interview, I asked Moyers about the incident. At the time, it was written off as a “college prank,” he said. “But I was an alcoholic and didn’t know it.”
That was only the beginning.
“There were many times in my life when it was only a matter of seconds or inches that kept me out of prison,” he said, referring to the close calls he had while driving under the influence of crack and booze.
Then there were the frequent drug deals he made on street corners to support his addiction.
“I should have been like millions of other Americans who have been incarcerated as result of their illness,” he said.
The Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights, a nonprofit based in Providence, R.I., estimates that at least half of U.S. prison inmates “committed the act they are incarcerated for while under the influence of drugs.”
Moyers will share his story at the dinner celebrating Hartford Dismas’ fifth anniversary. The deadline for purchasing tickets, which are $75 each, is April 4. Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan is the emcee.
Hartford Dismas is part of Dismas of Vermont, which also has two houses in Burlington and one in Rutland. The nonprofit organization was started in the early 1980s by Rita McCaffrey and her husband, Francis, a former Vermont judge who died last year.
As I’ve written before, Dismas is one of the best things going for Vermont’s criminal justice system.
For $80 a week, residents get room and board while they reintegrate back into society. They get help finding jobs and connecting with social services.
Vermont taxpayers benefit, too. It costs more than $60,000 a year to keep an offender behind bars in Vermont. At Dismas, the cost is about $22,000 a year.
On the weekend of the Dismas fundraiser, Moyers will come to town early to talk with residents over breakfast on Sunday morning at the house in Hartford Village.
Eight of the 10 current residents at Hartford Dismas have had serious addiction issues, House Director Jeff Backus, a former Vermont corrections officer, told me, “And the other two weren’t perfect either.”
Hearing from someone with Moyers’ background gives people hope that “recovery is possible,” Backus said.
Moyers, 59, is now vice president of public affairs and community relations at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation in Minnesota. A former patient at Hazelden, one of the country’s leading chemical dependency treatment centers, Moyers does about 50 speaking engagements a year.
“Those of us who have recovered have to be willing to talk about it the same way we talk about cancer, diabetes and other diseases,” he said. “I’m a prime example that addiction doesn’t discriminate and treatment works but not always the first time.”

Probe is over, but meddling persists; Russia will continue to interfere in U.S. elections to sow discord, experts say.

Texto completo: When Robert S. Mueller III turns off the lights in the special counsel's office for the final time, he will leave behind an exhaustive blueprint of how Moscow meddled in the last presidential election, one pieced together from electronic blueprints, sensitive communications intercepts and financial records.
It was an arduous task, but the truly hard part will be ensuring the Russians aren't able to pull that same blueprint off the shelf and use it in future campaigns.
A review of court filings and independent studies, as well as interviews with experts, shows that no one should expect that the end of Mueller's work means an end to Russian political meddling.

"There's been nothing as a result of the investigation that's helping us resolve the problem," said Alina Polyakova, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "We're just at the very, very beginning of this reckoning."
President Trump has downplayed or outright denied that Moscow meddled with the election, questioning U.S. intelligence conclusions while standing next to Russian President Vladimir Putin at their summit in Helsinki, Finland, last year.
"They said they think it's Russia," Trump said. "I have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia. I will say this, I don't see any reason why it would be."
Trump's assessment is not shared by Atty. Gen. William Barr, who sent a letter to Congress on Sunday summarizing Mueller's findings.
Barr backed up the president's repeated assertions that no one from his team conspired with the Russian government, but he stood by Mueller's determination, shared by U.S. intelligence agencies, that Moscow had launched a covert effort to meddle in U.S. politics. Citing the special counsel's investigation, Barr described a two-pronged effort by the Russian government to influence U.S. politics during the campaign.
The first part, a disinformation campaign allegedly funded by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, an oligarch close to Putin, is a relatively cheap and difficult-to-trace way of interfering in another country's politics. Such campaigns spread divisive content on social media, and Moscow has proved itself to be a persistent practitioner even after its actions during the last presidential election were revealed.
A prime example came a little more than a year ago, when Mueller unveiled his indictment targeting the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg, Russia-based troll farm that led the disinformation efforts. The day Mueller announced the indictment, the trolls were back online to rile both sides, with some supporting Trump and others cheering the prosecutors.
"We didn't vote for Trump because of a couple of hashtags shilled by the Russians. We voted for Trump because he convinced us to vote for Trump," wrote a Russian account calling itself the "Marlboro Man."
Another account with the handle "Jemisha" taunted the president with the tweet, "You're next on Mueller's list!"
The tweets, part of a database of now-defunct accounts tied to the Internet Research Agency, were a show of brazenness from Russia, which has always denied its role in the meddling.
"They do not care how many times they've been exposed," said Jakub Kalensky, who is based in Prague as a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center.
"Until there's a very robust, very strong step 2, it will not stop Russia."
Prigozhin and a dozen other Russians were indicted by Mueller. Last year the Justice Department's national security division charged another Russian who allegedly acted as the Internet Research Agency's accountant. The indictment outlined how the disinformation campaign was continuing and funding for the effort was only increasing. Since Russia has no extradition agreement with the U.S., however, there's little chance that any of the indicted Russians will stand trial.
The other prong of Moscow's operation, as described by Barr in his letter, was a hacking effort allegedly carried out by Russian military intelligence officers. A dozen officers were indicted by Mueller, who outlined how they used custom malware to access Democratic Party computers and extract thousands of internal documents and emails. Two troves of emails were released through WikiLeaks during the campaign, one right before the Democratic National Convention and the other in the month before the election.
During the campaign, Trump publicly called on Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton's controversial private email server. Although Trump later said he was joking, Russian operatives tried for the first time to access Clinton's system that night, according to one of Mueller's indictments.
Max Bergmann, who directs the Moscow Project at the Center for American Progress, said Trump and the Russians have often echoed each other with their messaging.
"Russians don't need to invent new messages," he said. "They just need to amplify the president and many of his supporters on the right."
Washington has become more aggressive to combat the problem. U.S. Cyber Command, a branch of the military, sent messages directly to Russian trolls to warn them that they were being watched, the New York Times reported. And the Washington Post reported that the same operation shut down web access at the Internet Research Agency on the day of November's midterm election, another shot across the Russians' digital bow.
Social media companies like Twitter and Facebook have also been deactivating accounts suspected of being part of foreign influence operations, a game of digital Whac-A-Mole.
But national security officials expect the challenge to continue as the U.S. prepares for another presidential election next year.
"What has continued virtually unabated, and just intensifies during the election cycles, is this malign foreign influence campaign," FBI Director Christopher Wray said during a conference in San Francisco. The goal, he said, is to "sow divisiveness and discord, to pit Americans against each other, to undermine our faith in democracy."
The problem has been the subject of two reports commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee and released late last year.
"Active and ongoing interference operations remain on several platforms," said one of the reports produced by a team from New Knowledge, Columbia University and Canfield Research.
Ben Nimmo, a British-based senior fellow for the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, said Russians have various methods of staying one step ahead of authorities. They've taken greater steps to disguise their digital tracks, he said, such as registering social media accounts with internet-based phone numbers rather than Russian mobile phones.
Nimmo said there's also been an increasing focus on Instagram, where the more visual format minimizes linguistic clues that can reveal the account isn't run by an American.
"The sheriff has now ridden into town. But the bad guys are still there," he said. "The bad guys are trying to figure out new ways to get away with what they're doing."
Disinformation campaigns are likely to gain traction as long as the targets -- in this case, U.S. voters -- aren't skeptical enough about what they're reading and watching online.
Polyakova said what's needed is a "bottom up" approach, such as a nationwide curriculum or awareness program to help people better understand the increasingly hazardous information landscape. It's a more ambiguous challenge than bringing indictments against Russian trolls, but she said it could end up being more crucial in the long run.
"The big question is how to get citizens, in all democracies, to discern between content that's meant to manipulate you and independent reporting," Polyakova said.
Critics say the lack of leadership from the White House has hampered the country's efforts to defend itself, especially since Trump has viewed questions about Moscow's role as an attempt to erode the legitimacy of his victory.
"We are marginally better prepared," said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
"But we should be much further along than we are, and this should be a higher priority for the administration."
An additional concern is other countries following Russia and launching similarly extensive operations to meddle in U.S. politics. There are signs that Iran has already taken steps, and Twitter announced in October that it had deactivated 770 accounts linked to the Middle Eastern country.
The accounts had spread pro-Tehran messages, sometimes while posing as independent news sources.
"The amount of players who will be in the game of deception will likely grow exponentially by 2020," said Bret Schafer, a social media analyst with the German Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy.
"I don't necessarily think we're in a better spot today than we were three or four years ago."

Texto completo: The idea that Google is subtly pushing masses of voters to the left has the ring of conspiracy, and thus the work of Robert Epstein is warmly embraced by conservative lawmakers -- as well as a president -- convinced that Big Tech is plotting against them.
Yet even some scholars who think the San Diego-based psychologist is wrong about the political impact of search engines -- he believes bias built into Google's processes could have cost Republicans three California congressional districts in the last election -- have started paying attention to his detailed work on how voters respond to tens of thousands of search results.
At a moment when misinformation about search engines and social media bias is rampant, with both the left and the right amplifying unsupported claims, Epstein is asking the right questions, they say, about the unseen power of algorithms and how little most Americans understand about the way they work.

The saga of the persistent San Diego psychologist versus the tech giant is a long-running one, full of twists. As Big Data shapes our opinions in ways scholars are only beginning to comprehend, his work has increasingly caught attention.
"The larger issue he is looking at is extremely important," said Ramesh Srinivasan, a professor of information studies at UCLA who focuses on the relationships between technology and politics. Srinivasan is not convinced by the claims from conservatives that the GOP is being victimized, but he argues scholars need to look more deeply at how search engines can shape the views of those who use them.
"We turn to these efficient technologies," he said, "to do almost everything these days without knowing why we see what we see from them or what data is collected about us and how it is being used."
Epstein, a former Psychology Today editor in chief who runs a nonprofit institute in California, calls the phenomenon he has explored the search engine manipulation effect.
"These are new forms of manipulation people can't see," he said. The technologies "can have an enormous impact on voters who are undecided. ... People have no awareness the influence is being exerted."
Google dismisses his research as the work of a misguided amateur. Company Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in December that Google had investigated Epstein's findings and found his methodology flawed.
Company officials, while declining to comment about Epstein on the record, offered background material asserting that Google algorithms are politically blind and respond to searches with news content based on its timeliness, relevance and authoritativeness.
In his latest study, which he and a co-author plan to present in April at the 99th annual meeting of the Western Psychological Assn., in Pasadena, Epstein tracked 47,300 searches by dozens of undecided voters in the districts of newly elected California Democratic Reps. Katie Porter, Harley Rouda and Mike Levin.
Mainstream outlets, including the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times, dominated the Google search results. By contrast, searches conducted on Yahoo and Bing more often showcased links from deeply conservative outfits such as Breitbart.
Using a model he has developed to gauge the subliminal effect of what he sees as tilted search results, Epstein projected that 35,455 voters who'd been on the fence were persuaded to vote for a Democrat entirely because of the sources Google fed them.
That conclusion is subject to much dispute.
Srinivasan questions how many undecided voters use Google to help decide how to cast ballots.
Safiya Noble, a UCLA professor and author of "Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism," is troubled by what she sees as an argument that search engines ought to counterbalance the content of large, well-resourced and highly trained newsrooms with "disinformation sites" and "propaganda outlets."
Epstein says the large readership that sites such as Breitbart receive should earn them more prominent Google exposure. "It is astonishing that Breitbart and some similar websites are not more present, given the enormous traffic some of these websites get, Breitbart especially," he said. "What you are seeing here might be indicative of a kind of blacklisting."
Google, he says, is trying to make judgments "based on some measures of what they consider to be quality. They have said this publicly. They are trying to judge what is good and bad."
Google executives, for their part, argue it would be corporate suicide to use their influence over voters to sway elections.
But many analysts say that is not the point. Even if Epstein is wrong about the effects of Google's searches, the real issue, they say, is how little people know about the ways the company's algorithms manipulate what users see. Google engineers design their algorithms for a host of reasons -- mostly related to boosting profits -- and users just accept the top links as the most trustworthy and authoritative information on a topic.
"We need to understand the potential political impact of these underneath-the-hood choices" by tech companies, said Jacob Shapiro, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton. "The question we should be asking is, what do we need to do to nail down how consequential this is? And what systems do we need to create as a society to minimize the negatives?"
Noble agrees with that broader point that Google should not be guiding crucial societal questions, such as how we vote.
"We use these search engines as if they are arbiters of truth, and they are not," she said. "They are global advertising platforms. They are not fact checkers or public interest technologies. ... The minute you start to engage these broader social issues on a search engine, you run up against its limits."
The fix, Noble says, involves giving people viable alternatives to Google that are not designed for profit but for the public interest.
Epstein calls for "a worldwide passive network of monitoring systems to keep an eye on emerging technologies and what they are showing and telling people." Other scholars suggest equally bold government interventions, some of which align with Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren's plan to break up big tech companies.
But Congress is right now focused on using the potential flaws in search engines as a springboard to air political grievances and launch partisan attacks.
The December hearing into Google was consumed by theatrics. Republicans, citing Epstein, presented themselves as victims of a cynical conspiracy, sometimes conflating his work with unrelated perceived biases. The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, declared political bias in search engines a "fantasy dreamed up by some conservatives."
Epstein may be discouraged, but he isn't helping turn down the temperature. He supported Hillary Clinton, but he's become a frequent guest on right-wing media. Tucker Carlson sings his praises on Fox News. He gives talks at tea party meetings.
He starred in a documentary called "The Creepy Line" that was produced by Peter Schweizer, author of "Clinton Cash," who is among the journalists most reviled by Democrats.
"I have become a darling of conservatives, which is driving me crazy," Epstein said. "But they love me because I am saying things they want to hear. People I am closer to politically don't want to hear what I have to say."

Emphasis on justice and equity is an important part of the Green New Deal

Texto completo: The Green New Deal deserves to be the center of attention in policy discussions. A similar proposal should have been center stage 40 years ago. We are now paying a high price for our neglect. Climate change is unquestionably the issue of the century. The cost of ignoring climate change will be more apparent with each passing year – even if we come to our senses and begin greening the global economy today.
As David Wallace-Wells recently wrote in the New York Times, “The age of climate panic is here. Last summer, a heat wave baked the entire Northern Hemisphere, killing dozens from Quebec to Japan. Some of the most destructive wildfires in California history turned more than a million acres to ash, along the way melting the tires and the sneakers of those trying to escape the flames. Pacific hurricanes forced three million people in China to flee and wiped away almost all of Hawaii’s East Island.”
These events are shocking even to those knowledgeable about environmental issues. I never, in my lifetime, expected to see weather events ascribed to climate change. My readings in environmental science during the mid-1970s clarified the problem but offered no reliable timeline. Predictions seemed little more than guesswork.
As the digital age evolved and expanded, computer models gained amazing accuracy. Scientists are now much better at making predictions, both in terms of weather and climate. Their findings would cause more alarm if they were not countered by false claims and ignorance.

Inequalities have risen dramatically
But the climate change debates are also confused in ways they could not have been in the 1970s. First, income and wealth inequalities are far worse than any of us would have imagined back then. France in 1968 and the United States in 1970-71 reflected a widespread and growing awareness of injustices and inequalities of many kinds. Despite the turmoil, almost everyone expected their lives to improve. The debate, in many ways, was about how social and economic change would occur – too slow and shallow for some, too fast and deep for others.
Thomas Piketty’s book, “Capital in the 21st Century,” made clear our delusions. Inequality has grown to monstrous proportions with a small part of the upper 1 percent pocketing so much income and wealth that it defies reason. The developed world became a casino, and those with the most money never lost a game. We now have unprecedented wealth, but that wealth is highly concentrated.
The Green New Deal as proposed in the House of Representatives addresses much more than climate change. The proposed joint resolution being circulated on the internet seeks “to promote justice and equity.” Later, it proposes “providing resources, training, and high-quality education, to all people of the United States,” as well as, “guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage.”
For these and other proposals within the joint resolution, there has been much criticism. The Washington Post editorial board said, “Massive social reform will not protect the climate.”
These criticisms are to be expected, but the evidence of human-caused climate change has become overwhelming. Likewise, growing inequality is easily measured and documented. We need a Green New Deal mobilization that confronts both environmental and social issues.
Thomas Friedman receives much credit for creating the term “Green New Deal” in a Times column from 2007. Few references have been made to the Cambridge-published book prepared by Edward Barbier for the United Nations Environment Programme: “Rethinking the Economic Recovery: A Global Green New Deal.” It was published in 2010. Barbier reminds us that meeting this challenge is a group project – a global project.
Worldwide, anger is apparent — and justified
Many people in the developed world who work for a living never benefited from globalization – in terms of increased wealth or economic stability. And, they are very angry. We see that anger directed toward Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, President Emmanuel Macron in France, Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany and other international leaders. We are in the midst of a confusing Brexit, a “yellow vest” rebellion in France, and rising anti-immigration sentiments in Europe and the United States.
Few members of the privileged class seem to understand this anger. But the anger is justified. As the Federal Reserve reminds us: In a pinch, 40 percent of Americans can’t come up with $400 without heading to the pawn shop. The majority of Americans have no significant retirement savings.
It is not possible to separate the changes necessary to save our planet from climate disaster, and the gross inequities central to the current version of globalization. They are entwined factually and in a range of emotional responses – some coming from the right and some from the left.
My father was a blue-collar worker. He moved to a university community as soon as he possibly could. When we had out-of-town guests, he and my mother always insisted on a tour of the university campus near our home. I grew up listening to their pride and trust in public institutions.
Too many mothers and fathers have raised children since then with little or no trust in institutions of any kind. They feel betrayed and left behind, and they worry about the future of those they love.
Working families’ support will be needed
To achieve a Green New Deal that echoes its namesake New Deal, there will need to be voters who support it. The proposed mobilization will need the support of working families whose wages have been stagnant for decades, and whose children have lost any hope of joining the middle class. It will need to spark the enthusiasm of rural voters in states disproportionately represented in the Senate.
Properly implementing a Green New Deal can do that. It is a matter of balancing our response to an environmental crisis with a renewed commitment to justice and equity. Done properly, it can even bring us closer to European allies and others who have not been treated well these past few years.
A plan limiting itself to direct mitigation of climate change will not work. It will not engage a weary, betrayed electorate. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey are right. The Green New Deal must be a vehicle to invite working families back into a vision of institutions and democratic processes that can be trusted.
The Green New Deal needs more thought, much work, many refinements, and vigorous debate. Its goals and outcomes must touch us all and mobilize widespread support. But it is a brilliant proposal during desperate times. We should wish the proponents luck, join them in their work, and do our best to rejuvenate hope, compassion, and trust in our institutions and democratic processes.
Keith Luebke recently retired from teaching nonprofit leadership courses and has several decades of experience directing nonprofit organizations.

Texto completo: Picture your book club. Keep the glasses of Chardonnay and hold the laughs at witty takes level, but increase your attendance 20 fold.
That's what the DSM Book Festival hopes to be.
Hitting Capital Square in downtown Des Moines on Saturday, the DSM Book Festival has scored three heavy-hitting headliners — Susan Orlean, Garth Stein and Nnedi Okorafor — and plans a host of literary-themed discussions and classes.
Now, the Des Moines Storytellers Project is proud to announce that we are joining the book-themed fun with an event featuring beloved tales from our archives.
"From the collection: Treasured stories from the Des Moines Storytellers Project" will bow at 6 p.m. on the Prairie Meadows Authors Pavilion and will feature storytellers revisiting pieces that made our first four seasons sparkle.
At the Storytellers Project, journalists with the Des Moines Register coach everyday Iowans to tell true, first-person stories live onstage without notes.
Like a chat around the campfire or a visit among friends, the Storytellers Project celebrates that good stories don't necessarily have to be bound up in a book — an idea that's also central to the mission of this new festival, said Colleen Murphy, downtown events director with the Greater Des Moines Partnership.
"We will have the authors, but a lot of the festival is centered around discussion and celebrating how people love to share stories or what they've read with each other," she said.
Born from the success of smaller book-focused events, The DSM Book Festival is aimed at connecting readers with people who produce work you can read.
Like all good book clubs, the festival is 50 percent literature discussion and 50 percent party.
"When I read a book, one of the more exciting things I love after I finish is to talk with someone about it," Murphy said. "So this festival is bringing that to life in a community celebration."
For more than a year, a committee of citizens, literary folk and business leaders have been planning the event. Throughout the process, they've made a concerted effort to secure authors whose work has transcended the literary scene, Murphy said.
A staff writer at the New Yorker, Susan Orlean has had multiple books land on the best-seller list, including "The Orchid Thief," which was later made into "Adaptation," a film starring Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep. Orlean is appearing at the festival as part of the Des Moines Public Library's Authors Visiting in Des Moines (AViD) event series.
Garth Stein is the author of the perennial book club favorite, "The Art of Racing in the Rain," which will be made into a film this year.
And Nnedi Okorafor wrote some of the Black Panther comics that inspired the 2018 Oscar-nominated eponymous film.
An award-winning science fiction author when not writing for panels, Okorafor is known for her Africa-based fantasy and myth-infused magical realism young adult books.
Her Akata series, which centers on a young Nigerian-American girl who discovers she can cast spells, was called a "Nigerian Harry Potter" by the New York Times.
In addition to the author talks, there will be a children's stage for young readers and a host of "make and take classes" featuring book discussions paired with a craft.
On the cooking stage, classes will include the Grape Gatsby, a wine tasting with a 1920s theme, and For Whom the Beer Tolls, a lecture on authors and the drinks they loved.
The Des Moines Storytellers Project is currently in its fourth season and has shows scheduled throughout this year. To become a teller or attend a show, visit DesMoinesRegister.com/Storytellers.
The Des Moines Register is a sponsor of the DSM Book Festival.

Apple unveiled the news app, Apple News+, at an event Monday. It will provide access to articles from more than 300 magazines including Vogue, GQ and Sports Illustrated. In addition to the Journal, the Los Angeles Times and Toronto Star will be the other North American newspapers joining the service.
Apple will take a substantial cut of the revenue -- it was seeking a 50% share in talks with publishers, people familiar with the discussions say. Media partners will get a portion of the monthly fees based on readership of their articles.
Journal executives declined to comment on the terms of revenue sharing. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Other major news outlets including the New York Times and Washington Post engaged in talks with Apple, people familiar with the situation said, but chose not to join the new service.
The Journal for years has focused on building its digital subscriber base, appealing to a core audience of people interested in business and financial news. The paper finished 2018 with 1.71 million digital subscribers, with a full-priced subscription costing $39 a month. Its print subscribers totaled about 840,000. The Apple partnership is viewed as an opportunity to bring in revenue from a broader audience.
William Lewis, chief executive of Dow Jones & Co. and publisher of the Journal, said at a meeting for newsroom staff that the deal "will enable us to get our journalism in front of millions of people who may never have paid for our journalism before."
Robert Thomson, chief executive of Journal parent News Corp, has been among the most vocal critics of tech companies such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc.
Mr. Thomson said the Apple deal was a measured and smart bet. "It's important that we partner with tech companies when that makes sense" and "pursue them" when necessary, he said at the newsroom meeting.
The partnership carries risks for the Journal, since each Apple user will generate much less subscription revenue for the company than a full-priced subscriber. Journal executives said they weren't concerned about existing subscribers canceling service to shift to the Apple service, because the two offerings will be fundamentally different.
To meet the needs of the Apple product, the Journal will be hiring around 50 additional newsroom staffers, the people familiar with the situation said.
The Apple app will surface stories thought to be of interest to a general reader -- that could be national news, politics, sports and leisure news, but also some business news, people familiar with the situation said.
The paper's entire slate of business and financial news will also be searchable within the app, but the thinking is that most users won't consume much beyond what is actively presented to them.
Apple users will have access to only three days' worth of the Journal's archive, the people said. The Journal also negotiated terms that would allow it to drop out of the service, they said.
"I have not entered into this deal lightly," Mr. Lewis said in his newsroom talk. "It was never worth doing a bad deal."
Mr. Lewis said the shift by the Journal was a milestone as significant as the launch of a paywall on the Journal's website in 1996, more than a decade before most of the news industry.
While Apple won't share customer data with the publishers, participating news outlets will be able to see what is being read and target regular visitors with specific offers for things like newsletters, said Suzi Watford, the Journal's chief marketing officer.
The Los Angeles Times also is hopeful that the Apple partnership will jump-start its digital business.
"We have every confidence that the Apple affiliation will spur the growth of our digital subscriptions," said Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner and executive chairman of the Times.

Texto completo: 1) "America's Got Talent," 8-10 p.m. Tuesday and 8-9 p.m. Wednesday, NBC. The show that dominates the summer Nielsen ratings now moves to live shows, adding a second night. Each Tuesday, we'll see 12 acts and vote; each Wednesday, we'll learn which seven advance. The 36-act line-up includes lots of singers, dancers and magicians, plus duos that do music, trapeze and ballroom-dancing. But there's also a cat act, a "danger act," a "diablo artist" and, of course, a singing and dancing accordionist.
2) "The Great British Bake Off" finale, 9 p.m. Friday, PBS. This gentle show — a dozen home cooks, in a tent in the British countryside — has been a quiet favorite of some Americans. Now it's moving to a British commercial channel and ending its PBS run. Tonight's finale (taped in 2012) has Brendan Lynch, 63; John Whaite, 23 and James Morton, 21. That's the only all-male finish in the show's eight years. Counting this season, six women and two men have won; other finalist spots were eight apiece.
3) "24 Hours to Hell and Back" season-finale, 9 p.m. Wednesday, Fox. It's a week for food shows to wrap up. In this one, Gordon Ramsay gives restaurants instant makeovers; it departs so Ramsay's other summer show ("MasterChef") can expand. The finale is at Sandra Dee's Bar-B-Que & Seafood, a laidback place in Sacramento. (No, it's not the movie-star Sandra Dee; she died in 2005, at 62.) Using hidden cameras, Ramsay decides the owner lacks discipline with family members who work there.
4) "Elementary," 10 p.m. today, CBS. It's the second new episode in two days for this smart series. (Don't worry, there are plenty left; CBS ordered 21 and didn't start them until April 30.) Tonight — on a Monday that's clogged with reality competitions — Holmes and Watson probe the murder of a robotics engineer whose work was linked to groundbreaking research on teleportation. Also, Bell is blocked from a class he must take to qualify for the U.S. Marshal Service; he's shocked to learn the reason.
5) "Frontline," 9-11 p.m. today and Tuesday, PBS. Most network newspeople rarely get an hour for any subject, unless it's a true-crime story. But PBS is the exception to many rules; here is a two-night, four-hour look at Iran. Thomas Erdbrink, a New York Times correspondent, journeys through the country; he uses humor and curiosity, PBS says, while describing a world often at odds with the conservative clerics and leaders. People talk about martyrdom, visits to the U.S. and protests about headscarves.
6) "Trial & Error," 9 and 9:30 p.m. Thursday, NBC. This broad (and, often, hilarious) comedy has taken some wild twists lately. Last week, that centered on Dwayne, who is both a police deputy and an assistant for Josh, the defense lawyer. He shattered Josh's timeline argument ... then came up with proof that cleared Lavinia (Kristen Chenoweth) anyway. That led Josh to re-open a case from nine years ago, when a genius clockmaker was convicted of killing Lavinia's brother. Preparations for his re-trial begin.
7) "Great Performances," 10 p.m. Friday, PBS. The Imperial Schonbrunn Palace is your typical rural retreat, albeit one with 1,441 rooms. Emperor Franz Joseph lived there, Jackie Chan filmed there, John Kennedy met Nikita Kruschev there. And once a year, the Vienna Philharmonic has a spectacular concert on is grounds. This one, beautifully filmed, starts with the "William Tell Overture" and ends with a Strauss waltz. In between, Anna Netrebko sings the works of Rossini, Verdi and Puccini.
8) "Ghostbusters" (2016), 8-11 p.m. Saturday, FX. We can spend the night with "Saturday Night Live" people. The "SNL" rerun (11:29 p.m., NBC) has Chance the Rapper hosting and Eminem as music guest. Prior to that, there's this clever remake, starring two current "SNL" people (Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones), an alumna (Kristen Wiig) and a frequent host or guest (Melissa McCarthy). There are big sight gags and a bonus — Chris Hemsworth's variation on the cliche of a dim-but-attractive secretary.
9) "Finding Nemo" (2003) and "Finding Dory" (2016), 6 and 7:45 p.m. Sunday, Disney. Here is one of the all-time cartoon classics, paired with its sequel. "Nemo" followed a little clownfish who got lost; "Dory" is set six months later, when his friend searches for her family. And if you want more cartoons, earlier in the day? Freeform starts a Sunday marathon with the wonderful "Lego Movie" (2014), at 9 a.m. It follows with "Cars" and "Cars 2" (2006, 2001), at 11:05 a.m. and 1:45 p.m., and many more.
10) "The Last Sharknado: It's About Time," 8 p.m. Sunday, Syfy, rerunning at 10. This all started in 2013 as noisy nonsense — a movie about a swirling storm, thrusting sharks at us. And then, bizarrely, it caught on. Ever since, a new movie each year has had Fin (Ian Ziering) and friends fighting evil forces. We can see the original at 8 a.m., followed by the others at 10 a.m., noon and 2, 4 and 6 p.m. ... ending with Fin wandering through an Earthly apocalypse. Tonight's solution, of course, is to go back in time.
Lucy Liu as Joan Watson and Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock Holmes in "Elementary." Holmes and Watson probe the murder of a robotics engineer whose work was linked to groundbreaking research on teleportation.

Texto completo: EAST LANSING - Ellis Hay knew one of answers had to be "Bea Arthur."
"She is only Bea to be kind of famous enough for a crossword that I could find," he said.
The 2016 graduate of East Lansing High School made his New York Times debut this week with the publication of his B-themed crossword puzzle.
Hay began work on the puzzle nearly a year ago. The Temple University music composition junior fittingly used music terms and homophones as well.
Clue topics ranged from pop culture, as in "Backstreet Boys member ____ Dorough," to political, "Brooklyn-born Supreme Court Justice."
It took Hay more than a week to finish the puzzle. He submitted it last spring and learned in July that it would be published. The puzzle ran in the New York Times on Monday.
"My mom was excited to tell everyone she knows about it," he said.
The former quiz bowl team member said he can usually complete the New York Times crossword Monday through Thursday. The puzzle gets increasingly challenging as the week progresses. He can sometimes complete the Friday and Saturday puzzles, though not always.
Hay isn't a lifelong crossword puzzle fiend. He started in earnest in college and has submitted a few puzzles to the Times.
"I haven't submitted any in a few months, but, probably during the summer, I can focus a little bit more on puzzles."

Parents hinder children's life skills

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become an adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of children ages 18 to 28.
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not rich — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor's appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn't sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child's grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid," Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's a difficult habit for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you're doing it in high school, you can't stop at college," she said. "If you're doing it in college, you can't stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life."
Lythcott-Haims said parents eventually have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own life lives. "You can't just arrive them at the future you want for them. They have to do the work to build the skills," she said.
The poll looked at 1,508 people ages 18 to 28 and 1,136 parents of people that age. The survey was conducted between Jan. 29 to Feb. 3.

HOW THE 1%STAY THE 1%

Texto completo: For the Monitor
Sometimes a story comes along that exposes deep, dark realities that typically remain hidden. Such a story is the college admissions scandal the FBI code-named Operation Varsity Blues.
While popular mythology and conventional thinking tout America as a meritocracy where anyone can get ahead based on their hard work and talent, this scandal presents a very different picture. It reveals that admission to elite schools in the U.S. is a stacked deck, rigged to benefit wealthy white students.
According to the New York Times, at 38 top-tier colleges including Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth and the University of Pennsylvania, there are more students from the top 1 percent of families by income than there are from the bottom 60 percent. Both class and racial inequalities are reflected in which students are admitted to and graduate from our nation's elite schools.
It is not a simple story; there are always a few exceptional students from low-income families who get into elite colleges, but they are the exception to the rule. The larger pattern is about class privilege and about how rich families are given preferential treatment or are able to game the system.
Rich people who are born into privilege already have a big edge in college admissions. Maybe it is stating the obvious, but elite colleges have become extremely expensive. Even with some financial aid, just to be able to come up with a means to pay the cost at many colleges, let alone elite colleges, is daunting.
The cost is too much for many prospective candidates. Having the means to pay full freight is no small thing since otherwise we are talking significant debt.
A close look at Operation Varsity Blues provides a window into the elite college admissions world.
The FBI arrested 50 people, including some Hollywood stars and 13 college coaches. The gist of what was going on was very wealthy people paying a guy named Rick Singer, who billed himself as a college counseling consultant, big bucks to buy entrance into some of the most prestigious colleges.
Singer's clients were paying him between $100,000 and $6.5 million based on a guarantee that he could get their child into an elite school. Most paid between $250,000 and $400,000.
While the allegations against Singer have yet to be proven, here are some of the alleged frauds:
Singer paid ringer stand-ins to take the ACT and SAT tests. He bribed test proctors and arranged for them to correct wrong answers. He instructed parents to lie and say their children had learning disabilities, and some kids were given accommodations to take tests in individualized settings, sometimes over two days, with only a proctor present.
Singer also paid bribes to college sports coaches. He would get students designated as recruited athletes, even when they were not athletes. He and the parents would Photoshop faces onto athletic bodies and would create fake athletic profiles. Singer made about $25 million from this business.
Legacy admissions
One of the sharpest comments about the scandal came from Susan Dynarski, a professor at the University of Michigan.
“This scandal is just the extreme, the illegal extreme, but it's a continuum with legacy admission, with Jared Kushner, with all these other thumbs on the scale that wealthy kids get that are legal.”
Dynarski described legacy admission as “affirmative action for people who've had a very privileged life.” She has written that legacies (children of graduates) at Harvard are accepted at five times the rate of non-legacies. That pattern likely holds true at other elite colleges.
A recent lawsuit against Harvard's admission practices revealed that the college maintained a secret list of applicants who are relatives of major donors. Students on the donor list have a 40 percent acceptance rate. Harvard accepts 4.6 percent of students who apply.
Legacy admission is really a form of bribery. Colleges see such students as revenue generators for their institution. If a student who is a legacy cannot be accepted, elite colleges may ask them to take a “gap year” and enter a year later. This is called “Z-listing.”
The fact of Z-listing came out in a recent affirmative action lawsuit against Harvard. For years Harvard denied the existence of Z-listing. Z-listing is, in fact, a preferential program for white, wealthy and well-connected students.
Even if you are not a legacy, if your parents can cough up a major donation, your chance of admission skyrockets; the larger the donation, the greater the certainty of admission.
Consider Jared Kushner. Kushner's father gave Harvard $2.5 million just prior to Jared's admission to the college.
In his book The Price of Admission, Daniel Golden quotes administrators at Kushner's private high school, the Frisch School, in Paramus, N.J.
“There was no way anybody in the administrative office of the school thought he would on the merits get into Harvard. His GPA did not warrant it, his SAT scores did not warrant it. We thought for sure there was no way this was going to happen. Then, lo and behold, Jared was accepted.”
The Kushner example represents a form of corruption that is deeply unfair to hard-working low- and middle-income students with better grades and SAT scores. Money talks, though, and inferior students like Kushner are permitted to bribe their way into Harvard. It is pay for play.
Donations by wealthy parents, in effect, rob other students of their right to a fair shot at admission.
Opportunity hoarding
The corruption aside, the other advantages of wealth deserve mention. If you are rich enough, you will have coaches, tutors, test prep courses, opportunities to play more expensive and exclusive sports, like water polo, squash and golf, and you will have social networking connections. Maybe you belong to the same country club and you get to socialize with alumni who can put in a good word for you. All those things are an edge in a competitive battle.
Private prep schools also have long-standing connections with the admissions offices of elite colleges that grease the path to admission. The great majority of public schools have none of that.
Another dimension of the separate college admission for the wealthy is how admission at a top-tier college catapults students into high-powered positions in the corporate world and finance. Part of the conceit is that they are the best and the brightest when the truth is they are instead the better-connected and richest.
This scandal also points to how misplaced criticisms have been about affirmative action for minority students where there was an effort to remedy a historic injustice. The real and much more widespread affirmative action has been on behalf of wealthy white students. That has played out in front of our eyes for decades without drawing the scrutiny and criticism it deserved.
This story is about how the ruling class in America reproduces itself. Whether you call it the ruling class, the 1 percent or the power elite, this class of people has an enormous sense of entitlement. For some of them, it was too risky to chance admission to the Harvards, Yales and Princetons. They had to buy it.
Maintaining power and privilege is not only about the cash, it is also about opportunity hoarding.
For the 99 percent, we need to recognize this aspect of an ongoing class struggle that we have been losing for decades. Understanding the continuing and accelerating inequality in our society today is just the first step to working for change so that fairness and equality for all will one day disrupt and destroy the prevalence of wealthy white privilege.

Texto completo: Native American author Tommy Orange of Oakland has won the prestigious 2019 PEN/Hemingway award for "distinguished" first novel.
The honor was announced Tuesday by PEN America, a project of the Hemingway Society created after the death of Ernest Hemingway.
Orange, a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, wrote his debut novel, "There There," about modern-day Native Americans struggling with loss of identity in urban Oakland.
Published by Knopf in 2018, the novel was rated by The New York Times as one of the best books of the year.
"After noticing a lack of stories about urban Native Americans, Orange created a remarkable work that explores those who have inherited a profound spirituality, but who are also plagued by addiction, abuse, and suicide," says a biography on the Penguin Random House Speakers Bureau website.
In a June 2018 Bay Area News Group review of the book and interview with Orange, Lisa Wrenn wrote: "His love for Oakland and its people is obvious in his book's broad cast of characters, who are introduced in eponymously titled chapters that read like standalone stories. Like Orange himself, the characters are biracial, with names like Orvil Red Feather, Edwin Black and Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield.
"Oakland itself serves as a character, drawn in such details as the characters' allegiance to the A's and Raiders, the whiff of cannabis smoke at the bus station and the faded pink glow of the Tribune Tower, which seems like it should be red, but somehow lost steam along the way.' "
Regarding the book's title, she writes: "Orange draws parallels between the identity issues facing Oakland and the Native Americans who are nearly invisible' here. When Dene applies for an arts grant, he's interviewed by a smirky, hipster judge, Rob, who tells Dene: No one's really from (Oakland), right?' Rob goes on to parrot the oft-misinterpreted Gertrude Stein quote, there's no there there.' "
The PEN/Hemingway comes with a $25,000 award from the Hemingway family and the Hemingway Foundation. Orange also will receive a monthlong residency fellowship at the Ucross Foundation, a Wyoming retreat for artists and writers.
Séan Hemingway, the grandson of Ernest Hemingway, will present Orange with the award during an April 7 ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.

If you had the money, would you pay off a college admissions officer? 1 in 4 parents say they would, a new poll finds

Texto completo: If you had the money, would you bribe a college official to get your child admitted?
Fifteen percent of all American adults would answer yes, according to a new poll. And that number rises to 25 percent for adults who actually have children ages 18 and under.
It’s a hypothetical question, but certainly a revealing ethical one. There’s been a flood of outrage over the recent college admissions scandal, in which federal prosecutors charged parents with everything from paying off testing proctors to lying about their child’s athletic abilities to win a spot at elite schools. But a new poll from YouGov, a global public opinion and data company, shows that a large percentage of the U.S. population certainly doesn’t rule out the possibility of cheating and bribery when it comes to college admissions.
“It speaks to the pressure of parenting a bit,” said Larry Shannon-Missal, head of data services in the U.S. for YouGov. “Parents are aware of how increasingly competitive it is out there. They’re all reading the same articles we are about kids coming out of college and moving back in with their parents because it’s hard to find jobs that will pay enough to get a living wage.”
Even more parents — 34 percent — said they would be willing to pay someone to take an entrance exam on behalf of their child to get him or her into a good college. Of the general public, 20 percent said they would do so.
Shannon-Missal said these findings might also speak to a level of cynicism among the general population: that people see the wealthy using their resources to take advantage of the higher education system and would therefore be more likely to think that they themselves should also be able to do so, if they had the resources.
About two-thirds of adults polled said they were not surprised at the cheating scandal, and a similar number said the system is rigged in favor of wealthy students. In fact, 44 percent of adults said that, if given the money, most parents would pay to get their kids ahead.
Steering students toward specific extracurricular and academic tracks designed to catch the eye of admissions officers is not uncommon and is available at sky-high prices. A recent New York Times profile of college consultants reported that costs for these services can reach into the millions of dollars. And rigorous, expensive test prep for entrance exams remains at the center of debates around equity and inclusion.
It’s worth noting that the majority of respondents said they would not cheat: About three-quarters said they would probably or definitely not pay off a high school or college official. But if they had the money, 72 percent said they would likely pay for tutoring or test prep to get their child into college.
While the two most high-profile participants accused in the scheme — celebrities Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman — are women, the survey found that more men than women were willing to cheat in the college admissions race. When it came to paying someone to take a college entrance exam for their child, 23 percent of men said they probably or definitely would, compared with 17 percent of women. And 19 percent of men said they would probably or definitely pay a college official to secure their child a spot, versus 12 percent of women.
Some survey questions asked whether the respondent would hypothetically cheat if given the resources, but when other questions inquired as to whether they have actually cheated to get themselves or their children ahead, very few said they had. Only 2 percent said they’ve paid someone to gain an advantage for their child. Only 10 percent admitted to having personally cheated on a pop quiz, and 5 percent said they’ve cheated on a final exam.
“There are a lot of things that people could see, under the right circumstances, being willing to go to an extreme (for), but that doesn’t mean that most people have found that set of circumstances that has driven them to do so,” Shannon-Missal said.
The survey is weighted and representative of U.S. adults. It was conducted online from March 13 and 14 and included 1,259 respondents. The margin of error was 2.76 percentage points.

Texto completo: TechMan's a streamer. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Plus: the quality and variety of video he can watch on the net has surpassed that available on his TV.
More and more, it's not just reruns of TV shows and movies streaming, but original programming with first-class writing, high production values and high-power stars.
Toward the end of the year, your choices will explode as three big players come onto the stage, streaming their own and original content.
On Monday, Apple will hold an event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, Calif., to announce its streaming service. The first of a dozen or more shows are likely to launch before the year is out.
Apple has negotiated with HBO, Starz and Showtime to populate its screens, Bloomberg has reported, but the centerpiece will be original programming. Five series have completed filming and around a half dozen more are on the verge of wrapping production, according to The New York Times.
Producer J.J. Abrams has two Apple series in the works - one with Jennifer Garner, who played the lead in the Abrams-produced ABC series "Alias," and a musical show starring the singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles that is about to go into production.
Apple has also given the green light to animated "Peanuts" specials and children's shows made with Sesame Workshop.
Among the projects that have either completed filming or are nearing their wrap dates, according to the Times, are: an untitled series with Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston; "Amazing Stories," a Steven Spielberg reboot; a new M. Night Shyamalan thriller; and, oddly enough, an Emily Dickinson comedy.
On April 11, Disney is expected to preview elements of its new streaming platform, Disney +, and several months later, Warner Media is expected to provide details of its version.
Disney+ will include all of Disney's family friendly fare. It'll have content from Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm (Star Wars), Pixar and National Geographic. After its acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Disney will control Hulu, where it will stream its more adult content, according to Cnet.
AT&T announced it will leverage the acquisition of Time Warner, renamed Warner Media, to launch its streaming service late this year. The service will feature content from Warner Bros., Turner and HBO, reports Forbes.
Warner Media's library has franchises like Wonder Woman, Harry Potter, Lego and Lord of the Rings. It also has a library of classic films that appeal to older generations and it will be producing original programming.
Of course, you'll have to pay a fee for each of these services and the amount of that fee is one detail that has yet to be announced.

Comey: I don't want Mueller to prove Trump is a criminal

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey said he doesn’t care whether Robert Mueller finds President Trump took part in any wrongdoing as suspense builds for the long awaited report from the special counsel.

Comey, who was fired in 2016 by Trump and has spoken critically of the president since, wrote in a New York Times op-ed, that he’s not rooting for Mueller to show that Trump is a criminal; nor is he hoping Mueller clears the president of wrongdoing.

He does hope for “maximum transparency,” he said.

“I have no idea whether the special counsel will conclude that Mr. Trump knowingly conspired with the Russians in connection with the 2016 election or that he obstructed justice with the required corrupt intent. I also don’t care. I care only that the work be done, well and completely. If it is, justice will have prevailed and core American values will have been protected at a time when so much of our national leadership has abandoned its commitment to truth and the rule of law,” Comey wrote.

Comey also discouraged impeaching the president, arguing that it would only further divide the country.

“Because if Mr. Trump were removed from office by Congress, a significant portion of this country would see this as a coup, and it would drive those people farther from the common center of American life, more deeply fracturing our country,” Comey said.

Texto completo: Sometimes stories are simpler than they’re made out to be. That appears to be the case with Jeff Bezos. When the National Enquirer reported that Bezos, the Amazon founder who is the world’s richest man, was having an extramarital affair and had sent racy texts, including photos of his penis, to his girlfriend, Bezos assembled a high-priced legal and PR team to mount an aggressive defense.
All of a sudden, sympathetic commentators began suggesting Bezos had been hacked. There was word that a "government entity" had gotten hold of the texts and photos. There was dark speculation of international intrigue, that Saudi Arabia might have used the Enquirer to target Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, in retaliation for the Post’s coverage of the murder of the columnist and Saudi regime critic Jamal Khashoggi. And of course, President Donald Trump played some sort of behind-the-scenes role.
Bezos orchestrated it all, using his security consultant to feed information to his newspaper, and also writing a much-discussed personal statement published on Medium.
"This statement that (Bezos) has released tonight is absolutely extraordinary," MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell said on Feb. 7, "and I think it is a gigantic moment, actually in this history of our digital communication, which everyone has known has been at risk for quite a while, that any one of us could be hacked. We could have private things revealed through stolen emails, stolen texts, that sort of thing. And here is someone who stands up and says, I’m not going to take it anymore."
"The Saudis are being brazen," MSNBC’s Chuck Todd said on Feb. 8. "We’ve caught them being brazen with Qatar. We’ve caught them being brazen with Jamal Khashoggi. This would not surprise if it ends up being more connected to them because they’ve been acting this way."
"The Saudi connection aspect of the allegation from Jeff Bezos," said CNN’s Chris Cuomo, also on Feb. 8. "Bezos says ... that you had (National Enquirer chief David) Pecker go to the White House with a Saudi guy that he was trying to raise money from. The dinner was a reward from the president. The Khashoggi reporting that The Washington Post did would really bother the Saudis, the Saudis wound up giving Pecker the money. Pecker’s now going after Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, maybe this has something to do with the Saudis, maybe even the president."
And so on. The Bezos team spun quite a story. But holes quickly appeared in their handiwork.
In early March, The New York Times published a detailed look at how the long-married Bezos came to be involved with his girlfriend, former Los Angeles local news anchor Lauren Sanchez. As the two got together, the paper reported, a smitten Sanchez was not shy about sharing intimate details of the relationship with her friends.
"By last year, they were having an affair," the Times wrote. "Three people in Ms. Sanchez’s extended social circle said she was giddy and in love, showing amorous texts to a number of Brentwood and Beverly Hills moms."
Sanchez was, to say the least, not particularly discreet in handling the revealing texts and photos Bezos sent to her. And then there was, in the Times’ description, Sanchez’s "fame-hungry brother-manager," Michael Sanchez, described as a "loose cannon" and an "incorrigible gossip even in a town full of them."
Now, The Wall Street Journal reports that Michael Sanchez, "a talent agent who has managed television pundits and reality-show judges," has also "long been a source for the Enquirer." And, according to the paper, Michael Sanchez sold the Bezos texts to the Enquirer for $200,000.
Imagine that. Mogul sends deeply private texts to gossipy L.A. girlfriend who has gossipy, fame-hungry brother, and somehow it gets out! No Saudis required.
It is not unusual for men caught sexting with women not their wives to claim they have been hacked, or that their texts have somehow been stolen. Remember that Anthony Weiner tried the same thing. But few have the resources of Jeff Bezos, and few could rely on so many media commentators to spread the story.
At the same time, the Bezos spectacle also attracted the attention of more serious journalists, who found out that the real Bezos story is much simpler than all the Saudi speculation. It is, in fact, an old story, of people acting foolishly in the course of an extramarital affair. All the money in the world couldn’t change that.

Profiling Bold-Face Names, but Not in Their Face

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine who occasionally writes for Arts, discussed the tech she's using.
You're known for writing profiles of people like Tonya Harding and Bradley Cooper . What tools do you use to make sure people forget they're in an interview and that they open up?
I have a small Olympus WS-801 recorder, but I don't think they ever forget about it because I don't. I'm constantly checking to make sure it's really running and the volume is really up. But it's not, like, equipment. I'm not wearing headphones or using a microphone. I never ever ever ask anyone to speak directly into the recorder, unless there are very extenuating circumstances. Hasn't happened in a while.
Some of the people you write about have chaotic schedules, and they probably surprise you with unexpected interview times. What do you do, and what tech equipment do you need to have at the ready for these sudden interviews?
I have been at basketball games with my kids and dentist appointments (my own!) when suddenly a secondary interview -- the only kind I'll do on the phone, though I've spoken with primary subjects on the phone after our meetings for follow-up -- comes in. I always have my Olympus on me. I have one on my desk at work and one in my bag at all times.
I also use this incredible, simple contraption called the Olympus TP-8 Telephone Pick-up Microphone (no, I am not sponsored by Olympus, but, hey, Olympus, if you're reading this, give me a call), which hooks up to my tape recorder, goes into my ear, and therefore picks up both my end and the other end.
It's like $21, and whoever thought of it should win a Nobel. I have a transcriber, a very nice woman, who gets upset at me if I do interviews while we eat or if the sound quality is terrible, and during those moments, it is her I am serving more than anyone else. I see people using iPhones or TapeACall, and those things are so unreliable-seeming and tenuous I can't bear it. It would absolutely affect the interviews if I were worried on that level about sound and the thing working.
How do you use social media tools to communicate with celebrities and other people whom you profile?
I never communicate over social with people I'm writing about. I give them my card at the end of our first meeting and put my cell onto it, and if they have something they forgot to tell me or are worried about, they can contact me.
It has led to a lot of further interactions that have really made the story. Also, it's helpful to ask Bradley Cooper over text what kind of hat he was wearing rather than go through other people, particularly during film promotion time. I'm not so organized all the time, and sometimes I don't think to ask pertinent questions until I read the transcript or realize I want to describe something I saw that I didn't ask about in the room.
When people you write about share a story or not share what you've written on social media, what do you generally consider that to mean?
God, that's a hard one. I think it's really hard to be written about. You're essentially vulnerable to a stranger. I feel very bad for everyone I write about. I tell them before publication: "You can read this if you want, but it's not really for you. It's about you, but it's not for you."
When someone asks if it's a good or a bad story, I always say, "It's not good or bad, it's a third thing." Some people want to stay in touch. Some people never want to see me again. There are very few people who have hated their story.
But that's not the same as the person being comfortable with it. If I do a good job and tell the intimate story that I, as a reader, want to read, then probably that person I wrote about never wants to be in a room with me again.
This is a long way of saying: I don't take it personally. I don't even notice most of the time when it happens, because I unfollow people pretty quickly because the experience was also very intense for me, and it's sad to me that I have these short-lived intensive relationships and then they're over. Like, when "Shakespeare in Love" used to come on HBO, I'd watch it. Now I have a hard time watching it. When I see Gwyneth, I have every emotion I had when I was reporting and writing and closing and publishing that story, which is the opposite of escapism.
Do you use social media less or more over time and why?
I really like it and sometimes I hate it, but I can't really chart it. Instagram is boring mostly. Facebook is boring, but I like seeing my friends and their kids and their dogs and stuff. I met one of my best friends on Twitter, Reyhan. Twitter! You can meet a best friend and get an alt-right trolling on the same day! Who could have predicted this?
I do know that if people love your story and there's a real thunder on social media, there's a twinge because you know if you like it too much, you'll have to one day experience its inverse, which is the incredible internet dragging that awaits each and every one of us. I don't think I really answered this question.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: In Rome, the college of cardinals is gathering to mourn one pope and select his successor. An ambitious rogue cardinal arrives on the island of Malta seeking ancient documents from the secretive Knights of Malta that will pave his way to the papacy. These are just two strands of the convoluted plot of "The Malta Exchange" (Minotaur Books, 393 pp., ), the 14th novel by Steve Berry featuring Cotton Malone, a retired Justice Department operative turned seller of rare books.
Malone arrives in Lake Como, Italy, in pursuit of letters exchanged between British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini that British intelligence fears will reveal some embarrassing dealmaking aimed at preventing Italy from joining forces with Germany in World War II.
Why is this so urgent in the 21st century? You got me. But Berry is a New York Times best-selling author, so to quote Pope Francis, "Who am I to judge?"
As Malone arrives at a villa to nab the letters, bullets zing by, bodies are strung up and, inexplicably, a bear rumbling through the villa attacks Malone. Soon, Malone is entwined in the case of Cardinal Gallo, the papal wannabe, and a murderous subsector of the Knights of Malta, a Catholic humanitarian group with its own agenda for the new pope. Gallo's estranged identical twin, Pollux, has been temporarily placed in charge of the Knights, seeking to thwart his brother's ambitions.
Author Berry has a passion for history and historical preservation, so look for long passages about the Catholic Church, Constantine, Mussolini and various other European conquerors. You'll find yourself wondering about several key plot points: Is any of this really true? For the most part, Berry confesses in an epilogue at the end, it isn't.
If you can make your way through a tortuous plot with dialogue that can be as wooden as a church pew, Berry makes some interesting points about religion and how powerful men created the tenets of faith (manufacturing the concepts of ideas of heaven, hell and the devil) to control the masses. But in the finale, good old Cotton shows he has a taste of his own for some righteous religious vengeance.
Steve Berry is passionate about history

Drug pricing is a deadly national scandal; Sun Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: "Your money or your life!" was a laugh line in a radio skit by the comedian Jack Benny, who pretended to be a skinflint. To the robber's demand, Benny replied, after a long pause, "I'm thinking. I'm thinking."
Today, your money or your life is a deadly serious dilemma that confronts Americans not so often at the point of a gun as at the pharmacy counter.
As many as one in every five Americans are trying to cope with Big Pharma's morally indefensible pricing schemes by leaving prescriptions unfilled, skipping doses or splitting pills. Such desperate economies, coupled with unwitting failure to take medications properly, are said to contribute to some 125,000 deaths every year and as much as $289 billion in additional health costs.
These staggering statistics are found in a Florida House of Representatives staff report on legislation (HB 19) that incorporates Gov. Ron DeSantis' proposal to let state agencies and private pharmacies import less expensive drugs from Canada and elsewhere.
The House Health Quality subcommittee approved it 12-2 last week, despite the usual obfuscations from Big Pharma. The bill has other House committees to clear, as well as a Senate that may be less receptive. If it doesn't get over the finish line, there will be no good excuse.
Drug pricing is a scandal that politicians of both parties are now recognizing. They are informed by stories like that of Alex Raeshawn Smith, a restaurant manager in Minnesota who would have had to pay $1,300 a month, almost half his salary, for the insulin he needed when he aged out of his mother's health insurance coverage. He tried rationing what he could afford and was found dead of diabetic ketoacidosis, an empty insulin pen nearby. He was barely 26.
The cost of drugs is one of the reasons why Americans spend more on health care - with less to show for it - than almost anywhere else.
Though it's not the most outrageously priced lifesaving drug, insulin is one of the most common and has become Exhibit A in the national outcry. The doctors who discovered insulin sold their patent to the University of Toronto for only $1, intending it as a gift to humanity. Between 2009 and 2017, the cost of a single vial of Humalog rose from $92.70 to $274.70. It cost only $21 when marketed as the first short-acting insulin in 1996. Feeling political pressure, Eli Lilly & Co., the manufacturer, is now offering the same drug as a generic at half price. But that's still $45 more than it cost just 10 years ago.
When Nevada enacted a law to make insulin makers disclose more price increase details, the industry hired 70 lobbyists to fight the bill. In Tallahassee, at least 63 lobbyists are registered for the trade group and its constituent companies.
The DeSantis proposal, as filed by Rep. Tom Leek, R-Ormond Beach, would need approval from Washington to take effect. That's a long shot. The Department of Health and Human Services has the power to waive the federal law that essentially allows only manufacturers to import drugs, but it has turned down every state and local request.
Florida should add to the pressure. Sometimes it works. The pharmaceutical industry put a lid on price increases while President Bill Clinton's health reform was under debate in 1993.
Though the governor said he has President Donald Trump's support for Florida to import from Canada, the White House was noncommittal. DeSantis needs to keep the pressure on Trump, too.
The federal government historically has parroted Big Pharma's propaganda about foreign drugs not being safe. Such cases are infrequent. In fact, as the New York Times reported, 25 percent of drugs labeled American are made elsewhere in plants inspected by the Food and Drug Administration, as well as 80 percent of the active ingredients used in American factories.
The probability that Canadian imports would help Floridians cope raises a fundamental question. Why does the same drug cost less in Canada - and almost everywhere else - than in the United States? It's because other countries regulate the price of drugs through one mechanism or another. Some stipulate that the price of a drug decline as it ages. Here, it goes just the other way.
The medical industry is immune to the normal effects of competition. For one thing, a critical drug probably has only one, or at most three, suppliers. And when one of them raises a price, the others inevitably do. People who need the drug have no choice.
It's for similar reasons that the Legislature should not repeal Florida's certificate of need law. To allow uncontrolled expansion of hospitals and clinics would mean only more MRI machines and other expensive technology to be charged to the same number of patients, swiftly raising costs to the taxpayers as well.
The United States must face the necessity of drug price controls. Medicines on which people's lives and health depend need to be regulated no less than the prices of two other essential commodities, electricity and natural gas. Utilities account to the states for their investments and expenses, and are awarded a reasonable rate of return. Big Pharma, on the other hand, accounts to no one but its stockholders, and only in ways that don't tell whether prices fairly reflect costs.
Congress sought to help with the so-called Orphan Drugs program, which Ronald Reagan signed into law. It gives benefits - including extended patent protection for drugs that might not be otherwise profitable because fewer than 200,000 people would need them. Here's what has happened with that: Manufacturers have found so many ways to relabel them for other purposes that such best-selling drugs as Crestor, Abilify and Humira have enjoyed "orphan" protection.
In one breathtaking stunt, Allergan sold patent rights for its popular and pricey eyedrop Restasis to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. A federal judge accused it of trying to "rent the tribe's sovereign immunity" to avoid having patents repealed for having been granted in error. The case is on appeal to the Supreme Court.
No matter the reform, Big Pharma will fight it. Its allies at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have flooded the internet with propaganda against a U.S. government proposal called the International Pricing Index Model. In test markets not yet announced, Medicare would set price ceilings based loosely on those in Canada and some other nations, and allow drug vendors to compete within those limits. It would apply only to drugs dispensed to Medicare Part B patients in doctors' offices and hospital outpatient departments, which have faced price increases averaging 9.8 percent a year.
The Chamber claims that this "would import alarming policies from foreign governments with socialized health care systems ... block access to life-saving drugs for America's seniors, inhibit the research and development necessary to discover new treatments, and threaten our nation's free-market health care system, currently one of the best of the world."
That is, of course, Big Pharma's hysterical, nonsensical and shopworn mantra against anything that might eat into its profits. In this case, the fear is that what might work for Medicare would work for everyone. In that happy event, people would no longer have to die for lack of medicines they can't afford.

Caption: Gov. Ron DeSantis wants Floridians to be able to access less expensive drugs from Canada, but Washington is noncommittal. Florida should keep the pressure up. Drug prices need controls. This insulin drug cost $21 in 1996. Now it costs $274. The cost is killing people.

Texto completo: ALGONA, Iowa -- It was the kind of question that a politician should have been able to handle with ease, but Representative Steve King is not any politician.
"Do you think a white society is superior to a nonwhite society?" Mary Lavelle, 63, asked, testing his reputation for white supremacist sympathies.
"I don't have an answer for that. That's so hypothetical," Mr. King, Republican of Iowa, told her. "I'll say this, America is not a white society -- it has never been a completely white society. We came here and joined the Native Americans."
He continued: "I've long said that a baby can be lifted out of a cradle anywhere in the world and brought into any home in America, whatever the color of the folks in that household, and they can be raised to be American as any other. And I believe that every one of us, every one of us, is created in God's image."
Ms. Lavelle said she asked the question in this northern Iowa town of 5,000 because she worried that anti-immigrant language used in a manifesto written by the suspect in the mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, resembled Mr. King's own talking points. His fumbling answer to a relatively simple query may have done little to allay those concerns, two months after Mr. King, a nine-term Republican with a long history of racist comments, was publicly rebuked by members of his own party.
House Republican leaders removed Mr. King from his committee assignments in January, after comments he made to The New York Times questioned why the phrase "white supremacy" was considered offensive. A number of powerful party leaders, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican, suggested he should resign, and the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution disapproving of Mr. King's statements.
Mr. King remained defiant after losing his committee seats, and released a statement insisting that his comments had been misunderstood. He said he had been referring only to "Western civilization" when he asked "how did that language become offensive," not "white nationalist" or "white supremacist."
Mr. King again faced scrutiny on Monday after a post on his Facebook page speculated who would win a second civil war between red states and blue states.
"Folks keep talking about another civil war; one side has about 8 trillion bullets while the other side doesn't know which bathroom to use," read the post, which has since been deleted.
On Tuesday, pressed by a reporter from CNN, Mr. King told constituents that he "wasn't aware" that the image had been published on his Facebook page the night before, and said he does not personally manage that page.
"I wish it had never gone up," he said.
But he also sought to deflect the question, telling the reporter, "it's interesting that nobody here asked that question," while gesturing to his constituents.
"The only people who care about that is national news media. Nobody has raised the issue around here," he said, prompting a handful of attendees to protest. The exchange was quickly picked up by American Bridge, a liberal political action committee.
But Ms. Lavelle clearly did care about Mr. King's incendiary language. After being asked about the manifesto, Mr. King responded at length. He said the author of the manifesto had expressed as much sympathy for Communist China as white supremacy. "The further it went, the more inconsistent it became, and he seems to have mixed and matched ideologies," he said.
Pressed about the overlap between the manifesto's language and his own, Mr. King responded, "He also likely used the same words that Mao used."

Texto completo: McCain fires back at Trump
Meghan McCain said Monday that President Donald Trump is leading a "pathetic life" as she escalated her pushback against Trump's weekend attacks on Twitter against her late father.
"He spends his weekend obsessing over great men, because he knows it, and I know it, and all of you know it, he will never be a great man," McCain, a co-host of ABC's "The View," said of Trump during Monday's episode. Sen. John McCain died last August.
Fox hires Brazile - Former Democratic National Committee chief Donna Brazile, who was fired by CNN for tipping off the Hillary Clinton campaign about debate topics in 2016, has joined Fox News Channel as a political commentator.
Brazile said Monday she knows fellow liberals will criticize her for joining Fox but that it's important for people not to just talk to people who agree with them. "There's an audience on Fox News that doesn't hear enough from Democrats," Brazile said in a statement.
Archive dedicated to Lou Reed - The New York Public Library has opened an archive dedicated to pioneering alternative rock musician Lou Reed. The library acquired the archive after performance artist and musician Laurie Anderson, who was married to Reed, decided to share it with an institution that could preserve and showcase the archive. The New York Times reports the archive includes a large collection of personal notes, photographs and more than 600 hours of recordings. Reed died in 2013.

Texto completo: I have an affinity for any living thing that thinks I'm the greatest thing that ever walked the Earth and doesn't ask for anything beyond a Milk Bone in return. That immediately eliminates my wife. She hates Milk Bones.
Our dog Rosie, however, would walk through a tire fire if there were a cookie to be had on the other side. She is a girl of simple pleasures. Her IQ, I would think, is something akin to a salad bar, which based on stories this week would be good enough to allow her to be the coxswain on the USC rowing team.
But she, like some of the "student-athletes" named this week, wanted no part of college. She just doesn't have verbal skills. Rosie is able to make herself abundantly clear without having to learn the highly technical skill of conversation. She speaks with her eyes and, on occasion, her nose.
For instance, she has one look that says, "I have to go outside and poop." She has another look (uncannily similar to the first) that says, "I have to go outside and pee." On her
return she gets a cookie for being a "good girl."
She also has a third look, which often comes shortly after the first two that says, "I don't really have to poop or pee but I want to go outside anyway because when I come back you're always stupid enough to give me another cookie."
The nose part of her conversation is an urgent suggestion. It is generally a frontal stab in the groin area that is roughly translated as, "I don't have time to talk to you with my eyes, so let's go."
That's pretty much it for Rosie's communication skills. She's good at lying down but not much in the way of participating in the sit, stay, heel, or roll over aspects of canine education. She's big, soft, sweet and kind. None of which can be said about her masters.
But this week, Rosie seemed to have a bit of a tude. She had obviously read the story of the Iditarod sled dog race in Alaska where a team of dogs rose up and simply said, "Enough of this schlepping through blizzards, who's up for Miami Beach?" When two dogs got into a scrap, the driver of the team who happened to be leading the race by five hours yelled at them to stop. And they did. For good! It seems that he violated some sort of secret dog code and embarrassed the pack, which in the end, of course, embarrassed him.
How did this happen you ask?
According to a story in the New York Times about what animals really feel, the one emotion that all animals feel is guilt. But, it seems in this case, according to a jury of it's peers (the other 12 dogs give or take a husky or two) decided that they the mushees were "Not guilty." The guilty party was actually the musher.
It was Mark Twain who once aptly said, "Man is the only animal that blushes. Or needs to."
So, in the end, that poor musher in Alaska has got to explain to his human fellow mushers why he's freezing his tush off in Nome while his dogs are checking into the Fontainebleau. All the while in my house Rosie was looking at me like she's either immensely proud or she has to poop. It took me a while to figure out which one it was. I now know it was the latter.
I can tell by the ice bag on my groin.

Let's remember: We and nature are one

Texto completo: The New York Times on Sunday published a beautifully photographed tale about fly fishing for trout in Patagonia.
Spun in the timeless "me and Joe go fishing'' reportage genre, albeit more polished than some yarns in this category, writer Jon Gluck's have-fly-rod-will-travel adventure recalled Izaak Walton's keen reminder centuries ago that, "God never did make a more calm, quiet innocent recreation than angling.''
Or maybe not.
To read some of the 50-plus reader comments appended to the online version of the narrative, one would have thought Gluck and his wader-clad pals had arrived in Chile brandishing Kalashnikovs, not carefully cased 9-foot, 5-weight graphite wands.
"Can we not leave a few places on this planet where wild animals ... can grow to their historic sizes without being lusted after by some human?'' lamented Trish Marie from Michigan. Karen B. of California chipped in, "Now more rich humans will go disturb nature instead of just appreciating it.''
All of which is another reminder that, of this nation's various ills, the belief, seemingly ever growing, particularly on the East and West coasts, that people and nature are somehow separate, is among the scariest.
George Monbiot in his book, "Feral,'' described this phenomenon as "dewilding.''
"I am not quite sure how this happened,'' Monbiot wrote, "(but) I had found myself living a life in which loading a dishwasher presented an interesting challenge.''
Only through "rewilding'' ourselves and the world, Monbiot believes, can people avoid the "ill-defined longing'' that he interprets as "ecological boredom,'' a condition whose inevitable dead end is societal stupefaction.
None of which, fortunately, will be on display this weekend during the Great Waters Fly Fishing Expo (greatwatersflyexpo.com) at Hamline University, sponsored by Minnesota Trout Unlimited.
It's there that a few thousand anglers, and anglers-to-be, will gather in a celebration not of ecological boredom but of ecological excitement.
The expo's many attractions and seminars will include instruction in fly casting and fly tying. But none will exemplify the gathering's positive conservation vibe more than Amber Taylor's report on Minnesota Trout Unlimited's environmental education program, which stresses to kids the interconnections of land, water, fish -- and people.
"The program is designed for students in grades four through 12,'' said Taylor, the fishing group's education program supervisor and overseer of the group's Trout in the Classroom program. "We set the schools up with aquariums and other equipment, including 'chillers' to keep the water between 48 and 53 degrees, which trout need. Then the class receives about 300 rainbow trout eggs, which the students hatch and raise to fingerlings.''
Funded in part by a grant from the Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources, using lottery proceeds, the plan's approximate cost is $2,000 per school. Included is a spring field trip for students to cold-water streams, so they can release their trout.
Many students also visit the streams in autumn. Donning waders and turning over rocks, the kids -- many knee-deep in trout water for the first time -- hunt for various insects that can be telltale of a waterway's health.
"Kids who otherwise wouldn't be engaged in science get excited to have the little fish in their room,'' Taylor said. "Exposing kids to the importance of clean water is one goal. But at the end of the day, trout are just a platform to show how important it is to take care of the environment, and to show how everything is connected.''
Intrigued herself by trout and trout fishing, Taylor intends to take advantage this weekend of the expo's continued emphasis on attracting more women to fly angling.
Seminars that specifically target women are planned for Friday and Saturday. Additionally, Friday night at Hamline, Fly Fishing Women of Minnesota (flyfishingwomenmn.com) will co-host a social along with other women's fly angling groups.
"We think women are, or can be, just as interested as men in fly fishing,'' said Carl Haensel, an educator, writer, photographer and fishing guide who lives in Duluth. With his conservation-biologist and photographer partner, Jade Thomason, Haensel manages the Great Waters Fly Fishing Expo for Minnesota Trout Unlimited.
"From a broader perspective, the more people we get on the water to enjoy our natural resources, including women, men and kids, the more effective advocates we'll have when those resources are threatened,'' Haensel said. "That's what Minnesota TU's efforts are intended to do, to get more people involved in conservation.''
Which in its way is an attempt at "rewilding.''
Of course, some people -- Trish Marie from Michigan and Karen B. from California come to mind -- will remain forever immune to nature's full seduction.
Walton noted as much in his "The Compleat Angler,'' published in 1653.
"Rivers and the inhabitants of the watery elements are made for wise men to contemplate," Walton wrote, "and for fools to pass by without consideration."

Texto completo: Newsday Media Group has signed a 15-year lease to relocate to a new headquarters in Melville, executives of the company said Thursday.
Newsday plans to move to 130,000 square feet at 6/8 Corporate Center Dr., a two-building complex connected by an inside walkway, around Labor Day, the executives said. The buildings are owned by The We're Group.
The new location is about a mile from the paper's longtime offices at 235 Pinelawn Rd. in Melville.
"Newsday's new state-of-the-art headquarters will be a bright, comfortable, energized environment," Newsday Media Group owner Patrick Dolan said in a statement.
"We're looking forward to our next chapter and continuing Newsday's long-standing commitment to the region and to journalism," Newsday publisher Debby Krenek said.
Hartz Mountain Industries, a Secaucus, New Jersey-based real estate developer, purchased Newsday's 413,500-square-foot Pinelawn Road building from property owner Tribune Media Co. for $54.5 million last fall.
The new owner plans to knock down the current facility and build two industrial buildings - one 600,000 square feet and the other 200,000 square feet - on the site, Gus Milano, president of Hartz, said in November.
Milano said then that he didn't expect to begin construction on the 48.3-acre site before 2020.
Newsday, formerly printed in Melville, is now printed by The New York Times Co. at its production facility in College Point, Queens.

Texto completo: The maybe-final episodes of "Arrested Development" hit Netflix. And a new documentary on Richard Pryor is on TV.
What's Streaming
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT Stream on Netflix. The first time this sharp, reliably unconventional takedown of upper-crust America wrapped up was in 2006, when Fox canceled it after three seasons. The show's somewhat unlikely Netflix-powered return in 2013 brought back the wealthy Bluth family -- including Michael (Jason Bateman), Lucille (Jessica Walter), Gob (Will Arnett) and George-Michael (Michael Cera) -- for a fourth, somewhat more conventional outing that was met with middling reviews from critics. When the first half of the fifth season was released last year, much of the discussion focused not on the show itself but on one of its stars, Jeffrey Tambor, who had been accused of sexual misconduct on the set of the Amazon series "Transparent" and dropped from that series. Now, Netflix is releasing the second half of Season 5. This set of episodes continues plot arcs from the first half of the season, including a missing person investigation and an attempt to build a wall on the Mexican border.
MOUNTAINS MAY DEPART (2015) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In a review of the Chinese director Jia Zhangke's new film, "Ash Is Purest White," for The New York Times, A. O. Scott called him "one the most inventive and engaged directors of the 21st century." Jia's previous movie, "Mountains May Depart," takes place at the very end of the 20th century and during two periods in the 21st. It centers on Tao (Zhao Tao), a worker in a small store in the city of Fenyang. The first part, set in 1999, shows Tao's relationships with two men, Zhang Jinsheng (Zhang Yi) and Liangzi (Liang Jin Dong). She eventually chooses one. The effects of that decision echo in the film's two other time frames: 2014 and 2025. Jia's approach "means that you have to do a certain amount of interpretive work," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. But patience will be rewarded.
What's on TV
MARY SHELLEY (2018) 8 p.m. on Showtime. Elle Fanning plays Mary Shelley in this biopic, directed by the groundbreaking Saudi filmmaker Haifaa al-Mansour. The movie gives equal weight to the origin story of Shelley herself and the origin story of her novel "Frankenstein."
I AM RICHARD PRYOR 10 p.m. on Paramount Network and 11:30 p.m. on Comedy Central. Fresh off a recent premiere at South by Southwest, this documentary about Richard Pryor enlists an assortment of voices to paint a portrait of one of the most influential comedians ever to wield a microphone. While its straightforward blend of talking heads and archival clips is more conventional than its subject, the film -- built around interviews with Pryor's wife, Jennifer Lee Pryor, and entertainers like Tiffany Haddish, Howie Mandel and Lily Tomlin -- gives an overview of Pryor's career alongside discussion of the boundaries he pushed and, in some cases, obliterated.

Texto completo: Facebook Inc.'s top executive in charge of all products, Chris Cox, the longtime confidant of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, is leaving the company. It's the highest-level departure at the social media giant amid nearly two years of sustained crises.
Cox's unexpected departure, which he and Zuckerberg announced in separate Facebook posts Thursday, comes months after Cox was promoted in a major reorganization.
Last May, Cox was put in charge of Facebook's "family of apps," including Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Facebook itself -- which together have more than 2.7 billion users worldwide. These apps have been distinct until recently, when Zuckerberg announced plans to unify them under a banner of privacy.

Chris Daniels -- an executive who ran Internet.org, the company's philanthropic project to promote global internet access, and was recently promoted to lead WhatsApp -- is leaving as well, Zuckerberg said.
Facebook will not appoint a direct replacement for Cox; rather, the leaders of each app will report to Zuckerberg. Longtime Facebook executive Will Cathcart will head WhatsApp.
"It is with great sadness I share with you that after thirteen years, I've decided to leave the company," Cox wrote in his post. "Since I was twenty-three, I've poured myself into these walls. This place will forever be a part of me." Cox didn't offer any explanation for his departure.
In his blog post, Zuckerberg said that Cox had told him that he planned to move on several years ago, but that Cox decided to hold off on leaving until the company made more progress combating misinformation and Russian meddling -- controversies that erupted in the wake of the 2016 presidential election.
"We have made real progress on many issues and we have a clear plan for our apps," Zuckerberg said in his post. "As we embark on this next major chapter, Chris has decided now is the time to step back from leading these teams."
Cox, who dropped out of a Stanford University graduate program to work with Zuckerberg when the company had just 15 engineers, was widely seen as one of Facebook's most popular and capable executives -- and a potential replacement CEO, were Zuckerberg to leave. (Zuckerberg has said he has no plans to exit.)
Perhaps more than anyone else at Facebook, even more than Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Cox was a sounding board for Zuckerberg on product ideas. He launched Facebook's flagship scrolling news feed nearly a decade ago and ran human resources before he was promoted to run the Facebook app in 2014.
The announcements of Cox's and Daniels' exits come during a bumpy week for Facebook.
On Wednesday morning a global outage hit its services. Facebook announced Wednesday night that Instagram was back in service, and Thursday morning -- about 24 hours after the problem began -- it said that the issue had been caused by "a server configuration change" and that its systems were recovering.
During the outage, Facebook product director Rob Leathern said on Twitter that people were also unable to access the social network's ad interfaces, which may exacerbate any lost revenue. The company also raised the possibility of issuing refunds to advertisers.
Compounding Facebook's woes was a report about a federal criminal investigation into the company. The New York Times, citing unnamed sources, reported late Wednesday that a grand jury had issued subpoenas as part of an investigation into Facebook's data-sharing deals.

When Parents Jump In Even When You're 28

Texto completo: Bribing SAT proctors. Fabricating students' athletic credentials. Paying off college officials. The actions that some wealthy parents were charged with Tuesday -- to secure their children a spot at elite colleges -- are illegal and scandalous. But they're part of a broader pattern, albeit on the extreme end of the continuum: parents' willingness to do anything it takes to help their grown children succeed.
As college has become more competitive and young adults' economic prospects less assured, parents have begun spending much more time and money on their children -- including well after they turn 18. Modern parenting typically remains hands-on, and gets more expensive, when children become young adults, according to a new survey by Morning Consult for The New York Times.
A significant share of parents, across income levels, say they're involved in their adult children's daily lives. That includes making doctor's appointments, reminding them of school and other deadlines, and offering advice on romantic life, found the survey, which was of a nationally representative sample of 1,508 people ages 18 to 28 and 1,136 parents of people that age. More than half of parents give their adult children some form of monthly financial assistance.
Colleges now routinely have offices of parent relations. Companies including LinkedIn, Amazon and Google have hosted bring-your-parents-to-work days. Parents have applied to jobs on behalf of their children; lobbied their employers for a raise; and attended job interviews with them. They have called their children's roommates to resolve disagreements or to check on their children's whereabouts.
For certain members of the superrich, the tactics have been extraordinary -- nobody would equate accusations of bribery with helping a college-aged child with homework or a job application. The factors driving most parents, researchers say, are widening inequality, the growing importance of a college degree, and the fact that for the first time, children of this generation are as likely as not to be less prosperous than their parents.
"It's the same thing but on a much different level," said Laura Hamilton, author of "Parenting to a Degree: How Family Matters for College and Beyond" and a sociologist at the University of California, Merced. "It's really hard for parents to understand why you wouldn't do anything you could do to assist your children. If you have the influence, the connections and the money, it's not surprising to me that the parents made these choices."
Even more typical parental involvement can backfire, many experts say, by leaving young adults ill-prepared for independent adult life, and unable to succeed at the schools and jobs their parents helped them get to.
"When one is hand-held through life, they don't develop a sense of self-efficacy and life skills," said Julie Lythcott-Haims, the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success" and a former dean of freshmen at Stanford. "This sense among parents that I've got to get my kid to the right future is overlooking the fact that your kid has to get themselves there."
It's a continuation of the kind of intensive parenting that has become the norm in the United States. Today's parents, especially mothers, are spending more time and money on their children than any previous generation -- on things like lessons, tutors and test prep. Many parents' anxiety only intensifies after 18, when children start the education and jobs they've been preparing for.
"Professional helicopter parents are really focused on using education to get their children into a professional career," Ms. Hamilton said. "Their goal is basically to prevent their children from ever making a mistake."
This kind of behavior is most prevalent among privileged parents, those with collegiate experience and wealth. In places with the biggest gaps between the rich and the poor, rich parents spend an even larger share of their incomes on their children, a recent paper found. The bribery scandal shows how far some parents will go -- in one example, parents were accused of paying $1.2 million to help get their child into an Ivy League college.
More commonly, financial help comes in the form of tuition or rent payments. Parents used to spend the most money on their children during high school, according to Consumer Expenditure Survey data analyzed by the sociologists Sabino Kornrich and Frank Furstenberg. But now they spend the most before age 6 and after age 18 and into children's 20s.
The increases in later years are because so many more children are going to college, which has become much more expensive, Mr. Kornrich said. Also, about a third of children this age still live at home. In the new survey by Morning Consult and The Times, about two-thirds of those who lived with their parents said it was because they could not afford to live on their own or were still in school.
One in three parents said they gave their 18-and-over children $100 or more a month, and 44 percent of those with children in college made tuition or loan payments for them. When asked at what age people should be financially independent from their parents, the largest share of young people said 25 to 28.
Recent research shows that even parents who can't afford to give their grown children money increasingly provide them with significant support of other kinds. In the survey, wealthier parents were more likely to report giving their children money than less affluent ones were, but many nonfinancial measures of parental support remained consistent across income and education levels.
For example, three-quarters of parents with children ages 18 to 28 said they had reminded their children of school and other deadlines they needed to meet -- whether the parents reported a low or high income. Four in ten parents, across income and education levels, said they offered romantic advice to their children.Parents gave their children less money, professional advice and job application help as they got older. Romantic advice, however, did not taper off.
Parents reported a more engaged relationship with their grown children than they once had with their own parents. They said they spent more time with their children, communicated with them more often and gave more advice than their parents had when they were the same age. Eight in ten said they were "always" or "often" in text message communication with their adult children.
This period of life has become so established that researchers have given it a name: emerging adulthood. In some ways, it has become harder to be an adult. Wages have stagnated, while the cost of college, homes, health care and child care have climbed. This generation has record student loan debt and low homeownership rates.
"There's no room for risk," Ms. Hamilton said. "It's not like in 1970 when you could screw around a little because every extra year of college didn't cost you an arm and a leg and not graduating wasn't incredibly risky."
Cultural changes play a role, too. White, native-born American families previously had an expectation that adult children should separate from their families, said Karen Fingerman, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the relationships between young adults and their parents. But that's changing as families are remaining closer throughout their lives, with more intergenerational support. Technology has made it possible for parents and grown children to stay in constant contact. Young people are marrying less and later, and parents are having fewer children, so they have more attention and money to devote to each one.
There are many benefits to parents' increased involvement in their grown children's lives. Ideally, she said, the relationship goes both ways, with adult children providing support and assistance to their parents, too. About a quarter of people 25 to 28 who lived at home said it was because their parents needed help.
"There's more mutual companionship," Ms. Fingerman said. "This is the most important relationship in their lives on both ends."
But experts say there's a line between supporting young adults and stifling their growth. Ms. Lythcott-Haims compares it to teaching children to drive -- the parent starts in the driver's seat, but the goal is to end up in the back seat. "You can't just arrive them at the future you want for them," she said. "They have to do the work to build the skills."
Research has shown that children of hyper-involved parents are often more successful at navigating college and finding good jobs -- but that they are less self-reliant and more likely to face anxiety or depression.

WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF ANYTHING GOES LEADERS ACROSS THE GLOBE ARE CRUSHING OPPONENTS AS THE U.S. FAILS TO CALL THEM OUT

Texto completo: I'm loath to feed Donald Trump's ego. But it's unavoidable. A new global political era is emerging that Mr. Trump, his party and his administration have played a huge role in fostering. Some analysts now label this era "anything goes."
Look around and you see a democratic recession - the number of democracies holding sham elections is steadily mounting - but you see something much more grotesque: Leaders are grabbing power for life, murdering or jailing even the mildest of critics and shamelessly building coalitions with openly racist and bigoted parties.
Most important, they're doing it with utter impunity - confident that either no one is watching or no one will meaningfully call them out.
This is what happens when people think America isn't looking, doesn't care or, worse, has a president who has uttered more than 9,000 lies and misleading statements and has zero moral authority to call out others. When it comes to being a global watchdog that tries to enforce some basic norms of decency, America under Mr. Trump is out to lunch - and a lot of people have figured that out, and so anything goes.
"It's not just that liberal democracy is retreating under pressure from demagogic politicians exploiting the stresses of globalization, rising inequality, economic insecurity, job displacement, immigration, and so on," argues Larry Diamond, author of a prescient new book, "Ill Winds: Saving Democracy From Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition, and American Complacency." "It's that authoritarian forces everywhere perceive that there is no longer any price to pay for ruling as nastily as they want."
So, today, "every type of regime is getting worse," Mr. Diamond adds. "Liberal democracies are becoming more intolerant. Illiberal democracies are electing authoritarian personalities like President [Rodrigo] Duterte in the Philippines, who are purging judges and locking up journalists who dare to criticize them. Authoritarian regimes that once coexisted with pockets of opposition no longer see the need to bother. In Cambodia, the party of the long-ruling dictator, Hun Sen, now controls every seat in Parliament. And China is now constructing the first truly Orwellian surveillance state."
It all makes some of the lyrics of Cole Porter's classic song seem so ahead of their time:
*
The world has gone mad today/ And good's bad today/ And black's white today/ And day's night today/ And that gent today/ You gave a cent today/ Once had several chateaux ./ Anything goes.
Just think of those shocks you've got/ And those knocks you've got/ And those blues you've got/ From that news you've got/ And those pains you've got/ (If any brains you've got) ./ 'Cause Franklin knows/ Anything goes.
*
When America, the world's most influential democracy, has a leader without shame, who is backed by a party without spine willing to prostitute itself to Mr. Trump no matter how low he goes - and both are protected by a virtually state-run network without integrity, called Fox News - it becomes a hunting license for leaders everywhere to go after their own domestic opponents and cross any human rights redline to stay in power.
Troubling allies
We're even talking about some close allies. Last week, Israel's attorney general recommended that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be indicted on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust in connection with three different corruption cases. This comes just after Mr. Netanyahu forged a political alliance with an openly racist, anti-Arab party.
Mr. Netanyahu's new political ally, the Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party, traces its lineage to Rabbi Meir Kahane's outlawed Kach Party, which advocated annexing the West Bank, expelling the Palestinians who lived there and resettling Israeli Arabs in Arab countries. Otzma's leader, Michael Ben-Ari, was denied a visa to the U.S. in 2012 on the grounds of being associated with a violent extremist group.
Among Otzma's leaders, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported, "is former Kahane aide Baruch Marzel, a resident of Hebron who holds a party every year at the grave of Baruch Goldstein, who in 1994 massacred 29 Palestinians at the Cave of the Patriarchs."
These are the people Mr. Netanyahu wants to bring into his government. Why not? No matter how low he sinks, Mr. Trump will always have his back.
Yes, politics can be a dirty business, "but there are sacred areas in which you don't play politics, where there has to be a boundary," says Hebrew University philosopher Moshe Halbertal. And making an alliance "with a racist party is one of them. Because when you do that you actually inflate them and send a message about what kind of speech is permissible."
You may think that "they are just a means to your ends," adds Mr. Halbertal. "But in the end, they will control you, they will dominate your identity," and, in Mr. Netanyahu's case, "they will define who he is, who is Israel, who is Israel in the eyes of world Jewry and who is Israel in the eyes of the world."
Rivals are unleashed
Our enemies and rivals are also worse than ever. Iran has been deeply complicit in the ethnic cleansing of Sunnis in Iraq and Syria, in the use of poison gas by Syria's regime and in the crushing of Lebanese democracy through its proxy the Hezbollah militia.
But Iran gets away with it. The Iranians know that U.S. human rights activists are so focused on Saudi Arabia's vile murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and its bombings in Yemen that they're ignoring Iran's misbehavior. So anything goes.
China's government has felt free enough to admit that it's been forcing religious minorities, particularly Chinese Muslims, into "re-education camps" to eliminate "extremism." But news seeping out of these camps indicates they have "a lot more in common with concentration camps. Thousands of guards carrying spiked clubs, tear gas and stun guns surveil the government's 'students,' who are held in buildings ringed with razor wire and infrared cameras," said Vox, citing a recent report by Agence France-Presse.
Allies of Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, are well on their way to amending the Egyptian Constitution to make him, in effect, president for life, or at least until 2034, and give even more power to the military. Mr. Sisi, who made this power grab after a visit from and praise by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has also arrested far more Egyptians for the mildest of criticism, and snuffed out far more press freedoms, than his predecessor Hosni Mubarak - without a peep out of America.
In Uganda, 74-year-old President Yoweri Museveni got age limits abolished so he can, in effect, also become president for life, after sending troops onto the floor of Parliament to beat up opposition lawmakers objecting to the move.
Larry Diamond says, "A leading Ugandan human rights lawyer wrote to me that with Trump in the White House and Europe silent and democratic norms generally in retreat, African rulers like Museveni now feel emboldened to rule as long and as brutally as they want."
Again, whether it is the presidents of China, Egypt, Uganda, Russia and Turkey all basically making themselves into presidents for life, or Bibi forging an alliance with a racist politician banned from America so that he can cling to power in Israel, or the Saudi crown prince's team murdering moderate journalist/critic Jamal Khashoggi, or allies Poland, Brazil and Hungary all drifting away from democracy under the sway of power-hungry nationalists, it's obvious that none of them, none of them, ever bothered to ask themselves before their respective moves, "But what will the Americans say if we do this?"
They knew the answer: Anything goes.

Texto completo: [Update: The slain Gambino boss shunned the limelight. Here's the latest.]
Francesco Cali, the reputed boss of the Gambino crime family, was fatally shot outside his home on Staten Island on Wednesday night, a senior police official said.
Mr. Cali, 53, was shot six times, the official said. The police said they received a report about the shooting outside 25 Hilltop Terrace in the Todt Hill section of Staten Island around 9:20 p.m. There was also a report of a blue pickup truck leaving the scene around the time of shooting.
Mr. Cali was pronounced dead at Staten Island University Hospital.
A 58-year-old neighbor who gave only his first name, Salvatore, said that he heard a burst of about seven gunshots shortly after 9 p.m.
"I just heard the pow-pow-pow-pow-pow," he said.
He said he rushed to his window but could not see anything. He said the shots were all the same volume, as if fired from the same gun.
Two other neighbors who declined to give their names corroborated Salvatore's descriptions.
The Gambino family was once the nation's largest and most influential organized crime group, but several of its leaders were convicted in the 1990s of crimes that included murder and racketeering.
The family was led at the time by the showy crime boss John J. Gotti, who frequented expensive restaurants and nightclubs with a crew of bodyguards. He took power in the family by arranging for the murder of his predecessor, Paul Castellano, in 1985, in front of Sparks Steak House in Manhattan.
Mr. Gotti was convicted of racketeering and murder in 1992 and died of cancer in prison in 2002, at the age of 61. In 2013 his son, the former Gambino boss John A. Gotti, was stabbed in the stomach in Syosset, N.Y. He survived.
[Read more about the Gambino crime family from The New York Times's files.]
The assassination of Mr. Cali came on the same day that Joseph Cammarano Jr., the reputed acting boss of the Bonanno crime family, was acquitted at trial, and about a week after Carmine J. Persico, a longtime boss of the Colombo crime family, died in prison at age 85.
While it has been decades since a Mafia boss was killed in New York, lower level members have been attacked or killed in recent years.
In October, Sylvester Zottola, 71, a reputed associate of the Bonanno crime family was shot and killed as he waited in his S.U.V. to pick up an order at the drive-through window of a McDonald's in the Bronx.
Just three months earlier, Mr. Zottola's son, Salvatore Zottola, was ambushed by a gunman and left for dead on a leafy street outside his family's Throgs Neck compound. He survived.
On Staten Island, Todt Hill is known for its Mafia history. Castellano, who was the last Gambino boss to be assassinated, owned a home on Benedict Road. A home on nearby Longfellow Avenue served as the filming location of the Corleone compound in "The Godfather."
[Todt Hill, a getaway from the bustling city , offers privacy that has appealed to mob bosses.]
Since the 1990s, the fortunes of the city's five traditional Mafia clans have been on the decline. Federal and state authorities increased their focus on the mob's control of certain industries and unions beginning in the 1980s and improved their use of racketeering laws to loosen the mafia's control. And since eight mob leaders were convicted in 1986 in a federal racketeering trial of operating a commission that ruled the Mafia in the United States, Mafia leaders have avoided the spotlight in fear of coming to the attention of federal and state prosecutors.
By early Thursday morning on Staten Island, the police had strung yellow tape across the street leading to Mr. Cali's home, a large red-brick, two-story colonial style house whose front door stood open.
Prashant Ranyal, 39, who lives in the neighborhood, said he was shaken by the killing. "Whenever you see nice areas you feel like it's peaceful," he added. "When something like this happens you definitely have a second thought about it."
Salvatore, the other neighbor, said he had lived in his house for 12 years and did not know any of his neighbors, which struck him as unusual. "Nobody talks to nobody around here; it's crazy," he said. "People kind of keep to themselves. They like their privacy."
He described the street where the shooting happened as quiet and full of old homes. "Dead street," he said. "Dead quiet all the time."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

What Misogyny Has Looked Like

Texto completo: Misogyny is everywhere. Or at least "misogyny" is everywhere. The word, which conventionally means hatred of women, was once a radical accusation. But recently, it seems to have eclipsed the gentler "sexism" and "chauvinism" in popular use. It's now unremarkable to find "misogyny" in a headline, much less a tweet.
On one end of the spectrum, the term is used to describe societal inequity, evidenced by things such as the gendered wage gap in the United States, the difficulties women have in finding adequate medical care and the career-destroying prerogatives of men like Les Moonves.
"Unfortunately, violent misogyny is nothing new in politics," ran a 2018 CNN headline. "Women's self-harm is being fueled by misogyny," read a Guardian story last August. A New York Times Op-Ed from December explored "The Special Misogyny Reserved for Mothers." Kim Schrier, a pediatrician running for Congress (now a Democratic congresswoman), flatly called Donald Trump "misogynist in chief" in a tweet last year.
A look at archival photographs, including those from The New York Times, shows how, as the term came into popular use, misogyny has also been a part of our visual landscape, from headline news to everyday experience.
But like so much of our current discourse, the word's resonance drifts between the weighty and the meme-ified. One report indicated that a mongoose in Kenya might be a misogynist. "Chill with that misogyny," reads a T-shirt available to buy on Etsy. And don't forget the mug that features a whimsical-but-woke shark saying "I'm fin-ished with misogyny."
Disdain for women, it is sometimes argued, is also the reason certain corners of pop culture are dismissed. "Has Internalized Misogyny Kept Me From Reading Romance Novels My Whole Life?" one writer asked. Hating the Kardashians has also been read as anti-woman, because in so doing we reduce the celebrity sisters to mere stereotypes. In the nesting-doll logic of the moment, disparaging any woman's respite from misogyny -- whether it's reality TV, a self-care beauty regimen or astrology -- is itself misogynist.
So, misogyny is having a moment, in more ways than one, but it also has a long history.
The term emerged in the 17th century, in response to an anti-woman pamphlet written by an English fencing master named Joseph Swetnam. The 1615 tract, titled in part "The arraignment of lewd, idle, froward and unconstant women" (froward meant disobedient), was published amid early modern anxiety and debate about women's place in society. Basically a compendium of sexist jokes, the dyspeptic work was aimed at an audience of "the ordinary set of giddy-headed young men," and it was very popular.
"Women are crooked by nature," Swetnam wrote, sounding like a proto-incel. To him even "the fairest woman has some filthiness in her." Going all the way back to Eve, womankind was "no sooner made but straightway her mind was set upon mischief, for by her aspiring mind and wanton will she quickly procured man's fall, and therefore ever since they are and have been a woe unto man, and follow the line of their first leader." They were like pumice stones because their hearts were filled with holes, he wrote, like painted ships because they looked pretty but contained only lead. Not surprisingly, the pamphlet drew several published responses from women. In one, an anonymously written feminist play called "Swetnam the Woman-Hater, Arraigned By Women," the character standing in for Swetnam was named Misogynos.
Misogyny was little used for the next few centuries, but its popularity skyrocketed in the mid-1970s, more or less entering the lexicon of second-wave feminism with Andrea Dworkin's 1974 critique "Woman Hating." In the book, Dworkin argues that a deep, ingrained prejudice against women informs aspects of society from legislation to cohabitation. As she summed it up two years later, "As women we live in the midst of a society that regards us as contemptible. We are despised ... We are the victims of continuous, malevolent, and sanctioned violence against us." (An idea familiar to women like Kathrine Switzer, pictured below, who was famously harassed as she became one of the first women to run the Boston Marathon in 1967.)
In the 1980s and '90s, reading Dworkin became for many a discomfiting and exhilarating collegiate rite of passage. Her writing is a strident and raw look at the systemic bias affecting the everyday experiences of women. Was there actual hatred lurking beneath every meeting with your boss or commanding officer, every date, sermon, novel, TV commercial? Yes, Dworkin insisted. At the time, this was a radical idea -- and to many it still is.
This understanding of misogyny became a commonly held idea among feminists: the issue was structural. Society was organized in a misogynistic way, even if its individual members didn't see themselves as woman-haters. As the writer and activist Audre Lorde wrote in 1980, there is a "piece of the oppressor which is planted deep within each of us." Susan Faludi, author of the 1991 book "Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women," echoed this idea, arguing that efforts against equality "are encoded and internalized, diffuse and chameleonic."
Much like "racist" -- which was once mostly used to describe certain sheriffs, politicians or neighbors -- misogynist is now as often applied to the system of institutions that creates an unequal America as it is to individuals. In this broadened meaning, happily married men, men with daughters and women themselves can be implicated. The way the word is now used, you don't have to hate women to be a misogynist, despite what Webster's dictionary still says today.
But can that one word do all this work? Can it describe some of the worst, most violent impulses in our world and everyday acts of gender bias? Should we use the same term to describe marital rape and the dearth of strong female leads on TV? It turns out, it already is, and we already are.
Some dictionaries have taken note. William Safire, the New York Times columnist who wrote for decades about the texture of our language, noted in 2008 that the Oxford English Dictionary had expanded its definition by 2002 to include "prejudice against women." "Sexist and misogynist are now in some respects synonymous," he wrote. "Because sexist has been so widely used, apparently misogynist -- in the same sense of 'prejudice' rather than 'hatred' -- now carries more force with those who are familiar with the word."
The word used to be a strong, personal indictment, ugly as it hit the ears. Now, it's less harsh to hear. But paradoxically, even as the term becomes more commonplace, it has grown more trenchant. It captures the cognitive dissonance of our moment, in which women are seemingly reviled and revered, running for president and still fighting for paid maternity leave.
This roominess feels appropriate to the time, since Dworkin's notion of misogyny, once thought radical, has become far more widely accepted.
Consider this Dworkin quote from 1997: "Women are perceived to be appalling failures when we are sad. Women are pathetic when we are angry. Women are ridiculous when we are militant. Women are unpleasant when we are bitter, no matter what the cause. Women are deranged when women want justice. Women are man-haters when women want accountability and respect from men."
That sounds a lot like a recent Nike ad that aired during the Oscars, to a warm reception on social media. "If we show emotions, we're called dramatic," the voice over by Serena Williams goes. "If we want to play against men, we're nuts. And if we dream of equal opportunity, delusional. When we stand for something, we're unhinged. When we're too good, there's something wrong with us. And if we get angry, we're hysterical, irrational or just being crazy."

"The detail that tore me apart was when the medical examiner testified that he could determine, based on his examination of the victim, that James Byrd Jr. was still alive as his arms and legs were being ripped apart from his body as he was being pulled from the back of the truck by three racists. Similar conditions exist on Mars, shielded from the cold and radiation, so if life ever arose there, it might still persist."

Texto completo: This being Sunshine Week -- media's annual spotlight on the importance of open government -- Editor JEFF D'ALESSIO asked three of the 1,610 former Illini profiled on our special UI-at-150-and-beyond website to tell us a story about the most challenging assignment they've had to report on since their college days.
STEVE OSUNSAMI ('93)
Emmy-winning correspondent
ABC News
"In the late 1990s when I first started with ABC News, I was covering a racially motivated murder, a dragging death in Texas. The trial of the main suspect, a white supremacist named John King, was difficult to get through, with details so graphic they couldn't be reported on network television.
"The detail that tore me apart was when the medical examiner testified that he could determine, based on his examination of the victim, that James Byrd Jr. was still alive as his arms and legs were being ripped apart from his body as he was being pulled from the back of the truck by three racists.
"I kept imagining that it was me, or my brother, walking down that same lonely road the night the victim was killed. It hit me hard.
"Back then, there were fewer people of color in the news business, and few black men.
"There was one other black reporter in the courthouse that day. A local reporter from one of the Texas stations. We had never really talked and didn't know each other at all, but when we walked out of the courthouse that afternoon, we both broke down into tears and hugged each other for a very long time.
"I took that experience and ran with it in the stories we filed that day. That what happened to this victim was not just an assault on him, but on black Americans in general. I learned that the humanity that brought me to tears was going to make me a better writer and a better reporter.
"I just looked it up: John King is scheduled to be executed next month."
JOHN PLETZ ('90)
Technology reporter
Crain's Chicago Business
"I pursued a single FOIA for over a year. It didn't involve lawyers, just persistence because bureaucrats didn't understand FOIA and kept dropping the ball. It was perhaps one of the simplest requests I've ever made, but I had to walk the respondent through every step.
"The final indignity was when they agreed to my request and finally responded with the documents, they sent the files to the wrong email address because of a typo. Had I not called back a couple of months later, I'd never have gotten the info."
KENNETH CHANG ('94)
Science reporter
The New York Times
"I traveled 8,000 miles to go a mile underground in South Africa -- and that was for a story about what might be living on Mars.
"Mars itself remains an impractical reporting trip.
"Scientists at Princeton are studying microbes that live in rocks far below the surface, and a gold mine -- South Africa has some of the deepest in the world -- is a convenient place to go study that. Similar conditions exist on Mars, shielded from the cold and radiation, so if life ever arose there, it might still persist."

Texto completo: New Yorkers have been gnashing their teeth these past few weeks over the decision by Amazon to pull its planned "second headquarters" out of Queens.
The city had spent millions and promised billions to lure Amazon to make the nation's largest city its second home. The largest American retailer had held a contest during the past year, inviting cities to compete for the new headquarters, which promised thousands of jobs and, eventually, a bigger tax base for the winner.
Indeed, Amazon couldn't seem to pick a winner from the many cities that applied, so they decided to split HQ2 between New York and the Washington, D.C., burbs. They both had offered the moon to the company that early in 2018 was valued at a trillion dollars.
When the terms of the deal, favored by both Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, became fully public several weeks ago, many New Yorkers started to make a fuss. The richest man in the world, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who is not used to not getting his way, decided he'd show these ingrates just how powerful the rich can be. He yanked HQ2 from New York and announced he'd take it to where it was wanted.
The politicians and citizen watchdog leaders who had objected to Amazon's plans have been denounced by Cuomo, de Blasio and many others for costing the city thousands of jobs, a chance to become an East Coast tech powerhouse and, of course, many millions in a bigger tax base at least, someday.
(The whole episode reminded many folks in Wisconsin of ex-governor Scott Walker's $4 billion deal with Foxconn's supposed 13,000-worker factory in the Racine area. Since the Republican-controlled Legislature and Republican Gov. Walker quickly approved the deal, there really wasn't time for any organized effort to raise questions.) The New York Times was among those that scolded the critics of the Amazon deal, but one of its columnists, David Leonhardt, begged to differ.
"Thank you, New York," he wrote in a column siding with the Amazon naysayers. "The city did the rest of the country a favor: Corporate-relocation handouts are terrible economic policy."
He's absolutely right they are not only terrible policy, but are unsustainable for either a city or a state.
Leonhardt did admit that in the short run the loss of Amazon to New York raises important questions.
"But they're not the only issues that matter here," he wrote. "They're not even the biggest issues. The handout that cities and states have been strong-armed into giving to corporations over the past few decades ... do nothing to raise the nation's economic growth rate. They mostly distribute income upward, from taxpayers to big shareholders.
"I agree with the critics (including my colleagues on the Times Editorial Board) who say that New York would probably have benefited from Amazon's presence in Queens. But I keep thinking about the larger principle here. If every city agrees to give billion-dollar handouts to companies, in the name of that city's short-term interests, those handouts will never end," he added.
Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers hinted at that fact recently when he commented that deals like Foxconn and Kimberly-Clark aren't sustainable in the long run.
Taxpayers can't afford to pump millions and billions into profitable private companies without harming their own economies.
As many contended during the Foxconn debate, Wisconsin would have been much wiser to take those huge subsidies for one foreign-owned mega-conglomerate, especially one with the shady reputation that Foxconn has, and spread it around the state to nurture small businesses that together not only can create more jobs than Foxconn can, but odds are will be around a lot longer than Foxconn will.
As Leonhardt said, providing mega-deals to corporate giants doesn't add to the national economy, but simply moves money from one city or one state to another.
We all know how that ends. The big corporation gets bigger, the cities and states are forced to yield to their economic power by giving even more tax breaks and subsidies and the one holding the bag is that same guy we've known for so long: mom and pop taxpayer.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump dijo que firmará una orden de emergencia para aterrizar todos los vuelos de aviones Boeing 737 Max 8 y 737 Max 9 de las aerolíneas estadounidenses.
De este modo, cualquier avión similar al que se estrelló en Etiopía que actualmente se encuentre en el aire irá a su destino y se mantendrá en tierra hasta nuevo aviso.
“Esos aviones serán aterrizados de inmediato “, dijo Trump en la Casa Blanca. “La seguridad es nuestra principal preocupación” .
Estados Unidos fue la única nación que pilotea aviones Boeing 737, después de que Canadá anunció el miércoles que estaba aterrizando dichas naves. Esta decisión afectaría, aún indeterminadamente, vuelos programados.
La Unión Europea y varios países ya habían tomado la decisión el fin de semana de retirar las aeronaves mencionadas, pero el CEO del fabricante de aviones buscaba evitar que el presidente Trump tomada una decisión similar, luego del siniestro con una aeronave de de Ethiopian Airlines.
Dennis Muilenburg , director ejecutivo de Boeing, con sede en Chicago, habló con el presidente Trump por teléfono el martes por la mañana para evitar que sus aviones fueran retirados, informó The New York Times.
El Times citó a dos personas familiarizadas con la llamada, sobre lo cual Muilenburg afirmó que expresó al mandatario estadounidense que las aeronaves eran seguras.
Desde el fin de semana, el valor de las acciones de Boeing se han desplomado y se espera que bajen más tras el anuncio del presidente Trump.
El martes, el presidente Trump abogó por aviones “más simples”, pero no habló de suspender las operaciones de los Boeing.
“Los aviones se están volviendo demasiado difíciles para volar. Ya no se necesitan pilotos, sino científicos informáticos del MIT”, dijo en su cuenta en Twitter, en referencia al Instituto de Tecnología de Massachusetts. “Lo he visto todo el tiempo con varios productos… siempre buscando pasos innecesarios…”
Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are….
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2019
“Las decisiones en décimas de segundo son necesarias y la complejidad crea peligro. Todo esto por un gran costo pero muy pocos beneficios. No sé tú, pero yo no quiero que Albert Einstein sea mi piloto. ¡Quiero excelentes profesionales de vuelo que puedan tomar el control de un avión de forma fácil y rápida!”, afirmó.
….needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2019
El siniestro en Etiopía murieron 157 personas; se reportó que las víctimas son de al menos 35 nacionalidades, incluyendo al menos un estadounidense y 18 canadienses, algunos de los cuales viajaban a ese país a buscar sus orígenes, ya que sus familiares migraron a Estados Unidos hace varios años.

Texto completo: La nueva fiscal general estatal de Nueva York, Letitia James, envió citaciones a Deutsche Bank e Investors Bank el lunes por los registros que involucraban la fallida oferta del mandatario Donald Trump para comprar el equipo de fútbol americano “Buffalo Bills” y otros negocios relacionados con la Organización Trump.
Un día después de emitir las citaciones, James pidió a los legisladores en Albany cerrar la “laguna” legal que prohíbe a los fiscales del estado presentar cargos similares contra personas indultadas por cargos federales.
“Tenemos un acuerdo en ambas casas, anticipamos que el proyecto de ley se aprobará en un par de semanas”, dijo a New York Post.
La citación del Deutsche Bank investiga solicitudes de préstamos, hipotecas, líneas de crédito y otros registros de transacciones financieras relacionadas con el Trump International Hotel en Washington, el Trump National Doral en el sur de Florida y el Trump International Hotel and Tower en Chicago , informó The New York Times.
Se le pidió a Investors Bank, con sede en Nueva Jersey, registros relacionados con Trump Park Avenue.
James también ha solicitado registros vinculados por los intentos de Trump de comprar los “Buffalo Bills” en 2014. El acuerdo se vino abajo después de que Terry Pegula, propietario del equipo de hockey Buffalo Sabres, compró el equipo de la NFL por $1,400 millones de dólares.
James, quien prometió en su campaña investigar al presidente, inició el proceso civil luego de que Michael Cohen, antiguo abogado de Trump, testificara ante un panel del Congreso el 27 de febrero.
En el Congreso se están realizando varias investigaciones sobre Trump, sus negocios y su campaña, y por el asesor especial Robert Mueller.
Deutsche Bank confirmó a The New York Times que había recibido la citación, pero Investors Bank se negó a comentar. La Organización Trump no respondió a las solicitudes de comentarios del periódico.
En febrero, una coalición de 16 fiscales generales, incluyendo a James por NY, presentó una demanda contra Trump, en un intento por frenar la “emergencia nacional” con la que el mandatario busca recaudar fondos para construir el muro en la frontera con México.

Impeaching Trump 'just not worth it,' says Speaker Pelosi

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that although she believes Donald Trump is not fit to be president, she opposes moves to impeach him, her most definitive statement yet on the issue and one that stands to alienate some members of the Democratic Party.
“Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country," the California Democrat said March 6 in an interview conducted for a future issue of The Washington Post Magazine.
“And he's just not worth it," she said.
Pelosi's remarks drew swift rebukes from some liberals who have been clamoring to begin impeachment proceedings over controversies ensnaring the Trump administration, with several House committees launching investigations.
Other Democrats on investigative committees were surprised that the speaker would all but rule out impeachment just as they were starting their investigations.
"I don't think it's something we decide whether or not it's 'worth it,"' said House Progressive Caucus co-chair Pramila Jayapal of Washington. "If [our investigations show] a consistent pattern of abuse of power, of obstruction of justice . . . then that to me seems like it will be impeachable."
Moderate Democrats, however, welcomed what they considered a politically pragmatic response, especially with no bipartisan support for impeachment and Republicans controlling the Senate, which would have to convict Trump to remove him from office.
Democrats also recognize that moving toward impeachment would energize core GOP voters ahead of the 2020 presidential and congressional elections. Pelosi's comments come as Republicans are seeking to portray Democrats as radicals beholden to the far left, unwilling to respect democratic norms.

Wisconsin key as Democrats select 2020 convention site
The Democratic National Committee has selected Milwaukee as the site of its national convention, placing a spotlight on a key Midwestern battleground state that Democrats lost for the first time in three decades in 2016 and see as central to the party's efforts to reclaim the White House.
The convention will be held next year on July 13-16 in the newly built Fiserv Forum, a 17,500-seat arena that is home to the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks.
Milwaukee was selected over a pair of larger Sun Belt cities, Houston, and Miami, to host the event.
Milwaukee organizers raised more than $10 million and reassured officials that they had secured sufficient hotel capacity for the event, ameliorating concerns that the city lacked the finances and infrastructure to support an event that regularly draws tens of thousands of out-of-town activists, officials, and media.
Wisconsin holds a searing place in the Democratic Party psyche after Hillary Clinton, the party's last presidential nominee, opted not to campaign in the traditionally blue state during the general election — a decision that some blamed for her 22,000-vote defeat in the state.
Democrats won back the governorship of the state in 2018, assuaging some concerns that Wisconsin was drifting away. Still, some in the party are urging the 2020 candidates to broaden their focus beyond the upper Midwest to the rapidly growing Sun Belt states.
Democratic officials worried about the optics of hosting a convention in Houston, a city dominated by the oil and gas industry, at a time when Democratic activists are focused on combating climate change.
Republicans will hold their convention Aug. 24–27, 2020, in Charlotte, N.C.

Gillibrand backs handling of aide's sex misconduct claim
Democratic presidential contender Kirsten Gillibrand is standing by her Senate office's response to a former staffer who resigned over the handling of her sex harassment claims.
Politico reported Sunday the female staffer alleged that one of Gillibrand's closest aides made repeated unwelcome advances toward her and then retaliated after she reported him. The aide lost his expected promotion but not his job. Gillibrand's office concluded the woman's allegations "did not meet the standard of sexual harassment."
The New York senator, who has been a forceful public advocate for victims of sexual misconduct, said Monday it's important to believe women who make allegations so that "serious investigations can actually take place, we can learn the facts, and there can be appropriate accountability."
Gillibrand said, "That's exactly what happened at every step of this case last year."
The aide was fired after Politico presented the office with additional allegations.
Associated Press
No comment on if Trump thinks Democrats 'hate' Jews
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Monday repeatedly refused to say whether President Trump really thinks Democrats "hate" Jewish people.
Before Trump left the White House on Friday for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, he said: "The Democrats have become an anti-Israel party. They've become an anti-Jewish party, and that's too bad."
Later in the day, Trump told Republican National Committee donors that Democrats "hate" Jewish people, according to a person who heard the remarks but spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the comments at a private event.
Trump's comments followed an emotional debate on Capitol Hill about statements made by freshman Representative Ilhan Omar, a Muslim lawmaker from Minnesota who suggested Israel's supporters were pushing lawmakers to take a pledge of "allegiance" to a foreign country — comments that some viewed as anti-Semitic.
Associated Press
LePage suggests Democrats mostly get money from Jews
Former governor Paul Le­Page suggested Monday that the Democratic Party's money comes from Jewish people, for the most part.
The Maine Republican told WGAN-AM that Jewish people should be "insulted" by a Democratic congresswoman's statements that some viewed as anti-Semitic. "The Jewish people in America have been great supporters of the Democratic Party," LePage said. "In fact, that's where their money comes from for the most part. They should be absolutely insulted for what she's been saying."
LePage, who has previously grabbed headlines for remarks critics deem racist, said he felt "completely vindicated from anything" he has said in light of freshman Representative Ilhan Omar, of Minnesota. She suggested Israel's supporters were pushing lawmakers to take a pledge of "allegiance" to a foreign country, reviving an anti-Semitic trope of dual loyalties.

'Hamilton' producer brings show, charity home to Detroit

Texto completo: "Hamilton" opens in Detroit this week, four and a half years after it launched on Broadway.
Or, in political terms, a lifetime ago.
Back in 2015, the mega-hit musical felt in step with an America that was moving closer to the ideals set forth by the founding fathers, who included Alexander Hamilton, the immigrant orphan of the title.
"I absolutely believe that 'Hamilton' was a beautiful manifestation of all the progress we made in the Obama era," says Jeffrey Seller, the suburban Detroit native and acclaimed producer of "Hamilton" and also "In the Heights," "Avenue Q" and "Rent."
Now, it's 2019, and the rancor of the Trump era is adding urgency to, well, everything. These days, according to Seller, "Hamilton" is even more essential "because 'Hamilton' shows us how unique is our democracy, how special it is. And it celebrates its greatest qualities and reminds us why it's so important to our everyday lives."
In case you've just been teleported to Earth from a faraway galaxy: "Hamilton" is the cultural phenomenon created by Lin-Manuel Miranda that won 11 Tonys and continues to sell out at Manhattan's Richard Rodgers Theatre after roughly 1,500 performances and $500million in Broadway gross earnings to date.
"Hamilton" broke the mold for musicals by combining an eclectic mix of rap, R&B, soul, pop and Tin Pan Alley into the same irresistible score and casting people of color to play Alexander Hamilton, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and other white figures who forged a new country that espoused equality and yet was mired in the original sin of slavery.
Overstating the show's impact as a critical and commercial success is nearly impossible. "Hamilton" has spawned a hit cast album, a "Hamilton Mixtape" album with other artists, a "Hamilton: The Revolution" book, a host of "Hamilton" merchandise, a PBS special, and a new interactive "Hamilton: The Exhibition" opening in April in Chicago.
And to satisfy the demand not met by the Broadway production, there are "Hamilton" companies in Chicago and London and an additional three touring companies.
Seller, the lead producer, who has been called "The C.E.O. of 'Hamilton,' Inc." by the New York Times, has been a part of the musical's journey since Miranda first shared the idea with him a decade ago,
It has been a meteoric rise for a child of Oak Park, Michigan, with theater dreams. As he told the Times, he remembers the impact of seeing Mandy Patinkin and Patti LuPone sing a song from "Evita" on the Tony Awards (an award he himself has gone on to win five times so far). He went to the library the next day to get the album.
Seller's earliest credits include appearing in fourth grade in a play at West Bloomfield's Temple Israel that used music from "South Pacific" and "H.M.S. Pinafore" to tell the story of Purim. Not long afterward, he wrote his own stage play. He later acted with Royal Oak's Stagecrafters troupe and at Oak Park High School.
Some of his fondest memories of growing up in metro Detroit are of seeing shows at the Fisher Theatre. When he talks about Detroit theater, it's with the authority of a scholar and the enthusiasm of a fan.
"Detroit is integral to theater in America, to Broadway theater in America and touring theater in America. Detroit has a very rich history of hosting Broadway musicals from 'Oklahoma' and 'South Pacific' in the '40s to 'Fiddler on the Roof' and 'Hello, Dolly!' in the '60s. ... I've said it many times, I was enriched by being able to see so many Broadway musicals on tour at the Fisher Theatre when I was growing up in the late '70s and early '80s."
The University of Michigan alum majored in political science — "I can say theater is my vocation, and politics in my avocation," he once said — but remained tied to the theater while in college through acting, directing and writing for the Michigan Daily student newspaper and the Ann Arbor News. After graduating in spring 1986, he got a one-way ticket to New York City and never looked back.
Seller has always retained that sense of being a kid from Oak Park who had to work his way up the ladder. He has become an advocate for audiences through his pioneering of discounted Broadway rush tickets and his current policy of selling low-cost "Hamilton" tickets via an online lottery, which will provide 40 seats at $10 each for every performance in Detroit.
Another initiative in which he had a key role? The Hamilton Education Program, which provides tens of thousands of high school students in Title I schools with a chance to study about the history covered in the musical and to see "Hamilton." It's coming to Detroit.
Seller has remained loyal to his Midwest roots, mostly in ways that give back to his favorite causes. Ask him whether "Hamilton" is in Detroit largely because of him, and he avoids the braggadocio of many big-league producers. Instead, he says simply, "If I was not the head producer of 'Hamilton,' 'Hamilton' would still be coming to Detroit, although because I am the producer of 'Hamilton,' it might be playing in Detroit sooner than it otherwise would have."
In recent years, Seller came home in 2015 for a Stagecrafters 60th Anniversary Diamond Jubilee fundraising event. He returned in 2016 for the annual Detroit Homecoming event, where he received the 2016 Creative Many Governor's Arts Award "for bringing to life compelling theater the world embraces and making Michigan proud of its native son."
In January, the announcement came that Seller had donated $1 million to Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit. The contribution was made through the Seller-Lehrer Foundation in New York, which he started with his partner of more than two decades, photographer and documentarian Josh Lehrer.
"I believe that art has a unique ability to imbue young people with spirit and skills that will enable them to become great citizens and great contributors to society," says Seller of his mega-generosity to the local troupe. "The reason I'm so enthusiastic about Mosaic is because they're creating great young minds and citizens, kids who go out and make a mark in the arts, but also maybe the sciences or in education or in politics, in many different ways."
Seller plans to attend a March 28 event at the Fisher Theatre for L!FE Leaders Inc., a nonprofit started by Amy Nederlander of the famous theater family to help Detroit middle school and high school students to find their voices, establish goals and forge paths to success. It will include a performance of "Hamilton" and a conversation with the cast and others involved with the show.
Also expected to be there is U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, one of many Democrats that Seller has supported since the 2016 presidential election, which he refers to as "the tragedy of '16, I make no bones about it." He says he made a commitment to helping to flip U.S. congressional seats from red to blue during the 2018 midterms, and he'll continue his efforts to change a political climate that he believes has thrown America into reverse on vital issues like civil rights and voting rights.
Does Seller ever wonder if being a kid from Detroit, far away from the capitals of entertainment, actually was a key to reaching his dreams?
Is it better to strive for impossible goals — sort of what an ambitious guy named Hamilton did centuries ago — than to have them easily accessible?
Seller has thought about this before. "To what degree can we attribute our success to the passion with which we sought it out as children? There's no question that my passion for it and my direction toward it were unstoppable. Looking back, it now feels that it was the perfect scenario to get me where I am today ... which is sitting at my desk in my Broadway office, where I've made my hobby into my career."
Says Seller, "I think it kept me very appreciative and I still am. I still go, 'Oh my gosh, am I still working on Broadway? Do I really have a show running at the Richard Rodgers Theatre? I do'! It still moves me when I walk down 46th Street and I see the marquee of the show that I produced. I produced a Broadway musical. Wow!"

Texto completo: "It takes guts to print what they planned to release on him."
Lance Ulanoff, tech blogger and regular Medium poster
When Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos decided to publicly accuse lawyers from the parent company of the National Enquirer of blackmail and extortion, his outlet of choice wasn't The Washington Post, which he owns, but instead the Medium blog website.
The world's richest man could have easily posted his claims as a Post op-ed or done a high-profile TV interview.
Instead, he turned to Medium, which has become the go-to website for people who want to get something off their chest. High-profile names like Tesla founder Elon Musk, former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and actor Wil Wheaton have also posted there.
"It's a logical place to publish," CNN media critic Brian Stelter wrote in his media newsletter. "A neutral space where the emphasis is on the words, nothing else – and kept the message away from any Amazon or Post-owned website."
Posting to Medium is easy, which is why so many CEOs, tech journalists, venture capitalists and authors like it. You register, create a handle, open a blank document and add photos and videos to your words and hit publish. This lets you blog, without the bother of having to create your own personal blog that's constantly in need of updating.
The National Enquirer previously shared details of Bezos and his relationship with Lauren Sanchez, a former Los Angeles TV anchor, including romantic text messages the two had sent each other. Bezos and wife MacKenzie announced last month that they would be divorcing after 25 years of marriage, just ahead of The Enquirer posting the intimate exchanges with Sanchez.
The leak of the texts, which Bezos confirmed in his post, prompted the Amazon founder to have Gavin de Becker from his security team investigate how the Enquirer got the messages.
Bezos said AMI CEO David Pecker was "apoplectic" over a separate investigation The Washington Post was doing into Pecker and AMI's interest in expanding to Saudi Arabia, including AMI's publication of a pro-Saudi Arabia tabloid last year before the arrival of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Bezos also noted how Pecker "recently entered into an immunity deal with the Department of Justice related to their role in the so-called 'Catch and Kill' process on behalf of President Trump and his election campaign," linking to a New York Times report that said Trump invited Pecker to a White House dinner in which the AMI CEO brought a guest that the Times describes as having "important ties to the royals in Saudi Arabia."
Bezos and his investigators accuse the Enquirer of a politically charged reporting job on behalf of President Donald Trump, who Bezos says believes him to be an "enemy," due to his ownership of The Washington Post.
In his Medium post, Bezos referred to potentially embarrassing photos of him the Enquirer said it had of him in various states of undress.
In the emails published by Bezos, Enquirer representatives say it won't publish the lurid photos if Bezos agrees to say publicly that the Enquirer coverage wasn't "politically motivated."
The post had 130,000 "claps" – Medium's version of the Like button – by Friday morning.
Casey Newton, an editor for tech news site TheVerge, also blogs on Medium and says it has replaced the concept of a blog that needs to be constantly updated, "with a place where you could just say something whenever you had a point to make. It lowered the barrier of entry and, thanks to a beautiful text editor, felt very approachable to lots of folks from the start."
Alex Kruglov, who runs the Los Angeles tech startup pop.in, uses Medium to speak directly to his audience, because its "really simple" and "they give you all the tools to make the page look good and publish properly on both desktop and mobile."
Medium was founded in 2012 by Evan Williams, a co-founder of Twitter and the old Blogger platform, for people who had more to say than the old 140 character limit of Twitter. In the latest version of the blogging site, users can read up to five articles monthly for free, or read more by paying $5 monthly.
The most popular post of 2018 was by James Bridle, who described himself in the post as "a writer and artist concerned with technology and culture." In writing his piece about his concern of seeing sexually themed videos targeting children on YouTube, he said, "I usually write on my own blog, but frankly I don't want what I'm talking about here anywhere near my own site"
The post got nearly 200,000 views. Many media organizations, including USA TODAY, jumped on points raised in the piece. YouTube was forced a few months later to announce changes to its policies, saying children's content on the YouTube Kids app would be curated and not left for automatic postings.
Jackson Cunningham, who makes cat furniture in Vancouver, Canada, wrote about getting banned for life from Airbnb for writing a bad review of his host on Google, while short story writer David Hopkins went for a less controversial take on bow the 1990s TV show "Friends," "triggered the downfall of Western Civilization."
Lance Ulanoff, a tech blogger who posts regularly on Medium, says he was "blown away," by Bezos' decision to make his announcement on Medium.
"It takes guts to print what they planned to release on him," he says. "I mean, there will be ramifications for a CEO of one of the world's biggest and most important companies acting so irresponsibly, but I do love how he pulled the rug out from under the (alleged) extortionists, assuming this is all true."

A Panel-Turned Master Class for Writers, Seekers

Texto completo: Headnote Power of the Pen
Three of arguably the most important and prolific writers of our time sat down on March 5 at Howard University's Cramton Auditorium for the "Power of the Pen" panel discussion to chat about writing, research, work and loving our Blackness. But the evening quickly morphed into a master class on pushing yourself towards excellence no matter what your field.
SPOILER ALERT - The answer to most every question in life is read more.
Nikole Hannah-Jones, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Jelani Cobb took the stage at Howard Cramton Auditorium in front of an intimate but enthusiastic crowd. The event was hosted by Anthony Brown, a Howard alum and communications specialist for the U.S. Small Business Administration's Office of the Inspector General.
The trio, who are friends in real life, have a list of credits and honors most people never achieve. Hannah-Jones is an investigative journalist covering Civil Rights and Racial injustice for the {New York Times}. She is the recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, The National Magazine Award and the National Association of Black Journalists Salute to Excellence Award.
Coates is a writer of residence at NYU's Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. He wrote the bestselling books, "The Beautiful Struggle," "We Were Eight Years in Power" and "Between the World and Me," which won the National Book Award. Coates is also the author of Marvel comics such as "The Black Panther" and "Captain America," and a recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship.
Dr. Cobb is an Ira A. Lipman Professor of Journalism at Columbia University. Cobb has been staff writer for The New Yorker since 2015. He is a recipient of fellowships from the Fulbright and Ford Foundations. He is also the author of "The Substance of Hope: Barack Obama and the Paradox of Progress" as well as "To the Break of Dawn: A Freestyle on the Hip Hop Aesthetic." He is also a Howard alum.
Brown asked Coates why it was important for him to be on at the panel discussion and the author was quick to point out the school's contribution to his life.
"It's quite impossible for me to imagine any success or my life at all personal or professional without Howard," Coates, who attended the university, said. "I met my wife here. I met Jelani here. My first articles were published in the Community News and Hilltop."
He went on to say, "I will owe Howard until the day I die."
Brown asked Cobb to unpack what he does as a writer.
"I think I am a Black man trying to be responsible to his community and times," Cobb said.
"I'm a historian and a journalist. But my mission has always been to use the tools that I gained at this institution in a way that was befitting the people who invested in me."
Hannah-Jones was able to unpack her process and debunk the myth of objectivity in journalism, all in one answer.
"I don't believe in objectivity. I've made that very clear," Hannah-Jones said.
She went on to say: "I don't pretend to be objective and I think objectivity has been the shield that mainstream White media and journalists hide behind when they make decisions that clearly many of us think are biased, when they decide who they're going to cover, what goes on the front page. These are all subjective decisions on what they think are important."
"I don't choose to hide behind that at all. But for me what is important is to be accurate and fair. Can you dispute the reporting? Is there anything in the reporting that is not true and was I fair to the parties involved?"
Hannah-Jones said her journalism is more aligned with the tradition of Black journalists and Black media.
"How did someone like Ida B. Wells be objective when reporting in a country where Black people didn't have citizenship rights?" she asked. "In a country that is in opposition to their existence. In a country that is in opposition to their humanity. You can't pretend you have no stakes in the game."
But developing good work is the most important part of the job. "You have to be excellent, you can't just be good," Hannah-Jones said.
Dr. Cobbs echoed the sentiment that the next generation of writers have to focus on the output not the outlet.
"People come to me and say, 'I want you to get me into The New Yorker.' as opposed to saying, 'I want you to help me to get my work to be good enough that it belongs in The New Yorker," Cobbs said. "It's the aspiration and the ambition without the idea of the caliber of the work going first."
Coates broke down the essential responsibility of being a Black journalist.
"It's really not enough for you to just go out and be a relatively successful journalist," Coates said. "It's not enough for you to go get a job at the New York Times, or get a job at The New Yorker or The Atlantic, where I was. You have to use the work that you create once you get there as a sword. You're at war."
"You're not just a journalist. You are a journalist in cause of something."
Coates continued saying: "Your job is to be excellent but excellent in the course of something. When you think about what this long struggle is about, it's actually about the future of humanity. Your job is to use your power you have as a journalist, as a writer to not be amongst that group of people who are trying to push the world over the cliff."
But Coates said understanding your responsibility does not have to be burden on you. It can empower you.
"If you do it right, once you leave and become a journalist it can be an accelerant," Coates said to the crowd. "If you're writing like, 'no I'm trying to change the world,' it's a different type of fire."
The crowd cheered and encouraged the panel throughout the night. Many people who attended the event were there for different reasons.
Mikala Williams, 28, who lives in D.C., said she follows Hannah-Jones and Cobb online.
"I just admire their work," Williams said. "I'm a freelance writer and I wanted to hear what they have to say about being a new writer and always having the audacity to really employ an authentic voice as a Black writer in predominantly White publications and how we can connect that bridge."
When asked about the importance seeing Black representation in the field of journalism, especially at the caliber of the panelists, Williams said, "It's huge. It's almost imperative for young writers or just aspiring writers, especially Black young women and men who are trying to find their footing, where they are in a world where they are reminded that their voice doesn't matter, to continue to fight that, to fight against that. It's just encouraging."
Nichelle Hernandez, 19, a sophomore studying journalism at Howard said, "I want to further the conversation and see what else they have to say about current issues in journalism and issues across the board."
As for pursuing journalism in this climate of layoffs and uncertainty, Hernandez said, "even though journalism may not be the direct avenue I might take, I feel it's still something I should study, and at least as a foundation. Even if I go into production, TV, i feel knowing news, current event writing, that's a good background."

Texto completo: Pennsylvania Grange president Wayne Campbell's op-ed ("Keep Sunday hunting ban") is missing existing perspective/data. Yes, hunter numbers will likely decline over time. The Pennsylvania Game Commission agrees culture shifts are significantly to blame.
Campbell ignores the fact that hunters cite lack of free time as the overwhelming reason they stop hunting. The commission's executive director testified in 2016 that " ... the No. 1 reason that people stop hunting is lack of time. The overwhelming majority of hunting takes place on Saturdays. ... For a lot of hunters the only option is Saturday." His full testimony is worth reading.
The commission has already done the "alternatives" research Campbell asks for. Trust the facts.
The Pennsylvania Grange commonly mentions sharing the outdoors, but wants to exclude hunters on Sundays. Curious. Hunters have always shared state game lands, which are funded by hunting license fees.
It's time to repeal the last blue law; 47 other states have removed bans. Opponents aren't citing issues in those states. It's overzealous to tell citizens what to do on private property. They should append their motto to "In essentials unity, in non-essentials liberty, in all things charity except Sunday hunting."

<h4>Keep up pressure on abusers</h4>
Kudos, praises and thanks to Richard Serbin for taking such a bold step to shine additional spotlight on the Catholic Church and its decades of cover-up ("Vatican should chip in for clergy abuse survivors"). Of course, no need to stop there. Sadly, virtually every other religion, truth be told, will have multiple "skeletons in their closets; itching to come outside" (most recently the Southern Baptist church).
It will take people like Serbin, TribLive and other "media" entities to keep up the pressure on those who did harm, those who are currently doing harm and those who will do harm in the future to the children who are too young, too afraid, too powerless and too brainwashed to fend and speak for themselves.

<h4>Vaccines are safe?</h4>
I find it deplorable that some doctors refuse to see unvaccinated kids ("Doctors' dilemma: To see or not to see unvaccinated kids"). This discrimination is feeding into vilification and outright hate increasingly directed at vaccine-free children and their parents, many of whom do not vaccinate after diligent research convinced them that the risks of the injections exceed those of the conditions they target and that the drugs are unsafe. Exactly my conclusion in 1988 after researching vaccines at Pitt's medical school library.
How does one call safe drugs that we know have injured thousands of children and probably tens of thousands? Exact numbers of such injuries are unknown because fewer than 1 percent of vaccine adverse reactions are reported, according to a Harvard Pilgrim study.
If vaccines are safe, why is there a National Child Vaccine Injury Act, under which $4 billion has been paid to victims of vaccine injuries? These facts are largely unknown because the media does not report on it .
Also largely unknown is that uniquely and outrageously in American law, vaccine makers cannot be sued for injuries the drugs cause. No other industry is exempt from liability suits.
What about the explosion in child neurological dysfunction and injecting infants and children with aluminum, mercury, formaldehyde, polysorbate, acetone and other toxic agents that are in vaccines?
There are many other questions as well that people should know about before they are denied control over what is injected into their children and themselves.

<h4>Details on the Clintons
There is speculation that Hillary Clinton will run again for president. That would definitely liven up the contest. She has the strong support of her husband, and she has many loyal followers who suffered extreme mental anguish when she lost the last election.
It would seem prudent and timely to examine a few details regarding the Clintons which surfaced and quickly disappeared in the news when they happened.
Nov. 19, 1993: President Clinton allowed the sale of a "super computer" to the communist Chinese and called it a goodwill gesture, allowing the Chinese to access the most advanced computer technology without having to spy to get it.
May 11, 1999: President Clinton approved the transfer of our most advanced missile guidance technology to the communist Chinese, essentially wiping out any strategic advantage the United Stateshad.
April 23, 2015: According to a New York Times article headlined "Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal," tens of millions of dollars flowed into the Clinton Foundation following the sale of 20 percent of the U.S. uranium reserves to the Russians.
Nov. 2, 2017: Vanity Fair published an article titled "Donna Brazile Says She Has 'Proof' Clinton Rigged The Primary Against Sanders."
Joseph Krill, Murrysville

<h4>Reform the cash bail system</h4>
Hundreds of thousands of people in the United States -- people who have not been tried or convicted of any crime -- are held in jail simply because they cannot afford bail. They may spend days, weeks or months in jail awaiting trial. And in the process, they may lose their jobs, homes, even their families. As their lives unravel, taxpayers foot the bill to the tune of millions of dollars.
The cash bail system is wrong. It disproportionately punishes the poor, both by requiring people without money to find money, and by imprisoning them if they cannot. It flies in the face of core American values of freedom and justice.
But it can be fixed. One year ago, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office stopped seeking cash bail for nonviolent offenses. The result? The number of incarcerated people declined by 22 percent, defendants showed up for court regardless, hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars were saved and crime did not increase as a result. Most importantly, people were not jailed simply for being poor.
Philadelphia's example is well worth following in Allegheny County, while we push state legislators to ban cash bail altogether. In a rare instance of bipartisan agreement, Democrats and Republicans both acknowledge that our criminal justice system is broken. Ending cash bail would be a small but important step toward fixing it. Let's work together to get it done.

<h4>Debunking 'gateway drug' argument</h4>
Letter-writer Susan Jones worries that legalizing marijuana could potentially lead to an increased usage of cocaine, crack or heroin ("Legalized pot a gateway drug.")
The "gateway drug" argument is an example of assuming that correlation is evidence of causation. Studies do show that the majority of people abusing the more dangerous drugs begin their drug-taking experience with marijuana. Studies also show that almost all of those same drug abusers also used alcohol and tobacco before they used harder drugs.
Yet the majority of people who have used marijuana, alcohol or tobacco never consume any cocaine, crack or heroin at all. If marijuana use was the genuine cause of an eventual addiction to cocaine or opioids, then the number of people addicted to those drugs would be more than double the number it is today.
While marijuana use cannot offer real physical relief to those who are already suffering from the addictive demands of opioids, legalized marijuana consumption could reduce the demand for cocaine, crack and heroin in the future. With legal (and potentially more potent) cannabis available, those looking to stimulate pleasure-receptors in the brain would be less likely to turn to harder drugs.

<h4>A plea to Republicans</h4>
The Republicans won the election in 2016. It's undeniable it was a slaughter, winning the presidency and majorities in both houses of Congress. It wasn't the outcome I wanted, but I accepted it. In the first two years of the Trump presidency, you've put an indelible mark on the judiciary for the next 30-plus years. You've appointed two justices to the Supreme Court. You've overhauled the federal tax system. You've rolled back scores of regulations. Congratulations.
Now it's time to come home. A word to the wise: Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered. You've feasted on the success of the 2016 election, as well you should. Now is the time to step back, appreciate what you've done.
Now is also the time to step away from the Trump trough before you lead us all to the slaughter. Your party, our Constitution and our great country are all in danger of bloody demise. With his declaration of a national emergency, President Trump reaffirmed his disdain for the separation of powers and thumbed his nose at the notion the three branches of government are in fact equal.
Come back, not as a Republican, Democrat or "other." Come back into the fold of the legislative branch. Reclaim your role as an equal, as a check on the executive branch.
Come back as a pig. That's OK. Washington is full of those. But you're dangerously close to becoming hogs. Just get back here soon, before we all end up fried like a side of bacon.

Texto completo: It wasn’t just the stormy weather that led to the deaths of 21 horses in less than three months at Santa Anita racetrack. More likely, it was a perfect storm, one that’s been brewing for years.
The heavy rains since December contributed, certainly, but an analysis of two decades of horse racing statistics published by the California Horsing Racing Board shows the world renowned track has weathered worse with fewer fatalities.
Just two years ago, 17 inches of rain — 2 more inches than this year — fell from December to March. Eleven horses died at the Arcadia facility in that time period.
Only two of Santa Anita’s five deadliest years from 1997 to 2018 correspond with higher-than-usual rainfall. The worst year, 71 deaths in 2011-12, was during the drought.
In this case, the various factors at play include the types of horses, the track, the training and racing schedules, and the weather’s impact on each of those, said Rick Arthur, equine medical director for the California Horse Racing Board. Necropsies on the horses will also determine if the animals had any pre-existing conditions or medication in their systems.
“It’s like a plane crash,” Arthur said in an earlier interview. “There’s seldom one factor that explains everything, and I wouldn’t expect that to be the case here.”
New protocols announced
On Friday, Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita and several other racetracks, announced a series of new protocols to increase safety when racing resumes later this month.
Consultants are still reviewing the weather’s impact on the main track, but the initial changes extend far beyond the rainy season. Under the new rules, Santa Anita will scrutinize horses’ medical records — even during training — and control the number of horses on the track for high-speed exercises.
On Saturday, Santa Anita announced its main dirt track would reopen at 5 a.m. Monday for limited workouts — “joggers and gallopers” only.
“Over the past four days, we’ve been able to do a great deal in terms of amending the soil and inspecting it,” said Dennis Moore, who served as track superintendent at Santa Anita until Dec. 31 and recently returned to analyze the racing surfaces.
“Things can happen even under perfect circumstances,” Moore said, “but from everything we’ve been able to learn, this track is in outstanding condition and it’s ready for training.”
Santa Anita’s fixes mirror successful changes made by the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, which cut back on horses on the track in the mornings and tightened up its inspections in the aftermath of a disastrous 2016 summer season, with 17 deaths in 23 days.
Experts: Overuse of track a factor
The increased traffic at Santa Anita is likely one of the main factors in the deaths, according to experts.
Bad weather can upset the consistency of a track, but it also forces horses into the barns, sometimes for days, according to Richard Tedesco, a veteran track consultant with experience as a superintendent at most of Southern California’s racetracks.
Disruptions make trainers and owners anxious to get their horses back out as soon as possible. Once the gates reopen, there’s a flood of horses all at once on a track already weakened by rains.
“You’ve got all of these guys foaming at the mouth to get their horse ready again,” Tedesco said. “The dirt gets pretty well chewed up.”
Too many horses running at the same time is an accident waiting to happen, he said.
Santa Anita shut its track down for two days at the end of February in response to outcry over the first 19 deaths. Track expert Mick Peterson, of the University of Kentucky’s Agricultural Equine Programs, examined and cleared the course as “100 percent ready” before the track reopened Feb. 28.
The horse racing statistics website Equibase tracked 862 workouts in the six days following the reopening. On March 1, 326 horses hit the track before the afternoon races began. Then another 70 ran in those events. The 20th horse died in a race the next day. On March 5, 273 horses worked on the track where the 21st horse died.
“That’s quite a bit,” Tedesco said of the workouts. He estimates an average day is about 150 horses.
In Europe, horses exercise at training centers and race mostly on the weekends, Tedesco said. But in Southern California, the loss of venues has condensed much of the thoroughbred racing to Santa Anita. Trainers say they don’t change locations as often as they did in the past.
Santa Anita scaled up and extended its season when Hollywood Park closed in 2013.
“The bulk of the dates went to Santa Anita,” said Jack Liebau, the director of Los Alamitos Thoroughbred Racing in Orange County. “You have a lot more stress on the track and it’s difficult.”
‘Real art form’ to maintain a track
Heavy rains, a well-worn track, and even the loss of Moore as track superintendent may have all played a part, Liebau said.
Moore, who most recently has been serving as a consultant at Del Mar and Los Alamitos, helped Del Mar with its crisis in 2016. He returned to Santa Anita as a consultant earlier this month to help with the track inspections.
“It’s a real art form to maintain a track in a safe manner,” Liebau said. “Everybody seems to be very happy that Dennis is back.”
Fewer deaths at Los Alamitos
At Los Alamitos Race Course, which runs quarter horses and thoroughbreds, 10,354 horses raced last year, compared to 8,922 at Santa Anita, according to statistics compiled from reports by the CHRB.
Los Alamitos also uses a dirt main track, like Santa Anita, and in the past three months experienced heavier rain. At both venues, the track is tightly compacted to keep out moisture. This creates another potential risk as the harder-than-expected surface can throw off a horse’s fragile footing.
Since Dec. 26, only three horses have died on the track at Los Alamitos, compared to the 21 at Santa Anita. That’s despite the fact that the state’s data shows Los Alamitos had 23 percent more deaths per year on average in the past decade.
Though the tracks share similarities, the big difference between the two venues is the daily traffic. Nine of Santa Anita’s 21 deaths occurred during training on the dirt track, seven were during races. The other five happened on the venue’s storied turf track.
Los Alamitos has added more thoroughbred racing in recent years, but the majority of horses at the venue are quarter horses. These sprinters of the racing world have less intensive training regimens than thoroughbreds, Santa Anita’s bread and butter.
Los Alamitos had less than 200 workouts in the same six day period as Santa Anita’s 862, according to Equibase.
‘Everybody worried’
Last week, the New York Times reported that trainers at Santa Anita appear to be more demanding than counterparts elsewhere in the state. Santa Anita averages 3.02 workouts per start, compared with 0.88 workouts per start for horses running at Gulfstream Park in Florida and 0.42 at Aqueduct in New York.
“Ninety-nine percent of the trainers take very good care of their horses, there’s less than 1 percent that you have to watch,” said Tedesco, the track consultant. “Owners spend a lot of money, the trainers want to win races. It all comes down to, ‘Let’s keep them going.’ “
Everyone at the track is working to ensure safety of horses during training and the races, he said. Tedesco said he’s fielded concerned calls from racetrack officials across the country..
“What is going on is really bad for the industry,” he said. “It’s gotten everybody worried, everywhere.”

Texto completo: “When you wake up in the morning,” the Roman stoic Marcus Aurelius advised some 20 centuries ago, prepare for disappointment. “Tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly,” he writes. He then admonishes us to remember that we are not so different ourselves, and that the people who will infuriate us in the course of the day are “of the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. ”
If only we were capable of such self-awareness. Alas, civility has taken a beating over the past few decades or so in our public life. Americans, it seems, are seeking new ways, large and small, to offend each other. This lack of civility has soured our politics — especially during and after the contentious election of 2016 — to the point where we now no longer simply disagree with each other, but express open contempt to others who do not share our point of view.
Read more commentary:
Why isn't Pelosi getting tough on Democrats like Ilhan Omar? Her majority is at stake.
You can critique Israel without sounding anti-Semitic. Rep. Ilhan Omar should learn how.
The right's revealing hypocrisy over Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments is painful to watch
As we enter another election cycle in which the central figure will be the least civil man ever to occupy the Oval Office, at least some public figures are calling for the defeat of contempt and a return to a more civil discourse. Arthur Brooks, the president of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, recently implored us in the New York Times to “turn away the rhetorical dope peddlers — the powerful people on your own side who are profiting from the culture of contempt,” and instead to take the chance “to change at least one heart — yours. ”
Only the worst misanthrope can disagree with the case for warmth and fellowship. A call for civility and kindness is a call for a better society, full of the trust and good faith that are at the foundation of a democracy.
Such pleas, however, avoid an important question, one that is just as crucial to maintaining a healthy social order as are the civic virtues: What do we do when our fellow citizens express views that are, in fact, contemptible?
A decent society requires guard rails
Notice that I do not add here “actions” that are contemptible, because we already have remedies — mostly — in the law and the courts to address the behavior of our fellow citizens. Racial and religious bigots are free to peddle their poison all day long, but if they engage in violence against other people, they have broken a prohibition that is independent of their views.
But when someone wears a shirt implying that they condone the lynching of journalists (seen at a Trump rally), or argues that sexual attraction to children (in the case of Alabama's Roy Moore) should not be a disqualification from public office, or that Jews are inherently unpatriotic because they have loyalties only to Israel or to money (as Rep. Ilhan Omar suggested), how are we to react?
Do we hold to the warmth of our hearts, and try to quash our innate sense of disgust because somehow a recognition of our common humanity makes us better people? Are we allowed to feel contempt — but then draw the line at expressing it? Or if we express it, must we do so with as much grace as possible, in order to spare the feelings of others?
And if our guiding principle here is to avoid expressions of contempt, then how do we reestablish the guard rails of a decent society? What good does it do to disagree with, say, a racist or a xenophobe without an attempt to induce shame that burns through the sophistry and reflexive appeals to free speech that such people employ to shield their views from criticism?
Hypocrisy on this issue is, of course, rampant. Conservatives were once the greatest critics of “moral relativism,” the idea that there is no better or worse set of values, but today they are among its greatest practitioners. Meanwhile, the same liberals who once deplored the judgmentalism of the right have conveniently rediscovered existential principles, especially about the importance of presidential character.
We should be worthy of each other's company
I am not arguing here for leaping at each other’s throats, either physically or rhetorically. There’s been enough of that, and I am as guilty as anyone else.
Sometimes, my expressions of contempt were an over-reaction to a political disagreement. (I don’t really hold anyone who wants a high marginal tax rate in contempt. ) At other moments, I have been carried away, as we all can be, by my own sense of self-righteousness. And yes, I do have a thing about bare feet on airplanes.
But there have been moments when I have not only felt contempt but believed that it was more than appropriate, and necessary, to express it. Moore's Senate candidacy was one of them.
Perhaps the real question is not how, or whether, we should express contempt, but rather whether we ourselves hold views that are contemptible. We all have the right to an opinion; we do not have the right to insist that others accept our opinions with kindness and good cheer.
The Emperor Aurelius warned us about judging each other. But he also warned us to be worthy of each other’s company: “Will any man despise me? Let him see to it. But I will see to it that I may not be found doing or saying anything that deserves to be despised. ”
Good advice, even 2,000 years later.

Parents, be vigilant, but don't drive yourself crazy while you're at it The best approach to Momo (and other real or perceived threats) is to do what you're most likely already doing.

Texto completo: News of a fresh threat to children exploded on social media last week. Local TV stations, police departments and school officials began warning parents about Momo, a grinning, bug-eyed monster said to appear unexpectedly in children's YouTube videos and instruct young viewers to engage in increasingly dangerous behavior - including self-harm and suicide.
There's no proof that Momo-spliced videos for children exist, or that the figure is linked to any real cases of self-harm or suicide. The photograph that warnings label as Momo actually depicts a spooky sculpture created by a Japanese artist and exhibited in a 2016 art show. (As if to sew things up even more definitively, the artist who made Momo has confirmed that the sculpture was destroyed some time ago after its rubber components began to degrade.)
But despite all signs of the phenomenon being a hoax, fear of Momo persists. In The New York Times, John Herrman observed that "screens and screen time are a source of endless guilt and frustration among parents today, and it makes sense to need to displace these feelings on a face, a character, and something, or someone, with fantastically evil motives."
That Momo is a convenient repository for the terror of contemporary parenting is almost certainly true - but I suspect there's something more timeless there, too.
Consider the context in which Momo has risen to prominence. At the moment, you can see a trifecta of new documentaries examining horrors committed against children: "Leaving Neverland," which explores the pedophilia allegations leveled against Michael Jackson; "Surviving R. Kelly," a deep dive into the rap star's alleged sexual abuse of young black girls; and "Abducted in Plain Sight," about an ordinary family's slow recognition of the years-long molestation of their daughter.
Meanwhile, as critics and viewers pore over these films and what they tell us about our world, the Catholic Church has continued its very public, long-running reckoning with clergy sexual abuse.
What all of these episodes of child abuse share is parents' excruciating realization that they somehow delivered their children into danger - or failed to protect them. Onlookers tend to charge parents in these situations with stupidity, or negligence or even malice after the fact. But that all seems arrayed toward the cause of imagining that abuse could never happen to smart, vigilant, loving parents. And that simply isn't true.
One of the great anxieties of parenting - which no level of vigilance can fully allay - is that you will do everything you can to keep your child out of harm's way but ultimately fail to recognize a threat for what it is, or - worse - even invite it in. Harmful things can come in harmless guises, after all: beloved pop stars, trusted family friends, unassuming priests and perhaps cheerful YouTube videos marked for kids.
You can drive yourself crazy worrying about these hidden risks. But ultimately all you can do is what you're most likely already doing: Look closely, consider carefully, talk to your kids and be cautiously optimistic. There is, finally, quite a bit of good in the world - even in strangers, even on YouTube - and not as much bad as it often seems.

Texto completo: Polling suggests that the more people learn about the cost and bureaucracy likely to result from a government-run health system, the less they favor it. So naturally Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has decided to make his plan for a government-run health system bigger and more expensive.
This column recently noted that Mr. Sanders is the kind of socialist who demands $32.6 trillion from taxpayers to alter their medical care and then misleads them about the imagined benefits. But that description now seems unfair since the 2020 presidential candidate has decided to shove the price tag significantly further north.
The Associated Press reports today :
Sen. Bernie Sanders is raising the stakes of the "Medicare for All" debate by expanding his proposal to include long-term care, a move that is forcing other Democratic presidential candidates to take a stand on addressing one of the biggest gaps in the U.S. health care system...
Some moderate Democrats have criticized the cost of such an expansive proposal and by adding the long-term care provision, Sanders could further expose that divide.
The original Sanders "Medicare for All" plan would end all private health insurance as well as government programs like Medicare and replace them with a new government medical system. Now on top of that Mr. Sanders wants to extend coverage beyond strictly medical services. Reports the AP:
People of any age could qualify if illness, injury or age limit their ability to perform at least one "activity of daily living," such as bathing or dressing, or one or more "instrumental activities of daily living," such as managing money or taking prescribed medications. There would be no income or assets tests to qualify, and no copays or deductibles.
One oddity of the 2020 race is that Democratic candidates closer to the political center seem careful not to offend Sanders voters on the extreme left, yet Mr. Sanders seems not to care about offending any Democratic moderates. Does he know something the other candidates don't about building political coalitions?
This week former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who successfully created and owned the means of craft beer production, resisted describing himself as a capitalist during an appearance on MSNBC.
Meanwhile Mr. Sanders has decided that packaging his government-run health care with an abolition of traditional energy production at a cost that may run above $90 trillion over ten years is not enough. The new long-term care plan could make Mr. Sanders the $100 trillion man in terms of the amount of other people's money he's willing to commit to his agenda.
Perhaps Mr. Sanders is feeling emboldened by the reception he's receiving on the trail. The New York Times reports enthusiasm for many Democratic candidates, adding:
But it is Mr. Sanders's ability to muster supporters, and his focus at this point on big, showy rallies rather than smaller events like town halls, that perhaps best captures the early 2020 ebullience. At this stage of the race, his events are also doubling as shows of force — supporters filled a Navy Pier hall in Chicago — evoking the strategy of President Trump, whose 2016 campaign gathered momentum in part because of the large rallies he held before similarly boisterous crowds.
Some 2,000 people, many from neighboring Omaha, came to see Mr. Sanders in Council Bluffs on Thursday, erupting more than once into now-familiar chants of "BER-nie! BER-nie!" As a band played tunes in an exhibition hall that smelled of freshly popped popcorn, small children amused themselves on a makeshift bed of winter jackets as a group of adults looked on.
But what about the adults who don't attend Sanders rallies? Last month a Morning Consult poll showed declining support for government-run health care. Karlyn Bowman writes in Forbes this week that, as always, people see problems in U.S. health care but also significant benefits:
When Gallup asked people in 2018 to rate the quality of the health care they received, said it was excellent or good. People are consistently satisfied with the access they have and with their doctors.
Ms. Bowman reviews data from various surveys and concludes they "do not suggest Americans are ready to scrap the current system." She adds:
Gallup's 2018 question shows that 54% prefer a health care system based on private insurance, while 40% prefer a government-run system. When the Kaiser Family Foundation asked people about some arguments made for a Medicare for All plan, 60% said they would oppose it if it required most Americans to pay more in taxes. Fifty-eight percent would do so if it eliminated private health insurance companies, and 60% would oppose it if it threatened the current Medicare program. A majority of the public (70%) would oppose Medicare for All it if it meant delays in getting tests or treatments. In another Kaiser question, 47% of Democrats said Democrats in the House should focus on improving and protecting the Affordable Care Act, while 44% said they should focus on a Medicare for All plan.
So most Democrats don't seem to favor his signature policy. And a Morning Consult poll this week on announced and potential presidential candidates found what many other polls have. While Mr. Sanders is dominating the policy agenda among Democratic elected officials, Democratic voters aren't yet entirely sold. Morning Consult summarized the results of the survey:
Joe Biden Remains in Front – Joe Biden receives 31% of the vote, followed by Bernie Sanders, who now receives 27%, and Kamala Harris who comes in third at 11%.
Morning Consult adds:
Sanders Fares Worse With High-Income Democrats – Among Democrats making $100k or more, Sanders gets 19% of the vote. Among those making less than $50k, he receives 30% of the vote.
Some voters may find it endearing that, like other Marxist revolutionaries, Mr. Sanders doesn't seem to particularly care whether a broad democratic consensus favors his policy agenda. But they should understand that he is promising to tax and spend tens of trillions of dollars to expand the quantity of government services.
Whether or not they call themselves capitalists, Democrats at every income level now have a chance to consider what the Sanders agenda will do to the quality of patient care.

Facebook fights to keep CEO emails from investors

Texto completo: One day after Facebook announced the launch of new user privacy tools, attorneys for the social media giant fought back against attempts from investors to view the company's confidential documents, including private messages sent by CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
In a small Delaware courtroom on Thursday, an attorney for institutional investors claimed that the social networking website has been governed by a board of directors who were willfully blind to "red flags" that indicated a massive misuse of user's personal information.
Those board members shied away from their oversight jobs because Zuckerberg – Facebook's powerful chairman, CEO, and largest shareholder – had the ability to fire the directors, said Samuel Closic, attorney for an investment fund controlled by a New York construction workers union.
"He's a 600-pound gorilla in the room," Closic said. "We want to see if he always takes all of the bananas or if other members of the board try to take some back."
Closic is leading a team of attorneys trying to convince a Delaware judge to compel Facebook to hand over reams of documents created between 2011 and 2018, including emails, internal reports, confidential filings to regulators, and unredacted meeting minutes.
Lawyers for Facebook countered that the suit is merely a fishing expedition that has no legal precedent. They said that in recent months it has grown beyond its initial request, which was for a year's worth of documents.
"They're seeking massive, massive amounts of communications," said David Ross, attorney for Facebook. "They don't make any attempt to limit it at all."
Closic argued that the documents would show how Facebook's top officials shaped policies governing the protection of user data after it had entered into a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission.
Last month, The New York Times reported that the FTC may impose a "multibillion-dollar" fine on Facebook for violating the terms of the decree, which mandated that company officials alert users to changes in policies and guard against data breaches, among other requirements.
Books and records The actions by the FTC and shareholders in Delaware court are the latest in a global backlash against what is likely the most powerful nongovernmental entity in the world.
They follow reports last year describing how a political consultant, Cambridge Analytica, used Facebook's personal data to construct psychological profiles of users.
Donald Trump's presidential campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in 2016.
In the Delaware "books and records" suit, investors are demanding to know why in recent years Facebook user data had drifted into the hands of a number of companies, beyond Cambridge Analytica.
The suit, one of a handful filed in the past year aimed squarely at Zuckerberg's control of the company, specifically claims Facebook's board failed to keep the company in compliance with the law, among other assertions.
If Delaware Vice Chancellor Joseph R. Slights III rules in favor of the document request, the investors then would use the information to investigate "wrongdoing," according to court filings.
That could lead to additional lawsuits.
Whitelisting Facebook investors lost billions of dollars last year after numerous news reports revealed that Cambridge Analytica had siphoned personal data from the accounts of tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent.
"During this time, Facebook was ignoring red flags and designing ineffective policies, seemingly on purpose," Closic said.
Through the documents, Closic expects to learn more about a practice called whitelisting.
Details of the practice were revealed in December, when lawmakers in the United Kingdom published 250 pages of Facebook's internal emails showing how the company had for years aggressively hunted for ways to profit off of its massive database of user information.
Suggesting the practice violated the consent decree with the FTC, Closic said it gives other companies access to an entire data profile of a user, beyond the raw data, such as which posts a user might have "liked."
Closic named Lyft and the Royal Bank of Canada as companies that entered into such agreements, which didn't require them to tell customers, or their Facebooks friends, that their user profiles would be accessed.
Closic further argued that Facebook also violating the consent decree when it updated its Android app to allow the company to "read call logs, text messages, and turn on or off the blue tooth function," he said.
"Instead of developing a plain English disclosure, which is required under the FTC consent order, Facebook just developed a workaround to avoid needing to obtain user consent," he said.
Ross did not specifically address the claims of wrongdoing, but called them "fully defendable."

Robert Kraft will not appear in Fla. court at March 28 hearing on soliciting prostitution charges

Texto completo: New England Patriots owner Robert K. Kraft will not appear in court March 28 to be arraigned on two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution at a Florida day spa that authorities allege has links to international human trafficking, his attorney said Thursday.
Citing court records, the Globe reported earlier Thursday that Kraft was required to show up in a Palm Beach County courthouse. But defense attorney Jack A. Goldberger subsequently issued a statement saying that his 77-year-old client is not required to appear under Florida court rules.
“This is a routine procedural hearing that the Court sets based on its schedule," the West Palm Beach defense attorney wrote in an e-mail. “The notice of appearance by the defendant is boilerplate, but in fact the lawyer appears for the defendant in a misdemeanor case."
He added, “The defendant does not appear."
Kraft was charged by Jupiter police for visiting a day spa in the beachfront town on Jan. 19 and Jan. 20 when he allegedly paid for sex acts to be performed on him by a woman. The charges against Kraft were part of a three-county crackdown on sex trafficking masquerading at day spas, an investigation that led to charges against some 200 men.
Through Goldberger, Kraft has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Stacey James, a Kraft spokesman, said Thursday he had no information about the upcoming court date when reached by phone.
The court papers Goldberger described as boilerplate included the directive in all capital letters, “THE DEFENDANT MUST BE PRESENT AT THIS HEARING."
A stipulation initially filed under seal in Kraft's case was later made public. In the document, Judge Frank S. Castor only asked prosecutors and the defense to agree to the new date of March 28. The change of date was made “per judges' request," according to court records.
Kraft has hired several lawyers to represent him in the case, including Goldberger and New York-based attorneys William A. Burck, a former federal prosecutor and White House lawyer during President George W. Bush's administration, and Alex Spiro, who is currently a guest lecturer at Harvard Law School.
The National Football League has said its personnel policies extend to team owners and has opened its own inquiry into the criminal charges against Kraft, whose leadership of the Patriots has made it one of the most successful franchises in the history of professional sports.
The league holds its winter meeting March 24 to 27 in Phoenix, meaning that court activity in the Kraft case will take place after the NFL meetings have ended.
Asked Thursday whether Kraft planned to attend the meetings, James said, “I don't have any update on that."
Authorities allege that Kraft was driven to the Florida spa in a white 2014 Bentley on Jan. 19, when he entered the spa and allegedly paid a woman to perform a sex act on him. He was stopped by police and identified through his driver's license, according to court records.
Police said he returned the following day — arriving in a blue 2015 Bentley — around 11 a.m. and later that day was in Kansas City for the AFC championship game won by the Patriots.
Jupiter police have said that they obtained a “sneak and peek" search warrant to install a camera inside the spa, located in a Jupiter shopping plaza, and that the sex acts involving Kraft and 24 other men were secretly recorded.
Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg, whose office is prosecuting Kraft and 24 other men charged in the case, has said that many of the women in sex trafficking rings are “themselves victims," and he called brothels populated by human trafficking victims an “evil in our midst."
During the multicounty investigation, authorities have asserted that some women were immigrants from China who became victims of sex trafficking and had been forced to live and work in the spas for extended period of time.
Two women were arrested for their alleged roles in operating the Jupiter day spa. They both have pleaded not guilty to numerous charges, and the cases against them are pending, according to Florida court records.

Winter War: Hoover, Roosevelt, and the First Clash Over the New Deal by Eric Rauchway (non-fiction) The history of the most acrimonious presidential handoff in American history – and of the origins of twentieth century liberalism and conservatism. When Franklin Roosevelt defeated Herbert Hoover in the 1932 election, they represented not only different political parties but vastly different approaches to the question of the day: How could the nation recover from the Great Depression? As historian Eric Rauchway shows in Winter War, FDR laid out coherent, far-ranging plans for the New Deal in the months prior to his inauguration. Meanwhile, still-President Hoover, worried about FDR's abilities and afraid of the president-elect's policies, became the first comprehensive critic of the New Deal. Thus, even before FDR took office, both the principles of the welfare state, and reaction against it, had already taken form. Winter War reveals how, in the months before the hundred days, FDR and Hoover battled over ideas and shaped the divisive politics of the twentieth century.

But for D.D., two coincidental murders is too many. Flora Dane sees the murder of Conrad Carter on the TV news and immediately knows his face. She remembers a night when she was still a victim – a hostage – and her captor knew this man. Overcome with guilt that she never tracked him down, Flora is now determined to learn the truth of Conrad's murder. But D.D. and Flora are about to discover that in this case the truth is a devilishly elusive thing. As layer by layer they peel away the half-truths and outright lies, they wonder: How many secrets can one family have?

Texto completo: Sylwia's Ice Cream shop in Cape Coral is what some might call a leap of faith.
At the beginning of February, husband and wife Brad and Sylwia Mills gave up there jobs as an engineer and registered nurse to launch an ice cream parlor.
"We put everything into it so we can be successful," Brad said. "Our hearts and our savings."
But the pair didn't open the shop on a whim. Before launching Sylwia's, they carefully researched ice-cream-making techniques. They took intensive workshops with famous ice cream makers around the state. They sourced the highest quality ingredients.
"Both of us are kind of overachievers," Brad said. "We want to make sure we're doing the best we can. It means a lot to us to make our customers happy."
And that's not all they did.
They also prayed.
"We are both believers, and we pray about everything," Sylwia said. "We wanted to work together, and we were considering different kinds of businesses. We both love ice cream, so that was one of the possibilities."
The couple "gave the subject to the Lord," as Sylwia explained it, and one door after another opened in favor of them launching the ice cream shop. Soon they found the perfect Cape Coral location, and they began a build-out to get the parlor ready.
As their grand opening neared, Sylwia shopped for pretty tea cups and bowls that they could use to serve their ice cream. She posted about the upcoming opening on social media. The pair spent long days and nights preparing the flavors for their inventory.
"We didn't know what to expect," Sylwia said. "I asked my husband, 'Do you think we'll have at least 20 people for our grand opening?'"
He said, "We'll probably get 100."
The opening was scheduled for 1 p.m., and at 12:30 p.m. Sylwia looked outside to see only two people in the parking lot.
"I was heartbroken," she said.
The Mills gathered their employees, and they held hands in a circle to pray one last time.
"Every single person prayed," Sylwia said. "We gave that day to the Lord."
When they finished, they noticed that more people had gathered. Many more.
"There were so many people everywhere," Sylwia said. "When we came outside, people started clapping and cheering. It was like in a movie. For us, it was a wonderful surprise."
That day more than 500 customers came to celebrate the shop's grand opening.
"Everybody was so patient and wonderful," Sylwia said. "Everybody was talking with each other in line, and it was such an incredible time. Many people came back after the grand opening and told us, 'You guys did really awesome.'"
Today the shop stays busy serving its signature homemade flavors.
The most popular? Almond Joy made with coconut shavings, crushed almonds, fudge pieces and chocolate chips. Dulche de leche, a vanilla base swirled with caramel. And strawberry which has pureed fresh strawberries and whole strawberries in Sylwia's vanilla ice cream.
The Mills work hard to keep the flavors in stock, sometimes going all night, but they say they don't mind hard work. Having their own ice cream shop is worth it.
"Everything that we prayed for and hoped for and dreamt," Sylwia said, "it has been beyond that."

Texto completo: NEW YORK - New York regulators have sent a subpoena to the Trump Organization's longtime insurance broker, a demand that comes days after President Donald Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, told Congress the president had misled insurers about the value of his assets.
The brokerage, Aon, told The Associated Press on Tuesday it intends to cooperate with the inquiry by New York's Department of Financial Services.
The document demand comes amid a flurry of criminal, civil and congressional investigations into the president and his business dealings by multiple agencies, including two U.S. House committees controlled by Democrats.
The New York Times said the subpoena seeks many records but does not allege any wrongdoing. The newspaper said the subpoena sought communications and records regarding Aon's business with Trump over the past 10 years and internal Aon contracts and records relating to Trump.
During testimony last week, Cohen presented three years of Trump's financial documents he said showed Trump inflated the value of his assets to lower his insurance premiums.

Texto completo: En una entrevista con ABC News, Ivanka Trump afirmó que su padre, el presidente Donald Trump , no tuvo nada que ver con la autorización de seguridad y la de su esposo, Jared Kushner .
“Hay información anónima de que mi padre presionó, pero el presidente no ha estado involucrado sobre mi autorización de seguridad” , afirmó a la televisora la llamada Primera Hija.
Sin embargo, reportes de CNN señalan que el presidente Trump presionó a su entonces jefe de personal, John Kelly, y al abogado de la Casa Blanca, Don McGahn , para que concediera a su hija la autorización, según tres personas familiarizadas con el asunto.
Aunque el mandatario tiene la autoridad legal para otorgar las autorizaciones, la mayoría de los casos se dejan en manos de la oficina de seguridad del personal de la Casa Blanca.
El proceso tiene que pasar primero por el FBI, que deberá verificar los antecedentes de los funcionarios de distintos niveles.
Segrún el reporte de CNN, el presidente Trump presionó a Kelly y McGahn para que dieran la autorización correspondiente, pero eso no ocurrió y él las autorizó.
La historia de la televisora da seguimiento a lo revelado por New York Times sobre la presión del presidente Trump a Kelly, para conceder a Kushner una autorización de seguridad de alto secreto, a pesar de las preocupaciones planteadas por los funcionarios de inteligencia.

Judge dismisses defamation suit against Fox News, Bill O'Reilly

Resumen: A federal judge has dismissed a defamation suit filed by a woman who alleged Fox News and Bill O'Reilly portrayed her as a liar.

Texto completo: A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a defamation suit filed against the Fox News Channel and Bill O'Reilly by a woman who claimed the network and its former host portrayed her as a liar after she reached a settlement with him.
Rachel Witlieb Bernstein, a former Fox News producer, had filed suit in U. S. District Court in December 2017 alleging that O'Reilly has defamed her in his comments to defend himself against the harassment claims that led to his dismissal from Fox News in April 2017.
She and two other women who joined her suit – Rebecca Gomez Diamond, a former Fox Business Network host, and Andrea Mackis, a former producer on The O'Reilly Factor – had reached separate settlements with O'Reilly over alleged sexual harassment claims.

Still open: No, really, these stores aren't closing even though they share names with bankrupt chains
But in U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge Deborah Batts Tuesday dismissed Bernstein's suit, stating in the ruling that Bernstein had not established specific damages suffered and that her "bare allegation of defamation per se is also wholly insufficient. "
Bernstein's claims against Fox suffered "serious" flaws, including the fact that Fox's statement in an April 17, 2017, story in The New York Times did not directly call Bernstein a "liar," Batts said in the ruling.
Also, statements that 21st Century Fox co-executive chairman Rupert Murdoch made in a Dec. 14, 2017 interview with Sky News were "not about (Bernstein)," the ruling said. Murdoch had said that after the departure of Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, who left the network in July 2016 after being sued for sexual harassment by former "Fox & Friends" host Gretchen Carlson, "there's been nothing else since then" involving harassment allegations. Fox settled that suit involving Ailes in September 2016.
Bernstein can re-apply her defamation complaint alleging damages against O'Reilly, the judge said, but not against 21st Century Fox or Fox News.
"We will amend the pleading to add more detail regarding the damages suffered by Ms. Bernstein as a result of Bill O’Reilly’s defamation," Bernstein's attorney Nancy Erika Smith said in a statement sent to USA TODAY.
The cases involving the two women who had joined Bernstein's suit are proceeding separately.

Documentary clouding Michael Jackson’s legacy

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES (AP) — Can the memory of Michael Jackson survive “Leaving Neverland”?
After all, it has bounced back before. The superstar’s image was tarnished by allegations of sexual abuse that shadowed him throughout much of his adult life and even stood trial on child molestation charges in 2005, for which he was acquitted. His untimely death in 2009 seemed to wash that stain away in an outpouring of public love and a resurgence of sales of his always popular music.
Now, 10 years later, the HBO documentary “Leaving Neverland” has aired detailed and disturbing stories from two men who say Jackson groomed them for sex and molested them when they were just little boys.
It has cast a spotlight on Jackson’s unsavory history at a #MeToo moment when old allegations against stars have been taking hold, and taking them down.
So far, there has been no evidence of major damage to Jackson’s music or his estate, which has made an estimated $2 billion since his death. His music has been featured in commercials and is the subject of a Cirque Du Soleil show in Las Vegas. A play about his life by Pulitzer Prize-winner Lynn Nottage is due out on Broadway next year.
And it may not. After all, Jackson is dead now, which means he can’t be charged or put on trial, keeping the story in the headlines for months or years to come.
And there is Jackson’s nearly unparalleled star status — starting out as a cherub-faced 11-year-old sensation with the Jackson 5, then catapulting into a global phenomenon with the world’s best-selling album of all time, “Thriller,” to his credit and hits adored by multiple generations.
“It’s hard to compare someone of Michael Jackson’s caliber to anyone else,” said Danny Deraney, a publicist who often handles crisis management. “I don’t think we’ve seen anything like it.”
Still, Oprah Winfrey, with her vast influence, may have heralded a shift in public attitudes just by hosting the special “After Neverland,” in which she interviewed the documentary’s subjects, James Safechuck and Wade Robson.
“I hope we can get beyond Michael Jackson the icon, stop staring into the sun, and do what is necessary to help our children and ourselves,” Winfrey said in front of an audience of sexual abuse survivors and their supporters.
She did not directly condemn Jackson. But she praised the film, treated its assertions as truth, and said that she was expecting an earful from Jackson’s defenders.
“I’m gonna get it,” Winfrey, who interviewed Jackson before the allegations emerged in 1993 and his family after his death, said at the end of the show that aired Sunday and Monday on HBO and OWN just after the documentary.
And she did. Even before the special taped, she was subject to fierce criticism by some who left disparaging comments on her social media account.
It could be that Jackson’s fandom is so pervasive, especially in countries that don’t follow his personal news closely, that the documentary and renewed allegations will just make a small dent.
“For Michael Jackson’s fans, more so probably outside of America, I don’t think it will have an effect, because they’ll ride or die with Michael,” Deraney said.
Robson and Safechuck’s allegations didn’t emerge until 2013, when they filed lawsuits seeking money from Jackson’s estate that have since been thrown out and are under appeal. Both men had previously denied Jackson sexually abused them and had been among his fiercest defenders when Jackson was alive, but say having their own children and Jackson’s death led them to confront their truth.
Because of the men’s past denials, some Jackson fans have dismissed their testimonies as lies, motivated by money. Some even refused to watch the documentary. Still, after the film began airing, there were casual fans who felt gutted by the revelations, with some saying they could not listen to his music the same way — if at all.
“People have already made the decision one way or the other,” Deraney said. “I think when a lot of people think of Michael Jackson they already think ‘pedophile,’ whether or not there is any proof.”
“I think what it comes down to,” Deraney added, “is future generations.”
Many millennials have only vague knowledge of the Jackson accusations, and are shocked even by facts that are acknowledged by both sides.
“I’m young enough to have not been aware of the allegations about Michael Jackson as they were happening,” 31-year-old New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie tweeted while watching the documentary. “It is WILD TO ME that anyone thought his behavior around and constant contact with young boys was remotely okay.”
Some of Jackson’s fellow artists have indicated they will not give him and his influence up easily, and say they can separate the performer from the person.
Jason Derulo recently released the first music and videos from a planned boxed set of EPs that the singer and dancer made in tribute to Jackson. It’s set to be released in its entirety on June 25, the 10th anniversary of Jackson’s death.
“Michael was the sole reason I started singing and dancing, so this was a way for me to give back,” Derulo, who has not seen “Leaving Neverland,” told The Associated Press. “I started this project because of my love of the performer that Michael Jackson is and the influence that he had on my life as the best performer that ever lived. This has nothing to do with anyone’s personal life.”
India.Arie says it was right to speak out against R. Kelly, who faces new sexual abuse charges after the Lifetime documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” aired more than a decade after he was cleared of child pornography charges. But Jackson’s situation is different, the singer said.
“I think it’s too late for people to be saying ‘mute Michael Jackson,”’ Arie told the AP.
“With R. Kelly there’s video,” she said, referencing a sex tape that allegedly shows the singer’s abuse. “With Michael Jackson, there’s a lot of speculation. I don’t know if it’s going to go as far. ... Not because we love him more, I just think it’s a different situation.”
Jackson’s estate, his most ardent fans, and his family, have no such ambiguity in their views. They say the documentary repeats discredited allegations from admitted liars.
Jackson’s brothers said they were already in a rough period of managing his memory and legacy with their father Joseph Jackson’s death last year, when they heard that “Leaving Neverland” was coming.
“This time is difficult for us because you know Michael, coming up on the 10th anniversary of his passing and my father passed away six months ago,” Marlon Jackson told the AP last week. “So those things are still there, and you never get rid of them. You learn to live with them. And now we’re dealing with something that’s totally different but has no truth to it. There’s no facts at all.”
At least one prominent and formerly devoted fan says he’s been forced to reconsider.
“I’ve spent a lifetime loving MJ,” Los Angeles Times music writer Gerrick D. Kennedy wrote after seeing the documentary’s premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.
“Roughly an hour into ‘Leaving Neverland,’ it felt like my chest had caved in .... It wasn’t long before I accepted that ‘Leaving Neverland’ would force me – and likely many others who also feel a deep connection to Jackson’s work – to see that none of us really knew him. And that maybe we’d been avoiding the truth.”
The subjects of the documentary themselves don’t have strong feelings about whether people should give up Jackson’s music.
“It’s a chance to reevaluate who you want to be your idols,” Safechuck told the AP at Sundance. “Because you can write a song, does that mean you should be people’s moral compass? ... It’s less about tearing down somebody and more about an opportunity of who do we want to look up to.”
“There’s plenty of other amazing people to fill that role.”

Texto completo: NEW YORK – A state regulator has subpoenaed an insurance provider for The Trump Organization, opening a new front in the widening investigations focused on President Donald Trump, his business, family, and White House administration.
Aon, a London-headquartered financial services company that is one of the world's largest insurance brokerages, said it was served a subpoena on Monday by the New York Department of Financial Services.
Donna Mirandola, Aon's vice president of global content marketing, confirmed the subpoena. The insurance brokerage intends to cooperate with the request but would not "comment on specific client matters," she said in an email response.
Another person with knowledge of the subpoena confirmed that the request sought records of communications involving Aon, Trump and his company, as well as internal documents for related insurance coverage. The person declined to be named because the subpoena had not been disclosed publicly.
A spokeswoman for The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
The New York action, combined with moves by the Democratically controlled House, represents the latest in a series of new investigations that could target Trump through the second half of his White House term.
News about the subpoena, first reported by The New York Times, comes less than a week after former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen testified at a congressional hearing that his ex-boss inflated the value of his financial assets to obtain more favorable insurance rates and loans from banks.
Separately, the House Judiciary Committee on Monday requested records from 81 "agencies, entities and individuals" linked to the Republican presidential administration along with Trump's family members, present and former associates and his private businesses.
Additionally, the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday announced new hires, including a former federal prosecutor with expertise in battling Russian organized crime. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , who chairs the panel, has signaled plans to continue an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Criticizing the new investigations, Trump tweeted on Tuesday that Democratic House committee chairs "have gone stone cold CRAZY" and "won't get ANYTHING done for our Country!"
More: Trump immigration policy under scrutiny at simultaneous congressional hearings
More: FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb resigns
Special Counsel Robert Mueller also is focused on Russian interference with the presidential election; his report could be imminent. Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have investigated Cohen, hush money payments to women who said they had sexual affairs with Trump, and other matters.
The New York regulator is part of the administration of Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a frequent Trump critic. The Department of Financial Services oversees all insurance companies that do business in New York, as well as many banks, credit unions and consumer credit reporting agencies.
The regulator does not have review authority over Trump or his business, nor does it have prosecutorial power. However, the regulator can refer findings to law enforcement authorities.

Texto completo: Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, announced on Monday that he would not run for president in 2020 and would instead work to end gerrymandering.
"Though I will not run for president in 2020, I will continue to fight for the future of our country through the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and its affiliates," Mr. Holder wrote in an opinion article published on Monday in The Washington Post.
The National Democratic Redistricting Committee, formed in 2017 under Mr. Holder, aims to contest a combination of governorships, legislative seats and more obscure state offices to chip away at Republicans' control of the redistricting process.
Mr. Holder said in a February 2018 interview with The New York Times that the group was mainly focused on denying Republicans in state governments from achieving what is known as a trifecta -- a single party controlling the governorship and an entire legislature, as Republicans do in Ohio and Florida, among other critical battlegrounds.
In The Washington Post, Mr. Holder wrote that he vowed to "do everything I can to ensure that the next Democratic president is not hobbled by a House of Representatives pulled to the extremes by members from gerrymandered districts."
So far 14 Democrats are officially planning a run for the White House. Mr. Holder did not say which candidate he planned to endorse.
"With the depth and diversity of the current field of candidates (and those who may still join), we will have a host of good options," he wrote, adding that some of the most important issues to address included universal health coverage, immigration reform and climate change.
He left few hints as to his ideal candidate, but did emphasize that age should not be a deciding factor.
"In evaluating potential nominees, we should remember that creativity is not limited to the young, nor wisdom to those who are older," Mr. Holder wrote. "We must measure our candidates not by their age, but by the vitality of their ideas."
Mr. Holder also wrote that it was fundamental to ensure elections are "free from foreign interference," and accused the Republican Party of using "voter ID laws, gerrymandering and purging of the voter rolls" to undermine the right to cast ballots in fair elections, "while doing nothing to protect our electoral system from another foreign attack."
Mr. Holder, 68, who left public service in 2015 after serving for six years under President Barack Obama as the nation's first African-American attorney general, was considered unlikely to pursue the presidency despite having emerged as a vocal critic of President Trump.

Former Colorado governor declares candidacy for president

Texto completo: John Hickenlooper, the two-time Colorado governor and former brewpub owner who has overseen Colorado's remarkable economic expansion, declared his candidacy for president Monday.
Hickenlooper, 67, a socially progressive, pro-business Democrat who has called himself an “extreme moderate," had long said he was considering a run, and made early visits to Iowa and New Hampshire. His biggest challenge will be distinguishing himself in what is sure to be a packed field of potentially history-making candidates and deep-pocketed household names.
“I'm running for president because we need dreamers in Washington, but we also need to get things done," he said in a video announcing his candidacy, with the Rocky Mountains as his backdrop.
Hickenlooper plans to run as a “pragmatic progressive," a candidate with extensive executive experience in a primary field of senators. He also suggested that his childhood as a self-declared nerd has prepared him for an electoral battle against the president.
As governor from 2011 until he reached his term limits in 2019, Hickenlooper employed a careful, consensus-building approach that won him praise from both sides of the aisle and helped him guide Colorado out of a recession and through a series of floods, wildfires, and mass shootings in the first years of his tenure. When he left office in January, his state had one of the nation's best economies.
He had also signed a contentious gun control package that included universal background checks, and helped Colorado become the first state in the nation to enact methane capture requirements, a measure he has said was equivalent to taking 320,000 cars off the road every year.
But even in Colorado, fellow Democrats have expressed skepticism that his signature low-key approach will translate to national success.

Holder won't run, saying he'll fight gerrymandering
Eric Holder, the former US attorney general, announced Monday that he would not run for president in 2020 and would instead work to end gerrymandering.

So far 14 Democrats are officially planning a run for the White House. Holder did not say which candidate he planned to endorse.
New York Times
Bill Clinton has 2020 advice, but few candidates seek it
Nearly 20 years after he left the White House, Bill Clinton is still sought after for advice by some Democrats running for president. But the names on his dance card in recent months underscore how much his standing in the party has changed.
So far, none of the party's early front-runners has had a formal meeting with Clinton. Nor have the women who are running in the historically diverse primary field.
Instead, Clinton has spoken mostly with male candidates who are considered longshots for the Democratic nomination, including Montana Governor Steve Bullock, former Housing secretary Julian Castro, and former Maryland representative John Delaney.
Clinton remains one of Democrats' most successful politicians of the last half-century and one of its strongest messengers on the economy. Yet the party has shifted considerably to the left since his two terms in White House, and his personal baggage — as well as lingering hostilities from his wife Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 campaign — make him an awkward adviser for some in his party's next class of presidential hopefuls.
Tensions run particularly deep between the Clintons and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who has launched another bid for the White House. The Clintons blame Sanders for damaging Hillary Clinton during the 2016 primary.
Neither side tried to mask the tensions in the days since Sanders launched his 2020 campaign. When asked Friday on ABC's "The View" whether he would seek campaign advice from Hillary Clinton, Sanders said: "I think not."

Fast food at White House for N. Dakota football champs
The smell of burgers and fries wafted through the State Dining Room as President Trump celebrated the championship football players from North Dakota State on Monday with fast food, like he did when he honored the national champion Clemson Tigers.
Trump told the football team he could have had White House chefs prepare a meal, but "I know you people very well."
The players laughed with the president while eyeing stacks of Big Macs and Chick-fil-A sandwiches on a long table in the center of the room. A side table was piled with bags of french fries, kept warm under a light.
Trump served a similar spread that included hundreds of hamburgers to Clemson's players in January. He said he personally paid for that meal because much of the staff in the White House residence had been furloughed by a government shutdown.
The Bison, who have the most titles in the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision, ended the season on Jan. 5 with a 38-24 win over Eastern Washington University.
It was the Bison's seventh national title in eight years.

Did Bolton blow North Korea talks?

Texto completo: President Trump’s second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un last week was criticized by both parties in Washington long before Air Force One even touched down in Hanoi. Washington’s political class seemed terrified that the nearly 70 year state of “war” with North Korea might actually end. In the end the only positive thing they could say about the meeting was that Trump apparently walked away with nothing to show for it.
The location of the meeting – Hanoi, Vietnam – serves as a great example of what can be won in peace versus what is lost in war. After losing nearly 60,000 US service members in an unnecessary war that took a million Vietnamese lives, the US loss of the Vietnam war resulted not in a communist takeover of southeast Asia but something very different: the domino theory failed because communism was destined to fail. Now we are close trading partners with an increasingly pro-market Vietnam. The result of trade and exchange versus war is a better life for all.
Unfortunately for Washington, the real lesson of Vietnam has not been learned. That is why the Republicans, Democrats, and the entire mainstream media spoke as one against President Trump’s decision to take a bold step and actually meet again, one-on-one, with one of our “enemies” to see if we can avoid nuclear conflict.
One leading Democrat, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), attacked Trump for meeting with Kim because speaking to the North Korean “gives him legitimacy.” Does it make any sense that we should not even speak with our nuclear-armed adversaries because it gives them “legitimacy”? He’d rather have a nuclear war as long as Kim remains “illegitimate”? This is sadly the kind of thinking that prevails in Washington.
The media reported that Trump walked away from the meeting before the scheduled signing ceremony and closing press event. The talks broke down, it was reported, because Kim demanded an end to all sanctions before any reduction in North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. Washington sighed with relief and said all together, “better no deal than a bad deal.”
Meanwhile the North Koreans held a rare press conference clarifying that they only asked for partial sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling one of their main nuclear facilities. Further, press reports began to surface that National Security Advisor John Bolton threw additional demands on the table which led Kim to draw the meeting to an early close.
Who’s telling the truth? We likely won’t know. But given Bolton’s strong opposition to any kind of peace agreement with North Korea it’s hard to doubt that he had something to do with the blow-up of the summit. As the New York Times reported over the weekend, while Trump’s advisors were shocked when he decided to meet Kim face-to-face the first time for negotiations, John Bolton wasn’t worried at all. As the Times writes, “Mr. Bolton told colleagues not to worry. The negotiations, he said, would collapse on their own.” And so they did.
Will Trump continue to allow his diplomatic efforts to be undermined by his own staff? Let’s hope the president will ignore Washington, ignore the neocons, and continue to work for peace with North Korea.

Here's why Court should revisit libel law overreach

Texto completo: "The constitutional foundation
of New York Times v. Sullivan
are not entirely firm."
Cass Sunstein, law professor
Last week, the Supreme Court refused to hear a case involving a libel claim by one of the women who accused comedian Bill Cosby of rape. That's not terribly surprising. Since the Supreme Court's 1964 decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, justices have interpreted the First Amendment to make libel claims very difficult to bring.
If you're a public official — later expanded to include all "public figures," a class that includes football coaches and celebrities generally, and even people who publicly accuse comedians of rape — you can't recover without showing that the libelous statement was made with "actual malice," meaning with knowledge it was false, or with reckless disregard of its falsity.
Even nonpublic figures have to show actual malice to recover punitive or presumed damages. The result is that libel claims are very hard to bring. This is especially true after the Supreme Court's 1968 decision in St. Amant v. Thompson holding that a plaintiff has to show that the defendant entertained serious doubts that what he was publishing was true. Mere failure to investigate isn't enough.
The court based these rules on the First Amendment's protection of free speech and freedom of the press, arguing that the prospect of libel judgments would chill news media's willingness to cover controversial issues.
But although the Supreme Court refused to hear the Cosby case, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that the court needs to undo New York Times v. Sullivan on the ground that it was a case of constitutional overreach. As Thomas wrote, "The constitutional libel rules adopted by this court in New York Times and its progeny broke sharply from the common law of libel, and there are sound reasons to question whether the First and 14th Amendments displaced this body of common law."
Justice Thomas would have the court revisit the issue, and possibly overturn Sullivan, arguing that the "actual malice" standard has no support in the Constitution.
Not surprisingly, this was poorly received by the press. Columnist Will Bunch in the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, "Thomas wants to crush the free press just like southern segregationists of the 1950s." A column in the San Francisco Chronicle called it "Clarence Thomas vs. public's right to know." And in the always temperate ThinkProgress, we were told that Thomas has declared war on the free press.
Well. Speaking as a blogger, columnist and occasional reporter, I have to say the Sullivan ruling has been very, very good to me. You have to work pretty hard to commit actionable libel under present law, and like everyone else in the business of writing and speaking and so on, I'm pretty happy with that legal regime. But this doesn't mean Thomas is wrong.
As even liberal law professor Cass Sunstein commented: "Thomas is right to point out that the constitutional foundations of New York Times v. Sullivan are not entirely firm." And it's also true that the case's original holding — in response to a coordinated plan by southern segregationist officials to use libel suits (brought in front of sympathetic local juries) to punish the national press for unfavorable coverage — has been expanded to cover all sorts of other cases, such as Cosby's.
It should be noted that limiting libel claims is essentially a subsidy for the chattering classes and the media. Like all subsidies, the costs come from someone else — in this case, someone whose reputation is ruined and who is left without a remedy. (And people who would perhaps not have been defamed at all if the news media worried more about libel exposure.)
I very much doubt that the Supreme Court will take up Thomas' call to overturn New York Times v. Sullivan. But I would not be surprised to see it cut back on some of the more expansive follow-ups to that decision. The court has never given a convincing reason why "public figures" should be treated the same as "public officials." And the St. Amant holding that there's no duty to do due diligence if you don't suspect anything is wrong is a likely place to start cutting back.
Like Sunstein, I think it's time to start thinking about ways to discourage defamation a bit more, and to provide remedies for people who are harmed. And I would not be surprised to see the Supreme Court go at least a little way down that road.

Texto completo: It's no secret that chefs and restaurateurs sometimes cultivate reputations for rigidity: egotistically refusing to allow substitutions on orders, denying requests for extra salt, even balking when patrons beg for music to be turned down in a boisterous dining room.
On the other end of that spectrum of inflexibility sits Colleen Kelley, the accommodating owner and head chef of Portland's Silly's and its new spinoff, Simply Vegan by Silly's. Kelley pays attention to every plate that comes back to the kitchen at her flagship restaurant, noting what diners finish off and what they leave behind. She also talks to her customers, requests their feedback and perhaps most impressively, acts on it.
So when the high-top tables and bar seating at Simply Vegan didn't go over well during the Washington Avenue cafÃ©'s first few months, she swapped them immediately with patio furniture from Silly's - a temporary fix. The strictly plant-based restaurant's menu also reflects her eagerness to revive guests' favorite dishes, just in a healthier format, like a recent Silly's summer special of Caesar pasta salad ($6 per pint) that she "veganized" with canola-based Vegenaise and topped with savory, roasted garlic granola.
Moreover, the very concept behind Simply Vegan came from a customer interaction 15 years ago, one she thinks about.
"I was waiting on a table at Silly's, and a woman told me that the only thing on the entire menu she could eat was a plain salad. Being a new business owner, I was devastated," she said. "I didn't know a lot about being vegan, but I swore to myself, 'That's never going to happen again.' "
First came a fryolator dedicated to vegan dishes exclusively, then menu alterations that demanded patience and an optimistic attitude toward failure. Slowly, Kelley mastered the art of substitution - a blend of tamari and balsamic vinegar in place of Worcestershire sauce (normally brewed with anchovy); simmered seaweed standing in for the sultry umami of fish sauce; even a lacy "fricco" of melted Daiya tapioca-cheese instead of cold cuts. But all that savory recipe rehab was just a prelude to tackling the hard part: baking.
Hand-in-hand with her old friend and head baker, Jeremy Newbert, the two found ways to use applesauce and flax seeds to conquer land where eggs and dairy once prevailed. And in the time it takes a biscuit made with grated, frozen Earth Balance margarine to rise, they had the makings of a second restaurant.
"I'm not a vegan myself," Kelley said. "I love scallops too much. But I wanted a new vegan outlet to be the kind of place where vegan people can come in and not have to even look at the menu to see what they're able to eat. They can just come in and say 'Yay!' " Kelley enthused.
She converted a former nonprofit organization's offices to a nine-seat cafÃ©, personalizing the space with dulce-de-leche-colored ceiling paint, framed artwork from Cook's Illustrated magazines and a long display shelf to show off Kelley's collection of ceramic salt-and-pepper shakers.
At the back is a minute kitchen with a single home range where pickles and chilis are prepared. Nearly everything else comes from Silly's much more capacious digs down the block. It's an unusual division of labor - one that isn't without its hiccups.
As it stands now, Simply Vegan's staff (usually just a person or two) assemble sandwiches and platters from largely pre-prepared components stored in deli cases and fridges. That may sound simple, but between re-heating, spreading, grilling and toasting, a substantial amount of work is required. When the restaurant is understaffed, as it was each of the three times I visited, it can take upwards of half an hour for dishes to arrive.
Sometimes they're worth waiting for, like a side of BBQ beans ($4) slow-cooked with cocoa and Moxie to give them a layered, warm-spice complexity, or the Don't Mock Me Reuben ($12), a well-balanced sandwich made with homemade seitan, crisp pickles and Thousand Island dressing. I enjoyed it almost as much as the Nothing Bettah... Muffaletta ($13), a twist on the New Orleans classic featuring a fat portobello mushroom cap, savory "cheese" fricco and tons of tart giardiniera and olive salad.
Yet all three sandwiches were sloppy, and by the time the overloaded staff delivered them, the bottom layer of bread had soaked through on each. The issue isn't restricted to sandwiches. The I Said Mush ($12) breakfast platter unappetizingly lived up to its name, thanks to a "gravy" (really more of an astringent purÃ©e of reconstituted dried mushrooms) that drenched both turmeric-and-paprika-spiced tofu cubes and an once-fluffy biscuit.
So too, my guest's Wrapping and Rolling Burrito ($10), a dish so waterlogged from wet components (black bean chili, spicy sauce, salsa) that she wound up wearing more than she ate.
"I'd have less on my shirt if I just asked them to throw it at me," she said.
Eating the You've Got Kale sandwich ($12) was a tidier experience. Fillings like chunky pepita-studded white-bean hummus, roasted garlic and greens (including both baby spinach and kale) left the toast crisp, and my lap clean.
And while Simply Vegan's savory dishes may be uneven in their execution, the cafÃ©'s baking is consistently top-notch. Everything from surprisingly light French breakfast puffs ($2.25), muffin-style tea cakes baked in square molds, then rolled in melted margarine and cinnamon-sugar, to slices of triple-decker layer cake large enough to feed four. My favorite of these is the lurid grasshopper cake ($6.75) a mint-and-dark-chocolate treat slathered thick in green "butter"cream frosting and crusted with unrestrained fistfuls of crushed Oreo cookies.
The sponge itself makes such an indulgent, tender-crumbed cake base, I laughed out loud when Colleen Kelley told me about its austere origins. "You won't believe it, but it is based on an old World War II recipe, from back when they really didn't have any eggs or sugar," she said.
From that humble starting point, she and Newbert did exactly what you might expect they would: "We took the recipe and experimented, heard what people said and... well, we made changes until we got it right. Listen, this is my 42nd year doing restaurants, but I don't claim to know everything. I talk to people and see what they like." It's a world-class tinkerer's path to greatness, one that leaves me with confidence that, although Simply Vegan isn't yet fantastic, it stands a good chance of getting there.

Texto completo: Top House investigators are demanding that the White House turn over documents related to its security clearances process by Monday, an escalation of the yearslong fight between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration that could lead to subpoenas.
The move follows an explosive report that President Donald Trump interceded to give his son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance despite concerns from top intelligence officials. The president directed his then-chief of staff, John Kelly, to approve the application -- a move Kelly, who had expressed concerns about the entire process, later detailed in a memo.
House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., in a letter to the White House on Friday, urged "full and immediate compliance" with outstanding requests the panel had made related to security clearances for much of the past two years.
"I am now writing a final time to request your voluntary cooperation with this investigation," Cummings said in the letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone.
While Cummings did not use the word subpoena in his letter, his recent correspondence with the White House suggested he is open to one: Cummings told the White House in early February to let the committee know "whether you intend to comply voluntarily or whether the committee should consider alternative means to obtain this information."
The White House still has not given the panel documents, arguing instead that the president traditionally has broad authority over his executive staff and clearance matters.
Cummings' frustration with the lack of response was clear in his Friday letter.
"Since I sent my letter on January 23, I have been negotiating in good faith -- and in private -- to try to obtain the information the Committee needs to conduct its investigation," Cummings wrote. "However, over the past five weeks, the White House has stalled, equivocated, and failed to produce a single document or witness to the Committee."
Cummings' letter cited reports that Kushner, a senior White House adviser, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, pressured the president to grant Kushner a long-delayed clearance and that Trump instructed Kelly to fix the problem early last year. Trump's push to get Kushner clearance -- and the chief of staff's concerns about it -- was first reported by the New York Times, which also reported that then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn had concerns about Kushner's clearance. The Washington Post later reported on Trump's actions.
Both Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump have publicly denied the president was involved in securing a clearance for Kushner. The president told The New York Times in a Jan. 31 interview that he did not direct Kelly or similar officials to grant a clearance for his son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump told ABC News earlier this month that her father was not involved in the process.
In the first year of the administration, Kushner held an interim security clearance that allowed him to view both top-secret and sensitive compartmented information, which is classified intelligence related to sensitive sources. With that designation, he has been able to attend classified briefings, get access to the president's daily intelligence report and issue requests for information to the intelligence community.
But there was widespread concern in the White House about Kushner's lack of a permanent clearance. Indeed, Democrats on Capitol Hill are also now questioning why Kushner had such trouble attaining that status.
"These new reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr. Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation's most sensitive secrets, why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation, and why General Kelly and Mr. McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions, and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this committee," Cummings wrote Friday.
The White House security clearance process has been a focus for Oversight Committee Democrats over the past two years. Cummings even garnered bipartisan support for his bid to investigate the matter in the wake of reports that Rob Porter, a former White House aide who had been accused of beating his ex-wife, had been denied a clearance but still worked in a top position.
At the time, Republicans controlled the House, and then-Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., joined Cummings in requesting more information about the process. When the White House ignored the requests, however, Gowdy refused Cummings' pleas to subpoena the information.

The great hypocrisy of the Green New Deal

Texto completo: Not ready for prime time. That was the consensus reaction to the Green New Deal, released last month by freshman Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
The Economist called the proposal “deeply unserious.” A Washington Post editorial labeled it as “fantasy.” New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote that it would result in “the greatest centralization of power in the hands of the Washington elite in our history.”
But the Green New Deal isn’t just lousy policy. It’s incredibly hypocritical.
In boosting the plan, for instance, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that “the world will end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” It was a hyperbolic summary of an alarmist and scientifically unsound United Nations report on greenhouse gas emissions.
Enter, the hypocrisy.
If a climate change-induced existential crisis were, indeed, just around the corner, the most rationale response would be to gin up all the nuclear power the world can get. After all, in 2017 nuclear provided more than half (56 percent) of the country’s emissions-free electricity — more than triple the amount we get from wind and 18 times more than solar generates generation.
But, according to the now-deleted FAQ sheet from Ocasio-Cortez’s office, “The Green New Deal makes new fossil fuel infrastructure or nuclear plants unnecessary.” Launching “a massive mobilization of all our resources into renewable energies,” while eliminating emissions-free nuclear power is the most inefficient and expensive approach to carbon reduction possible.
The hypocrisy doesn’t end there.
Green New Dealers are trying to sell their policies in the name of economic security and justice. However, policies that take away affordable, reliable power from American families are highly regressive. Higher energy costs hit low-income households hardest, because they spend a higher percentage of their budget on energy. The higher these costs climb, the more they are forced to make difficult choices between keeping the heat on or providing food for their family or perhaps going to the doctor.
Higher energy prices mean more than just having less money available for other necessities. It means having to spend more for all of the goods and services you purchase. That’s because energy is a critical component of manufacturing, communications and transportation—all of which are involved in getting goods and services to your household.
The Green New Deal doesn’t lead to more economic security and justice. It leads to greater economic strain, with low-income families being stressed the most.
And where’s the justice in cronyism and corporate welfare. The Green New Deal would open the floodgates of both.
Ocasio-Cortez rightly blasted New York’s special tax breaks for Amazon’s proposed HQ2. Offering up billions in state and city special tax breaks left a sour taste in many peoples’ mouths.
Cronyism works for big companies because they can offer a lot: investment, jobs and prosperity. But it is not a strategy for long-term economic success because it comes at the expense of other investments and opportunities. The investments will come when there’s an attractive, level-playing field for all companies to compete.
The Green New Deal would introduce significantly higher level of cronyism because Ocasio-Cortez wants the federal government (i.e., American taxpayers) to pay for the whole thing.
Remember Solyndra, the half-billion dollar solar boondoggle that went belly up? That’s just a small taste of things to come under a Green New Deal that puts potentially trillions of dollars up for grabs. As was the case with Solyndra, when the feds start picking energy technologies and companies to fund, they are essentially gambling with other peoples’ money. And there is never a guarantee the bet will pay off.
Solyndra is merely one example of a failed company that could not survive even with the federal government’s help. And there are many other examples of green cronyism that even more closely parallel New York’s erstwhile deal with Amazon, which Ocasio-Cortez found so distasteful. Taxpayers gave money or government-backed loans to companies that already enjoyed large market capitalization and/or substantial private investors. Federal “investment” wasn’t needed. But, hey, who’s gonna turn down free money?
The economic pain of green cronyism cuts deeper than wasted taxpayer money. When Washington steers money to — or away from — “favored” businesses or technologies, private-sector investment follow. This not only stifles competition and innovation, it also centralizes control in the hands of politicians, elites and lobbyists.
That’s the big picture. But the Green New Deal has very personal ramifications as well. It would change the way you live your life — from what car you drive, to how cool or warm you you’re your home, to what you eat.
The stench of hypocrisy makes it all that much worse.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A powerful Democratic House committee chairman investigating possible abuses of the government's security clearance process stepped up demands on Friday to see key documents and interview potential witnesses from the White House in light of a new report that President Trump personally intervened to grant his son-in-law a top-secret clearance despite legal and national security concerns.
The chairman, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who leads the House Oversight and Reform Committee, accused the White House in a new letter of stonewalling his requests for information and implied that if it did not comply voluntarily, he would issue a subpoena to compel its cooperation.
He said the report, published by The New York Times, added new concerns that Mr. Trump was lying to the public about his role in the clearance process to existing and broader questions about irregularities surrounding who should have access to sensitive government secrets.
"If true, these new reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr. Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation's most sensitive secrets," Mr. Cummings wrote in a letter to Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel. The letter went on to ask about "why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation, why General Kelly and Mr. McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions, and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this Committee."
The report in The New York Times said that Mr. Trump's intervention so concerned senior administration officials that John F. Kelly, then the White House chief of staff, documented the action in a contemporaneous internal memo that said he had been "ordered" to grant Mr. Kushner a top-secret clearance.
The Times also reported that Donald F. McGahn II, then the White House counsel, wrote a memo of his own documenting concerns raised by the C.I.A. and other officials about Mr. Kushner. Mr. McGahn, the memo noted, had recommended against giving him such broad access to the government's secrets.
Mr. Trump told The Times in January in an Oval Office interview that he had no role in Mr. Kushner's clearance.
Mr. Cummings has been pursuing reported irregularities by the White House and the Trump transition team since 2017, when Republicans were in control of the House. But he started a broad inquiry of his own last month after taking control of the oversight panel, Congress's most muscular investigative body, which he said he hoped would shine light on any national security risks that may exist.
He has specifically requested information on the clearances of nine current and former administration officials, including Mr. Kushner. Among those whose clearances he intends to scrutinize are Mr. Trump's current and former national security advisers, John R. Bolton and Michael T. Flynn; his onetime staff secretary, Rob Porter; a former senior director on the National Security Council, Robin Townley; a former deputy national security adviser, K. T. McFarland; as well as Sebastian Gorka, a former deputy assistant to the president.
Mr. Cummings has also asked for documents related to a review of the security clearance process that Mr. Kelly conducted in 2018 that concluded there were serious flaws in the system meant to vet high-level officials. And Mr. Cummings wants to talk to "all personnel in the White House Personnel Security Office."
The White House, he said on Friday, has thus far not complied.
In a sign that House Democrats would seek to further elevate the issue in their oversight agenda, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Thursday that his panel, responsible for overseeing American intelligence agencies, would work with Mr. Cummings'.
Mr. Schiff called Mr. Trump's actions the "latest indicator of the president's utter disregard for our national security and for the men and women who sacrifice so much every day to keep us safe."

ADVANTAGE TO THE AUTOCRATS CHINA CAN PAY TRUMP OFF; PLACES WITH RULE OF LAW CAN'T

Texto completo: There's been some good news on global trade lately: A full-scale U.S.-China trade war appears to be on hold, and may be avoided altogether.
The bad news is that if we do make a trade deal with China, it will basically be because the Chinese are offering Donald Trump a personal political payoff. At the same time, a much more dangerous trade conflict with Europe is looming. And the Europeans, who still have this peculiar thing called rule of law, can't bribe their way to trade peace.
The background: Last year, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on a wide range of Chinese products, covering more than half of China's exports to the United States. But that might have been only the beginning: Mr. Trump had threatened to impose much higher tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese exports starting Friday before backing off.
What was the motivation for these tariffs? Remarkably, there doesn't seem to be any strong constituency demanding protectionism; if anything, major industries have been lobbying against Mr. Trump's trade moves, and the stock market clearly dislikes trade conflict, going down when tensions rise and recovering when they ease.
So trade conflict is essentially Mr. Trump's personal vendetta - one that he is able to pursue because U.S. international trade law gives the president enormous discretion to impose tariffs on a variety of grounds. Predicting trade policy is therefore about figuring out what's going on in one man's mind.
Now, there are real reasons for the U.S. to be angry at China and demand policy changes. Above all, China notoriously violates the spirit of international trade rules, de facto restricting foreign companies' access to its market unless they hand over valuable technology. So you could make a case for U.S. pressure on China - coordinated with other advanced economies! - to stop that practice.
But there has been little evidence that Mr. Trump is interested in dealing with the real China problem. I was at a trade policy conference over the weekend where experts were asked what Mr. Trump really wants; the most popular answer was "tweetable deliveries."
Sure enough, Mr. Trump has been crowing about what he portrays as big Chinese concessions, which all seem to involve China's government ordering companies to buy U.S. agricultural products. In particular, the postponement of the trade war came after a Chinese pledge to buy 10 million tons of soybeans. This will please farmers, although it's far from clear that it will even make up for the losses they've suffered from previous Trump actions.
The point, however, is that what China is offering doesn't at all get at the real U.S. national interests at stake. All it does is give Mr. Trump something to tweet about.
Oh, and by the way: China's biggest bank, which happens to be majority-owned by the Chinese government, currently occupies three whole floors in the Trump Tower in Manhattan. It has been planning to reduce its space; it will be interesting to see what happens to that plan now.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce Department has prepared a report on imports of European automobiles that, according to the German press, concludes that these imports pose a threat to national security.
If this sounds ridiculous, that's because it is. Indeed, while the Europeans aren't angels, they do abide by global rules, and it's hard to accuse them of any major trade sins. Yes, they do have 10 percent tariffs on U.S. cars - but we impose 25 percent tariffs on their light trucks, which makes us more than even.
But a department headed by perhaps the most corrupt commerce secretary in history will, of course, conclude whatever Trump wants it to conclude. And this report gives the president the legal authority to get us into a trade war with the European Union.
If it happens, this trade war will be immensely damaging. The EU is America's biggest export market, directly accounting for around 2.6 million jobs. Moreover, our economies are very much intermeshed - which is why even the U.S. auto industry is horrified at the possibility that Mr. Trump will impose tariffs on cars.
But here's the thing: Unlike the Chinese government, the EU can't order private companies to make splashy purchases of U.S. goods. And it certainly can't steer business to Trump Organization properties. As a result, the chances of spiraling trade conflict remain high.
The point is that when it comes to dealing with Mr. Trump and his team, autocracies have an advantage over democracies that follow the rule of law. And trade disputes are arguably the least of it.
Think about the push by financially conflicted Trump advisers to sell nuclear technology to the Bone Saw Kingdom, otherwise known as Saudi Arabia. Or think of the influence golf-playing expats seem to be having over Venezuela policy.
So while stock markets are happy about the prospects for trade peace with China, the broader picture is deeply disturbing. If we do manage to limit the damage from this confrontation, it will be for the wrong reasons. And the warped motivations governing U.S. foreign policy may yet have deeply destructive consequences, with a trade war far from being the scariest possibility.

Joe Biden, in apologizing for calling Mike Pence a 'decent guy,' shows why he shouldn't bother running for president

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden isn't even a candidate for president yet, and he's already found himself apologizing. This time, the offense is the unconscionable act of saying his successor, Vice President Mike Pence, is a "decent guy."

If this is any indication of how a Biden candidacy is going to go, he may as well not bother running.

For those who missed it, Biden came under fire from actress turned activist turned failed political candidate Cynthia Nixon, and the following exchange ensued:

The problem this represents for Biden is two-fold.

The root issue is that Biden has been involved in federal politics since joining the Senate in 1973. That means he spent most of his career in a totally different political and cultural era than the current one. Running for president now, he'll be forced to explain past positions and statements that are out of sync with the current party. He'll also need to answer for his willingness to get along with politicians on the other side.

Before "decent-gate," Biden had already been forced to apologize for supporting the 1994 crime bill, which liberals criticized for ushering in an era of mass incarceration. He's also been put on the defensive for his handling of the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

So Biden is going to be called on to apologize for all sorts of past statements and positions as well as current attitudes that will be portrayed as out of touch.

One way to handle it would be to do so as he did in January. At that time, he joked about his friendly relations with Republicans. “I get in trouble,” Biden said at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C. “I read in the New York Times today that one of my problems is if I were ever to run for president is I like Republicans. OK, well bless me, Father, for I have sinned.”

Essentially, under this model, Biden will carve out a position for himself as somebody who is closer to the center-left, as an adult in the room who is able to work with Republicans to get things done. He may ultimately lose, but this is the only path to victory that's open to him.

If Biden enters the race only to spend the next year apologizing for being insufficiently "woke," he'll just look like a complete buffoon, without convincing any skeptics who will have plenty of alternatives to choose from who are younger and more in touch with contemporary sensibilities on the Left.

If he isn't going to run his race, he may as well recognize that his time has passed, and instead step aside and make room for the new crop of politicians.

Texto completo: A 45-year-old restaurant known for incredible sushi.
A nearly 100-year-old spot serving old-school Italian, at least to those lucky enough to get a table.
A struggling-pizzeria-turned-success-story, thanks to artisanal pies.
"This is very nice you know, because we really accomplished something," said Chizuku Fukuyoshi, who has run the sushi restaurant Sagami in Collingswood with her husband, Chef Shigeru Fukuyoshi, since 1974. (It is the second time the restaurant has been nominated.)
"I think we helped to spread the knowledge of Japanese food in this area," she said. "When we opened, there were quite a few Japanese restaurants in New York, where we were from, but over here they didn't know it at all. Now, everybody knows about Japanese food and we are very happy about that."
She credited her entire team with helping Sagami secure the Beard nomination.
"We have good employees who been here for so many years. At other restaurants, they seem to come and go and jump around, the servers and the cooks. Here, many have been here 20 years or more. They are good and we must be doing good for them, too.
"My husband works so hard, but now he is old," she said. "We are so very happy."
Sagami is among the six New Jersey restaurants named as 2019 James Beard Awards semifinalists. The James Beard Foundation made the announcement Wednesday.
The James Beard awards honor the best culinary talent in the country in categories that include best new restaurants, outstanding bar programs, bakers and rising star chefs 30 or younger, among others.
Finalists will be announced March 27 in Houston and the winners will be named May 6 in Chicago.
Here are New Jersey's nominees:
Maricel Presilla, Cucharamama in Hoboken, nominated for outstanding chef Maricel Presilla, the owner and chef of funky colorful pan-Latin restaurant Cucharamama, is not only an outstanding chef but a highly educated Latina who has earned a Ph.D. in medieval Spanish history from New York University. Cuban-born Presilla not only turns out some marvelous eats at Cucharamama but a block away at Zafra, her first Hoboken restaurant.
Presilla, who is considered to be a pre-eminent expert on Latin and Caribbean cuisine, has been feted numerous times before. Six years ago, her book, "Gran Cocina Latina: The Food of Latin America" was named Cookbook of the Year by the James Beard Foundation and Best General Cookbook by the International Association of Culinary Professionals. In 2012, she was named by the James Beard Foundation Best Chef-Mid Atlantic.
Presilla is one of only two chefs in New Jersey who has ever won a James Beard award. The other is Craig Shelton, then of The Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, names Best Chef Mid Atlantic region in 2000.
Sagami in Collingswood, nominated for outstanding restaurant A block building in the shadow on the high-speed PATCO line and congested Route 130, Sagami is a Collingswood gem.
At 74, Chef Shigero Fukuyoshi continues to create some of the best at Sagami the way he learned as an apprentice in the early 1970s in a New York City restaurant.
This is the second time Sagami has received an Outstanding Restaurant nod from the Beard Foundation; the first was in 2007.
Shigeru Fukuyoshi and his wife, Chizuko Fukuyoshi, who manages Sagami, opened their restaurant in 1974 on the Camden border. Generations of South Jerseyans and Philadelphians have sat in Sagami's cozy wooden booths, where Chizuko recalls holding babies that now bring in babies of their own.
Go: Sagami, 37 Crescent Blvd. in Collingswood; 856-854-9773.
Chef Vola's in Atlantic City, nominated for outstanding service Never been to Chef Vola's?
Us neither. Reservations need to be made months in advance (by leaving a message on their phone line) for this old-school Italian restaurant, which has operated out of an unassuming house on Albion Place since 1921. The place has a top-secret feel, down to its private website, which you need a log in to access. But when the food is consistently great and the service exceptional, word of mouth is all that matters.
Diners adore Chef Vola's butterflied, bone-in veal parmigiana, draped with tomato sauce and served with a steak knife. Plus the piled-high spaghetti and clams, homestyle tossed salad, and banana cream pie.
Go: 111 S. Albion Place; 609-345-2022.
Chef Joey Baldino of Zeppoli in Collingswood, nominated for best chef Mid-Atlantic Chef Joey Baldino must have a sense of humor about the Beard awards by now, as he's been nominated eight times, seven times as Best Chef in the Mid-Atlantic Region.
In its first year, Baldino's Zeppoli was nominated as Best New Restaurant. He also owns Palizzi Social Club, a private club and restaurant, in South Philadelphia.
In his tiny BYOB restaurant in West Collingswood, Baldino has championed Sicilian cuisine since opening Zeppoli in 2011. Baldino learned the ropes at the revered Anna Tasca Lanza cooking school in the Sicilian countryside. He also trained at The French Culinary Institute.
Each summer, Baldino hosts authentic Sicilian barbecues on the restaurant patio that sell out in minutes.
"Dinner at the Club: 100 Years of Stories and Recipes from South Philly's Palizzi Social Club" by Baldino and former Courier-Post restaurant critic Adam Erace is due out later this year.
Go: Zeppoli, 618 W. Collings Ave., Collingswood; 856-854-2670, zeppolirestaurant.com.
Randy Forrester of Osteria Radici in Allentown, nominated for best chef Mid-Atlantic In winter 2017, the husband and wife team of Randy and Ally Forrester opened Osteria Radici, serving modern Italian food in the tiny borough of Allentown, tucked along the westernmost border of Monmouth County. Randy is the chef, making his own bread and pasta daily. Ally runs the front of house.
Four months later, the restaurant was named a James Beard semifinalist for best new restaurant. It was the only restaurant in New Jersey to be included on the list.
"I have wanted to be a chef since I was a teenager," Randy said last year. "I have dedicated half of my life to the industry and working toward the goal of opening a restaurant. It is surreal to learn that we have received national recognition for our first restaurant."
Go: 4 S Main St.; 609-223-2395, osteriaradici.com.
Dan Richer of Razza Pizza Artigianale in Jersey City, nominated for best chef Mid-Atlantic This isn't the first time that Dan Richer has been nominated for a James Beard Award. He has been named several times, starting in 2011 when he was a Rising Star Chef semifinalist for his first restaurant, Arturo's Osteria & Pizzeria in Maplewood.
Richer, a self-effacing New Jersey born-and-bred Rutgers graduate, calls himself a humble pizza craftsman. But the pizzas that the 39-year-old crafts are so darn good that a glowing, 3-star New York Times review declared it "the best pizza in New York." Yes, that's right, New York?
He makes those Neapolitan-style pizzas by breaking nearly every rule, not using the requisite tomatoes, flour or even mozzarella that the powers that be say is needed to make the best Neapolitan pizzas. "I try to find out if there is a better way, better ingredient," he said.
He has also said that he had no desire to take his crafts-making skills across the river. Does the craftsman think about taking his skills across the river where the handful of other, undeniably fancier, three-star restaurants ply their trade?
"New Jersey is where I live," he has told USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey. "New Jersey is where I grew up. I never wanted a big restaurant or lots of restaurants. I'm just trying to make a great product and share it with my community"
Owner and Chef of Razza, Dan Richer.

Texto completo: A council of Christian leaders tapped to review last year's tumultuous exit of Bill Hybels from Willow Creek Community Church has concluded that claims of "sexually inappropriate words and actions" against the well-known pastor are credible, and that Hybels should have faced discipline if he had not resigned.
"The credibility of the allegations is not based on any one accusation or accuser but on the collective testimony and context of the allegations," the council report stated in its list of conclusions, according to a copy provided to the Tribune by the church. "The credibility of the allegations would have been sufficient for Willow Creek Community Church to initiate disciplinary action if Bill Hybels had continued as pastor of the church."
The report from the council, calling itself the Independent Advisory Group, also concluded that Hybels "verbally and emotionally intimidated both female and male employees."
Hybels, who founded the evangelical church based in South Barrington, could not immediately be reached for comment. The report did note that he has "publicly and privately denied the credibility" of the allegations.
The outside panel's review, delivered Thursday, was announced by Willow Creek leaders last summer and was said to have been funded by an anonymous outside donor to ensure it would be an unbiased look at what happened at one of the country's largest Christian churches.
Hybels stepped down nearly 11 months ago after spending more than 40 years leading the megachurch. He resigned in the wake of a Tribune investigation that revealed allegations of misconduct with women -- including church employees -- that spanned decades.
Church leaders initially stood by Hybels last spring, but that support deteriorated as additional accounts of alleged inappropriate behavior surfaced.
A former executive assistant to Hybels told The New York Times she had been sexually harassed and groped by Hybels over two years. The new review raised no new allegations since those detailed in that story.
The controversy and Willow Creek's slow response rocked the congregation, eventually triggering the resignations of the church's two leading pastors and its entire board of elders.
The council's report Thursday also was critical of how those leaders reacted as the crisis at Willow Creek unfolded, saying they failed to rein Hybels in.
"Over multiple decades, the Willow Creek Community Church boards were unable to provide effective oversight of Bill Hybels," the report states, also including the observation that church leadership was not prepared to handle the cascading events it faced last year.
Willow Creek issued a statement as the report was released.
"While we cannot change the events of the past, we grieve what has happened, ask for forgiveness, and commit ourselves to pursuing healing and reconciliation," the church posted on its website, attributing the statement to its new nine-member elder board. "Thank you for your prayers and faithful engagement in the life and ministry of our church during this season."
The alleged behavior reported on by the Tribune included suggestive comments, extended hugs, an unwanted kiss and invitations to hotel rooms. It also included an allegation of a prolonged consensual affair with a married woman who later recanted that claim to church leaders.
The Tribune found that internal church reviews of Hybels and the allegations repeatedly cleared him of wrongdoing, and Willow Creek leaders initially stood by those prior inquiries.
Women who spoke to the Tribune were critical of how the church reacted to their accounts. Victim advocates also raised concerns about the council review last summer when it was announced, suggesting they could not be confident it would be truly independent.
The IAG report indicated its members interviewed Hybels and also spoke to every woman who made direct accusations against him. The group included Margaret Diddams, the provost of Wheaton College; Gary Walter, past president of the Evangelical Covenant Church in Chicago; Jo Anne Lyon, of Wesleyan Church in Indianapolis; and Leith Anderson, president of the National Association of Evangelicals in Washington, D.C.
At the peak of its reach, Willow Creek welcomed some 25,000 congregants to its main campus and seven satellite churches. It also had spread its brand of Christian worship to 11,000 churches in 130 countries.
Its Global Leadership Summit has been one of the most influential conferences in the Christian world for more than two decades, though many dozens of churches declined to broadcast it in 2018 during the Hybels fallout.
Among the other recommendations put forward by the group Thursday were that Willow Creek create a way to offer financial assistance for counseling for anyone affected by Hybels, as well as maintain an outside hotline for people to make further misconduct reports. Under a heading it called "closing words," the group commented on its work.
"We encountered a range of emotions and attitudes including brokenness, hurt, fear, transparency, trust, faith and hope," the group members wrote. "We heard a catalog of opinions that were spoken with conviction and passion but also with grace. Clear and strong faith in God and service to Jesus Christ were repeatedly declared and evidenced by those interviewed. They displayed a pervasive sense that God's redemptive purposes will prevail."

Texto completo: TODAY'S BERLIN has a thriving Jewish community despite the decimation of Jews during the Holocaust.
Among the city's most illustrious past Jewish residents were philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, Fanny Mendelssohn, Rosa Luxemburg and Albert Einstein.
A Jewish presence in Berlin dates to at least 1295, when Jews were mentioned in a master wool weaver's certificate forbidding wool merchants from trading with them.
Early Jews lived mostly in a Jewish quarter, but some wealthier Jews lived elsewhere. In 1671, 50 Jewish families moved there from Vienna, invited there by Frederick William of Brandenburg, to help with war reconstruction.
During the reign of Frederick the Great (1740-1786), Jews enjoyed some freedom and prosperity. Eighteenthcentury Berlin Jews were typically bankers and traders, and a few served as court Jews.
The edict of 1812 finally bestowed Prussian citizenship upon the Jews. Many 19th-century Berlin Jews were prominent in journalism, literature and the arts, although they faced strong and consistent anti-Semitism.
By the 1920s, the city was home to about 70,000 Jews, albeit part of their environment was a backdrop of anti-Semitic culture. Most were forced to flee Germany after Hitler's rise to power, and 55,000 perished in the Holocaust. From late 1942, only Jewish laborers employed in vital war production were safe from deportation.
After the war, the community had a registered membership of 5,070, most with non-Jewish spouses; 1,321 survived the war by hiding, and 1,628 returned from concentration camps. By 1970, there were about 5,600 Jews.
By the 1990s, however, Berlin's Jewish population exploded with immigrants from the former Soviet Union and elsewhere.
The current Jewish population is about 100,000 out of roughly 3.6 million.
Today, there is a Jewish Museum, a Holocaust memorial, three Conservative congregations of varying size, four Reform congregations and six Orthodox congregations. Kosher food is obtainable, and there are several tours of Jewish Berlin available.
Unfortunately, despite this renaissance, anti-Semitism still exists. An April 2018 article in The New York Times chronicled its presence, despite official government efforts to stamp it out.

Top Democrat threatens subpoena over Kushner security clearance

Texto completo: A top Democrat threatened to subpoena the White House if it does not turn over requested information regarding its security clearance process.

House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said Thursday his panel expects “full compliance with its requests as soon as possible” after the New York Times reported President Trump told former chief of staff John Kelly to give his son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance, despite objections from former White House counsel Don McGahn and U.S. intelligence officials.

The Oversight Committee launched an investigation in January into the clearance protocol, asking the White House for documents and interviews relating to Kushner’s clearance. Cummings said the panel has not received “a single document or or schedule a single interview.”

“It may become necessary to consider alternative means to compel compliance,” he said in a statement.

Trump told the Times last month that he played no role in Kushner obtaining a clearance. Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and Kushner’s wife, told ABC News in early February that her father “had no involvement” in her or her husband’s clearance.

Democrats have urged the White House to revoke Kushner’s clearance since 2017.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said Trump has “jeopardized” national security by granting clearances to “unscrupulous people.” “We will work to ensure clearances are granted based on trust, not by blood or bond,” Swalwell said.

Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., urged government officials to not share any top secret information with Kushner. “Your loyalty is to America, not to Kushner or Trump,” he said.

Patrick Caddell, 68, pivotal pollster to Democratic candidates

Texto completo: The nation, Patrick Caddell once told the Globe, “is a very different place than it was two years ago or five years ago. Much less 10 years ago."
The year was 1975 and he was only 25 — not long out of Harvard University and speaking in the Cambridge office of his polling firm, Cambridge Survey Research — though some of his observations then might easily have found a home in subsequent eras.
“Consider the basic values which not long ago were almost inviolate, but in recent times have been seriously questioned, if not destroyed," he said.
Mr. Caddell, who launched his polling firm while he was a Harvard student and went on to work for some of the most memorable Democratic candidates of the 1970s and '80s, died Feb. 16 in Charleston, S.C., of complications from a stroke. He was 68.
His colleague Kendra Stewart, a political science professor at the College of Charleston, confirmed Mr. Caddell's death to media organizations.
With a presence as unforgettable as his polling, Mr. Caddell was “a bear of a man, in a body without angles, brooding dark eyes staring out from a broad face mostly camouflaged by a full beard, with its distinctive stripe of white hair running from the right side of his chin up to the right corner of a mouth that is seldom silent," the Globe's Walter V. Robinson wrote in 1984.
While still in his mid-20s, Mr. Caddell achieved political prominence though his work helping to elect Jimmy Carter president in 1976.
“Pat Caddell was a brilliant pollster who at a young age provided me with key information and over his career helped to shape the future of professional research," Carter said in a statement released by a spokeswoman. “Rosalynn and I are grateful for his counsel in our campaigns and while we were in the White House."
As a Harvard senior, Mr. Caddell began conducting polling for Senator George McGovern, when the South Dakota Democrat was competing in primaries during his failed 1972 presidential bid.
Over the years, Mr. Caddell also worked on campaigns for then-US Senators Gary Hart of Colorado and Joe Biden of Delaware, including during their respective presidential campaigns in 1984 and 1988.
In Massachusetts, Mr. Caddell's political clients included Michael S. Dukakis, when he took a step toward regaining the governor's office by defeating then-Governor Edward J. King in the 1982 Democratic primary.
In a 1984 Globe interview, John Marttila, a Boston-based campaign manager and strategist who died last November, called Mr. Caddell “the best broad strategic thinker in the business. He has truly brilliant insight."
Carter's 1976 election was arguably Mr. Caddell's greatest success, and one particular piece of later advice to the president was also historic. In 1979, when the economy was faltering and the energy crisis had led to long lines at gasoline stations, Mr. Caddell advised Carter to speak to the nation. On TV, Carter gave what became known as the “malaise" speech, though he never used that word.
In more recent years, Mr. Caddell had grown disillusioned with the Democratic Party and had appeared on Fox News as a commentator. Democrats, Mr. Caddell once said, were no longer the “party of the people."
The New York Times reported that Mr. Caddell had also been an adviser to Stephen Bannon, a former leader of the conservative Breitbart News organization who served as the chief White House strategist during President Trump's early months in office.
Throughout Mr. Caddell's life, an unstinting belief in his convictions had fueled such restless energy that he sometimes never seemed to stay still.
“It isn't that Patrick moves too fast," one of his friends told the Globe in 1984. “It's just that the rest of the world moves too slowly."
Born in Rock Hill, S.C., in 1950, Patrick Hayward Caddell was a son of Janie Burns and Newton Caddell.
His father, a Coast Guard officer, was from Massachusetts, according to “The Permanent Campaign," a 1980 book by Sidney Blumenthal that was excerpted in the Globe Sunday Magazine, prior to publication.
Mr. Caddell spent some of his childhood on Cape Cod, where his family would go to Otis Air Force Base to be among those greeting John F. Kennedy when his plane landed.
After Mr. Caddell's family moved to Florida, he made his first foray into politics in 1968, while in high school in Jacksonville.
“I hated math, but I loved statistics, so I decided to do a project predicting the outcome of local elections," he recalled in the 1975 Globe interview.
“The local paper did a story about me, then the speaker of the House in Florida hired me to do some work for him," Mr. Caddell said. “In those days, I could do a poll for $200 because I'd hire my classmates to help."
He went to Harvard and graduated in 1972 with a bachelor's degree in political science. During his senior year, he launched the Cambridge Survey Research polling firm. The fall of his senior year, he began conducting polling for McGovern's campaign.
Mr. Caddell's work on campaigns drew admirers and detractors. Jack Beatty, a longtime senior editor at The Atlantic, suggested that the term “Caddellism" should be added to political dictionaries.
“Caddellism differs from conventional political merchandising in a radical way," Beatty wrote in the Globe in 1984. “It does not merely emboss a candidate's political identity but invents one for him, investing him with an aura of mystery that makes him seem all things to all people. Practitioners of Caddellism poll the public not to see whether it likes candidate X, but to discover its ideal candidate and then tailor someone to that ideal."
Others said Mr. Caddell's forceful energy could often come off as too aggressive.
“He hasn't learned the art of schmoozing," Frank Mankiewicz, the late former NPR president, told the Globe in 1984.
“He's like a lot of people who make it very young: He's certainly had a late adolescence," said Mankiewicz. “When you're polling at 21 for a presidential campaign, you're missing something. Maybe those are the years when you normally acquire the social graces that make you less abrasive."
Mr. Caddell said for Blumenthal's 1980 book that “it's a little schizophrenic being younger. You have to act like a grownup even at times when you're not. Growing up when you have to be grownup in a political sense is a little difficult to balance."
The New York Times reported that Mr. Caddell leaves a daughter, Heidi Caddell Eichelberger; a brother, Daniel; a sister, Patricia Roberts; and three grandchildren.
Among Mr. Caddell's lasting contributions to politics was a 10,000-word memo he wrote to Carter a month after his election in 1976, laying out the need for a permanent campaign. The theory provided the title for Blumenthal's book and a blueprint for many future politicians.
“It is important to recognize we cannot successfully separate politics and government," Mr. Caddell wrote, adding that “essentially, it is my thesis that governing with public approval requires a continuing political campaign."

Russia May Block Action on Venezuela

Texto completo: UNITED NATIONS -- Forcing a possible United Nations showdown with Russia over the Venezuela crisis, the United States distributed a resolution on Wednesday calling for "free, fair and credible presidential elections" in the impoverished Latin American country and unfettered distribution of humanitarian aid.
The resolution was likely to be put to a Security Council vote on Thursday, Council diplomats said, and barring some compromise was almost certain to be vetoed by Russia.
A resolution needs nine yes votes in the 15-member Council to win, but a no vote by any of the five permanent members, which include Russia, would block it.
Diplomats said an aim in bringing the measure to a vote was to embarrass the Russians, who have stood by President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and described him as the victim of American big-power bullying and arrogance.
Russia was expected to submit its own Venezuela resolution, calling for a negotiated outcome between Mr. Maduro and his opponents and a declaration that Mr. Maduro's government should oversee any distribution of international aid. Diplomats said that measure is likely to lack the required nine votes for passage.
The face-off between the Americans and Russians over Venezuela, which was once Latin America's most prosperous country and sits atop the world's biggest proven oil reserves, is reminiscent of the Cold War.
The United States and roughly 50 other countries, including many in Latin America and Europe, have denounced what they call a culture of corruption and mismanagement by Mr. Maduro's brand of socialist governance in Venezuela, which has been reeling from an economic collapse.
They have thrown their support behind Juan Guaidó, the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, who declared himself interim president a month ago on grounds that Mr. Maduro had won elections last May through fraud and was destroying the country.
The American move at the United Nations came less than a week after a coalition of countries led by the United States sought unsuccessfully to send convoys of food and medical aid into Venezuela through Colombia and Brazil.
Mr. Maduro's armed forces and other loyalists blocked the deliveries at the border, saying the aid was unneeded and calling it a pretext for an American invasion. Violent clashes left at least four Venezuelans dead and many injured from rubber bullets and tear-gas.
The aid campaign's failure appeared to be a significant setback for Mr. Guaidó, who had left Venezuela in violation of a travel ban to help lead the convoy effort from Colombia.
He had expressed hope that members of Venezuela's military would desert Mr. Maduro en masse and allow the convoys in.
Mr. Guaidó was reported to be in Brazil, and his plans for returning to Venezuela were not disclosed. But he could be barred from going back by Mr. Maduro or possibly arrested if and when he tried to return.
"As a citizen, I believe it's treason what he's doing to his people," Venezuela's foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, said of Mr. Guaidó in an interview this week at Venezuela's United Nations mission.
In a meeting at the Security Council on Tuesday, Mr. Arreaza said the effort led by Mr. Guaidó had failed. Addressing American diplomats in the chamber, he said "now is the time for us to return to sanity and international law."
Mr. Arreaza struck a more conciliatory tone on Wednesday in Geneva, where he spoke at the United Nations Human Rights Council and called for dialogue between Mr. Maduro and President Trump. But Mr. Arreaza drew a hostile reception from other diplomats of countries that recognize Mr. Guaidó. As he made his way to the podium, about 60 representatives from 16 missions walked out in protest.
A draft of the American resolution on the Security Council agenda for Thursday, seen by The New York Times, does not include any language that could be construed as the basis for a military intervention in Venezuela, addressing the concerns expressed by other countries who do not want to see the crisis turn into a war.
Nonetheless, a key passage of the resolution, which expresses "deep concern that the presidential elections of May 20, 2018, were neither free nor fair," seemed bound to provoke Russian objections.
The draft also called for "the start of a peaceful political process leading to free, fair, and credible presidential elections, with international electoral observation, in conformity with Venezuela's Constitution."
Other provisions stressed "the importance of ensuring the security" of political opposition members -- a clear reference to Mr. Guaidó and his associates -- and the need to "facilitate unhindered access and delivery of assistance to all in need."
Mr. Maduro is not popular in Venezuela, where hunger and deprivation have intensified in recent years and hyperinflation has made the national currency nearly worthless. More than 3.4 million Venezuelans have fled to neighboring countries.
Russia and other defenders of Mr. Maduro blame Venezuela's crisis on American sanctions imposed on the country, including the recent seizure of assets belonging to the state oil company, Pdvsa, the government's main source of revenue.
The Trump administration has increasingly focused on Venezuela's economic calamity, seeking to frame it as a lesson in the failures of socialism, in what appears to be part of President Trump's own 2020 re-election strategy.
Mr. Trump gave an anti-Maduro speech last week at a rally in Miami attended by disaffected Venezuelans, declaring that the demise of socialism in their country was imminent and warning that Mr. Maduro's loyalists in the military should abandon him or "lose everything."

Texto completo: SEOUL, South Korea -- Kim Jong-un, the mysterious and mercurial leader of North Korea, has no intention of relinquishing his nuclear arsenal, a potent tool that gives him leverage abroad and authority at home, the highest-ranking North Korean diplomat to defect in years said in an interview.
The diplomat, Thae Yong-ho, held embassy posts in Denmark, Sweden and Britain, before a daring escape to South Korea in 2016 with his wife and two sons. Today, he is a target for assassination and kidnapping and lives under the protection of the South Korean government. He moves around Seoul, the South Korean capital, in dark sunglasses with a hat pulled down over his forehead.
Once a member of the North's elite political establishment, Mr. Thae was educated about the West through movies like "The Sound of Music" and books about bourgeois excess. As a diplomat, he became disenchanted with Mr. Kim and sought freedom and opportunity for his children -- a sentiment, he said, that is increasingly common among the country's elite.
Jane Perlez, The New York Times bureau chief in Beijing, sat down with Mr. Thae ahead of this week's summit meeting with Mr. Kim and President Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam, at which the leaders are expected to discuss nuclear disarmament. Mr. Thae, who has written a book and testified before the United States Congress, spoke in fluent English.
How would you describe Kim Jong-un? Is he wily? Impetuous? A spoiled brat?
I think, if we describe him rightly, he is intelligent and bright, but a merciless guy.
[His grandfather] Kim Il-sung and [father] Kim Jong-il purged a lot of people, but they never killed family members. Kim Jong-un killed his uncle and half brother. This kind of thing is really unprecedented in the Kim family.
Why was Mr. Kim so threatened by his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, a senior official who oversaw the National Defense Commission?
Kim Jong-un felt very afraid of his uncle and felt threatened by even the existence of his uncle.
All of a sudden, the whole department under Jang Song-thaek were arrested, and the main bosses of that department were shot immediately. All the families -- of the hundreds of members of his department -- were expelled from Pyongyang to the countryside. All these things took place in a very short span of time -- within one week.
Is Mr. Kim serious about dismantling his nuclear weapons, or is he meeting with President Trump out of vanity or to preserve his family dynasty?
He is just doing this for the preservation of his family. The main goal of Kim Jong-un's meeting with Trump is first to buy time, and second, get sanctions relief. Finally, he wants the status that comes with being a nuclear power.
Who is most threatened by North Korea's nuclear weapons?
Kim Jong-un wants his dictatorship and dynasty to go on. If you want to control North Korean society, you have to make South Korea afraid of North Korea. The existence of South Korea is itself a direct threat to the North Korean system.
He wants to make sure South Korea stays in South Korean territory, and does not extend it. That is his first goal.
Kim Jong-un wants to keep his military in balance with South Korea. But he knows the North Korean military cannot afford modern tanks and guns. He knows this balance is changing unfavorably for North Korea. Nuclear weapons are the only way to keep the balance with South Korea.
So, the weapons are not only important in military terms but as a political tool for keeping the society together?
That's right.
He needs an instrument to unite North Korea around him. North Korea's economy is a failure. North Korean welfare is a failure. The North Korean people do not now believe in North Korean's system and ideology. So he needs nuclear weapons to justify all of North Korea's current problems.
For instance, North Korean newspapers are educating the people that North Korea is poor. Why? Because North Korea spends so much money on nuclear development, and because of that nuclear development, North Korean became one of the superpowers of the world. So this is a really clear justification of economic failure.
Pakistan and India have kept their nuclear weapons and acted quite responsibly. Can North Korea be similarly trusted when it comes to proliferation?
If America -- Trump -- does not give Kim Jong-un sanctions relief, Kim Jong-un could do anything. In his New Year's speech, if you read the text of his speech, Kim Jong-un clarified: He would not further produce, he would not have any further tests, he would not have proliferation of nuclear weapons. But if his demands are not reached, he signaled he would look for a new path.
What would that path be?
In order to survive, he may sell his nuclear technology.
Who would buy North Korea's nuclear technology?
There are many potential buyers. Let's say Iran.
Iran is under really heavy international surveillance. It's very difficult for Iran to produce nuclear materials. But, Iran has money to buy nuclear weapons. And how can anyone detect this kind of nuclear sale between Iran and North Korea?
What would Mr. Kim do with that money? Would he improve his people's lives?
Maybe he would use some for economic development, and maybe he would update his nuclear arsenal.
He knows quite well that, unless he improves North Korean people's lives, his days are numbered. He would like to do something, actually. He wants to show the people that he is the one actually solving problems.
If it is true that Mr. Kim's days are possibly numbered, do you see any chance of a coup?
Structurally, it is impossible because Kim Jong-un has a very detailed network of surveilling the leaders around him. If you are of high rank, then all the high-ranking officials have to live in the same apartment. They can't choose where to live. They have to live collectively. You are not allowed to have private time with your friends around you, so the control system of North Korean society is really unimaginable.
North Korea's elites are under sanctions from the world and the United States. They have a tantalizing opening with Mr. Trump. What is life like for them, and what is their mood?
North Korean elites and North Korean society itself is in dilemma at this moment. North Korea is changing. Capitalism and the market system -- the concept is spreading quite rapidly in North Korea. Now the people want to solve their daily survival in their own way. They don't believe in the so-called leadership.
They don't have freedom to travel to foreign countries. They don't have freedom to have their own cars. If you're high-ranking you may have a government-supplied car, but the children of those high-ranking officials cannot use their fathers' government-supplied car. They're privileged. But their privileges are limited.
Have you heard people say, 'We need to get rid of Mr. Kim'?
I haven't heard anything because in North Korea you can't say that kind of thing, even to your wife. So, usually North Korea people don't open their mouths, but you can feel that kind of mood when you live in North Korea.

Julian Assange and Roger Stone made phone calls? Michael Cohen makes a dubious claim

Texto completo: Three years ago, Michael Cohen was vice president of the multi-billion dollar Trump Organization and fixer to the future leader of the free world. Now, the disbarred lawyer and convicted felon is set to testify publicly in front of the House Oversight Committee. If the opening statement published by the New York Times is indeed correct, it proves that he's a man with nothing to lose.

Cohen, who spent decades in the service of President Trump, burying bodies and paying off porn stars, now calls Trump a "racist," a "cheat," and a "con man." But while his complete 180 on his former boss is no secret, most explosive in Cohen's supposed prepared statements is the assertion that Roger Stone told Trump that WikiLeaks was about to dump hacked DNC emails before the beginning of the Democratic National Convention.

Cohen has nuked his ability to appeal to Trump for a pardon. In theory, he has no reason to hold back. But this assertion from a known liar, hack, and immoral emissary includes one detail that may just take his claim too far.

Cohen says:

"In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump’s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of 'wouldn’t that be great.'"

That Trump would call Stone in the wee small hours of the morning from a blocked number is no secret at this point. It is possible that Trump lied to special counsel Robert Mueller in his written assertion that Stone did not inform him of the WikiLeaks hack prior to the email dump. But it is very unlikely that Stone and Julian Assange, one of the most wanted and surveilled men in the Western world, could be making literal phone calls to each other without accidentally putting dozens of democratic governments on blast.

Consider, Assange can't even keep his room at the Ecuadorian Embassy messy without it becoming international news. We're now just supposed to believe that he was making phone calls to the country's most notorious political trickster willy-nilly, and not one intelligence agency picked up on it?

It's also possible that Stone simply lied to Cohen and Trump, and that Stone really did warn them about the email dump while embellishing the emails somewhat.

Or Michael Cohen is just a really bad lawyer who made a major boo-boo prior to one of the most explosive testimonies of the decade.

Texto completo: “Si Maduro no podía aguantar una entrevista de Jorge Ramos, no se debió sentar con él”, afirmó tras llegar a Miami, deportada desde Venezuela, la productora María Martínez-Guzmán, vicepresidenta de Univision Noticias , miembro del grupo retenido el lunes durante una entrevista fallida con Nicolás Maduro en el Palacio de Miraflores.
“Pensábamos que (Maduro) se podría parar” de la entrevista, “pero nunca pensábamos que nos iban a confiscar los equipos. Confiscar no es la palabra. Nos robaron nuestros equipos “, dijo Martínez-Guzmán. “Los que más bruscos estaban, los más toscos, eran cubanos”, afirmó convencida sobre el entorno de Maduro, por ser ella cubano estadounidense.
Maduro interrumpió la entrevista luego de 17 minutos, dijo el mexicano Ramos. “Para frustración de los agentes de seguridad, María (Martínez-Guzmán) se las arregló para hacer una llamada fugaz al presidente de Univisión News, Daniel Coronell, quien a su vez le advirtió al Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos y anunció a muchos medios de comunicación lo que estaba pasando”.
“Si le hacen esto a Jorge Ramos, imagínate lo que les pasa a otros periodistas en Venezuela”, comentó Elyangélica González, corresponsal venezolana de Univision, asilada en Florida.
“Nos apuntaron con una pistola en la cabeza por 30 segundos”, declaró el también periodista mexicano Pedro Ultreras en referencia a otro episodio durante su estadía el fin de semana en la zona fronteriza con Colombia. “Pensamos que nos iban a matar”.
“El gobierno de Maduro se aferra a que el mundo no conozca lo que pasa en ese país”, sentenció Ultreras en referencia a la difícil labor de los periodistas locales y extranjeros en esa nación. “Los colectivos son sicarios del gobierno”, agregó.
Ultreras viajó a Venezuela para cubrir la crisis que atraviesa el país suramericano y allá comenzó a ser perseguido por unos sujetos con perdigones. Según el canal, él no sabía si eran miembros de la Guardia Nacional o colectivos paramilitares fieles a Maduro.
Logró escapar, pero luego enfrentó otro momento de pánico cuando le apuntaron con una pistola. “Era (una situación) muy difícil, para luego llegar a Caracas”, relató en referencia al episodio que vivió el equipo de Ramos el lunes.
Según el Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Prensa (SNTP) de Venezuela, en lo que va de año suman “al menos 30 detenciones de periodistas y trabajadores de los medios” en ese país.
El martes, mientras el equipo de Univision era deportado, el corresponsal Daniel Garrido de Telemundo News también fue detenido por agentes de Maduro.
Ramos resumió su experiencia en una columna en español que publicó hoy The New York Times , titulada “El dictador de Venezuela se gana su título”.
“Fui deportado de Venezuela el martes 26 de febrero después de una entrevista tirante con Nicolás Maduro, el mandatario del país. En medio de nuestra conversación se levantó y se fue, y sus agentes de seguridad confiscaron nuestras cámaras, las tarjetas de memoria con la grabación y nuestros celulares. Sí, Maduro se robó la entrevista para que nadie pudiera verla”, es parte del artículo.

MADISONIANS JOIN MOVEMENT TO PREVENT BIRD COLLISIONS; ; DEVELOPMENT

Texto completo: When Ald. Ledell Zellers saw designs for a proposed 11-story office building slated for the 900 block of East Washington Avenue, she loved them, she said. But she had one major concern with the plans, which included an all-glass tower.
She told Curt Brink, the developer of the project: "I would like to be able to support it. Are you going to do bird resistant glass?"
Asking about how proposed buildings will affect birds is becoming more common, said Aaron Williams, assistant campus planner and zoning coordinator for Campus Planning & Landscape Architecture at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Along with, "Where are you putting the bicycles? Where are you putting water fountains?" comes, "What are you doing to mitigate bird strikes?"
Glass can be dangerous for birds, as they sometimes fly into windows, stunning, injuring or killing themselves. And people around Madison are joining in on a nationwide movement to help prevent building collision deaths.
"When you look at a tall, glass-fronted building, what do you see?" the Madison Audubon Society website reads. "If you put on a 'bird-lens', you would quite likely see more open sky to fly through, more habitat to tuck into, or more moonlight to guide you on your journey. The result is thousands of birds crashing into windows."
"The problem is basically that birds don't recognize glass as a barrier," said Peter Cannon. And that leads to two problems: Birds see through the building or see a reflection on the glass, and think they can fly through it.
Cannon was active in the Madison Audubon Society for many years and served on the National Audubon Society Board for seven years.
Everyone knows that birds occasionally fly into glass. Most people have found a stunned, injured or killed bird in their backyard, Cannon said. But in the early 2000s, awareness of the prevalence of the issue "was close to zero," even among bird lovers like himself.
"One or two birds in your backyard, you don't really think about it until you start multiplying by the number of houses in the United States," Cannon said. In a 2015 report, the American Bird Conservancy estimated that glass kills somewhere between 100 million to 1 billion birds annually in the United States.
As all-glass curtain walls came on the scene, they brought a "general increase in the amount of glass used in construction," ABC's report said. And generally speaking, the more glass in a building, the more likely it will be dangerous to birds.
The report added that even for those not interested in bird watching, birds bring plenty of practical benefits. They pollinate plants, spread seeds and eat insects.
With rising awareness of the problem comes innovative ideas on how to address it. Developers can create buildings with glass that lessen the hazard for birds, using measures like glass treatments, patterned or frosted glass, screens, latticework, netting, shutters and exterior shades.
Some of those glass modifications can also cut down on glare and cooling costs, Architectural Digest reported. Zellers pointed out that glass treatment can bring about new interesting designs.
The installation of patterned glass panels on a shiny New York convention center known as "one of the deadliest buildings for birds in New York City" decreased bird deaths by 90 percent, the New York Times reported.
While bird-resistant glass can be a "greater expense," Zellers said, "like anything, if the market starts demanding it," prices will drop.
Williams said it's somewhat analogous to Americans with Disability Act building requirements. Developers didn't use to install handrails or slope sidewalks, but "now it's just a common thing."
"As long as it's designed from the get-go, it should not be a budget breaker by any means," Williams said.
Illustrating the point nicely is a tale of two stadiums. The new Milwaukee Bucks arena was proclaimed the "world's first bird-friendly sports and entertainment venue," and one architect for the project called the costs to make it bird-safe "inconsequential."
But a few years ago, the potential for bird deaths raised concerns when the Minnesota Vikings' U.S. Bank Stadium was proposed with thousands upon thousands of square feet of glass. One architect called it a "fatal avian collision trap," and advocates said the cost of bird-safe glass would add $1 million although the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority put the price tag $60 million.
After the stadium was built, the Audubon Society came out with a report detailing 60 dead birds observed over a few months, and has since said retrofitting the glass to make it friendly for birds would cost "an estimated $10 million $9 million more than installing it in the first place."
Zellers became an advocate for bird-safe buildings after being made aware of the issue four years ago by Cannon, her constituent. While there are many factors that impact bird deaths, Madison can actually do something about bird collisions with glass windows, Zellers said.
Asked about any measures to mitigate bird strikes on the proposed office building, Matt Brink, Curt Brink's son, said, "We are still working through the options available and determining feasibility." Zellers also voiced her concerns with plans for massive glass towers in the Judge Doyle Square project. CREDIT: By Lisa Speckhard Pasque

Texto completo: Scott Foley and Lauren Cohan star in a new, comedic spy series on ABC. And the Oscar-winning documentary "Free Solo" is available to rent online.
What's on TV
WHISKEY CAVALIER 10 p.m. on ABC. More screwball than "Thunderball," this comedic spy series pairs an emotional, fresh-off-a-breakup F.B.I. agent (Scott Foley) with a by-any-means-necessary C.I.A. operative (Lauren Cohan) in a joint task force. Cue a dance of wit, sexual tension and clandestine assignments foiled by pesky human emotions. ("Agent, do not empathize" is an order given at one point, via a concealed earpiece.) The show finds humor and humanity in serious business. That's a feature it shares with "Scrubs," the comedy-drama series created by Bill Lawrence (an executive producer of this show), which also featured Foley. In his review of the beginning of the first season of "Whiskey" for The New York Times, Mike Hale wrote that it "looks giddily enjoyable."
ALIEN NEWS DESK 11 p.m. on Syfy. If all you can think about when you watch the "Weekend Update" segment on "Saturday Night Live" is "needs more aliens," this might be the show for you. Will Forte and Heidi Gardner voice a pair of extraterrestrial beings breaking down Earth's news in this new animated show, led by the "Weekend Update" writer Dennis McNicholas. The anchors refer to an Academy Award as an "arrogance enhancement totem" and our very planet as a "backwater outpost." So the show promises to stand out in the ever more crowded field of late-night programming through otherworldly skepticism and, well, by being hosted by a pair of cartoon aliens.
What's Streaming
FREE SOLO (2018) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Acrophobic audiences who nevertheless want to see the winner of this year's Oscar for best documentary feature can take comfort in this: Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi's portrait of the free climber Alex Honnold is as much a character study as a gravity-testing climb-along. The film follows Honnold as he prepares a free solo climb -- a ropeless ascent -- up El Capitan in Yosemite. But it's also a story of what drove Honnold to pursue what is often a fatal sport. (The answer involves, in no small part, his childhood.) Chin and Vasarhelyi have "a knack for exposing, without exploiting, a little of the man beneath the apparent madness," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times. She called the film "an engaging study of a perfect match between passion and personality."
TICKLED (2016) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. David Farrier and Dylan Reeve's documentary on the adult tickling world won't, in the end, leave you laughing -- but it is a fascinating, mysterious dive into a subculture. What begins as the fulfillment of the directors' curiosity morphs into something darker when they begin receiving legal threats for their investigations. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called the documentary "terrifically entertaining." The less you know going in, the better. It's that kind of story.

Lindsey Graham pretty much admits his Trump alignment is ‘to be relevant’

Texto completo: Late in Shakespeare’s career, one (it may have been two) of his contemporaries wrote a not-so-famous-compared-to-Shakespeare’s-stuff play called “The Honest Whore.”
It may be time to consider promoting Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, from dishonest to honest whore for Donald Trump.
A month ago I passed along a Buzzfeed piece titled “What the hell happened to Lindsey Graham?” It explored the mystery of Graham’s conversion from one of the most mavericky and bipartisanly-inclined of GOP senators and one of the most outspoken denouncers of Donald Trump during the current incumbent’s rise to the Republican nomination [a quote from Graham in that period: “If we nominate Trump we will get destroyed … and we will deserve it”], to one of Trump’s seemingly most loyal allies in the Senate, who seemed near to tears of anger at the Democratic resistance to the confirmation of Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In that previous piece, I confessed my surprise that Graham had either sold his soul or lost his mind. Well, perhaps now we at least know which of those it was.
In a piece for the Sunday New York Times Magazine, Times National Correspondent Mark Leibovich somehow induced Graham to purt-near confess that his motives for jumping on the Trump Train were not exactly rooted in sincerity, but motivated by a desire to remain relevant in the era of Donald Trump.
And maybe if you put it that way, a desire to remain relevant (also, of course, to remain a senator), it’s a little easier to remember back to when we (I, at least) thought of Graham as a relatively honest man of conviction. From the Leibovich piece:
And then there is Graham, who would seem to occupy his own distinct category of Trump-era contortionist. Certainly he embodies elements of the other groups: a desire to carve out his own parallel universe of work on certain issues that have always been important to him, especially on foreign policy; an instinct to avoid the distraction of weighing in on every Trump offense (“Don’t chase every barking dog,” he says); and a personal library of readily surfaceable aggressions from the 2016 campaign, in which Graham called the future president a “kook,” “crazy” and “unfit for office,” among other things — and which are easily juxtaposed today with Graham’s sycophantic raves about the president’s stellar golf game and reminders that Trump “beat me like a dog” in the 2016 presidential primary (no doubt delighting Trump with his nod to the president’s canine-themed pejoratives).
Graham’s rush to Trump’s side is particularly baffling because not long ago, he was best known for his bipartisan deal-making on issues like climate change and immigration. He subscribed, at least theoretically, to the country-over-party credo of his departed Senate co-conspirator John McCain. McCain’s diagnosis of brain cancer and eventual death coincided approximately with Graham’s emergence as Trump’s most prominent Senate defender and whisperer. This combination of factors gave rise to the “What happened to Lindsey Graham?” question, which has become synonymous enough with the South Carolinian’s national political identity that he felt compelled to own it on the stump.
“What happened to me?” Graham asked in Greenville. “Not a damn thing.” The crowd gave him a standing ovation. …
Later, talking one on one to Leibovitz and not to a live crowd:
“Well, O.K., from my point of view, if you know anything about me, it’d be odd not to do this,” he said.
“I asked what ‘this’ was.  ‘This,” Graham said, “is to try to be relevant.” Politics, he explained, was the art of what works and what brings desired outcomes. “I’ve got an opportunity up here working with the president to get some really good outcomes for the country,” he told me.
An outcome of particular interest to Graham, at the moment, is getting re-elected to a fourth Senate term in South Carolina, where Trump owns commanding approval numbers, especially among the hard-core Republicans who in the past questioned Graham’s devotion to their conservative cause. Sure, Graham allowed, you might emphasize some things more than others when you’re trying to appeal to the party base. “You just showcase your issues, right?” he said.
During his last re-election campaign, in 2014, Graham asserted his base bona fides by railing against President Barack Obama’s White House “scumbags“ and warning that “the world is literally about to blow up.”
He has always been conservative, he emphasized. “But in our business, you’re not defined by the 80 percent agreement. You’re defined by the 20 percent” that the base might object to. (His relatively liberal position on immigration once led Rush Limbaugh to dub him “Lindsey Grahamnesty.”)
Graham reminded me that when McCain was facing re-election in 2010, he turned himself into “the most conservative member of the U.S. Senate.” That was the race in which McCain claimed that he never embraced the “maverick” label, and people were asking, “What happened to John McCain?” Graham chuckled at the memory.
In acknowledging this, Graham was speaking to me as a fellow creature of Washington, fully versed in the election-year “showcasing” he is now engaged in — one of the “people who are so smart” that he derided the day before. “If you don’t want to get re-elected, you’re in the wrong business,” he said.
There you pretty much have it. Personally, I’m not sure whether to laugh or cry, but that’s better than I felt during the Kavanaugh hearings, when Graham’s performance — over-the-top, bordering-on-tears rage at the horrors to which Kavanaugh had been subjected by Senate inquiry into whether Kavanaugh had, as a teenager, attempted rape — made me want to throw up.
But then there’s this. If this blatant 180-degree flip from Trump trasher to Trump’s new best friend works to get him reelected, what does it tell us about the willingness of the electorate to swallow, and then, also, if Trump is buying this new Trump-loving Lindsay, what does it tell us about the current occupant?
After confessing his changeling act to Leibovitz, there’s this, from the Sunday piece:
Graham’s contempt for Trump in the 2016 campaign was such that he could not bring himself to support the Republican nominee. ‘I voted for Evan — whatever the guy’s name is,” Graham said, referring to the third-party candidate Evan McMullin, who wound up winning 0.54 percent of the popular vote. But after Trump became president, Graham said, forging a relationship with [Trump] served his conjoined interests of staying relevant in Washington and getting re-elected in South Carolina. Graham told me that McCain understood his willingness to make peace with Trump, though the extent of Graham’s ingratiation bothered him a bit — especially Graham’s over-the-top praise for Trump’s golfing abilities.
But McCain, more than anyone, knew the value of reconciliation. Like Graham, he was a mostly reliable Republican vote in the Senate and supported Trump’s agenda on most issues besides repealing the Affordable Care Act. Aside from McCain, Graham said, “I never met anyone in my whole life that could hold a grudge and move on at the same time.” And McCain, he said, understood better than anyone that few things are more potent in politics than having access to a president, regardless of which one.
“Relevance,” Graham said, returning to the word as if it were a mantra. “That was John McCain’s word.”
McCain detested Trump so much that one of his last wishes was to ban Trump from his funeral. I didn’t much care for Graham recruiting the ghost of McCain into his defense, based on their shared love of “relevance.” But it’s above my pay grade and my moral authority to stand in judgment of Graham’s deep affection for his fallen friend.
We live in interesting times.
Here’s one more chance to read for yourself, the full Leibovich/Graham, which is titled:

Texto completo: Michael Cohen , exabogado personal del presidente Donald Trump , planea decir todo sobre los trabajos que realizó para su jefe, especialmente aquellos relacionados con demandas e investigaciones sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
En la sesión a puerta cerrada ante el Comité de la Cámara de Representantes se espera que Cohen detalle aspectos negativos de su exjefe, como sus expresiones racistas, la forma en que acumuló su riqueza y su posible conducta delictiva, reportó New York Times.
El Times habló con una fuente familiarizada con el testimonio, quien adelantó que Cohen llevará documentos para probar sus dichos, pero también detallará experiencias personales de los alrededor de 15 años de colaboración.
Se agrega que uno de los aspectos potencialmente dañinos del testimonio de Cohen será la evidencia de una posible conducta criminal desde que Trump asumió la presidencia .
El presidente Trump y sus aliados se han estado preparando durante varios días para los impactos del testimonio de Cohen, que tendrá lugar durante varias horas mientras el presidente se encuentra en Vietnam para una cumbre con el líder de Corea del Norte, Kim Jong-un .
Se espera que los republicanos que forman parte del Comité de Supervisión y Reforma de la Cámara cuestionen agresivamente la credibilidad de Cohen, a fin de hacerlo ver como un mentiroso.
La portavoz de la Casa Blanca, Sarah Huckabee Sanders , calificó a Cohen de mentiroso y lo señaló como “un criminal”.
“El criminal deshonrado Michael Cohen irá a la cárcel por mentir al Congreso y hacer otras declaraciones falsas”, dijo. “Lamentablemente, irá al Congreso esta semana y podemos esperar más de lo mismo. Es risible que alguien le crea a un mentiroso condenado como Cohen”.

Amy Klobuchar's bad-boss flaws are disturbing. Should Democrats write her off for 2020?

Resumen: The Minnesota senator needs to show steadiness and discipline in her presidential campaign. We don't need more Trump-like nastiness and chaos.

Texto completo: Sen. Amy Klobuchar sounds like a strange and unpleasant boss. New reporting on her management style is especially striking given her outward persona as a “Minnesota nice” next-door neighbor.
The record shows Klobuchar has consistently high staff turnover. Accounts in HuffPost, BuzzFeed News and The New York Times, based on reviews of documents and internal emails as well as interviews with as many as 20 former staffers who insisted on anonymity, suggest Klobuchar can be volatile, abusive and paranoid — dressing down aides in public and in humiliating emails copied to many others, calling their work “slop,” suspecting them of sabotage, making it hard for them to find other jobs, making them pick up her clothes and wash her dishes (including a comb she used to eat a salad after berating an aide who didn't bring a fork).
Is it sexist to discuss this topic? Is it irrelevant? Is it unfair, given the deficiencies of the “manager” now in the White House? And is it so damaging that Democrats should write off Klobuchar as a presidential contender?
The answer in every case should be no.
Read more commentary:
Elizabeth Warren didn't miss her presidential moment. Win or lose, 2020 is her time.
How Bernie Sanders and Democrats can avoid the 2016 mistakes that gave us Trump
The Obamas showed Dems how to bridge the race gap between left and center voters
Klobuchar is relatively centrist in a party moving left. This makes her the type of Democrat many Republicans and independents are hoping will win the 2020 nomination — that is, one they can vote for because they can’t abide President Donald Trump. It also makes her the great hope of Democrats who believe that the overriding imperative in 2020 is to nominate the candidate who has the broadest appeal — particularly in the industrial Midwest's battleground states — and best odds of winning the White House.
In that respect 2020 is shaping up like 1992, when Democrats were determined to end 12 years of Republican presidencies. In focus groups and interviews I did for The Associated Press in New Hampshire, the overriding theme was electability. “I love (liberal populist Iowa Sen. ) Tom Harkin but we have to win so …” “I love (wildly unconventional Vietnam War veteran) Bob Kerrey but we have to win so …” “I love (even more wildly unconventional former and future California Gov. ) Jerry Brown but we have to win so …”
The electable choice was a moderate Southern governor. The end of the sentence was always “I’m voting for Bill Clinton. ”
Klobuchar could bridge Democratic divides
Of the major Democrats now running, Klobuchar most resembles that candidate in the abstract. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and others could eventually join her in the center lane.
Klobuchar has so far handled the party’s left-center split in ways that reflect preparation and, one hopes, authenticity. Medicare for All? “It could be a possibility in the future. I'm just looking at something that will work now,” like allowing the public to buy Medicare or Medicaid coverage, she said this month in her CNN town hall. Green New Deal? “An aspiration in that (it’s) something we need to move towards,” starting with immediately rejoining the Paris climate accord and restoring Obama-era clean power rules and gas mileage standards.
Nor did Klobuchar appear fazed when Bob Gigliotti, an assistant professor of business management at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, asked whether she is "a difficult person to work for. " She replied that she had managed “hundreds of prosecutors” as Hennepin County attorney in Minneapolis and that, on Capitol Hill, “My chief of staff has worked for me for six years, my state director for seven years, my campaign manager for 14 years. ”
But even in Klobuchar's Hennepin County attorney days, there were oddities and complaints, and she knows she still has a lot to prove. She suggested the presidential campaign will be her crucible: “That's a pretty good way to judge people and how they manage something. ”
Volatility yardstick is crucial, not sexist bias
She’s right about that. One reason for Barack Obama's 2008 successes is that he demonstrated solid, disciplined management of his campaign from February 2007 to November 2008. That aura of steady competence, through crises as personal as his controversial pastor and as terrifying as Wall Street's meltdown, helped him beat the best known woman in the country in the Democratic primaries and the experienced (but sometimes impetuous) Arizona Sen. John McCain in the general election.
And it was not a bait and switch. Obama’s presidency had its problems, but he ran an orderly, fact-based, minimal-drama administration that “the best people” did not flee or trash.
Are Klobuchar’s apparent management flaws disturbing? Yes. Are they disqualifying? Not yet. In the next 20 months, she has a sustained chance to show she has learned and changed — that she can run a drama-free Senate office and a stable, even-keeled presidential campaign.
It's not biased to apply this yardstick. It has nothing to do with Klobuchar’s gender or any double standard. Trump shows us every single day why competence, discipline and management skills are absolutely essential in the next president. It is a top consideration on my check list for all candidates, as it should be for every American desperate to end the Trump era.

Texto completo: Chicago in winter is a grind. We're in it. Sideways sleet. Cracked skin. Biting wind.
Winter tests Chicago's guts, its backbone, its resolve. Mine too. So desperate was I by mid-January, I bought one of those vitamin D light therapy lamps. Has it channeled positivity, optimism, motivation? I'll let you know once the mayoral election results roll in. I might need to quadruple the wattage.
Voters have a rare opportunity Tuesday to fill an open seat for mayor. To crack the status quo. The trouble is that in Chicago we usually do the opposite. We fortify with mortar. Why? Because voting is an exercise in self-interest. We all do it.
We vote for candidates promoting lower taxes in order to protect our own pocketbooks. We vote for candidates who promise to save government jobs because we have one. We vote for candidates who vow not to touch pensions because we want ours. We vote for candidates who will roll during labor contract negotiations because we want pay raises.
As a result, we get what we've always gotten -- elected officials who act as caretakers rather than status quo-breakers. More spending, more borrowing, more debt.
Make no mistake, City Hall is the jobs engine of Chicago. Departments under the mayor employ more than 30,000 rank-and-file workers. That number doesn't include the Chicago Park District, the Chicago Board of Education, the separately elected offices of clerk or treasurer or the Cook County agencies that overlap with the city.
Add to those employees the thousands of consultants, lobbyists, public relations firms, trade union workers and contractors who rely on City Hall and Cook County government for their livelihoods. They vote in their self-interests too. That's why nothing changes.
For a moment, change looked possible. After federal investigators papered the windows of Ald. Edward Burke's downtown office in November, voters seemed poked. Provoked. Ticked. If something so shoestring as a fast-food driveway permit could be leveraged for attempted extortion, it made you wonder. Is this Chicago or Pyongyang?
Three months later, though, tempers seem to have cooled on corruption. If the opinion polls on the mayor's race are accurate, voters are less concerned with clout and insider deals and are reverting to self-interest.
Come on, Chicago. Can't we set it aside this one time?
Cast a vote for the candidate who will make every decision from the lens of a one-term mayor. Someone who will serve up the tough medicine on spending cuts and pension debts. Someone who can grow Chicago by finessing complex projects downtown and on the North Side -- the $6 billion Lincoln Yards mega-development, for example -- while also pushing redevelopment of empty parcels on the South and West sides, such as the 440-acre long-abandoned U.S. Steel South Works site.
Chicago needs a mayor who understands the city's DNA. All of it. Someone who grasps the dichotomy of North Side neighborhoods struggling with gentrification and West Side communities struggling with abandonment.
It needs a mayor who will make bold decisions on finances and borrowing and schools. No more people-pleasing.
Voters have set aside their self-interests before. In the 2012 presidential election, for example, political scientists were surprised to learn that more than 40 percent of voters with incomes above $200,000 voted Democratic and more than 30 percent of voters with incomes below $25,000 voted Republican, according to a 2016 Gary Gutting opinion piece in The New York Times.
Voters in that election went with ideology, not necessarily the candidate who would benefit their own pocketbooks.
If Chicago voters do that on Tuesday and put policy positions they know might be painful ahead of their own self-interests, it could lead to a surprising result. They would be voting for what they know is best for the city overall, not necessarily what best suits them.
So, Chicago voters, you have a choice: You can once again show up at your polling places with mortar and a tuck pointer. Or you can show up with a sledgehammer.

How the Upper Middle Class In America Is Really Doing

Texto completo: Have upper-middle-class Americans been winners in the modern economy -- or victims? That question has been the subject of a debate recently among economists, writers and others.
On one side are people who argue that the bourgeois professional class -- essentially, households with incomes in the low-to-mid six figures but without major wealth -- is not so different from the middle class and poor. All of these groups are grappling with slow-growing incomes, high medical costs, student debt and so on.
The only real winners in today's economy are at the very top, according to this side of the debate. When Bernie Sanders talks about "the greed of billionaires" or Thomas Piketty writes about capital accumulation, they are making a version of this case.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
On the opposing side are people who believe that the country's defining class line is further down the economic ladder. To them, the upper middle class is on the happy side, enjoying rising incomes, longer lifespans, stable marriages and good schools. Richard Reeves's recent book, "Dream Hoarders" made this case, as did Matthew Stewart's well-titled Atlantic article: "The 9.9 Percent Is the New American Aristocracy."
I think the chart above helps to resolve the debate. It shows that both sides have a point -- but that it's a mistake to divide the country into only two groups. To make grand pronouncements about the American economy, you need to talk about three groups.
The first is indeed the top 1 percent of earners, and especially the very richest. Their post-tax incomes (and wealth) have surged since 1980, rising at a much faster rate than economic growth. They are now capturing an even greater share of the economy's bounty.
Then there are the bottom 90 percent of households, who are in the opposite position. The numbers here take into account taxes and government transfers, like Social Security, financial aid and anti-poverty benefits. Even so, the incomes of the bottom 90 percent have trailed G.D.P. Over time, their share of the economy's bounty has shrunk.
Finally, there is the upper middle class, defined here as the 90th to 99th percentiles of the income distribution (making roughly $120,000 to $425,000 a year after tax). Their income path doesn't look like that of either the first or second group. It's not above the line or below it. It's almost directly on top of it. Since 1980, the incomes of the upper middle class have been growing at almost the identical rate as the economy.
If you, dear reader, happen to be in this group, I'm not trying to dismiss your economic anxieties. I know that you may not feel rich. You probably have big mortgage payments, rising medical costs and perhaps eye-popping tuition bills.
But I'd ask you to spend a minute thinking about how much more challenging life is for the bottom 90 percent. These households aren't making six-figure incomes, and they have received only meager raises over the past few decades. They aren't receiving their fair share of the country's economic growth. No wonder so many feel frustrated.
And for too long, the country's economic policy, even under Democrats, has blurred the distinction between the upper middle class and the actual middle class.
In the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both used $250,000 as the upper limit of the middle class. (Even in the New York area, $250,000 in pre-tax income puts a household in the top 10 percent.) Obama then delivered a tax cut for everyone below that cutoff. In the 2016 campaign, Clinton and Sanders used the same definition.
A better approach exists. Politicians should recognize that there are three broad income groups, not just two. The bottom 90 percent of Americans does deserve a tax cut, to lift its stagnant incomes. The top 1 percent deserves a substantial tax increase. The upper middle class deserves neither. Its taxes should remain roughly constant, just as its share of economic output has.
So here's some good news: The 2020 Democratic candidates are moving in this direction.
Kamala Harris's big tax cut applies only to families making less than $100,000. Elizabeth Warren's child-care proposal delivers 99 percent of its benefits to the bottom 90 percent of earners, according to Moody's Analytics. The housing plans from Harris and Cory Booker give all their benefits to the bottom 90 percent, according to the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. The tax cut from Sherrod Brown, who's a potential candidate, is likewise focused on the middle class and poor.
Ro Khanna, a Silicon Valley congressman who co-wrote Brown's tax plan, has a useful way of thinking about this. "Our priority has to be the working poor and those struggling to make it into the middle class," Khanna told me. "What do the upper middle class care most about in my district? They want a pluralistic America that is engaged with the world and embraces technology and future industries. What they don't want is a backlash to diversity, a backlash to globalization, a backlash to technology."
The upper middle class doesn't deserve the blame for our economic problems. But it doesn't deserve much government help, either.

A re-examination of Sen. Klobuchar's salad days

Texto completo: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar apparently has a hunger for power - not to mention salad.
As one of three dozen Democrats who have either announced, or are expected to announce, their candidacy for president in the 2020 election, her every action from now until the primary can be expected to receive media scrutiny.
But on Friday, the New York Times time-traveled back to 2008 to focus attention on an incident that occurred in an unidentified airport during a trip Klobuchar took to South Carolina. An aide managed to snag a to-go salad for his boss while the two were hurrying through a passenger concourse, but somewhere between the snack bar and the boarding gate, lost possession of the plastic cutlery that came with the food.
Rookie presidential candidates take note: Hunger can do strange things to a person's sense of propriety, when food - even airport food - is finally at hand.
Once seated in her plane, Klobuchar learned that no utensils were on board. So, after a few moments spent berating the aide for losing her disposable knife and fork, she opened her handbag, peered inside, pulled out a comb,and began eating her salad with it.
I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she mistook the the comb for a vegetable brush to freshen up her salad greens a bit. And, to be fair, combs have teeth, and teeth, after all, are for eating. Mercifully, she didn't select one of her aide's shoes as a dining implement, since they come equipped with tongues.
Had I found myself in a similar circumstance, I think I would have eaten the salad by hand, as daintily as possible, skipping any dressing-drenched morsels to spare my clothes from splatters.
Combs, in my opinion, should only be used to eat pasta during such food emergencies.
The Times apparently resuscitated the 11-year old anecdote to help add color and substance to a now-prevailing contention that Klobuchar is hard on her staff. The kicker to the piece was a recounting of the Minnesota attorney, then in her second year as a senator, ordering her aide to clean up her comb after dining as punishment for losing the plastic utensils.
So, should Amy Klobuchar be driven off the campaign trail for making her aide clean up her comb after eating the salad?
Of course not.
She should be driven off the campaign trail for not forcing the aide to clean up her comb before eating it.
As of this writing, it is 619 days, 1 hour, 7 minutes and 24 seconds until the presidential election.
But who's counting?

Honest dialogue needed about health care for all

Texto completo: It's been nearly 10 years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act — one of the most sweeping health care overhauls in the nation's history. The law has brought the number of uninsured people in America to an all-time low, secured protections for people with pre-existing conditions and advanced the notion that health care is a human right.
But the system was never perfect, and its fractures and stress points have become too great to ignore. The number of people who are uninsured or underinsured is rising again after two years of sabotage to the current law by the Trump administration. A Republican-led lawsuit that once seemed like a lark is threatening Obamacare's protections for pre-existing conditions. And high out-of-pocket costs, absurd hospital billing practices and ever-rising prescription drug prices have forced too many people to skip crucial treatments, avoid emergency rooms and ration life-sustaining medications.
America may be a country rich in medical innovation — a place where robots perform surgery — but it's also one where tens of thousands of people die every year because they can't afford basic care.
Both parties seem certain to make health care a significant election issue over the next two years. There are no fewer than six Democratic bills floating through Congress that would address these problems. And "Medicare for all" — a concept that describes only some of those proposals — has become both a rallying cry and a test of progressive credentials.
Most other countries use negotiating power to control health care costs; that's why prescription drugs cost so much less elsewhere than they do in the United States. But those countries accept a trade-off, inherent in this approach, that the United States has so far resisted: They forgo access to certain innovations, like pricey new drugs and medical devices whose benefits are found to be minimal.
The fight to once again remake American health care will almost certainly be brutal. Before voters can decide if they want to have that fight, candidates will need to clarify what they are selling. Only then can the nation have an honest dialogue about the risks, benefits and trade-offs ahead.

A Japanese spin on pokÃ©, with an Earth-friendly ethos

Texto completo: PokÃ© isn't what it used to be.
The Hawaiian dish was once a simple preparation of two kinds of seafood exclusively - tuna or octopus - taken directly from the ocean. To make it, all you had to do was top raw, cubed fish with shreds of pounded limu (seaweed), oily candlenut meat and a dusting of local salt tinted ladybug-red by volcanic minerals.
Over time, pokÃ© has taken on a more globalized identity, one patterned on that of its Asian cousins. From Korean hwe dup bap, it borrows sweet and spicy saucing, and from Japanese chirashizushi, a diversity of fish as well as a layer of sticky rice that gives it heft.
Contemporary pokÃ© is an international dish, and it's time we start treating it that way.
It seems only fitting that, in our modest metropolitan area, we have four pokÃ© restaurants whose chefs' heritage is not Hawaiian, but Chinese, Thai - and with the recent arrival of Crunchy PokÃ© Bar in Portland - Vietnamese.
However, owner and chef Tien Nguyen's style of pokÃ© tilts towards the Japanese, reflecting his training as a sushi chef with the Whole Foods organization. Indeed, until just a few weeks ago, he still ran Genji Sushi Bar, the sushi, sashimi and ramen restaurant inside the Somerset Street supermarket.
Crunchy PokÃ©'s explicit focus on healthy, local ingredients and sustainability also seems inspired by Nguyen's time as a Whole Foods employee. "We try to be as Earth-friendly as possible," he said. "We use compostable bowls and straws, we don't sell bluefin tuna, which is endangered, and we donate 2 percent of our net sales every quarter to the Barbara Bush Children's Hospital."
Even the dÃ©cor of the Fore Street storefront (the former home of East End Cupcakes) is intended to signal the casual, mostly take-out restaurant's mission through grainy, unpainted wood panels and flashes of green, "the colors of the Earth," in Nguyen's words.
Perhaps no dish embodies Crunchy PokÃ©'s ethos better than its seaweed salad ($5.99). Normally a wakame-based, dashi-and-vinegar-seasoned side that Japanese restaurants import through one of a few corporate distributors, seaweed salad is usually the same everywhere you go, from Boise to Boston. Here, however, Nguyen serves a shredded, farm-raised kelp salad from Ocean Approved in Saco, one sweetened only by shaved carrots. The Maine version has a snappier texture than most seaweed salads do, but with no soy and little acid, the dish lacks flavor. It's a little like eating crunchy garden clippings.
Fortunately, the restaurant's signature dish is significantly better. Especially the salmon pokÃ© ($12), served on a sweet, nutty blend of brown rice and quinoa, along with peppery radish, crab salad, jalapeÃ±o, and a generous spoonful of shocking-orange masago (capelin roe). Its creamy, Japanese-mayonnaise sauce is tart and savory enough to perk up otherwise underseasoned vegetables, yet does not overwhelm the flavor of the gently seasoned fish.
Nguyen sources his salmon from the Faroe Islands, then dry-brines it in Himalayan sea salt before employing what he calls a "super freezer" to bring the temperature of the raw fish down below -50 F for three days. It is remarkably rare to find a fast-casual sushi or pokÃ© restaurant that does its own (often costly and time-consuming) parasite reduction. "But we believe that if we do it by hand, it (the fish) just comes out better," Nguyen explained.
Not all the seafood at Crunchy PokÃ© requires such intense pre-treatment. Meat for the Maine lobster pokÃ© ($15) is steamed fresh every day or two and (as a bonus) comes with a few thousand fewer food miles. Served with sweet onion, pre-bought calamari salad, corn and red cabbage, it is probably the best version of shellfish pokÃ© I have tasted in the state.
What makes it that may well be the lashings of extra-tangy, soy-based house pokÃ© sauce that flavor not only the toppings, but the un-vinegared short-grain white rice beneath.
In the unagi sushi burrito ($12) - pulled as taut as an Ariana Grande ponytail - that same white rice does not get the same drenching and winds up bland and pasty, even with chunks of mango and crispy fried onion valiantly performing CPR in the background. The over-grilled, dry unagi doesn't help matters.
Flavor equilibrium is also off in the matcha boba ($4), where too much green tea powder gets blended with whole milk and ice - nothing more. For the first 15-20 minutes, it is bitter and bracing, nearly undrinkable... until the brown-sugar-and-honey-soaked tapioca pearls eventually leach their sugars into the drink. Then, as if by magic, it becomes a different beverage, almost like an espresso-based milkshake. If you're willing to wait, it's worth a gamble.
So too, the tonkotsu ramen ($12), a hot bowl of super-elastic egg noodles that seems out-of-place in a raw seafood restaurant, even more so when you realize that none of the components is made in-house, from smoky pork broth seasoned with mayu (black garlic oil), to slices of mirin-and-soy marinated, slow-cooked chashu pork. But against all odds, it all works. I may never understand how an indulgent, carb-heavy bowl of brothy pasta and pork belly fits into Crunchy PokÃ©'s healthy-eating mission (or its commitment to sustainability and locavorism) but that may not matter. It's a great bowl of soup - yet another postmodern twist in the wacky evolution of pokÃ© restaurants in America.

Texto completo: The 52 Places Traveler
Stop #2 on a Yearlong Journey, a Spot in Panama That Takes It Slow
The 52 Places Traveler heads to the country's Pacific Coast expecting breakneck development and instead finds a place that's in no rush.
By Sebastian Modak
This is a place I could disappear into. And over the course of the five days I spent in the remote village of Santa Catalina on Panama's Pacific Coast, I met many people who seemed to be doing just that. There was the Italian surfer who came many years ago and now returns again and again, for longer periods each time. Or the British dive master who thought she would spend a season here at Panama Dive Center, but just passed two years in town.
Then there's the American who came to take a break from some stressful business in Boquete 170 miles away. He originally booked a brief stay at a hostel but, by the time I got to town, had moved into an apartment and had no end date to his trip.
Under the brutal noonday sun, when I, along with seemingly everyone else in town, retreated to a hammock in a spot of shade, I found myself daydreaming about being swallowed up by this little town too. I could find a new rhythm, dictated by when the waves were good for surfing and the visibility was good for diving, in a place where even the Wi-Fi takes things slow, restaurant menus depend on what's been caught that day and everything is just quieter.
Panama's Pacific Coast was on the 2019 52 Places to Go list because of this bit of coastline. Major luxury hotels have either just opened or will open soon, on private islands and previously empty beachfront a quick boat ride from Coiba National Park, a Unesco-designated site for its diverse marine life. I've been to places "on the up" before and I expected to see the telltale signs of a new tourism boom: cranes dotting the horizon; sunburned crowds settling into lounge chairs on the beach; minivans heading out in packs for day trips to nearby sites.
Instead, what I found in Santa Catalina was something that feels like a secret. It's a place that I can imagine being whispered about in hostels all over the world, a kind of El Dorado for budget-conscious surfers and bucket-list divers.
The pace of Santa Catalina was, refreshingly, dictated not by the backpackers passing through, but by those who are from here. During my stay, the Panamanians I met were just as excited as the visitors about the incoming swells at La Punta, a world-famous surf break a quick paddle away from a rocky beach. Most days, during sunset on the town beach, there was a heated coed game of beach volleyball, everyone fresh off their shifts at the hostels, surf shops and restaurants around the village. My favorite restaurant in town, Fonda Mango Green, a two-table affair, keeps irregular hours based on the laid-back schedule of the couple who run it. But if you catch them in the morning and tell them you're planning on stopping by in the evening, you can have a perfectly fried whole fish with rice and beans for just $ 5.
Conversations start unexpectedly in Santa Catalina and roll with no real rush to conclude. At Sugar Mama's Cafe, a tiny dessert and coffee shop in the center of town, a quick stop to grab coffee turned into a 30-minute conversation. Over a glass of sugar-bombed iced coffee, I talked to Pietro Ciotti, the Italian general manager of Hotel Santa Catalina, where I was staying; Melissa Caicedo, a Colombian who comes here from her hometown, Cali, periodically to work at the local gift shop; and Carolina Barberena, a baker from Panama City who moved to Santa Catalina five years ago to open Sugar Mama's and never looked back. The discussion, as it often does in Santa Catalina, tended toward the self-referential: a kind of gushing about what makes a place like this, where children spend the afternoon riding the streets on horses and the nearest A.T.M. is an hour-and-a-half drive away, so special.
"If you're going to get here, you have to really want to come here," Mr. Ciotti, 36, said, referring to the six-hour drive from Panama City. "The people of Santa Catalina really maintain its identity as a small village, isolated from the mass tourism you'll find closer to the capital."
Things to know
■ It's not easy getting to Santa Catalina. You can take a bus, but you'll have to make a transfer in Soná, the closest hub. I rented a car and the drive took between six and seven hours, lunch stop included. Watch out on the Panamerican Highway for speed traps though: There were more highway police than I've ever seen, all with their speed guns out. Also, prepare for some extra travel time if you're returning to Panama City on a Friday evening. My drive back ended up hitting the 10-hour mark.
■ There are no A.T.M.s, gas stations, or big supermarkets in Santa Catalina. Bring ample cash and arrive with a full tank unless you want to waste a chunk of your day making the three-hour round-trip to the unremarkable town of Soná. Also avoid driving at night -- cows, horses and dogs tend to use the roads, too, and can be hard to spot on unlit streets.
■ Though there are luxury resorts nearby, Santa Catalina is not the place for piña coladas and a spa. I stayed in the nicest hotel in town, Hotel Santa Catalina, a beautifully located collection of rooms, each with a hammock out front. It's pretty and the staff is wonderful, but it is by no means a luxury beach resort. Other options are mostly hostels, tent sites, and surf camps.
Ms. Caicedo, 26, said she came here for love, but that it was love for the place that kept her coming back. "There's a peace you can find here. There's so much time to really find yourself."
Ms. Barberena, 29, who was passing out slices of citrus cake while simultaneously listening in on our conversation and helping a German couple figure out the schedule for the buses that go to Panama City, chimed in. "I used to come here to visit from Panama City, then I started looking for work and finally set up this shop," she said. "I've been living here for five years now and I'm never moving back."
Another thing: I've never felt less alone as a solo traveler. In fact, on my last day, I had a group dinner with eight people, all of them solo travelers and now fast friends.
But the best moment didn't involve people. I was about 20 feet underwater, somewhere off the coast of Coiba Island, seeing firsthand why its waters are so special. Out of nowhere, a giant shadow appeared above me and my fellow scuba divers. A male whale shark had come to see who these visitors, so clearly out of their element, were. For at least 15 minutes I floated, looking up at the huge creature slowly circling above, chasing and inhaling the bubbles being let out by our regulators. Then, he dipped down toward the mass of plankton we had just swum through.
Later, as we took off our gear and climbed back onto the small boat, I took one last look into the deep blue below to see a giant shadow slowly making its way back to us. The whale shark was apparently in no rush to go anywhere else.

The World’s Largest Bee Is Not Extinct

Texto completo: It has been 38 years since scientists last spotted the insect known as Wallace’s giant bee, a rare species found only in a group of Indonesian islands called the North Moluccas. With a wingspan of 2.5 inches and a body the size of a human thumb, it’s considered the world’s largest bee, and was feared extinct.
Those fears can now be somewhat laid to rest. In January, an international team of conservationists found a Megachile pluto, as the species is called, in the wild. The team captured the first-ever photos and videos of a live specimen, renewing hope for survival of the species, which is threatened by deforestation.
“It’s just ridiculously large and so exciting,” said Simon Robson, a biologist at the University of Sydney in Australia and a member of the expedition.
The discovery did not come easily. Despite the bee’s size, its rarity, remote location and nesting habits make it difficult to find.
“I personally know of at least five attempts to find the bee,” said Clay Bolt, a photographer who was part of the latest expedition.
The bees make their homes by digging holes in the nests of tree-dwelling termites, where they spend much of their time hiding.
“It was a lot of walking around the forest in 90-degree heat and the highest possible humidity looking at termite nests and chasing after bees,” Robson said. In all, it took five days of hunting for the team to find their “holy grail.”
Wallace’s giant bee is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, an English entomologist who worked with Charles Darwin to formulate the theory of evolution through natural selection. Wallace first discovered the bee on an expedition in 1859, describing the female as “a large black wasp-like insect with immense jaws like a stag beetle.” (The males are less than an inch long.)
Though Wallace didn’t seem particularly interested in the bee - he devoted only a single line to it in his journal - it became something of an obsession among biologists. The next sighting didn’t come until 1981, when Adam Messer, an entomologist, observed several in the wild and returned home with a handful of specimens that are now held in the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the Natural History Museum in London and other institutions.
Messer observed that the bees use their unusually large mandibles to scrape together balls of tree resin and wood to fortify their nests, and that they are relatively solitary.
Robson believes they are capable of stinging, though he wasn’t in a position to provide evidence. “We were all keen to get stung to see how bad it was,” he said, “but because we only found the one, we treated it very carefully.”
The expedition was partly funded by Global Wildlife Conservation, a Texas nonprofit that in 2017 started a global search for 25 “lost” species - animals that are not necessarily extinct but haven’t been spotted in at least a decade. In addition to Wallace’s giant bee, the list includes the pink-headed duck, the Fernandina Galapagos tortoise and the Namdapha flying squirrel.
Conservationists are concerned that deforestation threatens the survival of the bee giants. The region of Indonesia where the bees are found lost 7 percent of its tree cover between 2001 and 2017, according to Global Forest Watch.
Excited as they were to find the bee, Robson and his team worry that the sighting may be a mixed blessing. Last year, an anonymous seller sold a previously unaccounted-for specimen to an unknown bidder on eBay for $9,100. “If you can get that much money for an insect, that encourages people to go and find them,” Robson said. To help protect the bees, the team has agreed not to disclose the exact island where they made their discovery.
The plan now is for the team to return to the island and conduct more extensive research.

Texto completo: "Sex abuse of children is a common phenomenon wherever you look, but particularly during the last half of the 20th century."
Thomas Plante
Psychology professor at Santa Clara University
As Roman Catholic dioceses in New Jersey and across the country continue to release the names of hundreds of priests credibly accused of sexually abusing children over the decades, many are asking why this behavior seems to be so much more prevalent among priests than others.
Over the years, some have attributed the problem to the church's all-male clergy, the oath of celibacy, sexual orientation, or all of these factors combined.
But research has debunked the notion that celibacy or sexual orientation are at the root of the problem, and experts say sex offenders, though overwhelmingly men, are no more likely to be priests in the Catholic Church than filling similar roles of authority in any other institution.
"If people think that you're more likely to get sexually violated by a priest than by a stepfather or soccer coach or a school teacher, then you're just not paying attention to the data," said Thomas Plante, a psychology professor at Santa Clara University whose research has focused on sex offending clergy. "Sex abuse of children is a common phenomenon wherever you look, but particularly during the last half of the 20th century."
The American Psychiatric Association has found that about 3 to 5 percent of the general male population in the U.S. are pedophiles. And in 2004, a U.S. Department of Education study of educators committing sexual misconduct found that about 5 percent of school staff sexually violated children.
From 1950 to 2002, of the 109,694 priests in active ministry, 4,392 — or 4 percent — were accused of sexual abuse, according to a 2004 John Jay report on the nature and scope of the crisis.
New Jersey has 16,000 people on its sex offender registry, which is far less than 5 percent of its male population. But it's crucial to note only 30 percent of sexual abuse cases get reported to authorities, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
Some experts say the reason priest sex abuse has become so prominent an issue is not because there are more sex abusers among priests than in the general population, but because victims have become more empowered to speak out. Some of that has to do with societal changes, a growing freedom to talk about sex generally, and a declining number of churchgoers, which has made it easier to challenge a secretive church hierarchy that had closed ranks to protect abusive priests.
Holding church leaders accountable, reviewing policies pertaining to interaction with children, and more research on how the problem persists in other organizations is needed in order to limit the opportunities of abuse, experts say.
Long-running crisis The crisis in the Catholic Church has come into the spotlight again since August, when a Pennsylvania grand jury report detailed cases of abuse by more than 300 priests over 70 years.
Dioceses across the country have been releasing names of abusive priests since.
Recently, the church found former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the archbishop of the Newark Archdiocese from 1986 to 2000 and founding bishop of the Diocese of Metuchen in 1982, guilty of sexually abusing seminarians and minors over several decades. Last week, Pope Francis took the unusual step of defrocking McCarrick, who is the first U.S. cardinal known to have his ecclesiastical status revoked.
Pope Francis and bishops from around the world began meeting Thursday at the Vatican for a four-day conference to address the global crisis of the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests.
The Newark Archdiocese, along with New Jersey's four other dioceses — Paterson, Metuchen, Trenton and Camden — earlier this month released the names of 188 priests credibly accused of sexually abusing children. Many of those priests are dead, and the others have been removed from ministry. The lists didn't include names of those who are currently in litigation or under investigation, or those affiliated with religious orders.
The abuse in many cases took place years, even decades ago.
Experts say most cases of sexual abuse have gone unreported. The New Jersey Attorney General's office set up a hotline in the fall for survivors to report sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. The line was inundated with calls the first two weeks, the office said at the time.
"Clergy sexual abuse isn't a new problem, just one that's been given more attention — and for good reason — in the past few decades," said Dorothy Rogers, the chair of the religion department at Montclair State University.
Societal changes spurred by feminism and the gay rights movement have contributed to people being more open to look at the problem of sexual abuse, not only in the religious organizations but other institutions, Rogers said.
"People are more free now to talk about sex in general — including sexual abuse," she said.
According to the Pew Research Center, 67 percent of adults in New Jersey identify as Christian and 34 percent as Catholic. Rogers said less people across the country are religious, which makes it easier to hold church leaders accountable.
"More people in the U.S. now identify as non-religious than ever before, [so] more people see 'the church' as just one of many organizations and they ask: Why treat religious leaders or groups any differently?" Rogers said.
Prevention and education efforts have increased dramatically since the public became more aware of how pervasive child sexual abuse is.
Organizations where adults have contact with children — for example, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Boys Scouts of America, the Girl Scouts and public schools — have developed training to prevent child abuse and neglect.
Pedophilia Only a few of the priests accused of sexual abuse in the United States from 1950 to 2010 had serious pathological, developmental or psychological behaviors that could have led to their discovery before they committed abusive acts, according to a report by the John Jay College Research Team in 2011.
Less than 5 percent of the priests were motivated by pedophilia, according to the John Jay report, called "The Causes and Context of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholic Priests in the United States."
According the U.S. Department of Justice, about 60 percent of perpetrators of sexual abuse are known to the child but are not family members, such as family friends, child care providers and neighbors.
Some priests who committed sexual misconduct were abused as minors, the John Jay report stated.
"Priests who were sexually abused as minors themselves were more likely to abuse minors than those without a history of abuse," the report stated.
However, just because someone has been sexually abused as a child, doesn't mean they will become sex offenders and abuse others, according to research by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Celibacy, gay priests Some have pointed to celibacy as a contributing factor to priests sexually abusing children, but the John Jay study did not find this to be the case.
"Just because somebody can't have sex, doesn't mean they're going to go after kids," Plante said. "There are a lot of people out there who don't have sex for a variety of reasons, including medical problems, but they're not seducing children."
Church leaders have often blamed "homosexuality" as the reason behind the criminal acts of sexual abuse.
Though less than 10 percent of priests have publicly come out as gay in the country, about 30 to 40 percent of the American Catholic clergy are gay men, according to estimates from gay priests and researchers in a recent report by the New York Times.
But the John Jay study found that "priests who had same-sex sexual experiences either before seminary or in seminary," or who engaged in sex after ordination, "most likely" exhibited these behaviors with adults.
"These men were not significantly more likely to abuse minors," the study stated.
"Sadly, gay men have been terribly scapegoated," said Plante. "They're not more likely to harm a child than a straight person is. The vast majority of sex offenders out there are not gay men by any means. Many are married with families."

Texto completo: "Sex abuse of children is a common phenomenon wherever you look, but particularly during the last half of the 20th century."
Thomas Plante
Psychology professor at Santa Clara University
As Roman Catholic dioceses in New Jersey and across the country continue to release the names of hundreds of priests credibly accused of sexually abusing children over the decades, many are asking why this behavior seems to be so much more prevalent among priests than others.
Over the years, some have attributed the problem to the church's all-male clergy, the oath of celibacy, sexual orientation, or all of these factors combined.
But research has debunked the notion that celibacy or sexual orientation are at the root of the problem, and experts say sex offenders, though overwhelmingly men, are no more likely to be priests in the Catholic Church than filling similar roles of authority in any other institution.
"If people think that you're more likely to get sexually violated by a priest than by a stepfather or soccer coach or a school teacher, then you're just not paying attention to the data," said Thomas Plante, a psychology professor at Santa Clara University whose research has focused on sex offending clergy. "Sex abuse of children is a common phenomenon wherever you look, but particularly during the last half of the 20th century."
The American Psychiatric Association has found that about 3 to 5 percent of the general male population in the U.S. are pedophiles. And in 2004, a U.S. Department of Education study of educators committing sexual misconduct found that about 5 percent of school staff sexually violated children.
From 1950 to 2002, of the 109,694 priests in active ministry, 4,392 – or 4 percent – were accused of sexual abuse, according to a 2004 John Jay report on the nature and scope of the crisis.
New Jersey has 16,000 people on its sex offender registry, which is far less than 5 percent of its male population. But it's crucial to note only 30 percent of sexual abuse cases get reported to authorities, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
Some experts say the reason priest sex abuse has become so prominent an issue is not because there are more sex abusers among priests than in the general population, but because victims have become more empowered to speak out.
Some of that has to do with societal changes, a growing freedom to talk about sex generally, and a declining number of churchgoers, which has made it easier to challenge a secretive church hierarchy that had closed ranks to protect abusive priests.
Holding church leaders accountable, reviewing policies pertaining to interaction with children, and more research on how the problem persists in other organizations is needed in order to limit the opportunities of abuse, experts say.
Long-running crisis The crisis in the Catholic Church has come into the spotlight again since August, when a Pennsylvania grand jury report detailed cases of abuse by more than 300 priests over 70 years.
Dioceses across the country have been releasing names of abusive priests since.
Recently, the church found former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the archbishop of the Newark Archdiocese from 1986 to 2000 and founding bishop of the Diocese of Metuchen in 1982, guilty of sexually abusing seminarians and minors over several decades. Last week, Pope Francis took the unusual step of defrocking McCarrick, who is the first U.S. cardinal known to have his ecclesiastical status revoked.

Art Collective to Curate German Exhibition

Texto completo: An Indonesian art collective was announced on Friday as the artistic director of the fifteenth edition of Documenta, the trendsetting art exhibition held every five years in the industrial town of Kassel, Germany.
The group, called ruangrupa -- its name is spelled with a lowercase 'r' and loosely translates as "a space for art" -- will be the first Asian curators of the event, one of the art world's most high-profile exhibitions. Featuring 10 core members, ruangrupa are also the first artists, rather than full-time curators, to have been chosen to organize the exhibition. The 15th edition will run from June 2022 through September of that year.
The collective is known for working with community groups and intends to bring that approach to the exhibition, Farid Rakun and Ade Darmawan, two of ruangrupa's members, said in a news release. They will focus "on today's injuries, especially ones rooted in colonialism, capitalism, or patriarchal structures," they added. They also want to show works or present events "that enable people to have a different view of the world," they said.
Founded in 1955, Documenta describes itself as a "museum of 100 days" and transforms working-class Kassel into a global arts hub. It often highlights pressing social issues, and gives both art world stars and lesser-known artists a global platform.
The last time a collective organized the exhibition, at the fourth edition in 1968, the event was heavily criticized. Since then it has always been run by one or two people.
Documenta 14, the last edition, in 2017, was directed by the Polish curator Adam Szymczyk, and was seen by over a million people. It was the first edition to be split across two locations, with 160 artists shown in both Kassel and Athens. It focused on issues like resurgent nationalism, racism and economic inequality and received a mixed reception from art critics.
Holland Cotter, writing in The New York Times, called it a "scattered, uneven, relentlessly unspectacular show." But, he added: "In the end, it's as good as the time and attention you're willing to give it."
But the decision to expand the festival to a second city caused problems. Documenta 14 ran $8 million over budget and the governments of Kassel and the German state of Hesse, where Kassel is, had to step in to stop the company that runs the exhibition from going bankrupt.
There has been no discussion about having a second venue in 2022, said Elvira Dyangani Ose, director of The Showroom Gallery in London and a member of the committee that chose ruangrupa, in a telephone interview. The collective's approach was "rooted in collaborators around the world, and they want to keep that very much at the core of the program," she said. "What that means in practice, we don't know yet," she added.
Founded in 2000 in Jakarta, Indonesia, ruangrupa runs an art space there that is a well-known party spot and also curates exhibitions around the world. The group ran an internet radio station as part of Documenta 14, and has done such projects in Indonesia, too.
In 2016, it curated the Sonsbeek art exhibition in Arnhem, the Netherlands. In preparation for the event, it set up a workshop in the city to meet locals and give them input into what should feature. Installations in the final exhibition included a wooden structure by the artist Alphons der Avest, in which local bakers made everything from Turkish bread to pizza. The bakers used materials from the building itself to fuel the oven, so that the structure eventually consumed itself.
"Documenta is consciously giving room to the non-European view," said Angela Dorn, the government minister responsible for the arts in Hesse. She added: "ruangrupa uses art in its home country to address public issues and problems. I'm looking forward to seeing how they incorporate this idea in Documenta."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: BEIJING -- Kai Li, an American businessman born in China, had stepped off a plane in Shanghai, preparing to visit his mother's grave. Instead, Chinese state security officers grabbed him and accused him of spying, and a court later sentenced him to 10 years in prison after a short, secretive trial.
Now, two and a half years after Mr. Li was detained, his family in New York has broken its silence, saying that the espionage conviction against Mr. Li, an exporter of aircraft parts, was groundless and driven by political motives.
In recent years, relations between the United States and China have been tested by trade and technology disputes. The United States has accused China of hacking companies and inducing or bribing scientists to hand over commercial secrets. China has also stepped up warnings against foreign spies and publicized convictions of foreigners on espionage charges.
Harrison Li, Mr. Li's son, said the Chinese authorities had charged his father with providing state secrets to the F.B.I. He says he is sure that his father was not a spy, and that his conviction showed the risks that American visitors to China face as tensions with the United States have festered.
"I certainly hope that the U.S. government will view my father's case as a serious indication of China's willingness to use the coercive and inflammatory tactics of detaining foreign citizens," Harrison Li said by telephone. "It's very clear to us that the nature of the case is political, and tied to whatever geopolitical conflicts exist between the two countries."
At first, Mr. Li's family kept quiet about his case while State Department officials lobbied Chinese officials to release him, the son said. But Mr. Li, 56, went on trial in Shanghai in August 2017 and was convicted and sentenced in July of last year. Harrison Li said that he and his mother decided to speak out after Mr. Li's appeal was rejected last month.
The F.B.I. declined to comment on the case. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond on Friday to faxed questions about the case, nor did the police, the prosecutors' office or the foreign affairs office in Shanghai.
The case raises broader questions about how foreign businesspeople dealing with sensitive sectors in China -- in this case, the aerospace sector -- are vulnerable to espionage charges.
Before Mr. Li's detention, his life centered on his home and businesses on Long Island, where he owned two gas stations. He went to the United States in 1989 after the Tiananmen Square massacre and gained citizenship there in the 1990s, said his son, who graduated from Harvard last year and works in finance. Mr. Li's wife also immigrated from China.
Mr. Li visited China two or three times a year, and he ran a company that exported aircraft parts to China and elsewhere in Asia on behalf of a subsidiary of Boeing, Harrison Li said. The son said he did not know the subsidiary's name, and Boeing had no immediate comment on Friday.
The aerospace sector looms large in the competition between China and the United States, and both governments guard against the theft of secrets. Last year, the United States orchestrated a complex international sting operation to arrest a Chinese intelligence official who was charged with trying to get proprietary information from a GE Aviation employee.
"I'm sure that his business would have made him an easier target for the Chinese government," Harrison Li said of his father. He said his father wrote in a letter, while in detention, that the paperwork for the exports entailed making filings with the United States government that may have drawn suspicion from Chinese investigators.
Mr. Li's case has added to the tensions between Beijing and Washington.
Relations have been strained since last year, when President Trump hit goods made in China with tariffs intended to force Beijing into dismantling what he and other critics say are unfair trade and investment barriers.
China was also incensed by the arrest in Canada late last year of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, who American prosecutors say helped Huawei slip past American sanctions on Iran by fraudulently misleading a bank. Two Canadian men were detained in China in December in what appeared to be payback for Ms. Meng's arrest.
"The international security competition between the United States and China is beginning to affect the business world in a very significant way," said Evan S. Medeiros, a professor at Georgetown University who was senior Asia director in the Obama White House.
In targeting American businesses, China has a "much bigger tool kit to play with" because of the vast powers of its state security apparatus and lack of real legal oversight, Mr. Medeiros said, without commenting specifically on Mr. Li's case.
Members of the Trump administration and of Congress have taken up Mr. Li's case, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other State Department officials, Harrison Li said.
"We regularly raise Mr. Li's case with Chinese officials," the State Department said a written statement. It said consular staff had sent multiple requests to the Chinese authorities seeking Mr. Li's release on humanitarian grounds, but received no response.
This week, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, and four members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to Mr. Trump urging him, for a second time, to push the Chinese government to release Mr. Li. The letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, said, "It is incumbent upon our government to fulfill its responsibility to a citizen in distress and be his vociferous advocate."
Mr. Schumer told The Times on Thursday, "The Trump administration must use all tools available to prioritize bringing Mr. Li back home."
On Friday afternoon, Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said the United States had appealed to Beijing "multiple times over the past two years for Li Kai's immediate release."
In China, President Xi Jinping has brought in new laws to combat espionage and perceived threats to national security, which include vague and sweeping definitions of national secrets.
In recent years, Chinese security officers have been especially tough in detaining people born in China who have foreign citizenship. Some visitors of Chinese descent have spent years in prison on sweeping charges.

In a travel warning for China reissued last month, the State Department said that American citizens of Chinese heritage could face additional scrutiny and harassment.
When Mr. Li went to trial, United States consular officers were not allowed into the hearing, after the court invoked a rule banning outsiders from sensitive cases involving national security. The hearing lasted a little over an hour, said Harrison Li, who is in touch with the consular officers.
After the trial, the court took the unusual step of ordering additional investigation by the prosecution office, postponing a judgment, Harrison Li said. Such a move suggests that judges thought the evidence presented by the prosecution was insufficient.
Still, the judges last year declared Mr. Li guilty of sharing one "classified" state secret and four "confidential" state secrets, his son said, citing a judgment seen by the United States consulate in Shanghai. Those classes of secrecy both fall below the topmost confidentiality classification in China.
Harrison Li hopes that Mr. Trump will take up his father's case when he next meets with Mr. Xi. But he said he had qualms about speaking out because he was afraid that the authorities might take it out on his father, who has been in poor health with bouts of shingles and constant stomach ailments.
"There's already a very real concern that when families of imprisoned people in China go public, they retaliate," he said. "It just seems that there's not much more that can be done quietly."

Texto completo: A prison drama debuts on HBO. And the 2019 Film Independent Spirit Awards air live from Santa Monica, Calif.
What's on TV
O.G. (2019) 10 p.m. on HBO; also on streaming platforms. The director Madeleine Sackler filmed this new drama over five weeks in a maximum-security prison in Indiana. It stars Jeffrey Wright ("Westworld") as Louis, an inmate at the end of his 24-year-sentence whose path to freedom is disrupted when he gets involved with a younger, newly incarcerated prisoner (Theothus Carter). The cast features guards and inmates at the correctional facility, and, through her research into this feature, Sackler produced an accompanying documentary, "It's a Hard Truth Ain't It?," which airs at 10 p.m. on Monday on HBO.
SATURDAY STACK -- QUEEN 12 p.m. on AXS TV. Rami Malek has collected accolades for his role as Freddie Mercury in "Bohemian Rhapsody," and he may just win his first Oscar for it on Sunday. The movie's scenes of live shows portray Queen's ability to dominate large crowds, but this marathon offers an overview of the real thing. It features concerts and profiles, beginning with a documentary on the band's acclaimed album "A Night at the Opera."
2019 FILM INDEPENDENT SPIRIT AWARDS 5 p.m. on IFC. Aubrey Plaza hosts the 34th Film Independent Spirit Awards live from Santa Monica, Calif. Among the nominees are "Eighth Grade," for best feature; Barry Jenkins, for best director ("If Beale Street Could Talk"); and Toni Collette, for best actress ("Hereditary"). In an interview with The New York Times, Plaza said she was hoping for a grand entrance, but reality may be a tad less flashy: "I'm just going to wash up on shore from the water, in rags." She succeeds the irreverent comics John Mulaney and Nick Kroll, who, in their opening monologue at last year's ceremony, reflected on the news surrounding the #MeToo movement. (Mulaney asked: "What about Woody Allen and his last 20 unwatchable movies? Can I still not watch them?")
What's Streaming
THIS GIANT BEAST THAT IS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY stream or rent on Amazon. Adam McKay lends his signature fast-paced style to this eight-part documentary series on the dizzying and sometimes appalling ways of the global economy. In each episode, the host Kal Penn ("House") unpacks a tricky topic like bitcoin or artificial intelligence with a no-holds-barred approach. And because McKay is an executive producer, expect a long list of celebrity cameos.
THE BLUE ROOM (2014) stream on Amazon, Hulu or Mubi; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes or YouTube. Mathieu Amalric directs and stars in this steamy French thriller based on the novel by Georges Simenon. It follows Julien (Amalric) and Esther (Stéphanie Cléau), former schoolmates who, when they're older and married, wind up in an impassioned affair. Their romance feels wicked from the start, but once Julien gets arrested, their lives intertwine in dark, unexpected ways. Writing in The Times, Manohla Dargis named the film a Critic's Pick and called it an "elegant psychological freak-out."

Texto completo: Food conglomerate Kraft Heinz took a $15.4 billion write-down in two of its most powerful brands this week, a jarring warning that even the most iconic American names are vulnerable to shifts in consumer tastes.
The hit on the value of the Kraft and Oscar Mayer labels on Thursday highlights the struggles packaged food companies face as they try to keep up with evolving palates and the rise of smaller, organic and online competitors. Though Kraft Heinz boasts some of the most distinctly American products - Jell-O, Kool-Aid, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese - nostalgia isn't enough to guarantee sales in the age of fresh-focused eating.
Consider Kraft Singles. The radiant orange slices have been the gooey glue of American lunches since the 1960s. The founder of Kraft Foods, James L. Kraft, created early versions of "process cheese" with hopes of making a sliced cheese with a longer shelf life. Kraft and researchers found a way to kill off the bacteria that spawn mold, but it took another 15 years of tinkering before their individually wrapped creation hit markets, the New York Times reported. The product was heralded for the ways it sidestepped the failings of store-bought cheese. Slices didn't dry out or curl up at the ends; they were beloved for their uniformity and convenience.
Now, the same factors that made Kraft Singles an American household staple are eroding its appeal for modern consumers, who prioritize fresh ingredients and have a vested interested in how their food is produced. A June report from Nielsen found that fresh categories are driving nearly half of all growth in bricks-and-mortar groceries, with fresh and perishable foods generating more than $177 billion in sales. Conversely, the volume of packaged products sold in the center aisles of grocery stores fell 1.7 percent.
"Consumers are seeking craft, not Kraft," said Matt Gould, editor at Dairy & Food Market Analyst. "People want a story, and they want something that's natural. They're afraid of preservatives."
Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of natural cheeses, and a corresponding drop-off for processed ones. Processed-cheese sales fell an estimated 1.6 percent in 2018 - a fourth straight year of decline - according to a study from Euromonitor International. The past decade has seen the evolution of the grocery store cheese section, as Americans have developed a more advanced taste for cheese, Gould said.
That might explain why consumers have turned away from Kraft Singles, which officially is a "pasteurized process cheese food" because it doesn't meet the Food and Drug Administration's definition for cheese; to do that, it would have to be at least 51 percent real cheese.
Executives have tried to paint the product's unnatural qualities as a virtue. Peter Cotter, general manager of cheese and dairy for Kraft Heinz, told Bloomberg News in October that the "melt" factor of Kraft Singles is a unique asset, a byproduct of its artificial makeup.
"Honestly, you can't get that in a natural cheese," Cotter said. "It's a unique product. The creamy smooth texture and melt of the cheese. The natural cheeses, they just don't melt that way."
Kraft Singles sales are flat, even though about 40 percent of U.S. households still buy it, Cotter told Bloomberg. And as shoppers have scaled back on processed cheese, so have restaurants. Last year, McDonald's eliminated artificial preservatives from its own squares of American cheese (as well as its buns and Big Mac sauce) to show consumers it has prioritized clean ingredients. Chains like Panera Bread and Cracker Barrel have jettisoned classic grilled cheeses from their menus in favor of sandwiches with cheddar and Gouda.
"Customers are becoming more demanding around really knowing what's in their food," Chris Kempczinski, president of McDonald's U.S. business, said as he explained the ingredient changes in a September conference call.
The bulk of Kraft Heinz's products are suffering from the same shifts in consumer tastes and increased competition, and it's showing in their business. The conglomerate, which counts Velveeta and Capri Sun among its bigger brands, reported losses of $12.6 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $8 billion a year earlier. On Thursday, Kraft Heinz cut its dividend by 36 percent. Chief Financial Officer David Knopf said the company expected to "take a step backward in 2019" in a post-earnings conference call, and investors are bracing for the worst.

Weaving America's threads back together

Texto completo: Eventually, someone who writes on public policy comes up against the limits of words. There are only so many times you can urge, condemn, cajole, wheedle, praise, remind, prod, propose and coax before your vocabulary and patience both give out. This is not to say that public argumentation makes no difference. But for a columnist, that influence consists mainly of throwing 750 words over a high wall and hoping they land with a pleasing thud on some doer or decider.
Having mastered the arts of opinion writing, cultural criticism and human decency, David Brooks of the New York Times is now undertaking a project at the Aspen Institute called "Weave ," designed to recognize and help people directly involved in social repair. In the work of lighting candles to push back the darkness, Brooks wants to be a lamplighter.
The metaphor Brooks prefers is textile production. Many people are involved in the unholy work of ripping and shredding our social fabric - through dehumanizing language, racial prejudice and other evidence of tribalism. The groups Brooks highlights are the weavers, laying down the warp and weft of communities. They promote community dialogue and deal with various categories of need from youth development to suicide prevention. But they share the goal of strengthening human ties, trust and reciprocity as alternatives to isolation, loneliness and despair.
I've been familiar with, and occasionally involved in, efforts to praise and encourage the work of community and religious groups providing compassionate social services. I've been involved in efforts to promote volunteer service as a method of social mixing and an alternative to the general selfishness of our culture. Brooks's effort involves a more ambitious framing, designed to be the intellectual scaffold (to employ another metaphor) on which a movement is built.
In his manifesto, Brooks argues for what he calls "relationalism," as opposed to the "hyper-individualism" of a society based on the maximization of choice and self-actualization. A critic might respond that liberal individualism has done a pretty good job as the basis for democracy, capitalism and pain-free dentistry. But Brooks is diagnosing an excess of individualism leading to "social isolation, distrust, polarization, the breakdown of family, the loss of community, tribalism, rising suicide rates, rising mental health problems, [and] a spiritual crisis caused by a loss of common purpose."
In Brooks's relationalism, the answer is not found in a political ideology but in an alternative way of being human. In this view, success is not measured by the goods we accumulate but in the number and quality of the relationships we form. Such relationships tend to push our attention outward, toward the welfare of others. "The central journey of modern life," Brooks argues, "is moving self to service." And a rich relational life delivers a deeper, more satisfying form of happiness than consumerism. We are actually liberated by the deep commitments we make in life.
Relationalism had clear (and acknowledged) debts to the Catholic idea of the common good, to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s conception of "the beloved community," to Alexis de Tocqueville's celebration of American volunteerism and to Edmund Burke's preference for the small and natural over the large and ideological. Some political conservatives may object to Brooks's critique of modern capitalism as potentially soul-destroying. Some liberals may object to his focus on incrementalism and the human scale rather than on structural injustice.
None of this makes much difference to the extraordinary weavers across the country whom Brooks has chosen to highlight. They are following an entirely different prompting - a love that leads beyond egotism and into the lives of others.
Brooks's message is likely to resonate precisely because it is not political. The atomizing tendency of American life does deepen and complicate problems such as drug addiction and suicide, in which isolation can contribute to a downward spiral of self- destructive behavior. But many Americans can identify with the broader challenge of loneliness, which seems to be the flip side of autonomy.
Brooks is making the case that there is already a movement of human connection in this country, among people who don't yet recognize themselves as part of one. He has served this movement by giving it a compelling, nonsectarian, nonpartisan frame, allowing diverse groups to consider themselves part of one another. In this case, the frame serves the picture well.

Suing to protect the right to just be left alone

Texto completo: Unlike citizens of most every other nation, Americans are not required by law to carry identification when they are simply walking around. Just as there is no national religion, there is no official language here, and we are free to gab in any tongue we choose.
So what possessed a United States Customs and Border Protection officer who last spring stopped two American women in a small Montana city and asked for their identification because, he said, he heard them speaking Spanish?
Well, there’s an easy answer to that rhetorical question: It was the false color of law, the un-American pretense that a uniform creates the right to invade others’ privacy without probable cause, that led the officer to pretend he could ask for something he had no right to.
Because, plain and simple, there is no national ID card here, and there is no need to carry anything with you as you go about your daily business — or to show even a driver’s license to law enforcement if there is no real reason to do so. But the undeniable truth is that police officers around the country quite often act as if this is not the case. It simply makes life easier for them if they can figure out who you are and run your name through the system when they have any suspicions at all.
In some small way, the fact that we can stroll ID-free helps keep the fully bureaucratic state at bay.
And that’s why we are glad that the two women in Montana, Ana Suda and Martha Hernandez, are suing the government agency in a symbolically important case brought by the ACLU.
They were in a convenience store in Havre, Montana, on May 16, 2018 when, the lawsuit alleges, Agent Paul A. O’Neal commented on Hernandez’s accent, calling it “very strong.” He then asked where they were born. Hernandez was born in California and Suda in Texas.
When the women expressed shock at the agent’s question, The New York Times reports, he said he was “dead serious” and asked to see their identification.
The pair were in possession of their valid Montana driver’s licenses, and, probably smartly, deciding to produce them, maintain as we might that they didn’t have to.
The officer briefly detained them in the store’s parking lot, the suit alleges. The women filmed the encounter on their phones, and asked on camera why they were being stopped.
“Ma’am the reason I asked you for your ID is I came in here and I saw you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here,” the agent said. The town is 35 miles from the Canadian border.
The agency has lots of real work to do. Frivolous lawsuits would only make that harder. But this kind of fighting back against false authority is so very important for Americans to continue to do in an increasingly un-private age. It is not against the law to speak Spanish — or Klingon, for that matter.
Government intrusion on individual liberty, whatever its rationale or purported justification, must be kept within reasonable limits.
In a society that values liberty, it is untenable for government agents to use accents or choice of language as a starting point for infringing on individual liberty.

It simply makes life easier for them if they can figure out who you are and run your name through the system when they have any suspicions at all.
In some small way, the fact that we can stroll ID-free helps keep the fully bureaucratic state at bay.
And that’s why we are glad that the two women in Montana, Ana Suda and Martha Hernandez, are suing the government agency in a symbolically important case brought by the ACLU.
They were in a convenience store in Havre, Montana, on May 16, 2018 when, the lawsuit alleges, Agent Paul A. O’Neal commented on Hernandez’s accent, calling it “very strong.” He then asked where they were born. Hernandez was born in California and Suda in Texas.
When the women expressed shock at the agent’s question, The New York Times reports, he said he was “dead serious” and asked to see their identification.
The pair were in possession of their valid Montana driver’s licenses, and, probably smartly, deciding to produce them, maintain as we might that they didn’t have to.
The officer briefly detained them in the store’s parking lot, the suit alleges. The women filmed the encounter on their phones, and asked on camera why they were being stopped.
“Ma’am the reason I asked you for your ID is I came in here and I saw you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here,” the agent said. The town is 35 miles from the Canadian border.
The agency has lots of real work to do. Frivolous lawsuits would only make that harder. But this kind of fighting back against false authority is so very important for Americans to continue to do in an increasingly un-private age. It is not against the law to speak Spanish — or Klingon, for that matter.
Government intrusion on individual liberty, whatever its rationale or purported justification, must be kept within reasonable limits.
In a society that values liberty, it is untenable for government agents to use accents or choice of language as a starting point for infringing on individual liberty.

Texto completo: Unlike citizens of most every other nation, Americans are not required by law to carry identification when they are simply walking around. Just as there is no national religion, there is no official language here, and we are free to gab in any tongue we choose.
So what possessed a United States Customs and Border Protection officer who last spring stopped two American women in a small Montana city and asked for their identification because, he said, he heard them speaking Spanish?
Well, there’s an easy answer to that rhetorical question: It was the false color of law, the un-American pretense that a uniform creates the right to invade others’ privacy without probable cause, that led the officer to pretend he could ask for something he had no right to.
Because, plain and simple, there is no national ID card here, and there is no need to carry anything with you as you go about your daily business — or to show even a driver’s license to law enforcement if there is no real reason to do so. But the undeniable truth is that police officers around the country quite often act as if this is not the case. It simply makes life easier for them if they can figure out who you are and run your name through the system when they have any suspicions at all.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Kirsten Gillibrand, one of a lengthening parade of Democrats seeking to take on President Donald Trump, found herself in one of those sticky moments:
Meeting with African-American leaders while campaigning in South Carolina, with a plate of fried chicken before her, would the New York senator eat it by hand or with fork and knife?
Gillibrand began with the utensils, a no-no in down-home South Carolina. It was a bite that launched a flood of biting tweets. Opinion columnist Frank Rich saw it as a metaphor for Gillibrand's inauthenticity.
The New York Times' Jonathan Martin wondered if Gillibrand had never eaten fried chicken before.
Writing later in the Washington Post, Margaret Sullivan saw sexism -- why were female candidates being held to these kinds of ridiculous standards?
And so, the Food Channel phase of Permanent Campaign 2020 has begun.
The table is being set. As long as we're being force-fed politics while governance is treated like last week's leftovers, we might as well enjoy it.
With so many people running for office so far in advance of the election, and with so much air time to fill between now and two Novembers from now, did you expect anything less?
Are our presidential campaigns too long?
Consider this: The 20-plus months between now and November 2020 is almost twice as long as the time between D-Day and V-E Day -- that period from when the first American, Canadian and British troops landed on the Normandy beaches to the day that Hitler was cornered in his bunker.
That's how long our campaigns drag on.
Are politicians how they eat?
The food factor touches on something in politics we might call "relatability."
How many times have you heard it asked whether you thought you'd like to have a beer with a certain politician to get to know the "real person" behind the political faÃ§ade? The default position being that nothing officially presented to Americans these days by their politicians is actually the real story.
Politicians have long tried to use food and drink to connect with the citizen commoner. Missouri's own commoner, President Harry S. Truman, who enjoyed a nip of bourbon after his morning walk, extolled the virtues of Bess' chicken and dumplings, and chocolate cake.
(The bourbon thing got Truman into a pickle: The Southern Baptist Convention, in the seventh month of Truman's presidency, officially came out against an honorary degree that Baylor University wanted to give Truman, saying a Southern Baptist university should not honor a president who drank and played poker. Despite that, Baylor did so two years later.)
Is it a relevant expectation that a politician knows how to eat fried chicken? That's for you to decide.
But it's bypassing recent history to say the rap on Gillibrand was sexist. Plenty of male modern presidents and presidential candidates have ended up with egg on face.
Mitt Romney got dinged in New Orleans for calling cheese grits, "cheesy grits." (One writer at the time remarked that it would be the equivalent of ordering a "cheesy burger.")
Who can forget John Kerry ordering Swiss on his Philly cheesesteak at Pat's in Philadelphia in 2003? In down-home Philly, that was perceived as clueless as believing Rocky is a partner to Bullwinkle. Despite what became known as the gaffe at Pat's, Kerry won Pennsylvania, anyway.
Politicians from both sides of the table have gotten sliced over a New York slice: John Kasich in 2016, current Big Apple Mayor Bill DeBlasio in 2014 and, yes, President Donald Trump in 2011 have all gotten written up by the political standards police for eating pizza with knives and forks.
Comedy Central's Jon Stewart skewered Trump for 7 minutes and 49 seconds after Trump was shown taking then-presidential aspirant Sarah Palin on a tour of New York, where they ate at a pizza chain and not from an "authentic" New York pizzeria. Strike one.
And then Trump stacked a couple of pieces on his plate and dug in with knife and fork, and not by hand in the curled-up fashion that connotes a true New Yorker. Strikes two and three.
At the end of the pizza take, Stewart -- riffing on Trump's "birther" campaign against then-President Barack Obama -- demanded to see Trump's full birth certificate.
"I don't think you were born in New York," Stewart said.
As president, Trump has had his fast-food habits, similar to Bill Clinton's when he was president, seriously roasted. Trump got Twitter blast-back during the 2016 campaign when he ate Kentucky Fried Chicken with a fork and knife on his private jet.
The president is accustomed to putting his eating habits out there. In 1995, Trump appeared in an ad for Pizza Hut with his former wife, Ivana, in which they extolled the virtues of eating crust first.
The rich man, letting his hair down.
As American as apple pie.

Savall, Le Concert des Nations to perform

Texto completo: One hardly thinks of the viola da gamba as an instrument of protest and social reform. Yet Jordi Savall, the world's most celebrated gambist, has brought not only his unique virtuosity to his exploration of early music, but a social message, as well.
For more than 50 years, he has been rescuing musical gems from obscurity, and creating new musical and cultural projects that have made him a leading figure in historical music.
Born in Igualada, Spain, in 1941, Savall has been one of the major figures in the field of Western early music since the 1970s, and is largely responsible for popularizing the viol family of instruments in contemporary performance and recording.
A conductor of three early music ensembles, Savall has amassed over 250 recordings, has earned six Grammy nominations, and has toured concert halls across the world.
Savall comes to the Williams Center at Lafayette College in Easton on Saturday, Feb. 23 with his ensemble Le Concert des Nations, which he founded in 1989, in a program of music from 17th-century France by Marin Marais, Couperin, Lully, Leclair and others.
Savall's musical projects extoll human compassion and cultural diversity as powerfully as they condemn tyranny. His first recording project, in 1976, was a double album of medieval secular Spanish and Jewish music. It was inspired by Savall's admiration for Spain's early music heritage, a result of the co-existence of three distinct cultures - Christianity, Judaism and Islam.
But Savall was shocked by Spain's expulsion of the Jews in 1492 and of the Muslims in 1609, and felt it his duty to make a space for these cultures alongside more familiar repertoire.
"The Routes of Slavery," Savall's latest multicultural project, is an homage to the victims of the slave trade. It explores the history of African slaves and their exploitation in the New World over the period 1444 to 1888, with a focus on the melding of the early music of the colonial period with the musical traditions of Mali, Madagascar, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.
Saturday's program is similarly historical, based on a poignant, bittersweet biography. Savall and his ensemble will perform music inspired by the 1991 French hit film "Tous le matins du monde," the story of the French Royal Court composer Marin Marais and his legendary musical mentor, Sainte Colombe. Savall's contribution as performer, composer and music director in the film made him a star in the early music world.
The film's storyline is a compassionate one. It is late 17th-century France, and viola da gamba player Monsieur de Sainte Colombe comes home to find that his wife has died while he was away. In his grief, he dedicates his life to music and avoids the outside world. But rumors about him and his music are widespread, and even reach to the court of King Louis XIV, who wants him at his court, but Sainte Colombe refuses. One day a young man, Marin Marais, comes to see him with a request - he wants to be taught how to play the viola.
Apparently those lessons were successful, since Marais would go on to become a musician to the royal court of Versailles. He composed numerous instrumental works, along with about half a dozen operas and sacred works, now lost.
He is mostly remembered today for his "Sonnerie de Ste-Geneviève du Mont-de-Paris" (The Bells of St. Genevieve), one of the most popular works in the Baroque repertoire. Marais' music is featured prominently in the film, as it will be in Saturday's program, including the popular "Bells."
Jordi Savall and Le Concert des Nations, 8 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 23, Williams Center for the Arts, Lafayette College, Easton. Tickets: $29. 610-330-5009, www.williamscenter.lafayette.edu
Verona Quartet
Hailed by The New York Times as an "outstanding ensemble," the Verona Quartet, the quartet-in-residence at the New England Conservatory of Music, comes to Foy Hall on the Moravian College campus in Bethlehem Friday (Feb.ruary 22). The group replaces the previously scheduled Signum Quartet.
The program, presented by the Chamber Music Society of Bethlehem, includes Mozart's String Quartet No. 23 in F major, K.590 ("Prussian"), Mendelssohn's String Quartet, Op. 44/2, and Michael Gilbertson's "Quartet," written in 2017 specifically for the Verona Quartet.
The Verona Quartet has toured worldwide in venues such as Carnegie Hall and Alice Tully Hall in New York, Izumi Hall in Japan, Wigmore Hall in London, and Melbourne Recital Hall in Australia. The quartet's members represent four different nations (United States, United Kingdom, Singapore and Canada), but they maintain a unanimity of purpose in their musical interpretation.
The quartet compares its approach to music making to the poetic narrative of storytelling, which transcends genre. As a result, its name "Verona" pays tribute to William Shakespeare, one of the greatest storytellers of all time.
The Verona Quartet regularly champions, premieres and commissions works from contemporary composers. One of them is Michael Gilbertson, whose "Quartet" was named a finalist for the 2018 Pulitzer Prize in Music. The Verona Quartet premiered the piece at Carnegie Hall in February, 2017.
Gilbertson, who hails from Dubuque, Iowa, told the audience at the premiere that he was working on the piece as the presidential election results were coming in the previous November. He decided to alter his original sketches to write something more introspective and comforting than what he had been working on.
As described by Anthony Tommasini in his New York Times review, "The first movement, 'Mother Chords,' unfolds in gentle, pulsing waves of strange, soft, mystical harmonies. The second, 'Simple Sugars,' is full of frenetic blips, with the instruments often playing in-sync riffs and screeching sonorities."
Verona String Quartet, 7:30 p.m. Friday, Feb.22, Foy Hall, Moravian College campus, Bethlehem. Tickets: adult $27, age 25 and younger with ID Free. 610-435-7611, www.cmsob.org
Allentown Symphony Family Concert
On July 20, 1969, the first human beings landed on the moon as part of NASA's Apollo 11 lunar mission. In recognition of that event and the astronauts' safe return, there will celebrations worldwide throughout the year. The Allentown Symphony Orchestra celebrates that milestone in a family concert Saturday (Feb. 23) at Symphony Hall with a program that can be considered truly out of this world.
Kyle Brenn, a 20-year-old actor, composer and musician, will narrate this musical voyage, which includes selections and themes from films such as "Apollo 13," "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Star Wars," and lots more. Accompanying the performance will be images from NASA projected on a huge screen above the orchestra. Diane Wittry conducts.
Brenn has been seen on Broadway in "West Side Story" and "Leap of Faith," as well as numerous workshops, New York festivals, and community theatre. He most recently appeared as Tobias Ragg in Live from Lincoln Center's national broadcast of "Sweeney Todd," starring Emma Thompson and featuring the New York Philharmonic.
In addition to music from film scores, the program also features many popular classics with the moon or space as the subject, including Debussy's "Clair de Lune," Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata," and "Mars" from Holst's "The Planets."
Come early for pre-concert activities, which include a musical instrument petting zoo, starting at 12:30 p.m.
Allentown Symphony Orchestra, 2 p.m. Saturday, February 23, Miller Symphony Hall, 23 N. 6th St., Allentown. Tickets: $30, free for students. 610-432-6715, www.millersymphonyhall.org
Bach Choir Family Concert
This year's Bach Choir of Bethlehem Family Concert is literally a festival of song, when four gifted student choral groups join the Bach Choir and members of the Bach Festival Orchestra, in the Youth Choirs Festival Sunday (Feb. 24) at Zoellner Arts Center in Bethlehem.
The student groups will perform selected pieces on their own, and join the Bach Choir and Bach festival orchestra, under the direction of Greg Funfgeld, in others. Participating groups include the Bel Canto Youth Chorus, directed by Joy Hirokawa; the Emmaus High School Chorale, directed by Rita Cortez; the Lehigh Valley Charter High School for the Arts Touring Choir, directed by David Macbeth; and the Parkland Chorale, directed by Frank Anonia.
Compositions from Bach, Handel and Mendelssohn, along with works from more contemporary composers from around the world, should offer an engaging and eclectic program. Works performed by individual choirs include the duet from Bach's Cantata 93, Richard Burchard's "Sitivit Anima Mea," "For He Shall Give His Angels" from Mendelssohn's "Elijah," and Vienna Teng's "Hymn of Axciom."
The combined voices of the Bach Choir and the four youth choirs, with members of the Bach Festival Orchestra, will present Rev. J.K Alwood's "Unclouded Day," Handel's "Zadok the Priest" from "Four Coronation Anthems," and conclude with Dona Nobis Pacem from Bach's Mass in B Minor. In addition, selected singers from The Bach Choir and the four youth choirs will perform Bach's Sanctus in D Major, BWC 230.
Bach Choir of Bethlehem Family Concert, 3 p.m. Sunday, Feb.24, Baker Hall, Zoellner Arts Center, Lehigh University, Bethlehem. Tickets: $18 adults, $9 students. 610-866-4382, x115 or x110, www.bach.org

Texto completo: News stories about civil rights protests - and the brutal official crackdowns that often followed - shocked the nation's conscience in the 1960s.
Some Southern politicians recognized that images of peaceful demonstrators being attacked by police with clubs, dogs and firehoses did not make a good case for the continuation of legal segregation, and they needed to fight back. They did it by filing libel suits in state courts, demanding damages big enough to put some newspapers that ran the stories out of business and stop others from taking the risk.
By 1964, there were $300 million in such claims pending when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark New York Times v. Sullivan decision, which established that the people's right to criticize the government and the powerful is so fundamental to our system that public figures needed to meet a very high test before they could be awarded damages. To win a libel case after Sullivan, they had to prove not only that the statement about them was false and defamatory, but also that its author had "actual malice," or had published a story knowing that it wasn't true or had acted with "reckless disregard" for the truth.
So it was chilling to read that at least one member of the Supreme Court, Justice Clarence Thomas, thinks it's time to reconsider the half-century-old Sullivan decision.
Such a move would have at least one enthusiastic supporter - President Trump, who has been saying we should be "looking at the libel laws" since he first hit the campaign trail. But it would be very bad news for those of us who care about a free press.
The Sullivan case resulted from an ad published in The New York Times with the intention of raising money for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s defense fund. An elected official named L.B. Sullivan said his reputation had been damaged by the ad, which contained some exaggerations, because it criticized the actions of the police department he supervised.
He went to an Alabama state court and sued four African American clergy members who signed the ad, as well as the Times, where it had run.
He was awarded $500,000 in damages (more than $4 million in today's money).
But the Supreme Court ruled that even if there had been factual errors in the advertisement, it was exactly the kind of speech that the Founders wanted to protect when they wrote the First Amendment.
"That erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate, and that it must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the breathing space that they need ... to survive," Justice William Brennan wrote. The opinion seems to anticipate the modern celebrity gossip sheets that hide behind the First Amendment with a quote from James Madison, saying: "Some degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of every thing, and in no instance is this more true than in that of the press."
Thomas wrote that the protections in Sullivan were unnecessary.
"We did not begin meddling in this area until 1964, nearly 175 years after the First Amendment was ratified," he wrote of the Sullivan decision. "The states are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm."
Back in 1964, Alabama was unable to strike that balance, and there is no reason to believe that every state would do better today.
The Sullivan decision makes real the Constitution's promise of free speech and equality. It doesn't need to be "looked at," except in appreciation.

Texto completo: The fallout from Amazon's cancellation of plans to build a headquarters complex in New York City continues to rain down on local politicians and fans of tax giveaways to pay corporations to relocate or expand.
The debate boils down to one camp arguing that the incentives promised Amazon -- nearly $3 billion in return for a project bringing 25,000 jobs to the city -- were a bargain, and another camp arguing that it was wasteful and abusive to pay one of the biggest corporations in the world, headed by the richest man in the world, to move to a location it might have chosen anyway, and to lay out billions for a relatively meager gain in employment.
Each camp includes many members who feel that Amazon shot itself in the foot by announcing on Feb. 14 that it was giving up on plans to build the complex in the Long Island City neighborhood of the borough of Queens. The company cited local opposition, which didn't mollify Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had diligently supported the project.

"There was a clear path forward," De Blasio wrote in the New York Times. "Put simply: If you don't like a small but vocal group of New Yorkers questioning your company's intentions or integrity, prove them wrong. Instead, Amazon proved them right."
Much of the ire over the canceled project has been directed at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a leading critic whose Queens district neighbors the Amazon site. In an impromptu interview with CBS News after Amazon announced its withdrawal, Ocasio-Cortez greeted the news with unalloyed glee.
"If we were willing to give away $3 billion for this deal, we could invest those $3 billion in our district ourselves," she said. "We could hire out more teachers, we can fix our subways, we can put a lot of people to work for that money."
Andrew Ross Sorkin of the New York Times and CNBC came back at Ocasio-Cortez with a tweet bemoaning "a financial literacy epidemic in America." (He meant, we presume, a financial illiteracy epidemic.)
Sorkin continued, "Quick lesson: NYC wasn't handing cash to Amazon. It was an incentive program based on job creation, producing tax revenue. There isn't a $3 billion pile of money that can now be spent on subways or education."
This is partially wrong, and partially irrelevant.
First, some of the incentive was to be in the form of a $325-million capital grant to help Amazon pay for construction at the site -- in other words, cash.
Sorkin also overlooks that the deal would have deprived the city and state of a "pile of money" that could be spent on subways or education -- two of the sectors that would suffer the greatest impacts from an influx of 25,000 workers and their families.
That's one of the fundamental flaws of many such incentive programs. They treat the appearance of new residents as an unalloyed boon, but ignore the costs of infrastructure needed to support them.
Typically, the taxes paid by the newcomers can be used to build new schools and hire teachers or add capacity to road and transit networks; tax abatement deals shortchange the community of that funding at the time it's most needed.
New York's package, moreover, included at least $1.3 billion in refundable tax credits -- that is, payments to Amazon even if it didn't owe the taxes in the first place. Altogether, New York would be paying Amazon as much as $120,000 per new job -- a subsidy amounting to 80% of the average $150,000 first-year salary the company said it would be paying its New York employees.
The employees wouldn't receive any of these benefits directly, since they'd still be on the hook for their own state and city taxes; the money would flow to their employer. In effect, they would be paying some of the incentive costs themselves.
What has gotten lost in the debate over the Amazon deal is how little the city would gain from its payout. Since December 2009, the end of the last recession, New York City has gained an average of 93,500 jobs a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Amazon said it planned to bring 25,000 jobs to New York over 10 years, or 2,500 jobs a year. Measured against the city's job growth, that's tiny, and underscores the questions about whether the city and state were offering too much.
One reality exposed by Amazon's cancellation is that New York, in common with many other big cities, doesn't have a workable plan to build affordable housing in places where it's most needed.
As Kriston Capps of CityLab reports, the borough of Queens is burdened by "a local oversupply of luxury condos and a shortage of affordable housing." The advent of Amazon might have made this mismatch worse, by driving up rents in the areas closest to the development, displacing moderate- and lower-income residents. Capps observed that the percentage of Queens residents judged in 2016 to be severely rent-burdened, "meaning they spent more than 50% of their income on rent -- was 48.7%, the highest share of all five boroughs."
These issues weren't adequately aired before Amazon announced its plans to move to New York, because the city and state had arranged to take the City Council out of the loop. Their incentive package included a streamlined permit process that would have short-circuited local community questions about the project's impact. The consequence was an intensification of community opposition.
De Blasio acknowledged those shortcomings in the planning process, but too late -- and he blamed the company, rather than his own administration or that of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, another supporter of the deal. "Amazon seemed unwilling to bend or even to talk in earnest with the community about ways to shape their project," De Blasio wrote. "They didn't want to be in a city where they had to engage critics at all."
When the critics became inescapable, he wrote, Amazon made its "capricious decision to take its ball and go home."
Can this company, or any other corporate behemoth, continue to take that approach? The reaction of New York activists to this deal suggests that the era of unnecessary corporate welfare may be coming to an end.

President Trump: ISIS wife Hoda Muthana of Hackensack won't be allowed to return to U.S.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Wednesday that a Hackensack woman, who was the bride of an Islamic State fighter and now wants to come home will not be allowed back in the United States.
“I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!” Trump wrote on Twitter.
Muthana traveled to Syria and married and had a child with an ISIS fighter and now wants to face the U. S. justice system.
But Pompeo said earlier Wednesday that Muthana is not an American citizen and "does not have any legal basis, no valid U. S. passport, no right to a passport," contradicting statements by her family and her Florida-based lawyer, who said she was born in Hackensack in 1994.
Muthana, who was raised in Alabama, left the United States to join ISIS four years ago at age 19. In Syria, she called for Americans to be attacked, and she spread the group's propaganda online.
She is one of about 1,500 foreign women and children – the spouses and children of Islamic State militants – held in a Kurdish-run detention camp in northern Syria.
Muthana is there with her 18-month-old son. The child's father is not alive. Two of her previous husbands, both Islamic State militants, are also dead. Muthana is not allowed to leave the camp and has armed guards protecting her from Islamic State sympathizers. She is asking to be allowed to return to the U. S. to face due process.

"The government needs to engage with her, but not just her; all of these people who joined ISIS" from the West, said Hassan Shibly, Muthana's lawyer.
"If she broke the law, then the justice system can deal with her, and if she didn't break the law, she should come back anyway, so it can be determined if she is a threat. "

Shibly said Muthana has realized she made a mistake in moving to Syria and wants to return to the USA to face justice and "pay any debts she has to society. " He said she wants to speak out against the Islamic State and help de-radicalize other Americans.
Muthana abandoned her family and fled to Syria in 2014, a year after she graduated from high school. She briefly studied at the University of Alabama-Birmingham.
Shibly shared a letter Muthana wrote this week in which she described herself as "naive, angry and arrogant" when she decided to journey to Syria.
"During my years in Syria, I would see and experience a way of life and the terrible effects of war, which changed me," Muthana wrote. "Seeing bloodshed up close changed me. Motherhood changed me. Seeing friends, children and the men I married dying changed me. Seeing how different a society could be compared to the beloved America I was born and raised into changed me. "
Shibly, executive director of the Florida Council on American Islamic Relations in Tampa, said it was not clear from a legal standpoint whether Muthana's "marrying into ISIS" could warrant a "material support charge" to Islamic State activities, which range from terror attacks in the USA and Europe to beheadings in Iraq and Syria.
Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, said that if he were advising Muthana, he would tell her that coming back to the USA would be "risky. " Dershowitz told the New York Post her case would be a "close call" even if all she did was tweet and send emails.
Muthana claimed to have had no contact with U. S. authorities, and Shibly said she can leave the camp only if the U. S. government asks for her release. It's not clear if it has. U. S. immigration authorities were not available to answer questions about her case, including whether a U. S. citizen can be barred from entering his or her own country.
In a briefing, State Department spokesman Robert Palladino would not address Muthana's specific case, but said repatriating foreign terrorist fighters to their countries of origin was the "best solution to preventing them from returning to the battlefield. "
Pompeo subsequently issued the statement Wednesday in which he claimed that Muthana was not a U. S. citizen and would not be allowed back in.
Shibly, however, provided USA TODAY with a copy of Muthana's birth certificate, which lists her place of birth as Hackensack, New Jersey.
Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, said that Pompeo can't just assert that someone born in the U. S. is not a U. S. citizen.
"I gather that the government's argument is that she was born to a diplomat who was in the United States on official business, and so was not entitled to birthright citizenship. That's correct as a matter of law if it's true, but it's not true just because the government says so," he said in a Twitter message to USA TODAY.
Only six American militants have returned from fighting or training with militant groups in Syria, according to New America, a Washington-based foreign policy research institute.
All were taken into custody. Muthana may be the first American spouse or partner of an Islamic State fighter who has sought to return home. The New York Times has reported that another woman, dual U. S. -Canadian national Kimberly Gwen Polman, 46, is also in the al-hawl refugee camp in Syria. She left Canada in 2015.
A similar case in Britain involves Shamima Begum, 19, from London, who gave birth to a baby boy over the weekend in the same camp where Muthana is held.
Begum, who left Britain for Syria at age 15 and married an Islamic State fighter, wants to return to Britain for the sake of her child's welfare, but British authorities, including the nation's interior minister, indicated they might try to block her return. They might find that difficult to do because a British national can't theoretically be prevented from returning home unless that person is also a national of another country. Begum isn't.
The woman's London-based lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said Tuesday that the British government informed him that it is trying to strip Begum of her British citizenship.
As for Muthana, "whether it's a few years in jail, 20 years in jail or no jail, she's open to the legal process, and she's not asking for a free pass, just due process," Shibly said.

Texto completo: The Catholic Church has required celibacy from its priests for centuries, yet those vows were broken so frequently that the Vatican established a secret set of guidelines for dealing with clerics who fathered children.
This latest revelation, first reported by The New York Times, comes amid a new wave of developments tied to the burgeoning sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the church for close to two decades.
On Monday, the Diocese of Oakland, California, released a list of 45 clergymen and religious brothers it said have had “credible accusations’’ of child sexual abuse made against them, going as far back as the 1960s. Several other dioceses have taken similar steps in recent months.
On Saturday, Pope Francis defrocked former Washington archbishop Theodore McCarrick after he was found guilty of a series of sexual crimes, making him the first American cardinal to be expelled from the priesthood.
Two weeks ago, Francis acknowledged the long-known but rarely addressed problem of nuns being sexually assaulted by priests.
More: The stakes are high for Pope Francis, Catholics worldwide ahead of unprecedented sex abuse summit
Now, just ahead of Thursday’s unprecedented meeting of more than 100 bishops summoned to the Vatican to address the sexual misconduct crisis, the Catholic Church faces yet another sexually related controversy.
Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti acknowledged to the Times and other news outlets the existence of the guidelines, although he would not reveal specifically what they are.

Gisotti said the instructions seek to protect the child and require – others contend they only encourage – the priest to request a leave from his clerical duties and “as a layman, assume his responsibilities as a parent by devoting himself exclusively’’ to the child.
Vincent Doyle, an Irish psychotherapist who learned in his late 20s his father was a priest, told the Times that church leaders initially misled him to believe his was a rare instance.
Though there’s no exact count of how many children have been fathered by clergymen, he eventually learned that wasn’t true when an archbishop showed him the Vatican instructions for cases like his.
“It’s the next scandal,’’ Doyle said. “There are kids everywhere. ’’

Doyle formed a global support group, Coping International, that provides counseling and resources to “children of the ordained,’’ as the church calls them. He said the organization’s website has 50,000 users in 175 countries.
Doyle told CBS News he wants to see them codified so the offspring of clergymen don’t have to live in the shadows. The Irish Catholic Church did as much two years ago, establishing a set of rules that prioritize the child’s well-being and mandate that the priest own up to his parental duties in every way.
“The first problem with children of priests is they're not recognized," Doyle said. “When you're hidden … you are characterized by secrecy. ’’

Texto completo: Introspection time. I have black colleagues — most of us do today — and I regard the majority of them as friends, even if we may not be best friends; but am I among those white people who, as Eligon writes, "can be left with superficial relationships and without a real understanding of how race plays out in a black person's daily life?"
I spent a fair amount of my Sunday thinking about race.
It began early, before sunrise, and ended late, but not too; the seventh in an eight-part murder mystery, filmed in northwest Arkansas, aired at 9 p.m. And in between, affirmation of the possibility that dermis might some day not define segments of the human species, will not set the ground rules for conversation, for friendships, for our culture and our politics.
So. Grandson, 6, was spending the night with his M'Amie and me, and both were still slumbering when I carried a cup of coffee upstairs to the computer and the morning scan of the news wires.
I had set aside, for the weekend, the brewing debate over that certain star in the Arkansas flag, the one the General Assembly put there a century ago to honor the Confederacy, the star that an African-American state representative wants to redefine as a tribute to the Native American tribes who were here before the Spanish and the French (and the African slaves) arrived.
And I thought I'd had as much as I needed about the uproar in Virginia, where the governor has acknowledged wearing blackface decades ago at a college event, and where the attorney general preemptively disclosed that he had similarly parodied.
Then my Web surf carried my eye to an essay in The New York Times by one of its African-American reporters, John Eligon. The headline, irresistible: "The 'Some of My Best Friends Are Black' Defense." That is an element of the defense that the Virginia governor is employing against demands (voiced more by whites than blacks, evidently, and as many Democrats as Republicans) that he resign.
It is the defense that Eligon dismisses as "a tried and true myth: the belief that proximity to blackness immunizes white people from having attitudes that are rooted in racism or doing racist things." A defense "which has so often been relied on by those facing accusations of racism that it has become shorthand for weak denials of bigotry — a punch line about the absence of thoughtfulness and rigor in our conversations about racism."
Introspection time. I have black colleagues — most of us do today — and I regard the majority of them as friends, even if we may not be best friends; but am I among those white people who, as Eligon writes, "can be left with superficial relationships and without a real understanding of how race plays out in a black person's daily life?"
Almost certainly. But, as Eligon concedes, it's tricky business for us white folks, those who earnestly desire to look beyond pigment, for "sometimes it's the relationships that white people have with black friends that can lead them astray. They can be lulled into a false sense of familiarity that might have them pushing boundaries better left untouched."
Which leaves this white man a little confused: How to eliminate boundaries without touching them?
To the evening, and the Home Box Office "True Detective" series featuring a pair of State Police investigators, one white, one black; theirs less a friendship than a professional alliance. The next-to-last episode's cliff-hanger final scene surely was intended to be the most gripping, the most memorable.
Not for me. No, it was an earlier tense exchange between the two officers, the white cop furious with his black partner, accosting him, holding his tongue at the last second, just one word away from calling him a ...
"Say it," demands the African-American. "Say it!"
The white cop's response is a devastating snarl: "It's enough that you know I'm thinking it."
I'm thinking I know the answer to the murder mystery, to be revealed in the concluding hour. To me the more pertinent puzzle is how the two detectives, in their waning years, will resolve the stresses in their personal relationship. Will they be two men, friends? Or a black man and a white man, sometimes friendly?
Heavy stuff, that: the some-of-my-best-friends defense; "Say it!" and "I'm thinking it."
The lighter stuff of Sunday involved the aforementioned grandson, who I took to lunch at one of those kid-friendly fast food outlets with an indoor rec room where children climb and slide while their elders sip coffee and read — or watch. I watched. I watched as a dozen or more youngsters of almost as many colors and ethnicities immediately bonded in the common joy of carb-powered play, plainly oblivious to hues and hairstyles, untouched by the fears and suspicions, unlearned of the assumptions and defenses, of the generations that preceded them.
On second thought, that's not lighter stuff. It's heavy.

Texto completo: Things could get tricky for sleazy tabloids hoping to run stories about Jennifer Aniston being pregnant with Brad Pitt's alien love child. Same goes for legitimate news agencies reporting on President Trump.
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas thinks the courts should revisit a 55-year-old ruling that makes it more difficult for public figures to win a defamation claim. Thomas said Tuesday that the landmark 1964 case New York Times vs. Sullivan was "policy driven" and unfair because it essentially requires public officials and figures who are famous or become part of a public controversy to prove knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth.
He notes that nowhere in the Constitution - ratified in 1778 when celebrity culture was quite different - is there mention of a separate standard for public figures.
"We should reconsider our jurisprudence in this area," Thomas (photo) wrote in a court decision declining to take up actress Kathrine McKee's defamation suit against disgraced comedian Bill Cosby, who she says defamed her after she claimed he raped her in 1974. Cosby is currently incarcerated on an unrelated sex crime conviction.
Thomas, himself accused of sexual misconduct by Prof. Anita Hill during his 1991 confirmation hearing for the nation's highest court, wrote that libel against public figures should be decided on a microlevel. "The states are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm," Thomas opined.
The conservative justice's opinion is very much in line with that of President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about the way he's reported on and gone so far as suggesting the courts look into NBC's parody program "Saturday Night Live" for the way it makes fun of him.
"Should be tested in courts, can't be legal?" he tweeted. "Only defame & belittle!"

Coverage of Khashoggi killing wins Polk Award

Texto completo: When Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October, the mystery of his fate was personal to Washington Post columnist David Ignatius and global-opinions editor Karen Attiah.
Ignatius had been friends with Khashoggi since 2003; Attiah had recruited him as a Post columnist in 2017 and had edited his columns. Together, Ignatius and Attiah sought to expose Saudi complicity in what turned out to be Khashoggi's slaying, the latter through dozens of social media posts and media interviews and the former through a series of reported columns revealing the machinations of Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler.
Their work describing the plot against Khashoggi by Mohammed's regime, and its ramifications, was honored Tuesday with the George Polk Award, one of journalism's most prestigious honors.
The awards' judges cited Ignatius and Attiah's "eloquence and resolve in demanding accountability" from the Saudi government and from the Trump administration following Khashoggi's death. Ignatius "hammered home" Mohammed's likely role in his columns while Attiah "came out from behind her editor's desk to wage a public campaign on behalf of the truth," they said in their citation.
The Polk Awards are themselves named for a CBS correspondent who was murdered in 1948 while covering the Greek Civil War. The annual honors, which focus on investigative and enterprise reporting, are administered by Long Island University.
In the wake of Khashoggi's death, Ignatius said he felt "a deep anger" over the crime and the Saudis' fumbling attempts to cover it up. "I thought, I'm not going to let this story go until I found out how and why he was killed," he said Tuesday. He added, "Trump has given [Mohammed] a pass on the murder of a Washington Post colleague . . . and I think the president has to answer why it's business as usual."
Attiah said she was motivated "to keep reminding people of [Khashoggi's] words and ideas," which stressed reform of the repressive monarchy. "I felt protective of his work . . . I was grieving in public. I was angry in public." She highlighted her colleague's death via numerous interviews and a relentless Twitter feed .
The New York Times was a double winner in the competition. Times reporters David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner were honored for their 18-month investigation of Trump's financial history, which they found was derived from an inherited fortune and what the paper said were "suspect tax schemes" over many years. The Times staff was also cited for a series of stories about how Facebook and other social-media giants misled regulators and the public and failed to monitor invasions of privacy and the dissemination of hate-mongering and propaganda.
For the first time, the Polk winners included a podcast. The judges chose "In the Dark, Season 2," a series by American Public Media reporter Madeleine Baran and senior producer Samara Freemark that cast doubt on the conviction of Curtis Flowers, who is on Mississippi's death row.
Among other winners:
l Bill Siemering, 84, received the Polk Career Award for writing the initial mission statement for NPR and helping to launch the public-radio programs "All Things Considered" and "Fresh Air."
l Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, Reuters correspondents who have been imprisoned in Myanmar since December 2017 after they revealed a massacre of Rohingya villagers by paramilitary police. The reporters are serving seven years in prison for violating Myanmar's official secrets act.
l Julie K. Brown of the Miami Herald, for a series about wealthy hedge-fund manager Jeffrey Epstein's plea agreement with federal prosecutors, which enabled him to escape a lengthy prison sentence despite extensive evidence of child abuse.
l The staff of ProPublica, for a series of reports about the Trump administration's policy of separating children from adults who are suspected of entering the country illegally.
l Ben Taub of the New Yorker magazine for his firsthand account of the detention and summary execution of hundreds of Iraqis, mostly members of the country's Sunni minority, by vengeful Shiites who suspected them of collaborating with retreating ISIS fighters.

Texto completo: 'Good Morning America' kicks off'Oscar Week'
With the approach of the 91st Academy Awards, "Good Morning America," airing 7-9 a.m. on ABC, will celebrate Oscar Week with "Road to the Oscars," presenting special guests and features through Friday.
The special segment kicked off Monday with a look back at Oscar fashions through the years.
On Tuesday, the show takes viewers behind the scenes as host Lara Spencer gets ready for the big night.
Wednesday will feature tips on how to get red-carpet ready, while on Thursday, Melissa Garcia makes her fashion predictions.
On Friday, Road to the Oscars concludes with Chef Wolfgang Puck, who for the 25th consecutive year, will plan and execute the sumptuous menu, featuring his signature chocolate Oscar statuettes covered in 24-karat gold, for the Governors Ball that immediately follows the Academy Awards.
The 91st Academy Awards, honoring movies released in 2018, air live from the Dolby Theatre at the Hollywood & Highland Center at 8 p.m., Sunday, Feb. 24 on ABC.
In other Oscars news: Top-ranked tennis player Serena Williams will have an important role in Sunday's Academy Awards.
As the New York Times reports, Williams - along with seven other people from "outside the world of entertainment" - will introduce the best picture nominees and talk about how the films impacted their lives. Williams will do an introuction about best movie nominee "A Star is Born."
"Along with inclusion, which we definitely want to embrace, the big theme of the show is about movies connecting us - not in this theater but in a big, sweeping, cultural way," Donna Gigliotti, the lead producer of the 91st Academy Awards, told the NYT. "There are so many things to balance. Some viewers want to see glamour. You have to pay attention to where there is humor and where there is music. When do we guess that people at home might get up to make popcorn in the kitchen, and what can we have on right after that to bring them back?"

Lashing out crime at Delaware's whipping post

Texto completo: "The New York and Boston papers and magazines, that were wont to describe the Delaware whipping post as 'an effete relic of barbarism,' " the Laurel State Register noted in January 1905, "probably do not regard it as quite so effete or barbaric since President Roosevelt has recommended its introduction into the District of Columbia."
When the European colonists arrived in southern Delaware during the 17th century, they brought with them an attitude toward criminals that had its roots in the dark corners of the Middle Ages.
Justice was often swift and brutal. Instead of incarceration, criminals were sentenced to a variety of corporal penalties that included whipping, branding, lopping off ears, and in the most severe cases, drawing and quartering.
During the 19th century, most states abandoned corporal punishment of criminals; but in 1873, the New York Times reported, "Corporal punishment is an important feature of the Delaware penal code. For instance, whipping is a part of the punishment of all minor degrees of murder, and for burglary, mayhem, violent assault, kidnapping, highway robbery, attempted poisoning, arson, larceny, counterfeiting, and other felonies and misdemeanors."
Many in Delaware saw the whipping post as being essential to maintaining law and order in the state; and in 1904, the state found a willing ally when President Theodore Roosevelt suggested the implementation of the lash for the District of Columbia.
According to the State Register, "Ever since President Roosevelt recommended the establishment of the whipping post in the District of Columbia, the District authorities have been agitating the question.
"In his message the President very strongly argued this mode of punishment for wife beaters. The District Grand Jury in making its final report to the present term of the Supreme Court says: 'The desirability of establishing the whipping post as a means of punishing wife beaters and petty larceny offenders has been investigated by this body and the majority of the members are of the opinion that it would prove very effective in decreasing the number of these reprehensible crimes.' "
In addition, the Washington Post quoted Major Richard Sylvester, superintendent of the District police force, as saying "In my opinion the application of the lash in one or two cases in the District of Columbia and the holding of the apparatus in readiness for the future would (do) more to stay the cruel treatment of wives and children and prevent the snatching of pocketbooks, assaults, and robberies, than almost anything that could be devised. Put up the whipping post and it will act as a scarecrow."
During the debate about making the whipping post part of the District of Columbia legal system, Delaware continued to flog its criminals.
In April 1905, the State Register reported, "Roy Thompson was whipped at the post in Georgetown Saturday until blood spurted from cuts on his back. Sheriff Lynch plied the cat with vigor forty times across his bare shoulders. George P. Insley and Charles Lofland and Theodore Bell ... were given ten lashes each for larceny."
Criminals continued to be flogged in Sussex County well into the 20th century. In 1932, a crowd of 2,000 people, men, women, and children, some of the women with babies in their arms, braved a chilly February wind to witness five prisoners being whipped at the new Sussex County jail at Georgetown.
The last flogging in Delaware occurred in 1952; and the scarecrow of the whipping post was formally abandoned 20 years later.

An Indictment Exposes America's Witless Intelligence Agencies; Monica Witt allegedly spied for Iran—but she defected in 2013, so she'll never be brought to justice.

Texto completo: U.S. officials revealed last week that a federal grand jury indicted Monica Witt, a former Air Force counterintelligence official, on charges of passing extremely sensitive secrets to agents of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps.
The case highlights how broken the U.S. intelligence system has become. For more than 30 years it has demonstrated an inability to keep secrets, to protect itself from foreign penetrations by hostile spy services, or to prevent current and former officials from defecting.
The result: Brave foreign nationals who risk their lives inside harsh regimes to spy for America are being killed and imprisoned on a significant scale.
Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation officials portrayed Ms. Witt's indictment as a victory of sorts, lauding the exposure of a foreign spy after a multiyear probe. Yet the real story is not Ms. Witt's indictment but her defection to Iran in 2013. She brought with her details of a secret communications system American handlers use to talk to their recruited agents.
The FBI fumbled the case in 2012 by warning Ms. Witt she might be targeted for recruitment by Iranian intelligence. A trained counterspy, she knew that the tip-off meant she was under investigation and surveillance. It likely set in motion her flight to Iran a year later. As she boarded the plane, she texted her handler: "I'm signing off and heading out! Coming home." Other texts reveal she "told all" to an Iranian ambassador in Central Asia and had plans to go public in the manner of renegade National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.
The indictment is largely symbolic, since the prospects of bringing the case to trial are slim to none. But it is one way for the FBI to dispose of the matter.
Officials did not detail the impact of Ms. Witt's betrayal. Jay Taub, the FBI's assistant director for national security, would say only that she became an "ideological" defector after converting to Islam. Her actions, he added, inflicted "serious damage to national security."
According to prosecutors, Ms. Witt worked at the Air Force Office of Special Investigations from 2003-08 and then as a contractor, running an ultrasecret Special Access Program, or SAP, until August 2010. The program gave her access to details about counterintelligence operations, true names of recruited agents, and identities of U.S. intelligence operatives in charge of recruiting foreign agents. One program "allowed agents to communicate in the open without disclosing the nature of their operations," the indictment states.
Ms. Witt left the contractor in August 2010 for unspecified reasons. In May 2011, Iranian state media announced that 30 people had been arrested as CIA spies and 42 others were suspected of involvement with U.S. intelligence.
It is not known how the agents were discovered, but a likely cause was a breakdown in agent-handler communications. Ms. Witt could conceivably have been involved. The indictment states that she provided defense information to Iran but does not say when. The spy charges cover the period from 2012-15. And that communications compromise appears to link the roundup in Iran to a second colossal intelligence failure under the Obama administration: the loss of all recruited agents in China.
Last year, the New York Times and Yahoo News both reported that between 20 and 30 recruited Chinese agents were killed or imprisoned between 2009 and 2013. Yahoo reported the loss was caused by a breach in an internet messaging system used to communicate with agents in Iran that spread to other countries. The Times blamed the loss on a former CIA officer, Jerry Chung Shin Lee, who was arrested in January 2018 and is suspected of passing along their names to China.
These recent losses follow decades of similar disasters. Aldrich Ames, a CIA counterintelligence officer, spied for Moscow and gave up the agency's network of agents working against the Soviet Union and Russia between 1985 and his arrest in 1993. At nearly the same time, FBI agent Robert Hanssen, also a turncoat counterspy, gave over secrets on recruited agents to Moscow between 1979 and 2001.
Ana Montes, the Defense Intelligence Agency's senior analyst on Cuba, had already been recruited to spy for Havana when she joined DIA in 1985. Until her arrest in 2001, she helped Cuba neutralize all recruited CIA agents in the country. Another failure compromised all recruited agents in Eastern Europe during the Cold War.
These disasters and others can be traced to a lack of effective counterintelligence—finding and neutralizing foreign spies. Critics of the late CIA counterintelligence chief James Angleton dismissed the efforts as "sickthink," and since Angleton was ousted in the 1970s, counterintelligence has been the bastard stepchild of American intelligence.
Congress should demand quality controls on the $60 billion it appropriates for intelligence services each year. New and more effective counterintelligence programs should be a priority. A good first step would be to elevate the practice of neutralizing foreign spies to a strategic level of importance. This would involve better vetting and monitoring of those granted access to agent secrets, including after they leave government.
The most effective way to prevent further spy betrayals is to shift the focus toward offensive counterintelligence operations. That means devoting more people and funds to getting inside hostile spy services before they can penetrate U.S. intelligence agencies.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine -- It wasn't easy for photographer Smith Galtney, 47, to find what he calls his "calm, content midlife." It lay on the far side of a chaotic early adulthood. Getting there, he first had to climb the ladder of New York's cutthroat music business, kick a drug habit, bail out to nowheresville Maine and then master a whole new system of self expression.
It was a difficult path to tread but Galtney pulled it off.
The proof is on the walls at the University of Southern Maine's AREA Gallery on the Portland campus. That's where you'll find his first solo photographic exhibition, "My Principal Ghost."
[image id="2767488" size="full" pos="center" /]
The subtle collection of black-and-white images are about photographing something that isn't there, something you can't see -- in this case, the past. The images are Galtney's attempt at showing the continuance of his own convoluted, chaotic youth by photographing its concrete imprint on the present.
A rundown clapboard house sits in a patch of unkempt bushes just beyond a manicured lawn in one picture. It suggests something unsettling lurking just outside of a comfort zone. Another photo shows last year's cat-o-nine tails dissolving into random windblown fluff. It's perhaps a reminder of each season's impermanence.
[image id="2767490" size="full" pos="center" /]
Two images show a box of an old friend's cremated remains. It was someone he used to do drugs with, someone who didn't make it. The box of ashes is all that's left.
Born and raised in New Orleans, Galtney's father died when he was a teenager. At the dawn of the 90s, he left his southern home, entering college in New York City. He intended to be a filmmaker. Instead, he ended up in a class taught by influential rock music critic Robert Christgau. That changed everything.
Impressed by his work, Christgau set Galtney up with an internship at the Village Voice. That led to a successful music writing career that saw him published in the New York Times, GQ, Rolling Stone, Time Out New York and others.
[image id="2767492" size="full" pos="center" /]
But even at the height of his career, Galtney wasn't happy. He also had a growing drug and alcohol addiction. After getting married to a supportive man with a good job on Wall Street, Galtney got out of the city and moved to Panther Pond in Raymond in hopes of putting his life together and figuring out what he wanted to do next.
First, he went to rehab. It was after that when his husband urged him to take a photography class. That's when it clicked.
Now, Galtney is a graduate of the Salt Institute for Documentary Studies photography program here in Maine and the International Center of Photography in New York. He works as Director of The Bakery Photo Collective in Portland. In 2014, he was commissioned by the Frannie Peabody Center to create "SeeingME: Profiles of Resilience," a series of portraits highlighting the diverse individuals who represent the AIDS/HIV community in Maine.
Q: It must have been awesome being a music writer in New York City?
A: It was a great job throughout my 20s and even into my 30s. But eventually what happens is the musicians you're interviewing start getting younger than you. I had a big identity crisis throughout the early 2000s. There were so many things coming at me that made me think, I'm not a part of this anymore.
Q: Did you have some kind of turning point where you knew you were really done?
A: Yeah, to put it all much shorter, I grew up loving music. I became a rock critic and I reached a good height in the business. In 2001 I wrote two features for GQ. I was very well paid for them. They flew me to Nashville to hang out with Lucinda Williams for a weekend. I was like, "Yeah, this is what I want to do."
Then, I kind of had a moment.
She was a wreck that weekend -- and this is when I was still drinking -- and I just got trashed with her. She was a sad drunk. It wasn't a cool drunk and I didn't write about any of it. I realized, I just can't do this to a person. It was in that moment I realized I'm pretty [bad] at this job. I never had it in me to be mean to people. I always wanted to be their friend. I wasn't a really good journalist.
Q: Was that the low point for you?
A: Then there was some serious drug bottoming out. It got pretty gnarly. I went to rehab.
Q: Wow. By this time you'd moved to Panther Pond, out in Raymond. This is when you took up photography in a serious way?
A: Yes. If you quit alcohol and drugs, it's usually a pretty good idea to pick up an activity that's totally new. At first, I started cooking because if you do meth for an extensive period of time, the last thing you're going to do is whip up some pancakes. Cooking was interesting for a little while but it's not quite my thing.
[image id="2767489" size="full" pos="center" /]
Q: When you finally found photography, was it love at first sight?
A: I can't recall a more instantaneous obsession. I'd been sober for about six or seven months [when I took my first class] but it was like, holy [excrement], this is something.This is going to get me. There was something about photography that was so fearless for me. Writing used to stir up every insecurity -- but with photography, if it sucked I was like, "Let's take some more."
[image id="2767491" size="full" pos="center" /]
Q: I first became aware of your work through social media pictures of your bulldog, Kate. I'm happy to see she's in this show. You've said she was crucial to your journey out of rehab and into photography. In this picture, she's facing away from you, looking into a beam of light. Is this photo about her passing?
A: She was amazing. Bulldogs are just very still and pliable. She taught me how to become a photographer. Her passing was so much worse than I expected. It brought on this crazy life assessment. I was like, "You have no idea what you've given me." There's something about that picture. It's like, her work is done. She going into the light. She's saying: "You're good from here. You don't need me anymore."
There's an opening reception for "My Principal Ghost" on Thursday, Feb. 21 at 5 p.m. at the University of Southern Maine's AREA Gallery in the Woodbury Campus Center, on the Portland Campus. Galtney will host an artist's talk at 6 p.m. The exhibition will be on view through March 29.

Baldwin: Trump tweet is a threat

Texto completo: Alec Baldwin hit back at President Donald Trump's rage-filled tweet against "Saturday Night Live," asking whether the president's "ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE" smear constitutes "a threat to my safety and that of my family."

The actor known for portraying Trump on the comedy show raised the question Sunday night: "I wonder if a sitting President exhorting his followers that my role in a TV comedy qualifies me as an enemy of the people constitutes a threat to my safety and that of my family?"

Baldwin's question followed a Trump tweet blasting "SNL" as "tired" and NBC as "Fake News." "Very unfair and should be looked into," Trump wrote. "This is the real Collusion!"

Baldwin once again played the president on Saturday, mocking Trump's national emergency declaration to gain access to billions in funding for construction of his southern border wall. "We have a tremendous amount of drugs flowing into this country from the southern border, or the brown line as many people have asked me not to call it," the actor joked during his routine. "That's why we need wall, because wall works. Wall makes safe."

Bridgers comes clean on Ryan Adams

Phoebe Bridgers is speaking out after she joined Mandy Moore and five other women in coming forward with allegations of harassment and emotional abuse against alt-country singer-songwriter Ryan Adams.

The "Scott Street" singer, 24, shared an emotional Instagram post on Saturday, thanking her family and friends for their support and validation and slamming Adams' own support system.

"It's been a weird week and I wanted to say a couple things," she began the note.

According to People, After thanking her network of friends for their support, she wrote, "Ryan had a network, too. Friends, bands, people he worked with. None of them held him accountable. They told him, by what they said or by what they didn't, that what he was doing was okay. They validated him. He couldn't have done this without them."

Bridgers continued with a call to action, urging friends of potential abusers to keep them in check.

Adams, 44, was hit with the allegations in a New York Times article published Wednesday. The musician's accusers, one of whom claimed she was just a teen when the two engaged in "sexual conversations" online, allege Adams wielded his power within the industry to lure them in with the promise of helping to grow their career, only to grow manipulative and obsessive.

Adams' lawyer, Andrew B. Brettler, denied the claims to the Times, saying his client never "engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage." Brettler also said the allegations come from "disgruntled individuals" who blame the singer for personal or professional disappointments, according to the outlet.

Bridgers told the Times she first met Adams in 2014, when she was 20 and was intrigued by the "mythology" surrounding the man she'd heard could help push careers forward. She said the two embarked on a whirlwind romance and began discussing her potentially releasing music on his record label.

Bridgers claimed Adams grew emotionally abusive, at times threatening suicide if she did not immediately respond to his texts, the Times reported. She said she ended their courtship, and so too came the end of Adams' offer for her to open his upcoming concerts.

Moore, 34 -- who wed Adams in 2009 and divorced him in 2016 -- told the Times that her ex-husband took charge of her music career in 2010 three years after they first met when she was 23.

The This Is Us star claimed he "discouraged" her from working with other producers and managers, but after writing songs together Adams would "replace her with other female artists" when it came time to record the tracks.

The actress also said he was "psychologically abusive" and belittled her musical abilities. "His controlling behavior essentially did block my ability to make new connections in the industry during a very pivotal and potentially lucrative time -- my entire mid-to-late 20s," Moore told the Times.

Adams denied Moore's claims via his lawyer, saying her "characterization" of their relationship is "completely inconsistent with his view."

Moore, too, spoke out following the article's publication, writing on Instagram that any women who have ever suffered abuse were forever bonded in sisterhood.

"Speaking your truth can be painful and triggering but it's always worth it. My heart is with all women who have suffered any sort of trauma or abuse. You are seen and heard. #sisterhoodforever," she wrote on Instagram.

The star has since moved on with Dawes rocker Taylor Goldsmith, whom she married in November.

Moore told PEOPLE last week that she and Goldsmith are already planning on collaborating on future projects.

"We have things written, we're ready to go," she said. "Our [This Is Us] hiatus starts soon, so I'm getting ready to go in the studio."

Serena Williams, who has as much impact off the tennis court as on it these days, is headed to Hollywood next. Or, at least, to a celebration of Hollywood.
The world-renowned athlete, who recently appeared in a Super Bowl commercial for Bumble and made a surprise cameo on "Lip Sync Battle" last month to reprise her role from the 2016 music video for Beyonce's "Sorry," will be one of the eight nonactors to present at the Oscars on Sunday, the New York Times reported.
Williams, 37, will introduce "A Star is Born," while seven other celebrities will each take on one of "Black Panther," "BlacKkKlansman," "Bohemian Rhapsody," "The Favourite," "Green Book," "Roma" and "Vice."
"Along with inclusion, which we definitely want to embrace, the big theme of the show is about movies connecting us - not in this theater but in a big, sweeping, cultural way," Donna Gigliotti, the lead producer of the Academy Awards, told the Times.
The other seven presenters have not been announced and a spokesperson for the Academy did not return a request for comment.
The 2019 Oscars have already seen a laundry list of changes - but few that have stuck - as the annual awards show aims for a return to legitimacy.
The ceremony will go without a host for the first time in 30 years after Kevin Hart stepped down following backlash for homophobic tweets that resurfaced online.
First-ever 'Jeopardy!' team contest draws champs
Glance around the "Jeopardy!" set during rehearsals for its first-ever team championship and it's easy to be intimidated by the assembled brain power.
There's Brad Rutter, whose overall "Jeopardy!" haul, $4.3 million, is the most won on any game show. And Ken Jennings, a 74-game winner and top moneymaker, with $2.5 million, in non-tournament "Jeopardy!" competition. And Buzzy Cohen, the reigning Tournament of Champions winner.
They're among the six captains who will join their teams in competing for a top $1 million prize in a series of 10 episodes that begin airing Wednesday and conclude March 5. The other three captains: Julia Collins, No. 2 in overall winnings on the show; Colby Burnett, a Teachers Tournament and Tournament of Champions victor, and Austin Rogers, No. 5 in games and money won.
"It's like the Mount Rushmore of 'Jeopardy!'" observed Jimmy McGuire, part of the traveling "clue crew" that poses video answers from distant spots.
The 18 contestants were chosen primarily on the basis of their previous success, with an edge going to fan favorites as determined by social media, said Harry Friedman, executive producer of the syndicated show hosted by Alex Trebek and featuring announcer Johnny Gilbert.
Can "Jeopardy!" soloists work together? "We're going to find out," Trebek said.

Guidance on hairstyle discrimination

Texto completo: The city's Commission on Human Rights issued legal guidance on Monday warning against discrimination on the basis of hair. 
The commission's report outlined that racism against black people can often include discrimination against "natural hair or hairstyles that are closely associated with their racial, ethnic, or cultural identities."
The report said the city's laws protects people who want to wear their hair any way, including "treated or untreated hairstyles such as locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, fades, Afros, and/or the right to keep hair in an uncut or untrimmed state."
The new guidance follows complaints from workers at a medical facility as well as a nonprofit in the Bronx, an Upper East Side hair salon, and a restaurant in Howard Beach, The New York Times reported.
"There's nothing keeping us from calling out these policies prohibiting natural hair or hairstyles most closely associated with black people," Carmelyn P. Malalis, the commissioner and chairwoman of the New York City Commission on Human Rights, told The New York Times. "They are based on racist standards of appearance."
The report said that while an employer, for example, can require employees to dress work-appropriate, they cannot enforce any policy in a "discriminatory manner and/or target specific hair textures or hairstyles."
"Therefore, a grooming policy to maintain a 'neat and orderly' appearance that prohibits locs or cornrows is discriminatory against Black people because it presumes that these hairstyles, which are commonly associated with Black people, are inherently messy or disorderly," the report continues. "This type of policy is also rooted in racially discriminatory stereotypes about Black people, and racial stereotyping is unlawful discrimination under the [New York City Human Rights Law]."

Texto completo: Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who nearly toppled Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary, launched a campaign for the 2020 presidential nomination on Tuesday, plunging into a diverse and crowded field in which other candidates are echoing his themes and attempting to claim the progressive mantle.
A 77-year-old independent from Vermont, Sanders retains a large and loyal following and a formidable grass-roots fund-raising operation, thanks to the insurgent campaign he ran against Clinton in 2016, when he won 22 states, many by landslide margins.
But unlike that head-to-head matchup with a front-runner firmly ensconced in the political establishment, this campaign will test whether Sanders can emerge as the progressive favorite in a wide-open contest that features prominent Democrats pushing his signature issues of Medicare for all, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage.
Sanders told his supporters “it is time to complete that revolution" they started three years ago, now that his ideas have caught on with the American public.
“Three years ago, during our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were 'radical' and 'extreme,' " Sanders wrote in an e-mail to supporters announcing his second White House bid. “Well, three years have come and gone. And, as a result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans."
In an interview with Vermont Public Radio, Sanders responded to concerns that he no longer represents the “face of the new Democratic Party," as some Democrats have rallied around the notion of nominating a younger candidate, a woman, or a person of color to challenge President Trump in 2020.
“We have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender, and not by their age," Sanders said. “I think we have got to try to move us toward a nondiscriminatory society, which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for."
Jonathan Tasini, a 2016 Sanders campaign surrogate who wrote the book “The Essential Bernie Sanders and His Vision for America," said Tuesday that Sanders' success in making his agenda part of the Democratic mainstream might be the biggest obstacle he faces in 2020.
“He might not win, oddly enough, because in 2016 he won the debate over the direction of the party," Tasini wrote in an e-mail. “Most, if not all, of the Democratic candidates for the nomination are singing from Bernie's policy playbook: Medicare For All (or some close variation like 'open Medicare to anyone 50 and older'); free college tuition; taxing the uber-wealthy."
Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio might be the two candidates most closely aligned with Sanders' message of fighting for workers against the power of billionaires and the corporate elite. But other Democrats such as Senators Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and Cory Booker of New Jersey have also embraced policies popularized by Sanders such as Medicare for all.
“Look, I think Bernie is terrific," Warren said Monday night in Glendale, Calif., where she was asked what she would say to voters who supported Sanders in 2016 and are considering supporting her in 2020. “We were friends long, long before I ever got involved in politics, and I think it's great that Democrats are out there, talking about ideas. We are the party of ideas."
Warren and Sanders may battle in particular for support in New Hampshire, which both consider their political backyards. Sanders won the state by 22 points in the 2016 primary. But some who backed him there are eyeing other candidates this time around.
“I don't see him getting as much traction as last time," said Christopher Sebastian Parker, a political scientist at the University of Washington. “And especially right now, in 2019 going on 2020, where he's an older, straight, white man. Oh, no. Not in 2020. That's not going to work. I think the electorate, especially in the middle and on the left, is going to want something different."
Despite being a longtime independent, Sanders has worked with Democrats in the Senate, but has never officially joined the party.
Sanders' supporters argue that he remains the most authentic and credible champion for progressives because of his unwavering record of fighting for government-funded health care and refusal to accept corporate money — stances that some Democrats have only recently embraced.
“It's almost comical to see them claiming, 'Oh, yes. I'm a progressive, too,' " said Phil Fiermonte, Sanders' former state director and senior campaign adviser in 2016. “Well, Bernie has been there fighting the fight for a long time, consistently and effectively. And I don't think the others can claim that. Maybe they're bona fide progressives now. I have my doubts."
The campaign said it had raised $3.3 million from 120,000 donors within the first nine hours of Sanders' announcement. Sanders also hired Faiz Shakir, national political director of the ACLU, to be campaign manager.
As the party looks to mobilize a diverse coalition of voters, Sanders is facing questions about his ability to appeal to black voters. In 2016, he lost to Clinton in Southern states such as Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, where blacks comprise a significant portion of the Democratic electorate. Some observers have since criticized Sanders' outreach to black voters as lackluster and inconsistent.
Parker said Tuesday that the situation might be even more dire now that Sanders is competing against Booker and Harris.
“He could go to as many black churches as he wants to — it's not going to work, not when you've got two black candidates," said Parker, whose February 2016 column, “Why Bernie Will Burn Out in Dixie," predicted Sanders' struggle with black voters in the South.
Sanders has also publicly apologized to multiple women who told The New York Times and Politico that they were harassed by Sanders' staffers while working on his 2016 campaign. Sanders has called the mistreatment “absolutely unacceptable."
Sanders on Tuesday called Trump “a racist," “a sexist," and “a xenophobe" in an interview with CBS News. Trump, for his part, said he agrees with Sanders on trade, although “he doesn't know what to do about it" and “we're doing something very spectacular on trade."
“Personally, I think he missed his time," Trump said at the White House. “But I like Bernie."

Bloodshot Records says it 'failed' Lydia Loveless

Texto completo: Lydia Loveless, an acclaimed singer and songwriter, became the latest musician to join the rising tide of #MeToo voices in the music business over the weekend when she took to social media to speak out against a surprising culprit: her Chicago-based record label, Bloodshot Records.
For a quarter century, Bloodshot has been revered for its artists-first approach to music-making, and has accrued a reputation for community involvement and integrity.
But in the last few days, Loveless made a series of statements on social media that paints the label in a less flattering light amid allegations that she was emotionally and sexually harassed for several years by musician Mark Panick, the life partner of label co-owner Nan Warshaw. She asserted that she felt betrayed by Warshaw after one incident was brought to the label co-owner's attention without any immediate action being taken, and blamed the label "for allowing a man to grope, paw at and mentally disturb me for over five years."
Warshaw apologized in a statement Sunday "for any hell or even awkwardness I put Lydia or anyone through, due to my actions or inactions" and announced that "for the moment I'm going to step away from Bloodshot."
She clarified in a follow-up email Monday to the Tribune that "the length of time that I am 'stepping away' will depend on what is best for the artists and the staff" and that she "will be involved in the label going forward, as co-owner, unless at some point I decide it is no longer best for the artists." She declined to comment on the allegations about Panick beyond stating that "I did not witness them."
Label co-owner Rob Miller added in a separate email to the Tribune that "it was the consensus that her (Warshaw's) presence, while she works on her personal life, would be a distraction to the staff and to the artists."
Panick, who is not a label employee, had been banned from all label events and prevented from contacting Loveless. On Monday, he issued a written statement to the Tribune: "Anyone accused of something like this that doesn't immediately do some kind of internal audit is just not paying attention. I am no saint and behaviors learned in the past can be unlearned. I do not remember the events Lydia describes in the same way. But I truly regret making her feel like that and really wish I'd have understood that at the moment."
Miller initially responded Sunday to the Loveless accusations with a statement acknowledging they are "essentially, and sadly, true."
Though he said that once he found out that Panick was allegedly harassing Loveless he acted immediately to ban him from all Bloodshot events, "I realized I had failed in not recognizing that one of our artists was made to feel uncomfortable by someone. ... Not seeing the behavior disrespected her immensely."
Miller added that he encouraged Loveless over the last 2 1/2 years to make a "frank and forthcoming" statement about the alleged harassment. Warshaw said she didn't make the issue public out of respect for Loveless' privacy. "I am relieved Lydia is talking about it now," she said.
Loveless spoke out after a New York Times report connected singer-songwriter Ryan Adams to a long string of emotionally and sexually abusive relationships involving a number of female musicians, including one reported to be 14 years old at the time of the alleged abuse. Adams released his first solo album on Bloodshot in 2000 but has since been affiliated with major labels.
In responding to the Adams allegations on Twitter, Loveless wrote that she was "gutted and hurt by an industry that claims to be creative and here for us and that only proves more and more every day to be just like everything ... else."
As an example, Loveless singled out Bloodshot, which has released three of her studio albums, a compilation and an EP since signing her out of Ohio when she was 19 in 2011. The next day, she elaborated on the allegation on Instagram, where she named Panick as the person "who has long been a source of strife for me" and detailed a number of incidents involving groping and sexually explicit comments. Though Panick did not have an official role at Bloodshot, Loveless wrote, "He was, for years, as much a face of the label as anyone." She said she came to dread label events because of his presence.
"I don't think Bloodshot has maliciously encouraged this behavior but instead quieted it to protect their brand," she wrote, "and it has indeed been covered up in my eyes, as the behavior only ceased when I was informed they wanted to begin signing more women."
Earlier, Bloodshot posted a statement on its Facebook page that described its relationship with Adams when he was signed to the label in the late '90s: "The Ryan Adams we have been hearing about over the past few days bears no resemblance to the one we knew back then. To be emphatically clear, we never saw or heard a hint of the appalling behavior now coming to light. We are as shocked and disappointed as everyone else."
The Adams allegations in the New York Times report have brought immediate consequences. The FBI said it would investigate Adams' alleged sexts with an underage girl, three musical equipment makers have severed business deals with the artist, and Universal Music Group has reportedly canceled release of Adams' next album, originally scheduled for April.
The Adams and Loveless revelations suggested that the moral and ethical differences between the independent music scene and the corporate music behemoths were not as significant as they once might have appeared.
Miller said as much in his Bloodshot statement on Sunday: "To our fans and supporters who will find this whole matter surprising and disappointing at the very least, and sickening at worst: this behavior is a violation of our nearly quarter century relationship with you that we hold so dear. It runs contrary to the label we've tried to be and to the spirit of the music and artists we've been associated with."
The comments echoed those of Phoebe Bridgers, one of the artists interviewed about her relationship with Adams in the New York Times. She issued a statement Sunday in which she indicted a "network" of enablers: "Friends, bands, people he worked with. None of them held him accountable. They told him, by what they said or by what they didn't, that what he was doing was okay. They validated him. He couldn't have done this without them."

TRUMP'S 'EMERGENCY' ACTION IS UNLAWFUL PRESIDENTS HAVE NO EXTRA-CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS DURING REAL EMERGENCIES, MUCH LESS FICTITIOUS ONES

Texto completo: The federal courts and ultimately the Supreme Court should quickly and emphatically hold that President Donald Trump's attempt to fund the border wall by declaring a national emergency is illegal and unconstitutional. In 1974, when President Richard Nixon made an unprecedented claim of executive power to resist complying with a subpoena from the Watergate special prosecutor, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected this assertion and enforced constitutional checks and balances. We should hope and expect that even the conservative Roberts Court, with two justices appointed by Mr. Trump, will likewise follow the Constitution and reject Mr. Trump's dangerous claim of emergency powers.
The Constitution has no clause that gives the president emergency powers. This was a deliberate and wise choice. The framers of the Constitution wanted to make sure that its requirements, including checks and balances, are enforced even in times of crisis. Indeed, when prior presidents have tried to claim inherent power to deal with emergencies, the Supreme Court has rejected such claims.
During the Korean War, President Harry Truman seized the steel mills to assure continued steel production in the face of a labor dispute. The Supreme Court decisively ruled against Truman and rejected his claimed authority to take actions to deal with a national emergency. The court stressed that Truman's actions violated the separation of powers and usurped the powers of Congress.
Likewise, Mr. Trump's attempt to spend money for building a wall without congressional appropriation of funds for this purpose directly violates the Constitution. The Constitution reads, "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." Under the Constitution, Congress has the power of the purse and it is impermissible for the president to spend money without specific statutory authorization.
No such authorization exists for building the border wall. Mr. Trump repeatedly has urged Congress to provide such funds. Even when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, from 2017 to 2019, Mr. Trump could not get this authorization. More recently, the government shut down for a month because Congress would not appropriate the funds Mr. Trump wanted to build the wall. For Mr. Trump to fund the wall unilaterally without congressional approval, even by claiming a national emergency, is clearly unconstitutional.
Mr. Trump likely will claim the authority to fund building the wall under the National Emergencies Act of 1976. One provision says that if there is a national emergency, funds in the Defense Department budget that are not "obligated" can be used for construction projects to support the armed forces. It reads:
Secretary of Defense, without regard to any other provision of law, may undertake military construction projects, and may authorize Secretaries of the military departments to undertake military construction projects, that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.
The statute is about construction projects to support the armed forces. Mr. Trump's wall is not about that at all.
Members of Congress have standing to sue Mr. Trump for violating the separation of powers and nullifying the spending power possessed by Congress. In 2016, U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer held that members of the Republican-controlled Congress had legal standing to sue the president to challenge the spending of federal funds without specific federal authorization. She held that the Obama administration was violating the Constitution by paying, without a congressional appropriation, the promised reimbursements to health insurers who provide coverage at reduced costs to low-income Americans. "Paying [those] reimbursements without an appropriation thus violates the Constitution," she wrote. "Congress is the only source for such an appropriation, and no public money can be spent without one."
At the time, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called the ruling "a historic win for the Constitution and the American people. The court ruled that the administration overreached by spending taxpayer money without approval from the people's representatives."
Members of Congress should now sue Mr. Trump - and should prevail in court. No court should accept Mr. Trump's claim of a "national emergency." Mr. Trump has been calling for the wall for years. The claim of "national emergency" is a pretext to allow the president to do whatever he wants.
If my prediction is wrong and Mr. Trump wins in court, Democratic presidential candidates should prepare their own wish lists of what can be done without congressional approval. A Democratic president could follow the Trump example and declare a national emergency to deal with the problem of climate change - a genuine emergency.
But whether we have a Democratic or Republican president, and no matter how noble the cause, we should be frightened of presidents acting unilaterally to deal with a national emergency. That would completely undermine the checks and balances and the separation of powers that are at the core of our constitutional system of government. Until and unless Congress authorizes funds for the border wall, it is unconstitutional and illegal for Mr. Trump to use any other funds for this purpose.

Texto completo: When surveys today reveal that 50 percent or more of "college-educated" Americans don't have a basic understanding of America's greatest tragedy, the Civil War; don't know who Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong were; who believe George W. Bush killed more people than Joseph Stalin - this reveals a dearth of knowledge ominous for America's future. Americans' lack of historical knowledge forces them to fall back on what they perceive their ideological proclivities would support (e.g. left vs. right; Democrat vs. Republican). But this futile reliance on ideological orthodoxy in interpreting historical events is devoid of critical thinking, and is akin to applying the Rorschach test of subjectively interpreting inkblots, rather than objectively judging facts.
History is a nuanced article of faith, based on facts that sometime blow up stereotypical conventional thoughts. It should scrupulously not be based on a simplistic narrative created through rigid, doctrinaire ideology - which only limits discerning, impartial critical thinking.
In 1866 General William T. Sherman wrote to Supreme Commander General Ulysses S. Grant, saying "We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women and children." Later, Sherman announced that U.S. Indian policy under President Grant was that "all the Indians will have to be killed or maintained as a species of paupers" and that it was to be a policy which entailed a "racial cleansing of the land." Sherman, in an 1890 letter to the New York Times commenting on the conclusion of the Plains Indian Wars, expressed his deep regret that, were it not for "civilian interference," his army would have "gotten rid of them all" - killing every last Indian in the U.S.
And Abraham Lincoln cannot be given a pass, as he authorized the 1862 Pacific Railway Act instigating a systematic program of either forced relocation or extermination of the Plains Indians, precipitating the Plains Indian Wars. President Lincoln as Commander-in-Chief oversaw his Union commanders committing numerous atrocities during the Civil War, including: the Dakota War of 1862, Battle of Whitestone Hill of 1863, Bear River Massacre of 1863, Sand Creek Massacre of 1864, and the Navajo Long Walk of 1864 - which murdered thousands of unarmed Sioux, Shoshone, Cheyenne, Arapaho and Navajo men, women and children.
The notion that President Lincoln, Generals Grant, Sherman, Sheridan and Custer's Union Army in conquering the South, were motivated by a belief that all men are created equal, is belied by the fact that just three months after General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox, these very same Union commanders redoubled their onslaught of ethnic genocide against the Plains Indians. But we're to believe they cared about the slaves! If the North's motive in the Civil War was a noble, compassionate crusade to end slavery in the South, what happened to the humanity of the U.S. government in such a short period of time?
The "free-soil" movement and the North's moniker "free states" had nothing to do with racial magnanimity and equality. Northern leaders sought a mercantile oligopoly over the Western territories (to facilitate free land for whites and protect free labor of whites in the West, to the exclusion of both slavery and black freedmen). Northern Exclusion Ordinances refused black freedmen residency, citizenship, voting rights and employment -- Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, California, Oregon, Colorado and New Mexico were unwilling to take a single additional person of color. Lincoln's Homestead Act of 1862 forbade any black freedmen participation (until the 14th Amendment in 1868). The New England maritime industry was the primary facilitator of the North American slave trade during the entire history of slavery (the South's maritime industry was nonexistent). Northern banks, insurance companies, manufacturers, textile mills, brokerage houses, transatlantic shipping companies - financed, supported and indemnified slavery in the South up until the Civil War.
Politically correct historians perpetuating the simplistic narrative that the Civil War was fought for moral reasons (i.e. ending slavery and white supremacy), and the North was the champion of that morality and good; while the South was champion of immorality and evil - is not only historically wrong, but by feeding into that myth avoids the entire nation's deep connections (North and South) to the crime of slavery. What it does is by treating the Confederates exclusively as Nazis - is exonerate the North of its crucial complicity in slavery up until the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln was absolutely right when he said at the 1865 Hampton Roads Peace Conference: "The people of the North were as responsible for slavery as the people of the South."

A potential candidate for 2020, Sanders focuses on black support

Texto completo: Shortly after Senator Bernie Sanders suffered a crushing loss in South Carolina's Democratic primary in 2016, his campaign's African-American outreach team sent a memo to top campaign leaders with an urgent warning.
“The margin by which we lost the African-American vote has got to be — at the very least — cut in half or there simply is no path to victory," the team wrote in the memo, which was reviewed by The New York Times. Sanders had won 14 percent of the black vote there compared with 86 percent for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls.
Over seven pages, the team outlined a strategy for winning black voters that included using social media influencers and having Sanders give a major speech on discrimination in a city like St. Louis or Cincinnati.
Sanders's inner circle did not respond.
As Sanders prepares to announce another run for the White House as early as this week, his weak track record with black voters — a vital base in the Democratic Party — could be a potential threat to his candidacy.
Dissatisfaction among black staff members on the 2016 campaign was reported at the time, including by Fusion. But fresh interviews show that many former black employees still feel frustrated that they were not taken seriously or provided the resources they needed to succeed, even though some continue to admire Sanders.
Sanders appears committed to strengthening ties with the black community since his loss to Clinton.
He has made multiple trips to the South, and last month he spent Martin Luther King Day in South Carolina, where he spoke at the Capitol and met with black leaders, elected officials, and students.

Disgraced ex-congressman is released from prison
Disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner has been released from federal prison after being convicted of having illicit online contact with a 15-year-old girl in 2017.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons website shows the 54-year-old New York Democrat is currently in the custody of its Residential Re-entry Management office in Brooklyn.
It's not immediately clear when Weiner was transferred and where he's staying now, but Weiner will have to register as a sex-offender and spend three years on supervised release under the terms of his sentence.
The prison bureau, federal prosecutors in New York, and Weiner's lawyer didn't respond to e-mails seeking comment Sunday.
Weiner began serving a 21-month prison sentence at the Federal Medical Center Devens, located in Ayer, in November 2017.
The bureau website shows Weiner is slated to complete his sentence May 14, a few months earlier than scheduled because of good conduct in prison.

Ex-Maine governor spent $22K on Trump hotel stays
Documents obtained by a Maine newspaper show the state's former Republican governor and his staff spent at least $22,000 in public money at a hotel owned by the family of President Trump.
The Portland Press Herald reported Sunday that former governor Paul LePage and staff paid for more than 40 rooms at Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., over a two-year period. The newspaper reported that documents it obtained show the administration paid from $362 to more than $1,100 a night for rooms at the luxury hotel when in D.C. to meet with Trump or conduct other business.

Trump says he found 'real Collusion' — in 'SNL' skit
President Trump has gotten ahead of Special Counsel Robert Mueller III's investigation, making one thing clear: There was collusion.
Well, on "Saturday Night Live," at least.
In a Sunday morning tweetstorm, Trump blasted the previous night's episode of "SNL," which opened with Alec Baldwin portraying the commander-in-chief declaring a national emergency at the southern border — and quickly drew fire from the ACLU and Baldwin himself.
And, like before, Trump said without much explanation that the show is a coordinated attempt by NBC at character assassination.
"Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution?" Trump said on Twitter. "Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real Collusion!"
Mueller's investigation and recent court decisions have found that at least four former Trump aides allegedly have lied about contacts with Russians during the 2016 election.
"SNL's" skit skewered Trump's Friday news conference: "Wall works, wall makes safe," Baldwin-as-Trump said. "You don't have to be smart to understand that — in fact, it's even easier to understand if you're not that smart."
That apparently got under Trump's skin, as Baldwin's performances often have.

Texto completo: Hi. I'm Steve Lohr. I write about the technology industry, from the old titans like IBM to start-ups working on the future of artificial intelligence.
In this week's newsletter, we're largely taking a break from the consumer internet giants, and the various controversies swirling around them. (Exception: Amazon's surprise announcement on Thursday to abandon its plans to build a headquarters in New York. See below.)
Instead, we're going to look at recent research and reports that track how digital technology is moving into mainstream industries, and the implications.
Let's start with a smart piece this week by my colleague Erin Griffith, "The Next Wave of 'Unicorn' Start-Ups." Erin asked CB Insights, a research firm that studies start-ups and venture capital, to create a list of the next wave of young companies likely to reach valuations of $1 billion or more. She then reported on some of the 50 companies.
The first round of well-known unicorns, led by Uber and Airbnb, she writes, exploited smartphones and cloud computing to upend old-line businesses. The next companies poised to become unicorns are going narrower, deeper and into more fields.
"They largely focus on software," she writes, "for specific industries like farms, banks and life sciences companies."
That kind of broad-based adoption across the nation's $20 trillion economy is what will deliver growth and higher living standards for many. Yet the advance of data-driven artificial intelligence will also provide real-world evidence of how much and how quickly this technology may widen income disparities and kill jobs.
The short answer, it seems, is not as fast as techno-pessimists fear. A.I.'s progress is impressive, but limited. An article this week by Cade Metz, "A.I. Shows Promise Assisting Physicians," underlines that point.
The piece describes an A.I. research program whose accuracy matched or slightly surpassed human physicians in diagnosing common childhood diseases like influenza. The software was trained on the medical histories, lab tests and other clinical data in more than 600,000 electronic health records of children in southern China.
It was an encouraging demonstration. But the experimental system relied on the easy access to personal data in China, where privacy regulations are less restrictive, and was confined to diagnosing common ailments.
That step-by-step approach is the counsel for business in a new book by Thomas Davenport, "The AI Advantage: How to Put the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to Work" (MIT Press). Mr. Davenport, a professor of information technology and management at Babson College, is a seasoned expert in using digital data to streamline operations and spot opportunities. And he's been at it since well before the current A.I. wave, which is both a technological evolution and a branding craze.
His advice to mainstream companies is that the best course is often to use basic A.I. tools to automate mundane office tasks in operations like accounting, billing, payments and customer service -- and to avoid "moon shots."
One of Mr. Davenport's prime examples of a misguided moon shot was IBM's initial efforts to apply its Watson technology to diagnosing cancer. That was a high-profile science project that proved more difficult, time-consuming and costly than anticipated, though IBM continues that work with several leading cancer centers.
Speaking of IBM, the company was out in San Francisco this week for its annual Think conference, which attracted more than 25,000 attendees. Its executives presented its Watson and cloud technology as the trusted path for companies across the industrial spectrum that want to embrace A.I.
IBM cannot compete head-on with Amazon, Microsoft and Google in the big-spending game of building out massive data centers to provide the infrastructure layer of cloud computing to one and all. So it is seeking to shift the competition.
IBM talks about "chapter two" in the cloud market. Increasingly, it says, companies will run not only new applications but also their legacy software on the cloud, either private clouds in their own data centers or on IBM's cloud. The next stage of cloud computing, Virginia Rometty, IBM's chief executive, told Jon Fortt of CNBC, "is going to be driven by the modernization of mission-critical apps. That's our sweet spot."
And in a nod to reality, IBM announced a Watson Anywhere initiative: Its A.I. technology will run on the popular clouds of Amazon, Microsoft or Google as well as IBM's cloud.
In other news:
■ J. David Goodman, City Hall reporter for The Times, deftly explained the shifting politics before Amazon withdrew its plan in "Why Amazon Is Caught in an Unexpected Brawl in New York."
But what happened in Queens is part of a broader resistance to the tech boom, and its consequences. After the protests surfaced last year, Fred Wilson, the dean of New York venture capitalists, told me that "it's partly from a sense that Amazon coming in is not going to help them, and will only drive up their costs. To really be a success in New York, the benefits of the tech sector have to extend to every borough and every neighborhood."
That concern, across the country, as A.I. technology marches ahead, is the subject of a lengthy analysis this week by Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
■ For a rich, enlightening read, I recommend a piece in this week's New York Times Magazine, "The Secret History of Women in Coding." The "secret" is a headline writer's exaggeration. Anyone with an interest in computing history knows about Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper and the women who programmed the early Eniac computer. Those stories have been told repeatedly, including in books.
But Clive Thompson, the author, elegantly weaves that history around the story of an early female programmer who is alive and recalls it all. His piece captures what it was like in the 1940s through early 1960s, when writing software was a wide-open field, before a male-dominated culture took root.
As Lois Haibt -- who in 1955, as a freshly minted Vassar College graduate, joined the IBM team that created Fortran, the first popular programming language -- once told me: "They took anyone who seemed to have an aptitude for problem-solving skills -- bridge players, chess players, even women."

Socialism already affects America

Texto completo: President Donald Trump was principled and politically astute to address, in his State of the Union, the horrors taking place now in Venezuela, and then to declare:
"Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country."
Venezuela is indeed a poster child for what happens when a nation's economic machinery falls under political control.
Over the last five years, per The Wall Street Journal, Venezuela's economy shrank by 35 percent and poverty tripled from 48 to 87 percent.
According to Gallup, 71 percent of Venezuelans say they can't afford food, 47 percent say they can't afford shelter, just 15 percent say they are satisfied with the availability of quality health care, and 35 percent say they are satisfied with their standard of living.
Thirty-six percent of Venezuelans, 51 percent of those between 15 and 29, say they would leave the country permanently if they could.
But if it is so clear that socialism is a formula for economic disaster, why does the idea still conjure up support?
In a Gallup poll of last year, 57 percent of Democrats, compared to 16 percent of Republicans, say they have a "positive view of socialism."
Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman says it's semantics.
Krugman mocks Trump, saying that "there is essentially no one in American political life who advocates such things" as government control of industry, as is the case in Venezuela.
When Democrats say "socialism," says Krugman, they really mean "social democracy" -- a market economy with a social safety net and use of the tax system as an equalizer.
The issue really isn't how we technically define socialism. The issue is really the extent to which we are free.
What difference is it really if a firm is privately owned, but the government has vast latitude to regulate what it does? Or if a private firm pays me but government taxes away a large chunk of what I earn?
Venezuela is, of course, the extreme case. Total collapse as a result of political despots taking over everything.
But socialism is not like good wine, which, in moderation, might not hurt and might even be beneficial.
Every step in which economic freedom is cut back bears costs.
We see what is happening now, as the U.S. economy surges back to life as a result of cutting back regulation and taxes.
But our nation has not totally escaped the Venezuelan phenomenon.
America has entire communities in distress for the same reasons that Venezuela has fallen apart -- political control over economic affairs. Life in our poor communities is in the grip of socialism, not capitalism.
Government housing, government health care, government schools, government welfare programs.
There are 31 million people living in areas of high economic distress, now designated as "opportunity zones." The average poverty rate in these zones is 28.7 percent. The average household income is 40 percent below the national average, and 36.5 percent of prime-age adults are not working. Fifty-six percent of these 31 million are non-white minorities.
The president's new opportunity zone initiative, providing tax incentives to direct investment capital into these neighborhoods, aims to change realities with the same passion that the president spoke against socialism for the rest of the country in his State of the Union address.
How do countries wind up going in the wrong direction?
British playwright George Bernard Shaw captured it when he said, "A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul."
Political demagogues tap into the frustrations of those who are struggling, or tap into the ambitions of those who long for power, and sell them Hollywood dreams -- and lies -- of a better life. Once they convince them to turn over power, the nightmare begins.

It wasn’t for the treason. It was for the ‘deals’

Texto completo: For the Valley News
“The Art of the Deal” is the title of the best-selling book claimed by President Donald Trump but written by Tony Schwartz. Schwartz, a sharp critic of Trump, alleges that Trump neither contributed much to the manuscript nor, by all evidence, even read it. The publisher, former Random House head Howard Kaminsky, said, “Trump didn’t write a postcard for us!”
Nonetheless “our” president parlayed the myth into a paper fortune, adding glitter to his “brand” and eventually leading to the celebrity status that took him to the White House.
His latest artful deal is the negotiation over his wall. First, the Mexicans would pay for it. Then the latest trade deal would pay for it. Such “deals” never materialized, so he held the nation hostage, shutting down the government for the longest stretch in history and causing incalculable suffering to millions of families. Artful indeed.
Yielding to pressure, Trump re-opened the government by signing a short-term spending bill and gave a bipartisan conference committee several weeks to come up with a “deal” that would fund his wall — or else. Last week, the committee proposed legislation that fell far short of funding his wall.
Remarkably, the portion of the appropriation designated for “the wall” (about 50 miles of fence) is less than the offer made before the initial shutdown.
Here’s my best analogy: You’re offered a promotion at the college where you serve on the faculty. The dean promises a salary of $65,000, an increase of $5,000 over your current pay.
You have tenure and can’t be fired except for cause, so you set your jaw, stomp your feet and boycott classes for a month, causing your students to lose a semester’s credit.
You appeal to the Faculty Senate’s grievance committee, which conducts a binding arbitration hearing to resolve the dispute. The committee recommends to the dean that your salary be set at $55,000, an effective cut of 10 percent. You grudgingly accept, declaring that you’ll make it up with “other work.” So much winning.
Everything this man touches turns to fool’s gold.
The week offered additional hints of the ongoing Mueller investigation and a remarkable New York Times story reporting conversations in May 2017 among the highest ranking justice department officials about pressing for a 25th Amendment removal of Trump from office. Several weeks ago, the Times and others reported on a contemporaneous FBI investigation into the breathtaking possibility that Trump was an agent for the Kremlin.
So how are these elements of the Trump saga related?
Trump repeatedly denies “collusion” and any effort to obstruct justice. I believe him.
That’s not to say that there was no collusion or that justice has not been obstructed. But in his narcissistic bubble, a lifetime of artful dealing has been perfectly legal and he is genuinely stunned that he is under investigation. That’s because he has always functioned precisely this way — skirting the rules, bending the truth, manipulating the press, and consorting with low-life con men and shady operators. As did his father.
What we have here is a profoundly unscrupulous operator, not a traitor or a spy. He doesn’t have the courage, the ideological conviction or the competence to be a traitor or a spy.
Trump has been supported by Russians because he has no credit anywhere else. It’s just a “deal.” He wanted to build a tower in Moscow and needed financing and political approval from the Kremlin and Kremlin associates. Running for president was incidental. The Russians helped him win, but he only knew a bit of the scheme on the periphery and surely was not sophisticated enough to see it as anything more than another “deal.”
Paul Manafort joined the campaign because his desperate interests overlapped with Trump’s desire for a “deal.” Manafort wanted the sanctions lifted because he was paid millions by oligarchs to make it happen, and he needed the money. Trump didn’t and doesn’t care about the sanctions, except to the extent that lifting them would help him consummate his “deal” and protect any scrutiny of money laundering related to various other “deals.”
Former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Manafort deputy Rick Gates, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and others, like Trump business associate Felix Sater and Trump’s greedy children, were in on the “deals” for self-enrichment, not treason.
But, as Manafort, Cohen and others are discovering, entering into a “deal” with Donald Trump is risky business. Ask the hundreds of creditors who have been stiffed by the oft-bankrupted phony. The difference now is that an entire nation is at risk because of this artless, feckless dealer.
You may remember Trump’s repeated use of the snake parable in the 2016 campaign. Here’s a CliffsNotes version: Kind person takes in beleaguered snake. Snake eventually bites kind person. Kind person expresses surprise. Snake responds, “You knew I was a snake when you took me in.”
The only surprise is that anyone is surprised.

Texto completo: Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe says President Trump pressured Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein into mentioning Russia in the memo the president cited as justification to fire FBI Director James Comey in May 2017.

"Rod was concerned by his interactions with the president, who seemed to be very focused on firing the director and saying things like, 'Make sure you put Russia in your memo.' That concerned Rod in the same way that it concerned me and the FBI investigators on the Russia case," McCabe, who briefly became acting FBI director after Comey's ouster, told "60 Minutes" in an interview that aired on CBS Sunday evening.

"If Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein listed the Russia investigation in his memo to the White House, it could look like he was obstructing the Russia probe by suggesting Comey's firing," he added. "And by implication, it would give the president cover."

Rosenstein did not include Russia in that memo, despite the president's insistence that it be there. The memo instead focused on the "mistakes" Comey made in handling the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's unauthorized email server. But the president made the connection anyway during an interview with NBC a couple days later, saying the “Russia thing” was a factor in firing Comey.

McCabe, who is on a media tour for his upcoming book, attributed this as one of the factors informing his decision to order an obstruction of justice investigation into Trump. A second reason was Trump's private conversation with Comey, described in memos Comey wrote and leaked to the media, in which the president asked his then-FBI director to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. A third reason McCabe listed was Trump reportedly telling Russian officials visiting the White House that firing "nut job" Comey relieved "great pressure."

"Put together, these circumstances were articulable facts that indicated that a crime may have been committed. The president may have been engaged in obstruction of justice in the firing of Jim Comey," McCabe said, adding later, "So all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder is there an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia?"

In his memoir due out next week, "The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump," McCabe wrote Rosenstein spiraled into rage and paranoia after Trump ordered him to write the memo. Eight days after Comey was fired, Rosenstein appointed special counsel Robert Mueller to lead the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The account in McCabe's book about Rosenstein echoes reporting by the New York Times that focused on the struggle the deputy attorney general went through in the days after Comey was fired. Although Rosenstein told Congress that same month he “stand[s] by” the controversial memo he wrote, he privately lamented how the ordeal tarnished his reputation. Rosenstein was “shaken,” “unsteady,” and “overwhelmed,” one person who spoke with Rosenstein told the paper. Another source said he was "frantic, nervous, upset and emotionally dis-regulated."

A Justice Department spokeswoman offered a different explanation for why Rosenstein was upset, pinning the blame on McCabe for not informing him of memos Comey wrote outlining conversations he had with Trump. “To be clear, he was upset not because knowledge of the existence of the memos would have changed the [deputy attorney general's] decision regarding Mr. Comey, but that Mr. McCabe chose not to tell him about their existence until only hours before someone shared them with The New York Times,” DOJ's Sarah Isgur Flores told the Times.

McCabe was fired on March 16, 2018, less than two days before he planned to retire on his 50th birthday and collect a full pension, after the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General determined that he misled investigators about the role he had in leaking information to the Wall Street Journal in October 2016 about the investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In April, it was revealed that the Justice Department IG had referred its findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges while McCabe is mulling whether to sue the government to get his pension back.

New California law should become law in West Virginia, too

Texto completo: California is known for being first in many trends that become national, but let's hope their new law that went into effect Jan. 1, is adopted by other states, including West Virginia. Pet stores that brought their owners big profits and were outlets for puppy-mill puppies will find themselves in legal trouble if they continue.
It's now illegal to sell any pet in California unless the animal is from a shelter or rescue. You read that correctly ... only pets from shelters and rescues may now be sold in all California pet stores.
Pets in California pet stores must now be procured directly from shelters or nonprofit rescues. Breeders and cruel puppy mills are no longer able to wholesale their animals through any California retail pet store.
This is a good law and must be adopted by other jurisdictions. The majority of retail pet stores in California have already shifted to the "humane model familiar to patrons of such stores as Healthy Spot, who's owner, Andrew Kim, gave compelling testimony in the Assembly and Senate hearings in support of the bill.
In his testimony, Kim said, "Now banning an outdated business practice of selling pets will positively impact our community, reduce overcrowding in the shelters and provide more adoption options through rescue partners. Making [Assembly Bill] 485 the law was the right and smart business decision for California so that our pets, businesses and communities can benefit.
The California Animal Control Directors Association applauded then-Gov. Jerry Brown's signing of the Pet Rescue and Adoption Act, AB 485, and believes that the restriction of the retail sale of dogs, cats and rabbits in pet shops to only those that come from shelters or rescue organizations will decrease the demand for these animals bred in commercial mills and increase the adoption of animals from animal shelters.
Henry Brzezinski, CACDA'S legislative chairman, said, "This law will further aid animal welfare agencies in their mission to save more lives.
The bill's author, assembly member Patrick O'Donnell from Long Beach, said in a statement to the Orange County Register, "This is a big win for our four-legged friends, of course. But also for California taxpayers who spend more than $250 million annually to house and euthanize animals in our shelters. I am very grateful for the strong support we received from animal-lovers across the state and from Social Compassion in Legislation.
O'Donnell has two rescue dogs and said the bill and the issue were "very personal to him.
Pet advocates everywhere need to pay close attention to the fact that we have the ability to get legislation passed to protect pets, to support worthy rescues or your local shelter and to become a loud voice for the welfare of animals.
Most shelters are noisy, uncomfortable places despite the best efforts of the staff. They are overwhelmed by the number of animals they receive and, as California has shown the country, there is a better way to handle this.
Mike Bober, president of the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council and member of the California Assembly, told the Orange County Register, "Assembly Bill 485 reverses California's tradition of leading the nation in pet and consumer protections. It also strips consumers of many pet store protections, risks hundreds of jobs and reduces pet choice.
Bober is ignoring the fact that the bottom line of any commercial operation, including pet stores, is profit. They might obey the California laws regarding vaccinations and health regulation for animals in their stores, but they often do not do home visits or take any other safeguards to make sure the pet was being sold to a responsible owner.
This law is expected to effectively decrease the number of pets in shelters who don't get adopted. California is the first state to have this law that governs commercial pet stores.
A senior vice president for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Daphna Nachminovitch, spoke to The New York Times before the bill was signed, echoing support and a major criticism of the bill: "There is no doubt that this will help cut down on the number of animals who go into animal shelters.
The main criticism of the bill is what she said: "Nothing in this bill stops people from purchasing an animal from a private breeder.
California and other states considering this legislation must look at revising laws that govern commercial breeders, perhaps limiting the number of litters permitted and rules governing the background checks of purchasers.
Violators of the Pet Rescue and Adoption Act face penalties of up to $500 per animal. Pets need protection, and our shelters are overcrowded and couldn't operate without many private rescues that pull animals from shelter facilities to find forever homes for them.
If you own a pet store, profit must not be your main goal. Protection of the pet and ensuring it is going to a kind and decent home is the goal of pet placement, be it from shelters, stores or private rescues.
As the "mom of two adopted dogs, I shudder to think where they might have ended up. I also think of what I would have missed out on had I not adopted them. This is a good law, and concerned animal groups in West Virginia should read it and contact their state representative about implementing it here.

Amazon Fiasco Splits New York's Left; Not every city Democrat is an antibusiness progressive like Bill de Blasio and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Texto completo: From 30,000 feet, Amazon's abandonment of its proposed new headquarters in New York City might seem a chance, as Bostonian snobs like to put it, for the light to dawn on Marblehead.
Slathering on tax abatements and infrastructure promises to lure new development may be irresistible for communities but is always a second-best idea. For New York it was especially unnecessary given all the city's attractions. The city would be better off giving all businesses a tax cut.
But the eagerness of certain progressives to celebrate the loss of Amazon jobs as a triumph of "the people" is a chance to see things in new light.
One newly enlightened resident of Marblehead, since retiring his 2020 presidential hopes, is Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Unlike some of his allies, Mr. Cuomo hasn't been backpaddling to get on the right side of the left after the Amazon fiasco.
Compare this to Mayor Bill de Blasio, as much an architect of the Amazon deal as Mr. Cuomo was. Now he says: "We gave Amazon the opportunity to be a good neighbor and do business in the greatest city in the world. Instead of working with the community, Amazon threw away that opportunity."
Here Mr. de Blasio echoes an emergency talking point adopted by many liberals last seen mau-mauing the company for accepting a deal proffered by liberals. Suddenly they're not so sure they want credit for the forfeited jobs and tax revenues. Solution: Blame the company for letting their over-the-top rhetoric drive it away.
Do they have half a point? Maybe. Amazon obviously holds to a mind-set native to much of America: A deal is a deal. A handshake settles matters. It's not a signal for a new negotiation, complete with vilification of Amazon for agreeing to the terms you just put before it.
But New York is New York. It would have meant overcoming some bad blood but Jeff Bezos could have done worse than consult a certain Donald Trump, an expert in New York-style bargaining who has been through the rigadoon many times with the city himself.
He might have advised Mr. Bezos: Put on a plastic grin. Let the ninnies have their shriek. Hey, there's no such thing as bad press in New York. And be open to some adjustment here and there, for which you can expect to receive down-low compensation in the future once the storm has passed.
Mr. Bezos might have been wise to entertain such advice since he's in danger of dominating the news lately in more ways than are desirable. But then we'd be missing something salutary: an explosion of genuine and vociferous debate among Democrats in one-party New York. It almost sounds like democracy coming alive.
If there's a downturn between now and 2020, possibly even the U.S. Congress might have to do without the services of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, now bragging about her success in killing Amazon jobs. How she became the representative of a community that needs opportunity and economic development more than it needs campus lefty attitudinizing was always a bit of a mystery. Except for her ethnic background, she doesn't fit the district that propelled her to overnight stardom. I bet many of the area's residents, as they assess what her latest coup has cost them, are starting to feel the same way.
Our strange new respect for Mr. Cuomo has its limits, but he has allowed himself lately to notice that New York state's high taxes are a deterrent to business. They drive high-earning taxpayers away. He finds it convenient to blame Mr. Trump for accentuating the problem by limiting the deductibility of state and local taxes. But being able to shift some of the cost of New York's punitive tax rates to other states hardly proved a solution to upstate's long economic decline.
In a pungent statement on the governor's own website, Mr. Cuomo not only acknowledged New York's fiscal unattractiveness and the reality of tax competition with other states. He skewered the disingenuous and just plain dumb critics who portrayed his Amazon deal as a net giveaway when Amazon would have brought New York $9 in tax revenues for every $1 in tax relief it enjoyed.
The governor especially unloaded on the New York Times, which has its own sterling history of extorting tax breaks and zoning exceptions from the city and state.
The world would be a better place, and New York would do better by its long-suffering job creators, if it spent less time dishing out favors to a handful of big-name companies. Political capital could be more intelligently employed making the state and city hospitable to businesses of all kinds, especially the smaller businesses that create most jobs.
You could possibly even have that debate once you thin out a political class for which progressive sloganeering is a weightier reality than the jobs and incomes and personal welfare of millions of citizens.

Words give new meaning to deception

Texto completo: You could always slight the very rich by calling them moneybags, robber barons, fat cats or plutocrats. Billionaire was a neutral word, grounded in math: Such a person could spend $10 million a year, for 100 years, before the pile was gone.
Then came Howard Schultz, a billionaire times two, insisting that people not use the B-word in describing him. Better to refer to the 540 Americans in his sensitive class as "people of means." For this he was roundly mocked, and rightly so.
The pushback to the pusher of our favorite South American drug is a fair start. But there is much more to clean up. For we live in a time when language has been weaponized for high crimes and petty cruelties, while neutralized when it should state the obvious. Democracy may die in darkness, as the slogan of a newspaper has it, but it also slips away under cover of euphemism.
You can date it to Republican repackaging of the estate tax as a "death tax," or tax cuts for the rich morphing into "tax relief" for the overly burdened. And were French fries really "freedom fries" during a spasm of faux-patriotism?
Maybe the food marketers started us down this road when "natural" was slapped onto any label - turpentine, for example, which also happens to be gluten-free. Or Big Pharma, using "wellness" to describe treatment by drugs with names from a dance party: Lyrica, Celebrex, and then the Cialis gets passed around.
All of that can be excused as framing to get an advantage. The Democrats are doing it now with the Green New Deal and Medicare for All.
We all know about "alternative facts" and "truth isn't truth" and "fake news" - used by the Trump administration to describe reality. But less attention has been paid to this government's description of cages for young children separated from their parents. The Trump administration has invented "tender age" shelters to defend the indefensible. It sounds so caring.
And Donald Trump is downgrading "national emergency" from something that comes with a siren for a soundtrack to just another term for cheap political expediency.
It used to be a big deal for a reputable news organization to flat out call the president a liar. Now, liar must be the most-used descriptor linked to this president.
The word "socialist" is back in play. This term also used to sting, evoking Cold War authoritarians and empty store shelves. 
If used to describe help for the elderly, subsidized college or affordable health care, socialist is a net plus. If it implies total government control without choice, it's a loser. We've only just begun the modern reframing of this power word.
At the White House, "executive time" is the bogus term for the majority of the president's day spent watching Fox News hosts praise him, tweeting insults or playing virtual golf in the new room-sized simulator just installed in the house where Lincoln slept. Kramer did more work in the "Seinfeld" episode where he pretended to have a job.
The border "wall" is a "complexifier," to use the odd word that multibillionaire Jeff Bezos introduced, but also central to Trumpian Newspeak. 
In a masterstroke of up-is-down, Trump's rally in El Paso last week switched the "Build the Wall" slogan of his cult to "Finish the Wall." Trump keeps weaseling out of his wall promise by changing the wording - a fence, a barrier, some German shepherds.
The language is crucial here, because it's the central lie of his presidency. Like Schultz, Trump wants to use his own verbal wallpaper to cover the truth.

Texto completo: Over the past generation, global capitalism has produced the greatest reduction in human poverty in history. Over the past 10 years, American capitalism has produced 20 million new jobs. The productive dynamism of capitalism is truly a wonder to behold.
But economic growth alone is not enough. Growth alone does not translate into economic security for the middle class and the less skilled. Growth alone does nothing to reverse the social decay afflicting communities across America.
This reality is transforming the political debate - and shifting everything leftward. Among conservatives there are now a bevy of thinkers who are trying to find ways to use government to reduce inequality, promote work and restore community.
For example, in the lead essay of the conservative journal National Affairs, Abby M. McCloskey notes that the family you are born into and the neighborhood you live in have a much stronger influence on your socioeconomic outcome than any other factors. Her essay is an outstanding compendium of proposals designed to strengthen family and neighborhood.
Pell grants could be used to pay for vocational and apprenticeship training and not just for college. The federal government could support a voluntary national service program by paying people, once in their lifetime, to work for a year at a local nonprofit. The tax code could be tweaked so that people with no income tax liability could receive a cash credit for making charitable donations.
These proposals are activist but humble. It's not the federal government centrally deciding how to remake your community. It's giving communities and people the resources to take responsibility and assume power for themselves.
As many conservatives have shifted leftward, so have progressives. From Bill Clinton through Barack Obama, Democrats respected market forces but tried to use tax credits and regulations to steer them in more humane ways. Obamacare was an effort to expand and reform private health insurance markets.
That Democratic Party is ending. Today, Democrats are much more likely to want government to take direct control. This is the true importance of the Green New Deal, which is becoming the litmus test of progressive seriousness. I don't know if it is socialism or not socialism - that's a semantic game - but it would definitely represent the greatest centralization of power in the hands of the Washington elite in our history.
The resolution is unabashed about this, celebrating and calling for more "federal government-led mobilizations." Under the Green New Deal, the government would provide a job to any person who wanted one. The government would oversee the renovation of every building in America. The government would put sector after sector under partial or complete federal control: the energy sector, the transportation system, the farm economy, capital markets, the health care system.
The authors liken their plan to the New Deal, but the real parallel is to World War II. It is the state mobilizing as many of society's resources as possible to wage a war on global warming and other ills. The document is notably coy about how all this would be implemented.
But the underlying faith of the Green New Deal is a faith in the guiding wisdom of the political elite. The authors of the Green New Deal assume that technocratic planners can master the movements of 328 million Americans and design a transportation system so that "air travel stops becoming necessary." 
They assume that congressional leaders have the ability to direct what in effect would be gigantic energy firms and gigantic investment houses without giving sweetheart deals to vested interests, without getting corrupted by this newfound power, without letting the whole thing get swallowed up by incompetence. (This is a Congress that can't pass a budget.)
If this were ever put into practice, there would have to be several new Pentagons built to house the hundreds of thousands of new social planners. The elite universities would have to be transformed into technocratic academies in which the children of the rich were trained so they could be dirigistes for the state.
The authors of this fantasy are right that we need to do something about global warming and inequality. But simple attempts to realign incentives, like the carbon tax, would be more effective and more realistic than government efforts to reorganize vast industries.
In an alienated America, efforts to decentralize power are more effective and realistic than efforts to concentrate it in the Washington elite. The great paradox of progressive populism is that it leads to elitism in its purist form.
The impulse to create a highly centralized superstate recurs throughout U.S. history. There were people writing such grand master plans in the 1880s, the 1910s, the 1930s. They never work out. As Richard Weaver once put it, the problem with the next generation is that it hasn't read the minutes of the last meeting.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Pope Francis defrocks Theodore McCarrick, ex-cardinal accused of sex abuse

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Former cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s rise through the Catholic Church hierarchy, during which he established a reputation as a globe-trotting human rights advocate before being brought down by sex abuse scandals, began as an altar boy in New York City.
McCarrick, who this weekend became the highest-ranking cleric to be defrocked by the Vatican, worked his way up over several decades to the highest circles of church leadership, despite awareness among the hierarchy of his suspect behavior, including sleeping with adult seminarians.
McCarrick’s past finally caught up with him last summer, when Pope Francis removed him as a cardinal after a U.S. church investigation determined that an allegation that he had fondled a teenage altar boy in the 1970s was credible. The church also acknowledged that it had made previously undisclosed financial settlements with adults who accused McCarrick of sexual misconduct decades ago.
On Saturday, the Vatican announced that McCarrick, known within church circles as “Uncle Ted,” had been defrocked after officials found him guilty of soliciting sex while hearing confession and of sexual crimes against minors and adults.
The move punctuated a stunning fall from grace for the 88-year-old, who was ordained as a priest in 1958, became a bishop in 1981 and was named Archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, in 1986. In November 2000, he was tapped by Pope John Paul II to lead the Archdiocese of Washington.
“I wish I were a holier man, more prayerful, more trusting in God, wiser and courageous,” The New York Times quoted McCarrick as saying upon his appointment. “But here I am, with all my faults and all my needs, and we will work together.”
That same month, a New York priest, the Rev. Boniface Ramsay, informed the Vatican in a letter about McCarrick’s misconduct with seminarians from Seton Hall University’s Immaculate Conception Seminary. Ramsay, who was on the faculty at the seminary, has said he sent the letter at the request of the then-Vatican ambassador because he had heard so many complaints from students.
Nevertheless, just weeks after his formal installation as archbishop, McCarrick was elevated to the rank of cardinal, shortly after President Bill Clinton had presented him with the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights.
The son of a ship captain who died when McCarrick was 3, the disgraced cleric attended Catholic elementary school and Fordham Preparatory School and was ordained after earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees at St. Joseph’s Seminary in Yonkers, New York. He later earned a Ph.D. in sociology from The Catholic University of America in Washington, where he was given his first assignment as assistant chaplain and went on to serve as dean of students and director of development.
McCarrick later served as president of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, personal secretary to Cardinal Terence Cooke and auxiliary bishop of New York.
From 1986 through 2006, during his years as archbishop in Newark and Washington, McCarrick was one of the most influential church leaders in the U.S. McCarrick, who speaks five languages, twice headed the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Committee on Migration and traveled frequently overseas on trips devoted to human rights and foreign policy.
In 1988, he participated in an interfaith meeting with Cuban communist leader Fidel Castro aimed at encouraging religious freedom in Cuba. He also played a role in the Vatican-endorsed back-channel negotiations that led to the 2014 U.S.-Cuba detente.

Texto completo: The Trump Organization, citing the political climate, has shelved its prospects for two hotels in Mississippi, The New York Times reported Thursday.
The proposed four-star Scion hotel in Cleveland was expected to open by the end of the year. The hotel was originally slated to open in the fall of 2018.
A second line of hotels, called American Idea, were also expected to open later this year in Greenville, Cleveland and Clarksdale.
"Plans for the two hotel chains, Scion and American Idea, are to be shelved indefinitely, most likely for the remainder of the presidency," the New York Times reported.
Mississippi was the only state in the country where a Trump Organization hotel project was expected to come to completion, the Washington Post recently reported.
The hotels are a collaboration between the Trump Organization, now run by Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and Mississippi businessmen Dinesh and Suresh Chawla. The Chawlas, who own 18 hotels in Mississippi, planned to develop the hotels while the Trumps would brand and manage them.
In a statement about parting ways with the Chawlas, the Trump Organization left open the possibility of reviving the Scion and American Idea brands. Donald Jr. and Eric Trump praised the Chawlas and the would-be Scion property, predicting it would still be "an absolutely spectacular project," according to reporting by the Times.
Dinesh Chawla said his company plans to move forward on the hotels without the Trumps. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, and it is unclear whether the Trumps were required to compensate the Chawlas in some way for pulling out. In the joint statement, the Chawlas said, "We understand their position completely," according to the Times.
On his Facebook page, Chawla heaped praise on the Trump Organization and said the collaboration "never had any political discussions," adding "I never understood the media representation of these folks."
Since the Trumps were handed the company in 2016, it has become the target of federal court cases and lost deals in some markets after partners complained about the brand, the Washington Post reported.
Gov. Phil Bryant has shown public support for Trump and in February the state — through the Mississippi Development Authority — awarded a tax break worth up to $6 million for the Scion hotel project. The tax break would cover almost a third of the hotel development costs, according to building permits.
Several residents of Cleveland supported the Scion hotel development, believing it will lead to additional jobs and revenue for the town, but others said they wouldn't be able to afford to stay at the four-star hotel.

Arts &amp; Crafts takes stage at Grove Park

Texto completo: In 1900, the Arts and Crafts movement swept across the country — and right into Asheville's growing neighborhoods of Montford, Kenilworth, West Asheville, Norwood Park, and Grove Park.
Back then young middle-class couples began turning their backs on their parents' ornate Victorian homes and plush velvet furniture, preferring instead to buy a modest bungalow and fill it with practical Mission oak furniture. The new Arts and Crafts style took root in Asheville and continues to flourish, evidenced today by strong interest in those original bungalows, as well as in new bungalows being built for both young couples and retirees looking to downsize.
"Historic examples of bungalows were built in emerging residential neighborhoods and have continued to be well-loved and sensitively adapted by families ever since," said As Asheville architect Jane Mathews. "And many who have come to the mountains in recent years ask us to recreate new homes for their families. They want homes that embrace the character, charm, and livability of the many historic homes that established the mountain aesthetic standard of quality and comfort through the Arts and Crafts style."
About a quarter of the homes sold in the Asheville area last year were such bungalows, said Asheville Realtor Brad Puffer at Keller Williams Professionals.
"This style has seen a resurgence over the last 20 years as Asheville has grown in popularity and population," he said. "Custom home builders and spec builders alike recognize this architectural style as the distinctive style most characteristic of the area. Today, most new construction homes in Asheville have some Arts and Crafts influence in their design."
The opening of the Grove Park Inn in 1913 helped label Asheville as the Arts and Crafts capital of the South, a title which it proudly bears today. Each February for 32 years, the iconic resort hotel has hosted the National Arts and Crafts Conference and Shows, drawing more than 2,000 people from across the country and WNC to the three-day event. This year's is Feb. 15-17.
"Once area people began to recognize our architectural ties to the Arts and Crafts movement," conference director Bruce Johnson explained, "they began flocking to the afternoon selling shows, looking for handmade reproductions and original antiques for their homes."
"The shows each afternoon are the highlight of the weekend," Johnson continued. "We bring in more than 100 of the country's finest artisans and antiques dealers, all of whom are exhibiting works made during or influenced by the Arts and Crafts style. Here people will find both new and vintage Arts and Crafts style furniture, art pottery, tiles, textiles, lighting, jewelry, rugs, and artwork. In nearly every case they will be speaking with the actual craftsperson who handcrafted the piece."
A growing number of area artisans exhibit in the Arts and Crafts shows, including furniture maker Brian Brace, cabinetmaker Gregory Paolini, jeweler Amy Brandenburg, potters Julie Calhoun Roepnack, Hog Hill Pottery, and Clark House Pottery, interior designer Karen Hovde, and Grovewood Village.
Arts and Crafts Conference details The shows, which are open to the public, take place from 1-6 p.m. Friday, noon-6 p.m. Saturday, and 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Sunday. Admission is $10 for adults and $5 for students, and tickets are good for all three days. Outdoor parking at the Omni Grove Park Inn is free. Indoor garage parking is free for the first three hours. For more information, please go to Arts-CraftsConference.com.
The National Arts and Crafts Conference also serves as a major fundraiser for two area nonprofit organizations. The Preservation Society of Asheville and Buncombe County will again be offering historic house tours on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Like the conference shows, these are also open to the public, as space permits. For information and availability, please go to www.psabc.org.
The Asheville Art Museum will host a Saturday evening reception and presentation entitled "Women and American Art Pottery." It, too, is available to the public. For additional information, please go to ashevilleart.org.
"Thirty years ago, "Johnson recalled, "the New York Times called this 'the most important weekend of the year for Arts and Crafts collectors.' But you don't have to be a collector to enjoy this once-a-year experience. If you appreciate hand-craftsmanship in the popular Arts and Crafts style, this is an afternoon show you will never forget."
Over 100 vendors will be at the National Arts and Crafts Conference at the Grove Park Inn in Asheville this weekend.

To reduce money in politics, slash the size of government

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – Like a terrifying demon that returns during the final scene of a horror movie, campaign-finance reform is the “thing” that never goes away. The United States Supreme Court sometimes saves the day, as it did with the First Amendment-related Citizens United case in 2010. Yet reformers always have a new scheme to take “the money out of politics,” even though their last schemes always resulted in more cash influencing political campaigns.
The campaign-finance scaremongers are back with a symbolic bill that is a political poke-in-the-eye to the sleazy-seeming Trump administration. It could never pass the Senate or gain a presidential signature, but it makes a point. Now that they have a majority in the House, Democrats are pushing HR1, which Vox describes as a “sweeping anti-corruption measures aimed at stamping out the influence of money in politics and expanding voting rights.”
The voting-rights goal is doable because Congress has the power to loosen federal standards for voting. But only a delusional person would believe that lawmakers have the power to “stamp out” money in politics any more than they have the power to “stamp out” sexually transmitted diseases. Desire often outstrips good sense, which is why STDs and political spending are at record highs. People will work around any new hurdles placed in their way.
The problem — at least with political spending — is government, not rich people. Both political sides rail about the role of billionaires in our political system. The left fulminates about the Koch Brothers and right-wing “dark money” groups, whereas the right pounds the table about George Soros and left-leaning tech firms. However, a close look at lobbying spending in California offers some much-needed lessons on this hot-button topic.
The Sacramento Bee recently published an analysis of spending on government lobbying and found that it rose again last year. The total was $361 million, up 5 percent since 2017. It is far above the approximately $200 million spent on lobbying in 2002. One can easily conclude from these numbers — and from watching lobbyists swarm the Capitol — that something untoward is going on.
Nevertheless, those numbers need a little more perspective. The total 2017-2018 California state budget was $183.3 billion. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new budget proposal would spend $209.1 billion. In 2002-2003, the total state budget was $97.9 billion. Lobbying spending has gone up, but only in tandem with growth in state government spending. Lobbying dollars are small potatoes when you consider the total, well, potato pie.
Sure, stories are legion about legislators who won’t consider any proposal until they run it by the requisite lobbyist. Union leaders strut around the Capitol as if they own the place, because they pretty much do own the place. Lobbyists and trade groups of all type — unions, industry and activist groups — routinely write the language that becomes state law. Welcome to the real world. No finance reform can ever take the politics out of the political system.
Again, the problem is the size of government. Writing in National Review, Bradley Smith notes that Democratic lawmakers have proposed a Green New Deal “that would essentially abolish the aviation, auto, energy and mining industries, among others. Why is it illegitimate for shareholders and employees in those industries to voice their opinions on regulatory schemes that would leave them bankrupt and unemployed?” Good question.
Take a closer look at that California lobbying report. The top spender was Pacific Gas & Electric, which is a regulated monopoly utility whose continued existence could be dependent on how the Legislature decides to handle wildfire-related liabilities. The Western States Petroleum Association, a trade group that represents the highly regulated oil and gas businesses, is next on the list. Then there’s another regulated utility, Edison International, and the California State Council of Service Employees, which is a powerful labor union.
Reality check: Those groups whose existence is most dependent on the government are going to spend oodles on lobbying that government. Look at the lobbying categories, per the Bee. The biggest spender is government — mainly local governments influencing state government. Next is healthcare, which is a government-dependent industry. Then come utilities, which are government-granted monopolies. Also high on the list are insurance companies, where government has power to set rates, as well as manufacturers, education and labor unions.
Finance reformers are frustrated by the courts, but there’s that thing called the First Amendment. Spending is not speech per se. However, columnist George Will asked if The New York Times would be OK if it were free to write what it wanted, but if the government controlled “the amount it can spend on journalists, paper, ink, printing presses, delivery trucks, advertisements and so on.” You get the point.
Maybe we can all embrace a reform idea that would actually work: reducing the size and power of government. Sadly, that is the one idea that will frighten the kind of politicians and activists who support campaign-finance reform.

Don't make it easy for Trump to hide his failure

Texto completo: President Trump's regular threats to close down parts of the government to vindicate an applause line make you almost nostalgic for the shutdowns of the past.
When Sen Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pushed the government to a 16-day halt in 2013 in an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, at least he was fighting over something that mattered.
I said "almost" about that nostalgia because the closure Cruz championed was, from the beginning, a doomed tactical ploy for a wrongheaded objective. Josh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called Cruz's gambit "a toddler's version of legislating."
That Trump's fixation over a useless border wall looks even more juvenile than a preschooler's tantrum explains why Republicans, including McConnell, finally said "Enough!" to a president they had been coddling for fear of retaliation and in the pursuit of conservative dominance over the federal judiciary. This time, they told him he had to surrender his wall-funding dreams.
But the Republicans did not come to this realization entirely of their own accord. A little over a month ago, the same McConnell said he would not bring budget legislation to the floor that he knew the president would veto. The result was the 35-day shutdown.
McConnell did not reckon with the impact of Democratic control of the House of Representatives. With power in her hands, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, along with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, refused to accommodate a presidential objective they knew was phony and, worse, racist in its underlying motivation.
The president's proclivity to tweet or talk without much reflection was helpful on this front, too. On Sunday, he picked up on a Gallup Poll suggesting, as Trump put it, that "Open Borders will potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans."
So we know it's "Latin Americans" in general and not just those "criminals" he talks about whom Trump sees as the grave danger.
Trump's lost mojo with Senate Republicans creates a new playing field. Republicans can see what a 2020 thumping would look like in the nearly 10-million-vote margin Democrats won in the 2018 House races. They also learned from the price they paid for the last shutdown that they will be blamed for the president's shenanigans.
Noting Trump's recent statement that "we're building a lot of wall," The New York Times reported on Tuesday: "In fact, no new walls have been built or financed by Congress based on the prototypes that the Trump administration unveiled in October 2017. Projects to replace or repair about 40 miles of existing barriers have been started or completed since 2017."
But Democrats need to learn lessons from all this, too. First, they should stay tough. Second, they need to be disciplined.
This episode shows that standing up to Trump's worst instincts will pay rewards. Democrats forced Senate Republicans into a very old-fashioned conference committee that reached a budget deal in a very old-fashioned way because the legislators were operating in a largely Trump-free zone. This only happened because Democrats resisted calls to play Trump's game. "Comity" and "civility" are never achieved by capitulating to bullying and hostage-taking.
At the same time, the GOP, including Trump, is already signaling that its main goal is to pick up on the most adventurous proposals from Democratic legislators to pretend that Republicans are, against the evidence of the last two years, a mainstream bunch.
Dealing with this issue is much trickier. For the long run, it's useful for progressive Democrats to push the boundaries of the policy debate. But they should leave the incendiary tweets to Trump, keep the focus on his extremism, and legislate in areas where their party is united – political reform, voting rights, repairs to the health care system, protections for the Dreamers, and infrastructure.
Successful parties manage to do more than one thing at the same time. To keep the initiative, the Democrats need to show that they can master this essential political art.

Texto completo: Sherman Joseph Katz, 95, of West Hartford died February 11 surrounded by his loving family. He was predeceased by his beloved wife of 65 years, Phyllis (Sachs) Katz. He is survived by his two daughters and their spouses, Marjorie Katz and William Nicholson, of Sudbury, MA and Nancy and Donald Rossler of West Hartford; four grandchildren, Lindsey Nicholson and husband Andrew Beaton, Sara Nicholson and husband Benjamin Gammerman, Michael Rossler, Drew Rossler; and great-grandchildren Patrick and Robert Beaton. He was the son of the late Nathan and Elizabeth (Becker) Katz and brother of Jerome D. Katz.
Sherman attended Mount Hermon School for Boys. He served in the armed forces in World War II, where he received a purple heart. Upon returning from the war, he earned his MBA from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. He then joined his father and brother in the scrap metal business at Jacob A. Katz and Sons, founded by his great-grandfather. Later, he joined Suisman and Blumenthal, during which time he served as President of the Scrap Metal Institute.
He thoroughly enjoyed life, whether it be reading his New York Times daily, traveling the world, singing in the temple choir or starring in the PTA elementary school plays. In later years, when he and Phyllis were not attending opera, theater, symphonies, taking classes, participating in film club, golfing or playing bridge, he relished lounging by the pool in the Florida sun.
Sherman also made giving back to his community a priority. He helped Russian immigrants settle in the Hartford area, and volunteered at the Hebrew Home coffee shop and Saint Joseph's School for Young Children, where he was simply adored.
A service will be held Friday, February 15, 2019 at 10:30 AM at Congregation Beth Israel, 701 Farmington Ave., West Hartford with Rabbi Michael Pincus officiating. Calling hours will be Friday following the funeral service and Saturday evening 4-7 PM at the family home on Cliffmore Road.

Indy's pothole situation isn't as bad as last year

Texto completo: Indy's potholes are so bad, the two guys who took it upon themselves to fill potholes during last year's season have grown to a staff of dedicated volunteers that includes a legal team and a graphic artist.
They're so bad that Indy made The New York Times, which this week dubbed the city "one huge pothole."
But by one measure — about 10,000 road-repair requests since September and counting — they aren't as bad as last year.
"As of today, we have received over 2,000 fewer requests for this time frame than we did last year," Department of Public Works spokeswoman Charnay Pickett said Wednesday.
The number of road-repair requests doesn't necessarily reflect the number of reported potholes, which form when roadways expand and contract as temperatures fluctuate. But the decline could be the result of different weather patterns this season vs. last.
"There have been fewer temperature swings this winter than last," said Indianapolis National Weather Service meteorologist Kacie Hoover. "December was warmer, and we didn't really hit our deep freeze until January, whereas last year, we saw a longer stretch of at-zero around New Year's."
It's likely that there will be more temperature fluctuations before spring, Hoover said.
"It's just that time of year that it goes back and forth across that freezing line," she said.
Still, there are nearly 5,000 open pothole repair requests since Sept. 1, 2018, according to the city's official Indy Pothole Viewer. Public Works has responded to another 5,000 requests in that time. Each request could cover an area of road, instead of an individual pothole.
Since Jan. 1, Public Works crews have filledmore than 28,000 potholes citywide.
As soon as the weather is a little warmer and dryer, Pickett said, Public Works will begin milling long segments of pock-marked roadway and laying down all new asphalt, a process called strip-patching, along 17 stretches of road.
"It's a longer-lasting solution," Pickett said. "That will begin once we have the asphalt plants open."
The strip-patching won't only be for those 17 areas, Pickett said. It's a rolling list that will continue to grow as needed.
In late January, Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett announced in his 2019 transportation plan, which included $126 million for resurfacing 167 lane miles of road, among other road improvements. This move is part of a four-year, $400 million package to repair and rebuild Indy's roads and bridges.
A year ago, Public Works analyzed what it would take to repair 8,100 miles of lanes in need of repair, and estimated it would cost $732 million to bring the condition from a poor rating to fair, and $178 million annually for upkeep.

‘No first use' policy is a sound way to keep us safe

Texto completo: For the Monitor
I'm writing in response to a Feb. 11 opinion piece by Mike Moffett titled “ ‘No first use' policy increases likelihood of war.” Moffett says, “Many of us prefer to leave defense policy to longtime national security and military experts.” Indeed, we should hear what is being said by those experts.
People like former Secretary of Defense William Perry and former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. James Cartwright have both written extensively on the subject and believe that the need for a no-first-use policy is a necessary and time-sensitive step toward a safer world.
Cartwright and Bruce Blair wrote in an op-ed titled “End the first-use policy for nuclear weapons” in the New York Times in 2016. “Our non-nuclear strength, including economic and diplomatic power, our alliances, our conventional and cyber weaponry, and our technological advantages, constitute a global military juggernaut unmatched in history. The United States simply does not need nuclear weapons to defend its own and its allies' vital interests, as long as our adversaries refrain from their use.”
Blair and Cartwright continued, “We believe a no-first-use policy could catalyze multilateral negotiations to reduce nuclear arms, discourage non-nuclear states from developing them and reinforce the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.”
False alerts caused by weather balloons, flocks of geese and computer glitches have almost touched off nuclear wars over the past 50 years too many times for comfort. A public policy turning away from first use would calm the nerves of our global adversaries and keep diplomatic steps in place to keep us safe.
We are not in the midst of World War II and far from some Bolshevik conspiracy. A no-first-use policy, as prescribed in HCR 7, is a modest step toward addressing the very real threat of the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons. According to IPSOS polling, 62 percent of Republicans, 69 percent of independents and 75 percent of Democrats agree that “the U.S. should never be the first to use nuclear weapons.” The N.H. House and Senate ought to pass the bill expressing our state's support for no first use. It is the opinion of the experts, it is the preference of their constituents and it is just plain old sound policy.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump likes to say that he hires only the best people and that his White House operates like a well-oiled machine.
But a steady stream of insider accounts flowing out of the West Wing suggests that there's more madness than method to this administration.
The most recent entries are two books that just hit best-seller lists, one by former White House aide Cliff Sims, the other by ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a onetime Trump adviser.
Sims dishes about Oval Office back-stabbing in his explicitly titled "Team of Vipers." Christie's "Let Me Finish" laments Trump's choice of "amateurs, grifters, weaklings, convicted and unconvicted felons ... hustled into jobs they were never suited for."
The authors join a pantheon of disgruntled leakers or tattling ex-staffers telling tales of incompetence at the highest executive levels. Last week, someone handed Axios three months of Trump's daily schedule, revealing in mortifying detail how the president spends more than half of his workday in vague "executive time" activities.
The consistent, mounting evidence of internal dysfunction is growing increasingly difficult to ignore or to explain away. Remember, these accounts aren't coming from Democrats or anti-Trump pundits:
A senior Trump administration official, writing an anonymous column in The New York Times, characterized the president as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective," with decisions that are "half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless."
Bob Woodward, in his best-selling book "Fear," diagnosed a White House suffering a "nervous breakdown," with aides stealing papers off Trump's desk to deter bad policy. Former Chief of Staff John Kelly was quoted as saying: "We're in Crazytown."
"Fire and Fury" by Michael Wolff and "Unhinged" by Omarosa Manigault Newman, the ex-White House aide and former reality TV star, questioned the president's mental well-being.
Sprinkled throughout these tell-all tomes are unflattering assessments by top aides. Ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to Woodward, said Trump comprehends like a "fifth- or sixth-grader." And former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has never denied reports that he labeled Trump a "moron."
Trump and his supporters have questioned the credibility of some writers, or dismissed their accounts as sour grapes. But you have to wonder how so many aides who were hailed as brilliant choices on their way into the administration suddenly became incompetent hacks on their way out.
With more books in the pipeline, the Trump campaign is eager to try to enforce nondisclosure agreements signed by ex-staffers. What doesn't the White House want the public to know?
Trump administration insiders keep trying to warn the world that something is terribly awry. Americans ignore them at their peril.

BALLETNEXT at New York Live Arts (Feb. 19-22, 7:30 p.m.; through Feb. 23). In Salt Lake City, the University of Utah is home to a well-regarded ballet program where Michele Wiles, the artistic director of BalletNext, is a visiting professor. For her company's New York engagement, she has recruited some of the school's talented students to join her and guest artists such as Maria Kowroski and Amar Ramasar, in performing two works by the prolific Italian choreographer Mauro Bigonzetti. Wiles, a former principal dancer with American Ballet Theater, also contributes several new works of her own featuring live music, which includes a commissioned score from the jazz trumpeter Tom Harrell.

COMPLEXIONS CONTEMPORARY BALLET at the Joyce Theater (Feb. 19-20, 7:30 p.m.; through March 3). To mark its 25th anniversary, Complexions presents three programs over two weeks that highlight its brand of sharp, sultry ballet. The programs comprise new, revived and repurposed works by Dwight Rhoden, who founded and directs the troupe with the dancer Desmond Richardson. Program A features the New York premiere of "Bach 25," set to music by both J. S. Bach and his son C. P. E. Bach, as well as the return of "Star Dust," a tribute to David Bowie. Program B pairs the premiere of "Woke," a response to current politics, with "From Then to Now," a greatest-hits compilation from the company's repertory. A separate matinee program combines the compilation with the Bach piece.

MERCE CUNNINGHAM CENTENNIAL at Anthology Film Archives (Feb. 18, 7:30 p.m.). For the past six weeks, as part of this year's extensive celebrations of the centennial of Cunningham's birth (he died in 2009), the Anthology Film Archives has presented weekly screenings of his works. The final screening on Monday focuses on a 2005 film of "Biped," a 1999 piece that made imaginative use of computer-generated imagery and that Cunningham likened to "the feeling of switching channels on the TV." Alastair Macaulay, the former chief dance critic at The New York Times, called it "a triumphant outpouring of pure dance invention and a masterpiece of theatrical poetry," and will be on hand to introduce the film and participate in a post-screening Q. and A.

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
MIRO MAGLOIRE'S NEW CHAMBER BALLET at New York City Center Studio 5 (Feb. 18-19, 7:30 p.m.). In an upstairs studio that is part of the City Center complex, Magloire has long presented thoughtful, intimate ballets that he creates for live contemporary music. For this presentation, he introduces "Sanctum," a new work for six dancers that is meant to be viewed in the round and is set to music by Kaija Saariaho and Karin Rehnqvist. Two vocal sections, sung live by three members of the Ekmeles vocal ensemble, bookend instrumental selections from both composers. Preceding this work is a solo called "Morning Song" set to John Cage's "Cheap Imitation."

NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (through March 3). In the coming week, City Ballet's winter season belongs to Princess Aurora. Through Feb. 24, the company presents "The Sleeping Beauty" in a 1991 version by the former director Peter Martins, who followed a blueprint from the 19th-century master Marius Petipa (a section by George Balanchine made the cut, too). Over the next 10 days, several of City Ballet's top ballerinas embody the titular character in this streamlined, two-act production. Lilac Fairy aside, the true fairy godfather here is Tchaikovsky, whose enduring score many consider ballet's best.

ROCHA DANCE THEATER at John Jay College (Feb. 15, 8 p.m.). Jenny Rocha works simultaneously in contemporary dance and cabaret, directing both this company and a burlesque troupe called the Painted Ladies. In her new work "Half-Heard," supported by the CUNY Dance Initiative and John Jay College, she takes on gender stereotypes and satirizes social expectations of femininity. The costumes, which she designed, are fashionable and fantastical, with lots of lace and a hint of naughtiness.

Sandmann may face challenges in proving defamation

Texto completo: Does Nick Sandmann have a case against media outlets, celebrities and journalists?
The Covington Catholic High School junior is represented by a nationally recognized attorney, L. Lin Wood, who has experience in defamation lawsuits.
Wood told The Enquirer by email this week that the Sandmann family's legal team, which includes Northern Kentucky-based Todd McMurtry,is investigating outlets for more than potential defamation offenses.
Those who "intentionally joined a cybermob aimed at harassing and threatening a teenager have good reason to be legally concerned," Wood wrote.
He and Wood recently sent dozens of letters requesting national media outlets and figures preserve evidence such as internal emails for potential lawsuits. The Enquirer did not receive a letter.
Wood, in an email to The Enquirer, cited a U.S. Supreme Court decision, Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., as one that would bolster Nick's chances in court.
The court ruled in the case that "opinions that convey false facts, that imply the existence of undisclosed defamatory facts, or that are based upon false or incomplete facts are legally actionable," Wood wrote.
McMurtry divulged to The Enquirer an example of a false report that harmed Nick. He said some professed that Nick got into the face of Nathan Phillips, the Omaha tribe elder who stood across from Nick.
Two legal experts disputed that claim, telling The Enquirer it would likely fail in court because it is not a verifiable fact.
"That's really a perspective, a point of view," said David Marburger, a Cleveland-based attorney who spent decades representing outlets including CBS, CNN and the Associated Press. Those who bring an accusation of defamation stemming from a statement of opinion "will lose," he added.
Jon Fleischaker echoed him. The attorney, who represents the Louisville Courier-Journal and is general counsel for the Kentucky Press Association, said it is "set law under the Constitution" that a person or publication "cannot be held ... responsible for damages for statements of opinion. Because opinion is something that is not provable as a matter of fact."
Marburger said the Milkovich ruling only addresses the First Amendment. But the first consideration in a lawsuit will be state law.
He cited a 1999 Kentucky Supreme Court ruling that found "only provable false assertions of fact can provide the basis for a defamation action."
Marburger also said that case emphasized that generalized rhetorical exaggeration is protected speech.
He gave an analogy by describing the aftermath of the O.J. Simpson trial. Many wrote that Simpson was guilty of murder, Marburger said, but those statements were not libelous.
"The context is controlling, not only words but the overall expression," he said. "If it screams perspective, giving a point of view, screams, you know, rhetoric, hyperbole, criticism," it isn't defamatory."
But Wood wrote the team is also looking into additional possible offenses.
"As we analyze the mountain of false publications and statements about Nick," he wrote, "we will be looking at causes of action beyond defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress, including actions based on cyberbullying and assault."
Infliction of emotional distress claims accuse a defendant of engaging in conduct beyond the means of human decency while knowing doing so would cause distress in a plaintiff, Marburger said.
Defamation law distinguishes between public and private figures. Typically, public figures must prove whoever wrote or uttered a statement had prior knowledge that it was false or evidenced a reckless disregard for the truth, according to Fleischaker.
Fleischaker said potential defendants against Nick's attorneys would have a "legitimate argument" that Nick would qualify as a limited-purpose public figure, as he participated in a public protest and has sought publicity on his own.
Wood, who represented JonBenet Ramsey's brother in a $750 million defamation suit against CBS, called Nick a "private figure plaintiff."
Wood and McMurtry sent more than 50 preservation letters, requesting the recipients keep items such as drafts of stories, internal emails and other correspondence regarding Nick.
The following people or organizations were among those sent the letters, Nick's attorneys said:

Brief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen Hawking (non-fiction)
New York Times Bestseller. The world-famous cosmologist and author of "A Brief History of Time" leaves us with his final thoughts on the biggest questions facing humankind. Stephen Hawking was the most renowned scientist since Einstein, known both for his groundbreaking work in physics and cosmology and for his mischievous sense of humor. He educated millions of readers about the origins of the universe and the nature of black holes, and inspired millions more by defying a terrifying early prognosis of ALS, which originally gave him only two years to live. In later life he could communicate only by using a few facial muscles, but he continued to advance his field and serve as a revered voice on social and humanitarian issues. Now, as we face immense challenges on our planet – including climate change, the threat of nuclear war, and the development of artificial intelligence – he turns his attention to the most urgent issues facing us. Will humanity survive? Should we colonize space? Does God exist?
The Reluctant Healer by Andrew Himmel (fiction)
Named to Kirkus Reviews' Best Books of 2018. "The Reluctant Healer" tells the story of a young attorney who is torn between mounting evidence that he has the spiritual ability to heal others. Will Alexander is cautious and conventional. But when he meets Erica, a beautiful, intense energy healer, he becomes troubled not only by her unorthodox endeavors but also by the limitations of his own existence. Will is startled to discover that he may possess metaphysical gifts of healing that confront the narrow doctrines of his regulated life.
Vindication by H. Terrell Griffin (fiction)
In this John Grisham style mystery, Matt Royal, the retired lawyer-turned-beach-bum is called back into the courtroom to defend his girlfriend J.D. Duncan's Aunt Esther, who lives in the sprawling North Central Florida retirement community of The Villages. A best-selling author has been murdered after a book signing, and Aunt Esther has been arrested. Matt has a history with the local sheriff – one which may not bode well for his client. Matt reluctantly suits up for the courtroom, and J.D. takes a leave from the police department to go undercover. A bizarre specter from the past haunts their investigation every step of the way. As they delve further into the case, the pieces of the puzzle refuse to fall into any kind of coherent pattern. Not until the case goes to trial and the evidence is revealed does the truth emerge – and a strange kind of justice prevails.
Samantha Bonnette is marketing & development manager at Shreve Memorial Library.

Texto completo: For the second presidential cycle in a row, a crowded field of candidates has emerged in the race to claim a major party's nomination. The sheer number of hats in the ring could produce a nominee outside the small coterie most pundits expect to win out.
Dubious? Just think about 2016.
In the last presidential election, most of the Republican candidates were seen as beacons of the "establishment." With Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Rick Perry, John Kasich and Chris Christie all competing to win the hearts and minds of more moderate GOP primary voters, Donald Trump won by collecting support from Republicans with an appetite for a different brand of candidate — and he succeeded. In other words, the crowded field opened the door for an outsider who was (and could still be) largely out of step with many others inside his own party.
This time, the situation is flipped. Democrats are the party with the crowded field. But maybe more important, many Democratic candidates are not focusing on winning over moderate voters. Quite the opposite; they're keyed on winning over the Democratic Party's base voters and others on the far left. If history repeats itself, these candidates will end up slicing that electorate into such small portions that they could open the door for a competitor with a different message and outlook.
No one knows who will emerge as the Democratic nominee, and the widely held presumption that the 2016 race would be yet another contest between someone named Bush and someone named Clinton should give prognosticators pause. But the crowded field among Democratic candidates signals that the unexpected today might seem inevitable tomorrow. Voters eager to see a candidate emerge with a promise of getting Democrats and Republicans to work collaboratively should stay engaged.
Nancy Jacobson is a founder of the nonprofit organization No Labels.
What others are saying Dean Obeidallah, CNN.com: "President Donald Trump is now confronted with a gang of women who are all gunning for him. And if he responds in usual Trump fashion, with his no-holds-barred attacks, he could drive away more female voters than he did in the 2018 midterms. That could potentially not only be devastating for Trump, but also for many Republicans on the 2020 ballot."
Tara McGowan, The Hill: "Trump's campaign has excelled at leveraging digital ad dollars to keep the controversies surrounding the Trump administration from reaching his supporter base online. ... Coupled with Trump's own tweets, thousands of Facebook ads placed by his re-election campaign and dozens of conservative 'media outlets' driving the same narrative, Trump's chosen message blanketed the feeds and phones of voters nationwide."
David Leonhardt, The New York Times: "If I were Trump, I would fear Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Either would be well-positioned to take back blue-collar states Trump needs like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and maybe even Ohio and Iowa. They could also play well in the Sunbelt suburbs of Arizona, Florida and North Carolina. And if I were the other 2020 Democrats, I'd be studying how Klobuchar and Brown have succeeded where so many other Democrats have been failing."

Texto completo: Nathan Howard/The Columbian
The United States Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory was one of the Clark County federal sites hardest hit during the last partial government shutdown. The CVO's employees are preparing for the possibility of a second round of furloughs if lawmakers fail to strike a deal by Friday evening.
Amanda Cowan/The Columbian
Trap Door Brewing has been waiting to receive approval for new labels and release new products since the previous government shutdown

A looming deadline that would again close the federal government has created some white knuckles in Clark County, where both federal workers and ordinary citizens are still in recovery mode from the first shutdown.
If lawmakers in Washington, D.C., fail to strike a deal by Friday evening, the partial government shutdown that lasted 35 days and delayed paychecks to 800,000 federal workers will resume.
“We're still waiting — I was just looking at the news to see what the latest is,” said Sam Tunes, administrative officer at the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver.
With 80 employees, the observatory was one of the hardest-hit operations in Clark County during what became the longest government shutdown in the country's history. Last month, Tunes told The Columbian that his wife had gone back to work when he was furloughed on Dec. 21. The couple had to scramble to find child care for their 2-year-old when the government reopened Jan. 25, abruptly calling him back to work.
“A lot of times, we find out at the same time as everybody else,” Tunes said. “As far as we know right now, there's no appropriations in place.”
As of Wednesday afternoon, the outlook looked optimistic but wobbly. President Donald Trump had expressed that he wanted to avoid a second shutdown over funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, though he was dissatisfied by a bipartisan border deal that fell more than $4 billion short of his initial demand for wall funding.
According to The New York Times, the president had suggested that he was eyeing the deal with some skepticism and that his White House aides would be “looking for land mines” when it scoured the legislative text.
The Ridgefield, Steigerwald Lake and Pierce national wildlife refuges in Clark County employ about a dozen staffers facing a second furlough. Brent Lawrence, a public affairs officer for the National Wildlife Refuge System, said refuges are following guidance from the Department of Interior on how to prepare for a potential government shutdown, again.
“It's all very similar to the last time,” Lawrence said. “There's always maintenance stuff, whether it's working fields or various facilities. … Of course, those would have to be caught up on in the event of a shutdown.”
A second shutdown could also prove a headache for people in the private sector who still need to access services run by federal agencies.
Regulatory quagmire
Bryan Shull, co-founder of Vancouver's Trap Door Brewing, told The Columbian on the one-month anniversary of the shutdown that he was struggling to obtain federal approval for new beer can labels. Although the government has reopened, at least temporarily, the backlog is still so bad that the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau functionally feels closed to craft brewers trying to get their packaging OK'd.
“The reality for all of us is pretty similar to during the shutdown,” Shull wrote in an email. “We have received notice from the agency of their commitment to redirect staff to address this, and I believe they are doing their best.”
In order to cross state lines, beer labels need to be approved by the federal agency.
“The TTB website posts a projected backlog time of 48 days, today. Approvals used to be within 10 days,” Shull wrote.
Trap Door had an appointment with a traveling cannery booked about six months in advance, Shull said. Though still waiting on federal approval of its new labels, the business went ahead with its appointment. But now the onus is on the brewery to make sure that unapproved labels don't leave Washington (the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board, which was unaffected by the shutdown, has approved the cans for sale within the state).
“We did not reschedule our canning dates, we just have to keep unapproved labels in WA state to be compliant with federal law, which is still an impediment to our business strategy and adversely affects our profits,” Shull wrote.
A second government shutdown could worsen the backlog, Shull worries. He was already concerned about how the first shutdown might have impacted the timeline on his next project, a satellite Trap Door Brewing taproom in Ridgefield scheduled to open in spring 2020.
Playing catch-up
In both the public and private sectors, people are still playing catch-up from the first time around. Tunes said that at the volcano observatory, he's still so caught up in making up for the lost month that he barely had the headspace to consider a second encroaching shutdown.
“I'm speaking more for myself here, (but) we're kind of focused so much on the work itself that we don't spend enough time thinking about where we're going to be in two weeks,” Tunes said.
In the meantime, staff at the CVO are doing what they can to keep from getting caught off guard by a shutdown sequel, Tunes said. There's a checklist — employees need to update their time cards, send all their formal letters and correspondences, and ensure that all of their collaborators outside of the federal government know that the CVO staff might soon be furloughed.
Last time, they dropped down to a skeleton crew of about 20 part-time people working essential operations only. Longer-term products and research stalled.
Then there's the housekeeping stuff.
“Simple things like emptying the fridge. Things like that. Taking your plants home,” Tunes said.
“We're definitely preparing for it. It's such an uncertain thing. It's kind of hard to convey the feeling,” he continued. “I think we're worried it might be another long one.”

The last shutdown, by the numbers
$584,847 — Lost wages per week for Clark County workers, according to a county-by-county study from the Washington Employment Security Department following the last federal government shutdown.
$2.92 million — Total wage loss over the course of the five-week shutdown.
3,398 — Federal jobs in Clark County, employing about 0.7 percent of the population.
333 — Estimated number of employees who were directly impacted by the shutdown and would be again if the government were to close once more.
These figures did not count the Clark County residents who commute to Portland for federal government jobs. The study also didn't account for the private government contractors impacted by the shutdown, who unlike fu

Texto completo: Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said he has "no knowledge" of a woman's allegation that she was sexually assaulted by a former Blue Devils player and he believes the school should and will investigate.
Lawyer Nancy Erika Smith has said her client, Meredith Watson, was raped by a player while she was a student at Duke. The New York Times and other publications identified the player as Corey Maggette, who has denied the allegation. The reports cited a friend of Watson, R. Stanton Jones, who said she told him about the alleged assault at the time.
Watson also said Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax sexually assaulted her while they were students at Duke in 2000. Smith said Watson told a high-ranking administrator about the assault by a player but was dissuaded from filing a complaint or notifying police.
Maggette played at Duke in the 1998-99 season and then left for the NBA.
Krzyzewski was asked about the allegation after Duke's 71-69 victory over Louisville on Tuesday night in Louisville, Ky. He said he wasn't aware of the details.
Tennessee 85, South Carolina 73: Admiral Schofield had 21 points and 10 rebounds as No. 1 Tennessee won its school-record 19th consecutive victory.
Tennessee owns the longest active winning streak of any active Division I team and is 11-0 in Southeastern Conference competition for the first time in school history.
The Volunteers (23-1, 11-0 SEC) also earned their 23rd straight home win.
Bradley 61, Loyola 54: The Ramblers went cold on free throws and 3-pointers, and the result was a Missouri Valley road loss in Peoria.
They shot 5-for-20 on 3s and 5-for-11 at the free-throw line. The Braves trailed 26-22 at halftime but outscored Loyola 39-28 in the second half.
Marques Townes scored 15 points to lead the Ramblers (16-10, 9-4), whose conference lead fell to one game over Drake and Missouri State. Cameron Krutwig added 13 points and 11 rebounds, and Darrell Brown scored a game-high 21 points for Bradley (13-12, 5-7).

Texto completo: As much as anyone says to beware the ides of March, the ides of February bring more trepidation to more people than the midpoint of any other month, thanks to the societal expectations that come with Valentine's Day.
Do you not have someone to love you? Better get on that, stat!
Do you have a love in your life? Best have something prepared to show that your romantic fire still burns, lest that be questioned and the night devolve into arguments, cold shoulders and slammed doors.
Or, if you're fortunate enough, you can find friends old or new to guide you through the 14th day of the second month without your heart breaking into a million little pieces. Even here in New York City. Especially here. Whatever your situation, here are some entertainment suggestions:

[Check out our Culture Calendar here.]
LIVE @ THE APT at the Villain (8:30 p.m.). This independently produced comedy showcase usually pops up in unexpected lofts and apartments, but for this night, it's playing it safer at this establishment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where all of the comedians will joke about sex, love and relationships to put you and whomever you're with at ease. liveapt.tv
'MORTIFIED: DOOMED LOVE VALENTINE'S DAY SPECIAL' at Littlefield in Brooklyn (shows at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Tragedy plus time does equal comedy in this showcase, in which comedians and writers unearth the journals, poems, home movies and more that they made in their teenage years. Angsty then. Funny now. All about unrequited romance. (Also Valentine's Day events in Boston and Denver.) littlefieldnyc.com
OUT BY 10 at NoHo Sound (8 p.m.). Each month, the host Susan Seliger presents a nonprofit production of musicians and funny storytellers that raises money to support the artists on the bill. February's lineup features Kevin Allison, host of "RISK!" (he's also from the State), the comedian and rapper Carolyn Castiglia, the actor Gianmarco Soresi and music from All Types of Kinds. musae.me
THE SONS & HEIRS at the Bell House (8 p.m.). If romance seems too contrived, or you're so emo that you're over the idea, then we'll know to look for you at this concert hall in Gowanus, Brooklyn, where the Rolling Stone columnist Rob Sheffield hosts this performance by a band that pays tribute to Morrissey and The Smiths. thebellhouseny.com
'YOUR LOVE, OUR MUSICAL' at Caveat on the Lower East Side (7 p.m.). As raved about recently by Jason Zinoman in The New York Times, the duo of Rebecca Vigil and Evan Kaufman take a nearly impossible premise and execute it brilliantly. They'll interview a real couple from the audience and turn that pair's love story into a fully improvised musical. Now that's a Valentine's gift. caveat.nyc

That law firm with the all-white partner class? It's a sign we have more work to do

Texto completo: When I was growing up, one of my heroes was George E. Johnson Sr., the legendary entrepreneur who built an empire from a line of beauty products for African-Americans and became the exclusive sponsor of the hit TV show "Soul Train."
By the 1970s, Johnson was the most prominent black businessman in America. His company, Johnson Products, was the first black-owned company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.
His most impressive feat, however, wasn't just accumulating wealth, but spreading it around -- hiring black attorneys, buying ads on black radio stations and supporting black philanthropic and political causes. With that, he ensured that other African-Americans in Chicago also could board America's escalator.
This is why I am passionate about tackling economic inequality through business opportunity, and why I talk -- some would say preach -- inclusion every chance I get.
This approach isn't just doing good, it's also good business. Studies show that diverse teams make better decisions and are more likely to see better-than-average profits.
What's more, failing to become more diverse has become increasingly risky. When New York City law firm Paul, Weiss posted photos of its newest class of partners on LinkedIn, the photos showed a class of white men -- and one white woman.
The resulting backlash led to coverage in The New York Times and an open letter from 170 companies, which called on law firms to become more diverse or risk losing their business.
A corporate leader reading this may think, "My organization holds an annual diversity fair. Our last construction project included several minority-owned firms. Our food service contractors could form a mini-United Nations."
But equal opportunity demands more.
Take a moment to look at the highest levels of your organization as well as your professional services contractors. Chances are you'll find little, if any, diversity.
In 2019, the problem is not supply, but demand. A critical mass of highly qualified people of color are ready for greater opportunity.
In asset management, for example, firms owned by women and minorities account for 3 to 9 percent of the industry, and manage only 1.1 percent of the total assets under management, according to a 2017 study by the Knight Foundation. This is despite the fact that the report found no statistically significant difference in performance.
The Knight study grew out of the foundation's efforts to diversify its endowment, and it eventually moved $472 million of its endowment, or 22 percent, to management by women- and minority-owned firms -- with no compromise on performance.
Astonishingly, a decade after President Barack Obama moved into the White House, there are still only three black CEOs at Fortune 500 companies.
So, how do we move the ball forward? In Chicago, three initiatives are yielding results:
* At the University of Chicago, an annual symposium brings leading minority and women-owned businesses to campus to pitch their services to senior-level decision-makers. The symposium has helped these businesses build crucial relationships and secure contracts worth an estimated $42 million.
* Exelon Corp. prioritizes diversity among professional services contracts and in 2017 reported that high-margin spending with diversity-certified suppliers reached $100 million. It also encourages diversity among non-minority-owned partners by requiring them to report the level of contributions made by women and minorities, and providing incentives for improvement.
* At Chicago-based Northern Trust, African-Americans make up 23 percent of the board and women make up 38 percent of senior executives.
Consider this a call to action. Martin Luther King Jr. predicted that African-Americans could only be liberated from the "crushing weight of poor education, squalid housing and economic strangulation" by being "integrated, with power, into every level of American life."
To make King's vision real, diversity efforts must go all the way to the top.

Texto completo: A lawyer for National Enquirer owner American Media Inc. 's CEO defended the company's correspondence with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, saying AMI did nothing illegal.
"It absolutely is not extortion and not blackmail," Elkan Abramowitz, attorney for AMI CEO David Pecker, said Sunday on ABC's "This Week with George Stephanopoulos. "
His comments came after Bezos published a blog post Thursday accusing AMI of attempting to blackmail him with threats to publish a trove of embarrassing photos, including some of a sexual nature.
The clash followed the Enquirer's previous publication of a report on Bezos' breakup with his wife and his romantic relationship with former Los Angeles news anchor Lauren Sanchez.
Bezos on Thursday posted emails in which AMI representatives offered to withhold publication of the embarrassing photos in exchange for Bezos acknowledging that the tabloid owner had no political motivation for publishing its original expose. Pecker has supported Donald Trump, and Trump has repeatedly criticized Bezos, who owns The Washington Post.
"That is not extortion because all that AMI wanted was the truth," Abramowitz told "This Week," adding that the company was making a "news decision" and that the Bezos correspondence "was part of a legitimate negotiation. "
AMI representatives declined to comment further Sunday on Abramowitz's remarks.
Among the accusations Bezos made was that Pecker and AMI have murky ties to the Saudi Arabian government, potentially through a pro-Saudi publication released in 2018.

"The Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve," Bezos wrote.
The Bezos allegations came after AMI signed a non-prosecution agreement with the U. S. attorneys in connection with the government's investigation into Trump's presidential campaign.
If AMI is found to have committed a crime, the company would not be immune to prosecution, said Michael Conway, a lawyer who has represented media organizations such as the New York Times and ABC, and now teaches at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism.
Conway said the AMI correspondence "certainly has the elements of blackmail," which would "blow up" the company's deal with the government.
Abramowitz said he's "absolutely not" concerned that the Bezos revelations could affect that agreement.
Stuart Karle, a former Dow Jones attorney and Reuters executive who teaches media law at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, said the situation is fraught with peril for American Media. But he said “it seems unlikely to me that whatever happened here” would “destroy” the company.
“There are a lot of steps between this kind of correspondence and a formal criminal charge,” he said.
However, “corporations can be destroyed by criminal charges” or can be forced into a sale to pay off liabilities in civil cases, he added.

Texto completo: MEXICO CITY -- Yazmín Morales recalls weeping with rage after an encounter four years ago in the book-lined study of her country's most respected statesman. Óscar Arias Sánchez, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former Costa Rican president, had pinned her against a door, she says, forcibly kissing and groping her.
Until last week, Ms. Morales kept the episode to herself. But after another woman came forward to file a criminal complaint against the former president alleging sexual assault, Ms. Morales summoned the courage to add her voice.
Ms. Morales, a former Miss Costa Rica, wanted a powerful criminal lawyer to represent her. She called one, then another. After a third also refused to take her case, she decided to act alone. Accompanied only by her half sister, she, too, filed a criminal complaint against Mr. Arias.
The case of Mr. Arias, who now faces accusations of sexual assault or misconduct from at least nine women, is emerging as the most significant of the #MeToo era in Latin America.
But it has also revealed just how difficult it is for women to seek legal recourse in cases involving powerful men. In a region where the laws lay out a progressive vision of women's rights, the social and political barriers to exercising those rights can seem insurmountable.
On Sunday, the list of Mr. Arias's accusers grew again when Carina A. Black, 52, a political scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno, told The New York Times that Mr. Arias tried to grope and kiss her in 1998, when he visited the university as a speaker.
As she took Mr. Arias around at meetings and events, Ms. Black said, she found herself alone in an elevator with him. He pushed her against the elevator wall, put his hand across her chest and tried to kiss her, she said.
"I pushed him, and I smacked him in the face," she said.
But because she was not injured, it never occurred to her to file a report, Ms. Black said. She has decided to tell her story now, she said, in part so people will believe his first accuser.
"Arias is so powerful," she said. "He has huge land ownership. He is so revered. In Latin America, the power is so tilted on the side of men. This behavior is what most women have grown up with."
Gloriana Valladares, a lawyer for Mr. Arias, acknowledged that he faces two legal complaints, from Ms. Morales and the first accuser, Alexandra Arce von Herold, a psychiatrist and nuclear disarmament activist. Ms. Valladares said she would not comment because the preliminary stages of the proceedings are private.
Last week, Mr. Arias "categorically" denied Dr. Arce's assault allegations, saying he had never acted in a way that disrespected the will of any woman.
Ms. Morales, 48, said that as she looked for a high-profile lawyer to represent her, she found that they all had some kind of connection to Mr. Arias. Two of the lawyers she approached were former justice ministers, and one had run for the presidency.
They all found an excuse not to help her. One said that he was a friend of Mr. Arias's wife. Another said that he did not take sexual-abuse cases, and the third said that he was too busy, she said.
"They preferred not to get involved," Ms. Morales said in a telephone interview. "I was scared. If the lawyers didn't want to support me, nobody else would."
Ms. Morales declined to name the lawyers. "I am already scared of Óscar Arias," she said. "Giving more names would be even more difficult."
When she arrived to file her complaint, she met with a prosecutor and a psychologist and was advised to find a lawyer. Her complaint was first reported on the website of the Costa Rican journalist Amelia Rueda.
Larissa Arroyo, a lawyer with a group in San José, the Costa Rican capital, that works to prevent gender-based violence and discrimination, said that women who wanted to press criminal charges without legal support were very vulnerable.
"It's just not true that access to justice is the same for everybody," she said.
"Filing a complaint has a very high price," Ms. Arroyo said. "It implies an emotional and economic price, even losing a job or being stigmatized publicly."
One of the problems, she said, is that few lawyers are trained to deal with issues of gender and human rights.
Laura Chinchilla, a protégée of Mr. Arias's who also served as president, said he had a right to a defense, but acknowledged the constraints women face when they accuse powerful men of misconduct.
"As a society, we have an obligation to support the victims so that they can break their silence and the abuses do not remain in impunity," she wrote on Facebook.
Arcelio Hernández, the lawyer who agreed to take Ms. Morales's case after she filed her complaint, said that colleagues had called to warn him against taking it. "How dare you go against this guy?" Mr. Hernández said, summarizing their comments. "Of course, people are afraid."
Mr. Arias, 78, was president from 1986 to 1990 and again from 2006 to 2010. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his mediation efforts during civil wars in Central America.
Dr. Arce, 34, the first woman to come forward, is a psychiatrist at a state hospital in San José. She often met with Mr. Arias in her nuclear disarmament work, and said she was at his home in late 2014 when he came up behind her, touched her breasts and shoved his hands up her skirt, penetrating her with his fingers.
In an interview last fall, Dr. Arce said several people had cautioned her against going public. "People began to make me feel scared about my security -- my physical security," she said.
When Dr. Arce first posted her account on social media last year, a journalist friend persuaded her to take it down, warning that she could be damaged by the tabloid media.
Mr. Arias did not know Ms. Morales personally before he invited her to his house around Easter of 2015 to give her a book of his essays and speeches. (The editor of that book says that as she worked with Mr. Arias, he once put his hand on her leg and that he called her twice, insisting that she come to his house for a massage.)
Ms. Morales, who worked as a television host and model after winning Miss Costa Rica in 1994, posts beauty tips on her Facebook page and sells skin care products online.
For more than an hour, the meeting was cordial. Mr. Arias gave her a tour of his elegant home before signing his book.
But when she moved to leave, he pinned her against the door, pulled her head back and kissed her, pressing his body against hers and touching her breasts, she said. Shocked, all she could say was: "Don Oscar, I have to go," using a respectful form of address in Costa Rica.
He did not pressure her further, walking her to the front gate and opening it.
She decided it was time to tell her story after Dr. Arce came forward. "I was motivated by that girl, who is very brave, and by the #MeToo movement," Ms. Morales said.
A lot has changed for women since 2015, she said.
"Women's voices are being heard," she said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: [Video: Hale County This Morning This Evening Official Trailer Watch on YouTube.]
A powerful documentary set in rural Alabama is on PBS. And the crime series "White Dragon" is available to stream on Amazon.
What's on TV
HALE COUNTY THIS MORNING, THIS EVENING (2018) 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings); rent on iTunes. This Oscar-nominated debut feature by RaMell Ross was made out of 1,300 hours of footage filmed over five years. It documents the lives of two young black men, Daniel Collins and Quincy Bryant, in Hale County, Ala., with an innovative cinematic approach. The critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times named it one of the best movies of 2018, and wrote that Ross "glimpses arresting, at times almost hallucinatory beauty in the rural Alabama landscape, and finds nuances of emotion that grow in intensity over 75 heady minutes."
AMERICAN DAD! 10 p.m. on TBS. After a long break, Season 13 returns with a new episode in which Francine (voiced by Wendy Schaal) bulks up to become a bodybuilder after her family calls her a quitter.
STUDIO 54 (2018) 10 p.m. on A&E. Andy Warhol once said Studio 54 was "a dictatorship at the door and a democracy on the dance floor." Michael Jackson described that club as the place "where you come when you want to escape." That was in Studio 54's heyday in the late 1970s, when the New York hot spot attracted the likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Mick Jagger and drew the ire of those who could not make it past the velvet ropes. Its wild ride ended, though, after 33 months when its founders, Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell, were sentenced to prison for tax evasion. In this documentary by Matt Tyrnauer, Schrager recounts the details behind the rise and fall of his notorious club -- a tale that he described in an interview with The Times as an "operatic, tragic story of the years ending the sexual revolution." Another documentary by Tyrnauer, 'SCOTTY AND THE SECRET HISTORY OF HOLLYWOOD,' about a former Marine who was an escort to closeted gay movie stars during Hollywood's golden age, leads in at 9 p.m. on Starz.
What's Streaming
WHITE DRAGON stream on Amazon. In this British drama series, Jonah (John Simm of "Life on Mars"), a professor in London, travels to Hong Kong after receiving terrible news about his wife. There he discovers disturbing revelations that lead him to David (Anthony Wong), an ex-cop who was surprisingly close to Jonah's wife and who joins Jonah in his search for answers. "The show does its job as gritty tourist-noir," Mike Hale writes in his review for The Times. But, he adds, "It's never quite as fun or romantic as it should be, and the characters' words and actions tend to run counter to common sense."
FLAVORFUL ORIGINS stream on Netflix. The first season of this culinary series explores the history and ingredients of food from Chaoshan, a coastal region in the eastern Guangdong province of China, with dazzling, mouthwatering visuals.

9 things to know about Amy Klobuchar

Texto completo: The self-proclaimed “senator next door” is officially hoping to walk through another door: that of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
Democratic U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is a popular politician in her state of Minnesota, gaining support and cash from both liberals and, to a lesser degree, conservatives.
She smoothly sailed to a third term in her 2018 Senate race, raising more than 38 times the cash her Republican opponent raised — and winning 60 percent of the vote. (Her “Minnesota nice” persona hasn’t worked on everyone: Back in 2011, Justin Bieber said Klobuchar should be locked up for proposing an anti-piracy bill concerning unlicensed online content.)
Before becoming the first Minnesota woman elected to the U.S. Senate, Klobuchar, 58, served as county attorney for the most populous county in Minnesota, Hennepin County. Her prosecutorial experience came into focus during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh: Klobuchar’s exchange with Kavanaugh about whether he ever blacked out while drinking — he retorted, “Have you?” — went viral and earned her a spoof on Saturday Night Live .
Here are nine things you should know about Klobuchar’s politics and finances:
* Klobuchar raked in donations from chief executive officers from 11 of Minnesota’s 25 largest corporations, according to a Star Tribune analysis of data from the 2017-2018 election cycle. Two of the CEOs, Scott Wine of snowmobile-maker Polaris Industries and Stanley Hubbard of Hubbard Broadcasting, normally give the majority of their money to Republicans. But they gave to Klobuchar anyway.
* Klobuchar is known for her consumer rights advocacy. Online privacy protections and investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election are among her causes. She cosponsored the Honest Ads Act, which would beef up disclosure of online political ads, and spoke about passing “a whole bunch of bills” to regulate Facebook in the wake of its handling of Cambridge Analytica’s harvesting of Facebook users’ personal information. Facebook nevertheless took a small step toward getting on Klobuchar’s good side: Its political action committee donated $2,500 to her campaign in September, months after the scandal unfolded.
* Klobuchar is worth anywhere in between $836,000 and $1.9 million, according to her latest financial disclosure from May 2018. Her assets are stored in a mix of mutual funds, retirement plans and bank accounts. She also received about $300 in royalties from her senior thesis-turned-book “Uncovering the Dome,” a history of the construction of the former Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis.
* Klobuchar currently has $3.9 million stored in her campaign coffers, which she may use in her presidential run. That puts her in the upper echelon of presidential candidates or potential contenders already in office, along with President Donald Trump, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.
* Before running for U.S. Senate, Klobuchar was a corporate lawyer in Minneapolis. Her fellow attorneys appear most supportive of her federal ambitions, with lawyers and law firm PACs together donating the most money among industry classes to her three U.S. Senate campaigns — more than $3 million.
* From 2013 to 2018, Klobuchar collected about $430,000 more from male donors than female donors — at least among donations greater than $200, where donor names are required to be reported, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. However, a Center for Public Integrity analysis found that women provided more than half of Klobuchar’s donations between 2017 through November 2018 through the conduit ActBlue, which includes smaller checks.
* Klobuchar had the highest staff turnover rate in the Senate, at 36 percent, according to a Politico analysis of Legistorm data from 2001 to 2016. (She told the New York Times she has “high expectations.”) A HuffPost investigation found at least three people withdrew themselves from consideration for jobs Klobuchar’s presidential campaign because of rumors involving her mistreating staff.
* In 2007, Canadian officials gave Klobuchar a hand-blown glass bowl worth $150. A Federal Registrar filing noted “non-acceptance would cause embarrassment to donor and U.S. government.” Klobuchar kept the bowl “for official display in 302 Hart Senate building.”
* Klobuchar stayed on the good side of people she dated, apparently: Klobuchar said she raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends toward her 2006 Senate run.

Texto completo: One of my friends is having a ‘dry February’ where he’s not drinking and not on social media. As a way to show my support for this brave endeavor, I told him I would be his sober companion, in that he could be my month-long designated driver and I would hang out with him.
It got me thinking about other companions we could use at those critical times when we need a good friend to show support or stop an action that we’d rather regret. You know, like mixing drinking with Instagram or an ill-time text.
Drunk-text companion
This is the person who would prevent you from sending a text to your exes while inebriated.
Here are the worst of the drunk texts some of my friends told me about:
I’m so glad you’re out of my life! Please take me back.
I’m not drunk. You’re drunk! Now, where am I?
I can’t wait to wake up next to you. This was a text my friend accidentally sent to his mom.
Salt Lake face with a Kentucky booty. Again, sent to his mom.
I can’t believe what a jerk he is! Why can’t I find a real man that just understands?? A text accidentally sent to the aforementioned “jerk.”
Here’s one my friend received: I will always love you. You are the love of my life. You manipulative b$&%@.
and one an anonymous friend sent:
You gave the hat I knit you to your girlfriend?? You are a TERRIBLE person!
OK, that one was me, and it was warranted.
and
My dear, you are ugly, but tomorrow I shall be sober and you will still be ugly.
OK, that one was Winston Churchill.
Diet companion
This person would shadow you while you shop, and when you reach for the potato chips, would put a kind hand on your shoulder and shake their head and guide you toward the kale chips.
I could definitely use one of these, since I’m declaring February my “Month of health.” (I know, the title is lacking in creativity.)
But my worry is that this companion will, at some time, say, “A moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.” Because then I would instruct my “bodyguard companion” to swing away and draw blood.
Lost things companion
If you ask anyone around me, they’ll confirm I’m constantly losing things. My keys, my phone, my mind. I once lost my salt shaker. Found it later in my medicine cabinet.
My friend lost his keys for a day. They were in his fridge. Naturally.
And speaking of fridges…
Rotten-food-in-fridge companion
That’s kinda specific, but I could really use one of these. The other day, I had guests over to celebrate the birthday of a friend. I provided a pitcher of water.. One of my friends commented, saying he was pleasantly surprised that I’d provided “cucumber” water. I had no idea what he was talking about.
Until I found some… um… beyond-the-‘eat-by’-date cucumbers in the fridge. The aroma had somehow made its way into my fridge water.
I am not proud of this. Except that if I’m going to have rotting food, I’m glad it was something that made my water taste like I was hoity toity. Better than “moldy cheese” water.
But mostly, I would want:
Cheerleading rock band companion
This would be several people following you around, playing optimistic music as the backdrop of your life.
Like, if I do the dishes, the band breaks out in a complimentary anthem. “Go Brodi, go Brodi, you’re killing it, and we’re feeling it! You got this, and you bought this!”
And then they would go buy my groceries for the week, with the help of the diet companion.
Ah, dreams.
What are some companions you would like in your life?

Texto completo: President Donald Trump wants you to know that despite what you may have heard, "Executive Time" is productive time.
On Sunday, Trump posted a tweet in response to a week-old Axios report that included leaked copies of his private schedule. The report found that roughly 60 percent of Trump's schedule has consisted of "unstructured Executive Time" over the past three months.
The report triggered a wave of outrage and indignation from people who claimed the schedule showed that the president was spending most of his time watching Fox News, firing off tweets or chatting on the phone.
Not so, the president explained. In fact, "Executive Time" should be "reported as a positive, not negative," he said.
"When the term Executive Time is used, I am generally working, not relaxing. In fact, I probably work more hours than almost any past President," Trump tweeted.
He followed up with another tweet explaining that when he took office, the U. S. was such "a mess" that he "had no choice but to work very long hours!"

When the president's private schedule was leaked, political observers painted it as an unprecedented personal betrayal by a White House staffer.
"A White House aide is weaponizing his schedules, which says a lot about how people in the White House feel about the man they work for," tweeted New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman after Axios published the leaked documents.
"What a disgraceful breach of trust to leak schedules," tweeted Trump's secretary Madeleine Westerhout‏. "What these don’t show are the hundreds of calls and meetings @realDonaldTrump takes everyday. This POTUS is working harder for the American people than anyone in recent history. "
But, on Sunday, Trump said that getting his "work schedule" was actually "very easy to do. " That would seem to be the case, because after he sent his tweet, Axios published more copies of his schedule. This time, Axios revealed four days from the week since its original story. True to form, those days included about 50 percent of scheduled "Executive Time. "

White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that the leaked schedule "is not that confidential" and about 400 people get copies of it.
"It's not the content" that is upsetting, Mulvaney explained on "Fox News Sunday. "
"It's the fact that someone within the White House spent three months collecting this information, which is really, really hard to do," he said.
The White House is close to identifying the staffer who leaked the schedule, with hopes "to have a resolution on that this week," Mulvaney said.

GARLIC CHICKEN WITH LEMON-ANCHOVY SAUCE

Texto completo: Anchovies often get a bad rap. They're pungent and scary-looking to people who don't eat a lot of fish. But they're often a secret ingredient that adds instant umami - "pleasant savory taste" in Japanese - to a dish.
Mashed and heated with garlic, olive oil, capers and chile, the tiny silver fish that come in a can anchor a briny, insanely delicious sauce for pan-fried chicken. They dissolve when you cook them, bones and all, so don't tell your family about this integral ingredient until after they've eaten.
1¼ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs (4-5 thighs)
1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
5 anchovy fillets
2 tablespoons drained capers, patted dry
1 large pinch chile flakes
1 lemon, halved
Fresh chopped parsley, for serving
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper and let rest while you prepare the anchovy-garlic oil.
Mince one garlic clove and set it aside for later. In a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, add oil. When the oil is hot, add 5 smashed whole garlic cloves, anchovies, capers and chile.
Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up the anchovies, until the garlic browns around the edges and the anchovies dissolve, 3-5 minutes.
Add chicken thighs and cook until nicely browned on one side, 5-7 minutes. Flip thighs, place pan in the oven and cook another 5-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through.
Transfer thighs to a plate when chicken is done (be careful, the pan handle will be hot). Place skillet back on the heat and add minced garlic and juice of one lemon half.
Cook for about 30 seconds, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Return chicken to the pan and cook in the sauce for another 15-30 seconds.
Transfer everything to a serving platter. Squeeze remaining lemon half over the chicken and garnish with chopped parsley. Serve.

AJC EXCLUSIVE: Bill aims to aid student debt-laden millennials

Texto completo: The most millennial of bills has begun its journey through the state Legislature.
House Bill 42 would prevent the state from suspending the state-issued professional licenses of those who default on government-backed student loans. Whether nurses, insurance agents or termite exterminators.
"This is a really terrible way to collect debt," said state Rep. Scot Turner, R-Holly Springs, the bill's author. "There are plenty of other opportunities for debt collection in the state of Georgia."
Garnishment and liens, for instance. "We should not remove somebody's ability to earn a living if they fall behind on their student loans. Then they will not be able to pay their student loans," Turner told a House committee.
Well, duh, you say. That's just a debtor's prison without bars.
In a quickly changing job market that requires more and more technical training, millennials as a generation are carrying more debt than older Americans can imagine. That debt is defining them. And us, too.
In 2005, the average student loan debt for someone between the ages of 24 and 32 was about $5,000, according to a U.S. Federal Reserve study published last month. By 2014, it had doubled. Currently, total U.S. student loan debt stands at $1.5 trillion. The national default rate is about 11 percent, according to other federal stats. Georgia's default rate is just a tad higher.
Student debt, it can be argued, is already changing the face of metro Atlanta. Much has been made about the region's shift in attitude when it comes to commuter rail. Millennials don't want to drive cars and prefer apartment living, Georgia's corporate recruiters insist.
Environmental concerns and lifestyle choices are factors, to be sure. But so are personal finances.
According to that January study published by the Federal Reserve, in 2005, 45 percent of Americans between the ages of 24 and 32 indulged in homeownership. By 2014, that had dropped to 36 percent.
Higher student loan debt early in life leads to a lower credit score later in life -- another factor in reduced vehicle and homeownership.
Very likely, student loan debt even has played a role in the depopulation of rural Georgia. "Individuals with student loan debt are less likely to remain in rural areas than those without it," according to the study. The more student loan debt you carry, the more likely you are to head for the big city -- where employment is more certain.
But back to Scot Turner and HB 42. The first thing to note is that Turner's bill is primarily, but not entirely, preventative.
According to 2018 calculations by the U.S. Department of Education, 16,538 student loan borrowers are in default in Georgia.
Georgia law specifically allows the state to suspend the professional licenses of those who fall behind on loan payments. How many have actually lost their livelihood as a result is unclear. "Only a handful in the last several years -- that we know of," Turner said.
As a matter of policy, the Georgia Student Finance Commission will first attempt to establish payment plans with those who fall behind. The actual yanking of licenses is left to the professional boards under the purview of the secretary of state.
"When we asked the secretary of state's office last year, they told us that the records were kept on paper, and so they couldn't tell us exactly how many, unless we wanted to wait for somebody to go through every single one of them," Turner said in an interview. "We thought that was a poor use of resources."
But a policy is subject to change, in which case 16,538 Georgians might be vulnerable. "That was good enough for us," he said.
Moreover, Turner said, in cases where the student loans are federally guaranteed, federal officials will occasionally insist that Georgia follow its own law and pull the occupational licenses of debtors.
The problem is more serious elsewhere. Two years ago, The New York Times reported that from 2012 to 2017, officials in Tennessee -- which has debt collection laws similar to Georgia's -- reported more than 5,400 student loan defaulters to professional licensing agencies. As in Georgia, exactly how many Tennessee professionals have lost their licenses to work isn't clear.
HB 42, which is expected to be voted out of committee this week, received its first airing last Wednesday before the House Higher Education Committee, chaired by Chuck Martin, R-Alpharetta. Turner apologized for its length of 13 pages, a testament to large number of professions that are licensed in Georgia. The bill starts with pesticide contractors, continues with mortgage brokers and ends with real estate appraisers.
All in all, the bill was well-received. But some hard questions were asked. Defaulting on a student loan can sometimes be a red flag, said Rep. David Knight, R-Griffin. "You don't want a stockbroker out there, who is behind on their loans, handling other people's money," Knight said.
What may be most interesting about Turner's measure is its generational nature. Roughly 40 percent of Georgia's 10 million residents fall between the ages of 24 and 54. These are the people we baby boomers will rely on to see us through to the end. In many cases, the amount of student loan debt they wrestle with could determine which nursing homes they choose for us.
That is only part of the wisdom that can be associated with HB 42.
In political terms, this is also the same age group that Republicans in Georgia saw drift into the Democratic camp during last year's race for governor. Lose more in 2020 and 2022, and GOP control of the state could be a thing of the past.
In other words, the millennial vote in Georgia truly matters now. "This is certainly going to help young people. It's great for our party," Turner concedes. At 43, he's officially classified as a Gen-Xer. But one who's learning the millennial language.

Texto completo: Lawyers don’t know everything.
Wait, what? Sure, we pretend to at family dinners, but that’s different.
The truth is in modern times no one lawyer can know every area of law. Think about it — the tax code alone is a gaztrillion pages long (that’s a legal term). How could we know and understand that along with the California Family Law code, which is a modzillion pages (legalese again, sorry)? That’s why we specialize in one, maybe two or three related areas of law. And that’s why you should be careful and methodical in choosing your attorney.
So how do you choose?
First, be clear about what kind of lawyer you need. Is this a real estate transaction? Do you need a will or trust? Are you being sued in a business transaction? Were you injured and contemplating a lawsuit? Is a divorce looming? Those are matters for different types of attorneys. (If you find one attorney who claims to do all of that, please run far away. They can’t possibly do it all well.)
Next, find a referral.
Talk to friends, neighbors, and, most importantly, other professionals to find out what lawyers practice in the area where you need help and who are the good ones. Lawyers are like other business folks (except when arguing with one, or so I’m told) — there are great ones, mediocre ones and bad ones. Talking to someone who has worked with a specific attorney can tell you a lot you need to know. Was the attorney responsive? Reasonable? Knowledgeable? You want those things.
Check the lawyer’s standing
The California state bar website calbar.ca.gov will let you know if the attorney is licensed, what their practice area is, and whether they’ve had any disciplinary proceedings.
I recently had a client bring me their estate planning documents which were so poorly prepared I looked up the attorney who drafted them. He’d been disbarred years before he prepared their documents. I’m sure the client would not have hired him if they had known that, which would have saved them time and money.
I’m less fond of consumer review sites, as there is no neutral party administering what gets posted, as there is with the State Bar, but go ahead and check. If you find a pattern of complaints (as opposed to one or two outliers) you may learn that’s not the right attorney for you.
Meet and talk to the attorney
Most attorneys offer free consultations. You should feel free to ask questions about their experience, their fees, their areas of practice and what you can expect if they handle your matter.
I’ll be honest, we’re rarely asked these questions, but I like it when someone does ask. I know that’s going to be an engaged and sharp client. The point of the conversation is to understand what it will be like to work with that particular attorney. And an important part of that is learning whether you’ll be comfortable and happy working with him.
If your matter involves estate planning or a divorce, you will be sharing a lot of personal information about your family and finances. You should feel comfortable doing that. If your matter involves a lawsuit, you’re likely to be stressed and emotional at times — again, you need to be comfortable with the attorney and confident in her abilities.
My dog can help you out here. Years ago I had a beagle battling cancer. His oncologist was cold and pessimistic and made our appointments much more difficult to bear.
Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and asked to be assigned to a different doctor. The clinic’s owner said, “that’s why we have several doctors on staff, we want you to be comfortable.” The next doctor was fabulous and made the whole experience easier. I’m guessing that’s why California has so many lawyers — so you can find the right one.
One last thought: Though it’s tempting and an important factor, don’t let fees make the decision for you. After all, you can get a car for $500. That doesn’t mean it will get you where you need to be.

Texto completo: Today is Saturday, Feb. 9, the 40th day of 2019. There are 325 days left in the year.
Today’s Highlight in History:
On Feb. 9, 1964, The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on “The Ed Sullivan Show,” broadcast from New York on CBS.
On this date:
In 1825, the House of Representatives elected John Quincy Adams president after no candidate received a majority of electoral votes.
In 1861, Jefferson Davis was elected provisional president of the Confederate States of America at a congress held in Montgomery, Alabama.
In 1942, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff held its first formal meeting to coordinate military strategy during World War II. Daylight-saving “War Time” went into effect in the United States, with clocks moved one hour forward. The SS Normandie, a former French liner being refitted for the U.S. Navy at a New York pier, caught fire (it capsized early the next morning).
In 1943, the World War II battle of Guadalcanal in the southwest Pacific ended with an Allied victory over Japanese forces.
In 1950, in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., charged the State Department was riddled with communists.
In 1960, Adolph Coors Co. chairman Adolph Coors III, 44, was shot to death in suburban Denver during a botched kidnapping attempt. (The man who killed him, Joseph Corbett, Jr., served 19 years in prison.)
In 1964, the G.I. Joe action figure was introduced at the American International Toy Fair in New York.
In 1971, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake in California’s San Fernando Valley claimed 65 lives. The crew of Apollo 14 returned to Earth after man’s third landing on the moon.
In 1984, Soviet leader Yuri V. Andropov, 69, died 15 months after succeeding Leonid Brezhnev; he was followed by Konstantin U. Chernenko.
In 2002, Britain’s Princess Margaret, sister of Queen Elizabeth II, died in London at age 71.
In 2005, Hewlett-Packard Co. chief executive Carly Fiorina was forced out by board members, ending her nearly six-year reign.
In 2017, a federal appeals court refused to reinstate President Donald Trump’s ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, unanimously rejecting the administration’s claim of presidential authority, questioning its motives and concluding that the order was unlikely to survive legal challenges.
Ten years ago: President Barack Obama used his first news conference since taking office to urgently pressure lawmakers to approve a massive economic recovery bill. New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez admitted to taking performance-enhancing drugs, telling ESPN he’d used banned substances while with the Texas Rangers for three years. Lindsey Vonn won the downhill for her second gold at the World Championships in Val D’isere, France, becoming the second American woman (after Andrea Mead Lawrence) to win two golds at a worlds. Playwright Robert Anderson (“Tea and Sympathy”) died in New York at age 91.
Five years ago: Despite a wave of online protests, Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark killed a healthy male giraffe named “Marius” because of rules imposed by a European zoo association to deter inbreeding. Host country Russia won its first gold medal of the Sochi Olympics, winning the team figure skating event; Matthias Mayer of Austria won the men’s downhill. Missouri All-American Michael Sam came out to the nation as an openly gay player in published interviews with ESPN, The New York Times and Outsports. Danish movie director Gabriel Axel (“Babette’s Feast”) died in Copenhagen at age 95.
One year ago: President Donald Trump signed a $400 billion budget deal that sharply boosted spending, swelling the federal deficit; the measure ended a brief overnight federal government shutdown. At the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in South Korea, North and South Korean athletes entered Olympic Stadium together, waving flags showing a unified Korea; it was their first joint Olympic march in more than a decade.

A Security Chief Who Is Selling Peace of Mind

Texto completo: Gavin de Becker, Jeff Bezos' longtime security chief, may run his own consulting firm, write books, operate a private luxury terminal at Los Angeles International Airport and develop threat-assessment tools.
But he is really selling only one thing: peace of mind.
For more than four decades, Mr. de Becker, 64, has counseled the United States government, law enforcement departments, thousands of celebrity clients and countless readers on how to ward off threats and stay safe in a scary world.
His most recent case was for Mr. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, who asked him to find out how American Media Inc., which publishes The National Enquirer, had obtained private intimate pictures of Mr. Bezos and his girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez.
[Mr. Bezos' claim brought intrigue and politics to The Enquirer's exposure of his extramarital affair.]
In a blog post on Medium on Thursday, Mr. Bezos said David J. Pecker, the chief executive of A.M.I., was trying to use the photos to blackmail him and deter him -- and the news outlet he owns, The Washington Post -- from investigating allegations that The Enquirer's coverage of his affair was politically motivated.
Mr. Bezos said he had asked Mr. de Becker "to proceed with whatever budget he needed." Those are words that could inspire any employee. But Mr. de Becker has made the security of others his life's work.
His own childhood was full of the violence and fear that he is now paid to shield others from. Mr. de Becker has written that his mother, a heroin addict, regularly beat him and his sister, and shot his stepfather. She committed suicide when he was 16.
He then moved in with the family of a friend from Beverly Hills High School, Miguel Ferrer, the son of the actor José Ferrer and the singer Rosemary Clooney. Ms. Clooney later gave him a job as her road manager. He went on to work as Elizabeth Taylor's assistant. (Another close friend was the actress Carrie Fisher; he gave a eulogy at a memorial service in 2017 for Ms. Fisher and her actress mother, Debbie Reynolds, who died a day apart.)
In an interview with The New York Times in 1997, Mr. de Becker said his experience with Taylor had led him to understand the perils of celebrity and the "marketing of human beings."
He has been enmeshed ever since. He has investigated stalkers for stars like Olivia Newton-John and Cher. He supervised security for public figures visiting President Ronald Reagan and his family at the White House. He worked with members of the family of Ronald L. Goldman when they sued O. J. Simpson over Mr. Goldman's 1994 killing at the home of Mr. Simpson's former wife. And he helped Bill and Camille Cosby when they received threatening letters after their son's 1997 murder.
For most people seeking Mr. de Becker's advice, they can buy peace of mind for a few dollars with a paperback copy of his best seller, a book that Oprah Winfrey has gushed over, "The Gift of Fear."
For those who can afford it, there is a more hands-on option. Private Suite, the royal blue refuge Mr. de Becker created for wealthy travelers going through Los Angeles International Airport, get their own private suites, bathrooms and bag screeners for a $4,500 annual fee.
"It typically takes 2,200 footsteps from car seat to plane seat," the website boasts. "For members of the Private Suite, it's 70 footsteps. And they are all peaceful footsteps."

Letters to the editor Friday: Disappointed in incorporation group's tactics

Texto completo: Disappointed in incorporation group's tactics
On my Jan. 28 morning paper, attached to the front page, was a sticker about voting. The sticker read "Want to vote yes or no on becoming a city?" and targeted residents of Wilmington, Whitemarsh, Talahi and Oatland islands. As an islands resident, I tore off the sticker and went to the website only to find the sticker totally misleading.
Warning, read the website carefully. Do not fill out the requested information unless you want to be counted as someone who would log a yes vote. But yes to what?
Quoting from the website: "You are not voting 'Yes' or 'No' on incorporation at this time. You are simply indicating that you wish our legislators to introduce the 'placeholder bill' so that the one-year waiting period for discussion and consideration can being."
In smaller, bold print, you will read the following message: "By clicking sign now, an email will be sent to State Representative Jesse Petrea and State Senator Ben Watson registering your support for the opportunity to continue discussion. If you do not wish the 'placeholder bill' to be introduced by your legislators, you can email them your dissent here."
This sticker and the webpage are deceitful in my opinion. They are also biased.
My point is simple, unless you read this website carefully, by completing the web page you vote yes automatically, but not to incorporate, only for a placeholder bill.
There is no place for me to register a no vote, as in, do not move forward, no placeholder bill.
To vote no, I am required to contact Rep. Petrea, and Sen. Watson directly. I consider this very one sided.
I will contact both Rep. Petrea, and Sen. Watson. I am doing this so that they see that this issue is not being handled in an appropriate manner, and that Island residents are not being treated in a fair manner. If this is how this committee handles business now, how would residents be treated in the future?
Randy Rudd, Savannah
Pay attention to the political games
Most people will agree that the state of our political system is in turmoil. It has American citizens taking sides like opposing schools at a football game. Social media is responsible for the fact that we are able to disagree, too often, with vile insults toward our fellow citizens. The topics include immigration, drugs, laws, morality, personalities, religion, socialism vs. capitalism, etc., among a host of others.
Other than voting for a politician, months or years in the future, our representative form of government gives us voters no immediate ability to do anything, except opine. The poor politician, who looks forward to a future November, must weigh their options, manipulate their points, accentuate the obvious and pray (or wish) it works for their re-election.
In the meantime, we are left to take a side or not. The personal attacks, between those who are unable to change the combative narrative, "should" be subdued, for just that reason. The indisputable fact is, we need each other. That was demonstrated for too short a time after the Sept. 11 attacks. If you believe your side could defeat a greater national attack alone, I question that. We can agree that any group that looks to overthrow America wants this separation to widen.
We are left to see what politicians will do, so they can best be sure they will get re-elected. We watch both sides play offense and defense and all we can do is cheer.
Charles Olenick, Savannah
Disgruntled reader channels a Russian patriot
To all my fellow comrades, life here in what passes for the world's greatest democracy is indeed strange. During the Cold War we thrilled as the Socialist Motherland confronted American capitalism and imperialism all over the world. We managed to get America embroiled into wars it could not win, and the persecution against our comrades was not long lasting thanks to the Supreme Court's decisions. We read our Daily Worker at home in a safe place, concealed in the folds of the New York Times, as we anticipated the demise of American hegemony. But our Soviet leaders, alas, were too weak to prevail.
Now Russia, no longer either csarist nor socialist but oligarchic, under the leadership of ex-Comrade Putin, has managed to make the American president into his stooge and agent and Russia now is able to control American elections and a good deal of American foreign policy. Who would have thought this possible?
Lenin taught us to search always for "useful idiots" in the pursuit of our goals. We found him in Donald Trump and Russia, now more National Socialist than anything else, is reaping the rewards. We can now hold our heads high and without fear: the establishment hates us still, but we have the Oval Office on our side.
Norman Ravitch, Savannah
Expecting serious action from Mueller
The swamp is being drained, but not by the man who promised to do so. President Donald Trump is known for not apologizing or second guessing his own actions. I wonder, though, if he doesn't regret firing FBI Directer James Comey which directly resulted in the creation of the special counsel's office under Robert Mueller.
To use Trump's own words, "we'll see," but I'm betting there is a lot more dredging to be done by Mueller.

A mail-order DNA test unravels a lifetime mystery for ‘Inheritance’ author Dani Shapiro

Texto completo: Of all the millions of people who have spit into a plastic vial and sent their DNA off to have it analyzed, writer Dani Shapiro might be the most prepared for what happened next.
The core of Shapiro’s work — this bestselling author has written 10 books — has always concerned family issues, those tangled emotional webs we weave around each other and the secrets we keep.
“It has been a huge part of what formed me as a writer — I had an obsession with searching and digging, trying to understand,” Shapiro says, noting that half of her books are memoirs about deep, personal exploration. “I idly wondered why (I kept writing memoirs) but those were the books that continued to present themselves to me as necessary. And that comes very much out of not knowing something and writing in order to try to know.”
Part of what she didn’t know was why, with her fair hair and blue eyes, she barely resembled her parents, both Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe — an otherness remarked upon by people throughout her life.
All is revealed when the results of an Ancestry.com test that she took “on a whim” come back: She is not her beloved father’s biological daughter after all, but the product of artificial insemination her parents turned to when they could not conceive. Why that happened and what meaning Shapiro makes of it is the subject of her riveting new memoir, “Inheritance: A Memoir of Genealogy, Paternity, and Love.”
“This discovery poured gasoline over everything I thought I knew and threw a match on it,” she says. “Now I see the whole picture.”
Since its release in January, the book has quickly risen to the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction and has already been optioned by Hollywood, a clear indication that both her writing and the topic of family secrets is speaking to the hearts of millions.
“I certainly wanted it to resonate with people who had been through similar experiences or discovered there were family secrets —everybody seems to have them,” said Shapiro in a phone interview while she was on the road for her national book tour that lands in Southern California for several appearances this week.
“Adoptees, people who discover they were donor conceived, or have half siblings — there are so many of those kinds of secrets tumbling out of the closet right now,” she observes.
More like an avalanche.
She notes that in 2018 alone 7 million Ancestry.com kits were purchased — and that doesn’t take into account what might be sold for other commercial DNA services like 23andMe. (DNA kits were the No. 1 holiday gift last year, too.) Shapiro discovered while researching “Inheritance” that out of the 7 million kits, 14 percent revealed what’s known in that industry as ”NPE,” Not Parent Expected: “That’s a huge number of people. Many of them, like me, were just recreational DNA testing.”
The ease and accessibility of these DNA tests herald a historical shift, she believes. “I think this is a moment in our culture when secrets and the impossibility of secrets is reaching a deafening roar,” Shapiro observes. “Paternity, ethnicity — these were secrets people could keep since the beginning of time, and did. And now that is over. I think in a few decades the idea that there ever were these secrets is going to seem like the most ridiculous thing you’d ever heard.”
Yet the exploration she undertakes in this book is even more universal: At the center is the question: How do heredity and history combine to make us who we are?
Says Shapiro: “I was also very aware that I did not only want people that could directly relate to the material to be readers of this book, because I felt I had learned so much in this really sort of harsh and complicated, and ultimately liberating, journey. I learned so much about identity, and family, and what makes a father a father, and about nature and nurture.”
Anyone who knows Shapiro’s work understands that she was close to her father, who died in an accident when she was 23, and distant from her abusive mother. These are themes that have run throughout her work. Reconciling her experience with her biological makeup was the “emotionally challenging” part of her journey to write this book.
“One of the things I had to contend with was the deep suspicion that I was part of my father’s sadness. The man that I tried so hard to make happy. But I don’t think that diminished in any way the love he had for me,” she says. “The irony is my biological parent is the one I felt a deep disconnection from, while my father, who was not my biological parent, was the one to whom I was connected. I think that my mother looked at me for all of our shared life together and found it very challenging because I was her secret. I was a reminder of their infertility; I was not my father’s child and on some very deep animal level, she knew it.”
There’s a moment in “Inheritance” where a friend tells her, “Everyone feels other,” and that she had been the explorer to come back to teach us all something about what that means. “I very much took that to heart,” she says.

Texto completo: Automakers Pickup trucks, SUVs boost GM profit
General Motors on Wednesday reported a quarterly profit that exceeded Wall Street expectations, thanks to high-margin pickup trucks and small SUVs in the U.S. market and cost-cutting.
All of the No. 1 U.S. automaker's profit came from North America, where those lucrative models helped overcome an overall drop in the number of vehicles it sold. The company's operations in China and South America combined added nothing to the company's bottom line in the quarter.
The stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, driven by strong U.S. results, stood in contrast to the job cuts GM has begun to make in its salaried and hourly workforces.
The Detroit automaker has received political blowback, including from President Trump, after announcing in late November it would not allocate new product to five plants in North America that mostly produce less-popular sedan models, indicating they will probably close.
GM said on Wednesday that China's $300 million in operating earnings in the fourth quarter was offset by other international markets. It sold fewer vehicles in China, its largest market by volume, and said weak currencies in South America had also affected results.
On Wednesday, GM reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.1 billion, or $1.40 per share, vs. a loss of $5.2 billion, or $3.65 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, it earned $1.43 per share, above the $1.22 analysts polled by Refinitiv IBES had expected.
It reported a fourth-quarter loss in 2017 to adjust for an overhaul of the U.S. tax system. Excluding those charges, the automaker had reported net income of $2.4 billion.

Toyota profit decreases despite strong sales
Toyota's fiscal third-quarter profit plunged to 180.9 billion yen ($12.6 billion), about a fifth of what the Japanese automaker earned the previous year, despite relatively solid sales, the Japanese automaker said Wednesday.
Toyota Motor Corp.'s October-December profit in 2017 had totaled 941.8 billion yen, helped by perks from U.S. tax restructuring.
Toyota, Japan's No. 1 automaker, said profit for the latest quarter was also hurt by unrealized gains and losses in equity securities.
Quarterly sales totaled 7.8 trillion yen ($71 billion), up nearly 3 percent from 7.6 trillion the previous year, according to the maker of the Camry sedan, Prius hybrid and Lexus luxury models.
Toyota lowered its profit for the fiscal year through March to 1.87 trillion yen ($17 billion), down from 2.5 trillion yen in the previous fiscal year and below its earlier projection for 2.3 trillion yen ($21 billion) profit.
Last week, Japanese rival Honda Motor Co. reported fiscal third-quarter profit fell 71 percent from a year earlier to 168 billion yen ($1.5 billion).

Health care Boston Scientific reports income growth
Boston Scientific on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter net income of $386 million, after reporting a loss in the same period a year earlier.
On a per-share basis, the Marlborough, Mass.-based company said it had net income of 27 cents. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, came to 39 cents per share.
The medical-device manufacturer posted revenue of $2.56 billion in the period.
For the quarter ending in April, Boston Scientific expects its per-share earnings to range from 35 cents to 36 cents.

Online subscriptions accelerated for a fourth quarter for the New York Times Co., prompting it to set an ambitious new goal: hitting 10 million subscriptions by 2025. The publisher of the eponymous newspaper added 265,000 new digital subscriptions last quarter, the biggest increase since the months right after the 2016 election. Fourth-quarter revenue increased 10 percent when excluding the impact of an extra week in 2017, with subscription sales up 5 percent and advertising sales up 11 percent. Digital advertising revenue was up 23 percent, while print advertising revenue decreased 10.2 percent.

How reporters should cover Trump voters

Texto completo: The news media’s collective shock that Donald Trump won in 2016 was evidence of how out of touch most reporters were with the less affluent, less educated, rural parts of the country, where white voter rage galvanized into votes that made him the 45th president. In the days after the election, there was anguished self-examination in many newsrooms and vows to cover the parts of the United States that had been mistakenly overlooked.


But more than two years later, the same question bedevils journalism: Can our tribe cover their tribe?


The president does have his amen corner on right-wing talk radio, Fox News and Breitbart, megaphones that help keep his base rock solid and reticulate his warped version of the facts and truth. But in the rest of the news media, there is little evidence that reporters have fulfilled their pledge to report on and reflect the interests and values of the people who voted for him. There have been some good dispatches from the heartland, but too often what is published amounts to the proverbial “toe touch in Appalachia.”


I was powerfully moved by a recent article in The New Yorker about journalism by LBJ biographer Robert Caro. He described how he couldn’t really understand President Lyndon Johnson’s native Texas Hill Country until he and his wife actually moved there from New York for three years. The locals had a derisive name for the reporters who parachuted in and out: “portable journalists.” There are great reporters who defy this description.


The rhythm of the internet has made spending a week reporting a story a rare luxury. But our cocooning on the liberal coasts has intensified because of other factors in the past decade. One is the virtual disappearance of local newspapers, their business models irrevocably broken by the disappearance of print advertising. The Cincinnati Post shuttered in 2007, the Kansas City Kansan two years later — just two of hundreds of local papers in Red America that have merged or closed. Researching my book “Merchants of Truth,” I interviewed reporters from The Denver Post and the St. Paul Pioneer Press who were protesting outside Alden Global Capital, the Manhattan vulture firm that had acquired the papers and gutted their newsrooms.


With the possible exception of The Wall Street Journal, the most influential national papers reflect the values of the cities where they are headquartered, New York and Washington. Politico published maps of the ideological clustering of the top newsrooms. In the same article, FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver pointed out, “As of 2013, only 7 percent of (journalists) identified as Republicans.” Does this contribute to groupthink? Sure it does.


The rise of all digital news organizations has actually intensified the clustering. Almost all are in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Some reporters never leave their screens to do on-the-ground reporting. But other outlets, including Vice News, do bring their audience up close to the different and difficult realities of life in rural America.


Reporters who have contracts with MSNBC and CNN sometimes appear on panels, wedged between Democratic partisans and prosecutors who have already judged the president guilty of grave crimes. They blend and create an appearance of bias. It’s hard for viewers to keep them straight. Twitter is just an open invitation for politically inflamed hyperbole.


On the whole, enterprise reporting on President Donald Trump has been excellent. To cover him, reporters need to be smart about politics, policy and international affairs, but also students of criminal law and procedure. It’s a harder job than it’s ever been. Think how much less we would know about special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian meddling in 2016 without the deep investigations published by The New York Times and The Washington Post.


The president is a master at media manipulation, a talent gained on “The Apprentice.” So determined to dominate each news cycle, he seamlessly abandons his preference for “Fox & Friends” to give occasional interviews, such as the one he did Thursday with The Times, to the very places he has criticized in more than 1,000 tweets, including using the term “fake news” hundreds of times.


Although editors have pledged to dial back the reactive coverage that revolves around the president’s words and tweets, they remain addicted. After all, they are swimming in Trump-generated revenue, clicks and ratings. “I remain astonished by the ability of this former reality TV star to be our assignment editor,” bemoaned Kyle Pope, editor of the Columbia Journalism Review.


One way out of the reactive cycle is to report the story from the places where the pro-Trump and Trump-curious live, to cover the facts and truths of their lives. The Caro approach offers a way forward for news organizations to find contributors from, or place correspondents in, the communities that support the president, to soak up the sense and sensibility of undercovered America. That way, we mix with the other tribe. The 2020 campaign, already upon us, offers a great opportunity to fulfill the pledge we made after the last election.
Abramson is a journalist and author of the new book “Merchants of Truth.”

Texto completo: President Donald Trump began Tuesday's State of the Union address without an introduction from Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a break from tradition according to the Speaker's office.
The president is usually introduced two times before the State of the Union address: Once by the sergeant-at-arms and once by the Speaker of the House, according to the Wall Street Journal.
"It appears he blew through that custom," a spokesman for Pelosi told the publication.
Last year, when Republicans controlled the House, Trump paused at the beginning of his speech for an introduction from then-Speaker Paul Ryan.
This year's break from tradition was reported by the New York Times' Nicholas Fandos: "Trump was evidently ready to get going tonight. The House speaker customarily introduces the president to the joint session of Congress before he begins to speak. Instead, Trump took the lectern and just dove right in, leaving Pelosi a little confused. "
Numerous social media commentators also noticed:
More: Nancy Pelosi clapped at Trump during State of the Union. The memes quickly followed
More: State of the Union: Gillibrand uses viral eye roll clip to raise money for presidential bid

Texto completo: Linfield College professor Daniel Pollack-Pelzner is declaring the 1964 film "Mary Poppins" racist, accusing Julie Andrews of "blacking up" her face with soot while dancing with chimney sweeps. In a New York Times op-ed titled "'Mary Poppins,' and a Nanny's Shameful Flirting With Blackface," he slammed the dance scene where Poppins joins Dick Van Dyke's Bert for the song "Step In Time." The literature professor linked the scene to racism in P.L. Travers' novels, which he claims "associate chimney sweeps' blackened faces with racial caricatures." Many fans of the classic family film fired back on Twitter.

Texto completo: For two consecutive years, the Travel section of The New York Times has released a diverse list of its top 52 places to visit. (They also send one lucky traveler to all 52 spots can you imagine?)
The newspaper enlists editors, writers and photographers to build the list based on their travel experiences and story assignments. What emerges is a mix of destinations that are "aspirational, newly intriguing and perhaps threatened."
Some are world-class cities known for food and wine (Santa Barbara, yay) or art and opera (Munich); others are places having their moment, such as Panama and Portugal's Azores. The latter two also made Indagare's list of new destinations for 2019.
Finally, many selections were made because of a new development or improved accessibility. In Puerto Rico, for example, Lin-Manuel Miranda reprised his lead role in "Hamilton" with performances at San Juan's Centro de Bellas Artes Luis A. Ferré last month. And in Eilat, Israel, a new airport makes it easier to access the Red Sea resort instead. You know, instead of driving through the Negev Desert.
With that, here are the top 10 places to visit in 2019, according to The New York Times. Find the entire list of 52 at www.nytimes.com.

When Mia's parents find jobs managing a small California motel that includes a place to stay, they are excited and hope they will finally be able to find their place in America. The arrangement turns out to be a nightmare, as the motel owner is cruel and demands more and more from Mia's parents, ultimately leading to Mia working the front desk while they handle all the cleaning and repairs. Mia must use her ingenuity to help the longtime motel residents, fellow Chinese immigrants and her family find safe places they can call their own. Ages 9-14.

Texto completo: For more than a year, congressional Democrats have pushed to unlock a mystery they said could reveal whether Donald Trump had advance knowledge of a meeting his eldest son had in the summer of 2016 with a Russian lawyer promising damaging material about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The key, they said, was to determine who was using blocked telephone numbers to speak to Donald Trump Jr. before and after the meeting in Trump Tower, suggesting he may have communicated with his father on a private line.
But Senate investigators have concluded the blocked calls were conversations between Trump Jr. and two longtime business associates: Howard Lorber, a real estate investor who has done business in Russia, and Brian France, the chief executive of NASCAR, according to two people familiar with the determination.
The findings were first reported by CNN and ABC News.
France did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for Lorber said Friday that the real estate magnate "does not recall conversations with Donald Trump Jr. in the summer of 2016," adding that Lorber never discussed "any Russian matters" with the president's son.
Lorber is a longtime friend of the elder Trump, and the two went to Moscow in 1996 to scout for a real estate deal that never materialized, according to people familiar with the visit. The trip helped spur Trump's interest in seeking other ways over the years to build a tower in Moscow.
President Trump has long denied he knew about the Trump Tower gathering in 2016, which was attended by Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. At the meeting, Trump Jr. was expecting a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin to share dirt on Clinton, he later told Congress, but she instead pressed him on a U.S. law levying sanctions on Russia for human rights abuses.
The president and his allies seized on conclusions by congressional investigators, saying the findings undercut Democratic efforts to raise questions about links between Trump and Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign.
"The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. ... Really sad," the president tweeted late Thursday.
"This Witch Hunt must end!" he added.
In his own tweet, Trump Jr. wrote: "More of the Democrat's #fakenews narrative disappearing before their eyes. I wonder how many more false leaks will pop now to keep their dreams alive???"
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that his father had no knowledge of the June 2016 meeting with the Russians.
Democrats, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who now chairs the House intelligence committee, were skeptical of Trump Jr.'s account, noting that his first explanations of the meetings were misleading.
In a July 8, 2017, statement to The New York Times, Trump Jr., said meeting participants "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children." The statement did not mention that he was promised damaging information about Clinton -- or that Trump Jr. had responded enthusiastically to the offer.
"If it's what you say I love it," he wrote in an email to an associate who offered to set up the meeting.
Democrats raised questions about phone calls made by Trump Jr. on June 6, 2016, that they thought might show that Trump's son informed his father about the meeting in advance.
At 4:04 p.m. that day, phone records show, Emin Agalarov, a wealthy Russian who helped arrange the meeting, called Trump Jr.
Phone records show Trump Jr. called Agalarov at 4:31 p.m. Between those two calls, phone records show that Trump Jr. was connected with a blocked phone number.
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not remember whom he spoke with at that time, but others testified at the time that his father uses a blocked line.
Democratic members of the House intelligence committee pushed for information on the blocked numbers for more than a year. But House Republicans rebuffed efforts to subpoena the phone records, according to Schiff.
Schiff told MSNBC that he would continue his efforts to "find out who Don Jr. was talking to about that meeting at Trump Tower."
"Those conversations could have taken place over the phone, or they could have taken place by Don Jr. walking down the hall to talk to his dad," he added Thursday.

Evolution of 'fortuitous' an unfortunate development for linguistic purists

Texto completo: During a recent NFL playoff game veteran NBC sportscaster Al Michaels reported that an official's placement of the football had been "very fortuitous" for the Philadelphia Eagles because it had given them a first down.
For linguistic purists watching the telecast - and, yes, some of them do follow football - Michaels' use of "fortuitous" to mean "fortunate" was highly unfortunate. They insist that "fortuitous" means "occurring by chance," not "beneficial." Thus, having a branch fall randomly onto your car is fortuitous, even though it's unfortunate.
When "fortuitous" first appeared in English during the 1600s, it meant only "occurring by chance," and this meaning is still common today, as in a recent New Yorker story noting that Vermont gubernatorial candidate Christine Hallquist had braved "a fortuitous health calamity."
But during the past decades, more and more people have also been using "fortuitous" to mean "occurring by lucky chance." A post on Bubba Watson's blog last year noted that fellow golfer Graeme McDowell had thanked a fan after a ball had taken "a fortuitous bounce" off the fan's head." (I'm wondering whether the bounce was as fortuitous for the fan as it was for McDowell.)
Given the similarities between "fortuitous," "fortunate" and "felicitous," it's easy to see why this semantic transition from "occurring by chance" to "occurring by good luck" evolved.
Today only the stuffiest purist would object to the use of "fortuitous" to mean "happening by lucky chance." In a 2005 survey, 68 percent of the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, for instance, approved this sentence: "The photographer felt that it was very fortuitous that she was in place to take the winning photo," (meaning that she was lucky to be in the right place at the right time).
But always avoid the use of "fortuitous" to mean "fortunate" when chance occurrence is not involved. Last December, the New York Times reported that the partnership between Ohio State University and its retiring head football coach Urban Meyer had been "one of the most fortuitous marriages in recent college sports." (Although Meyer wasn't expecting to get a call from Ohio State in 2011, his hiring hardly occurred by chance.)
Whenever you use "fortuitous," always provide enough context to make your meaning clear. A vague sentence such as "Our meeting was fortuitous" can leave people foggy, like a golf ball shot to the head. Boink!

Four Cities in a Tight Race to See Who Cares the Least

Texto completo: Some cities are not all in on the Super Bowl this year. And those places include the city where the game is being held and the city that one of the two teams calls home.
But which city is offering up the most indifference to Sunday's matchup between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams? There are four chief candidates.
St. Louis
St. Louis was the home of the Rams for 21 years, but more recently not the home of the Rams for the past three years. Fans there are still angry their team left after the 2015 season. Few are excited about the Super Bowl, and fewer still expect to root for the Rams.
"Since the Rams left, I've watched little to no football. If it's on a television, I look elsewhere," the former Rams fan Dan Buffa wrote in an essay on KSDK titled, "Why I Won't Be Watching the Super Bowl."
Fans are especially bitter about the way the Rams' owner, Stan Kroenke, a Missouri native, left town with the team: with a flurry of dismissive comments about the city's economic prospects. In an objection to a plan to finance a new stadium in St. Louis, he wrote: "Any N.F.L. club that signs on to this proposal in St. Louis will be well on the road to financial ruin, and the league will be harmed."
And to many onetime Rams fans, it seemed as if the team didn't turn on the real effort to win until the move. Sure, the St. Louis Rams went to two Super Bowls, winning in the 1999 season. But after 12 straight seasons at .500 and below in St. Louis, the team waited till it got to Los Angeles to fire Coach Jeff Fisher and bring in the young genius Sean McVay, who brought immediate success.
St. Louis fans don't feel much good will toward the Patriots, either, since that was the team that beat St. Louis in its last trip to the Super Bowl, in 2002. That Rams team, known as the Greatest Show on Turf, was a 14-point favorite. And many former Rams players, including Marshall Faulk, have contended that New England cheated by filming the Rams' walk-through the day before the game.
"Is there anywhere in the rule book that both teams can lose?" a fan named James Heredia asked CBS.
New Orleans
Falling a game short of the Super Bowl is painful. When a major reason is a blown call, it stings even more. The agony of losing the N.F.C. conference championship game to the Rams has led many Saints fans to turn their back on the big game.
Don't believe us. Believe the governor.
"I'll be honest -- I don't know anyone who has interest in watching the game in our entire state," Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana told USA Today. He added the opinion that "it was the worst call in the history of the N.F.L."
It was only two weeks ago, but to refresh your memory: Late in a tied game, with the Saints driving, Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman slammed into New Orleans receiver Tommylee Lewis. It looked like pass interference or a helmet-to-helmet hit, or both. But there was no call, the pass was ruled incomplete, and the Saints had to settle for a field goal. The Rams had time to match that field goal, then won in overtime.
On Wednesday, Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the N.F.L., acknowledged the officiating crew messed up on the play.
The loss, combined with the recent trade request of the Pelicans star Anthony Davis, led Jeff Duncan of The Times-Picayune to write: "With the notable exception of the fall of 2005 when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city, I can't think of a worse period in our city's sports history."
Eater New Orleans offered a list of "12 Places to Avoid Super Bowl LIII," bars and restaurants that promise not to show the game on any of their televisions. In some cases, they will instead show a replay of the Saints' championship from nine years ago.
Nola.com has 25 reasons not to watch the Super Bowl, but "could come up with 325."
There's enough disdain in New Orleans that fans are using words like "boycott" and saying they hope they can help hold the Super Bowl ratings down to a record low. But even mass participation is unlikely to make a decisive impact: The New Orleans area has a population of a little over a million, and the Super Bowl regularly draws more than 50 million.
Los Angeles
O.K., it's overstating it a little to say Los Angeles isn't excited about going to the Super Bowl. After all, thousands of fans waited in long lines this week for a pregame rally.
But while other cities virtually stop when their team makes the big game, Los Angeles has reacted with a comparative shrug.
After only three seasons back in town, the Rams haven't sunk into the city's bones the way, say, the Packers and the Steelers have in their football-mad hometowns.
And, hey, LeBron James just came back to the Lakers after missing five weeks with an injury.
The Los Angeles area, home to roughly 13 million people, has 11 major professional sports teams and prominent college programs. Many residents came from somewhere else, and brought their allegiances, perhaps even to the Patriots, with them.
Some fans chose other teams during the two decades the N.F.L. was absent from Los Angeles. As Philip Nowlen told The New York Times's California Today newsletter, "The years without a team led me to fan commitments to the 49ers and the Pats. Maybe after time passes ... maybe."
While the Rams drew a robust 72,000 fans a game this season, playing in the cavernous Coliseum meant they were at 77 percent of capacity, 31st of the 32 teams in the N.F.L.
Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald got some attention this week by proclaiming that L.A. is "a football town now." But his avowal is less interesting than the fact that he was asked about it at all. No one asked Tom Brady if Boston planned to follow this year's Super Bowl.
Atlanta
It hasn't even been two years since the Atlanta Falcons blew a 28-3 lead over the Patriots and transformed a third-quarter Super Bowl score into a lasting slur.
So perhaps Atlanta can be forgiven if it is greeting anything about any Super Bowl -- especially a Patriots-involved Super Bowl -- with only so much good cheer.
Yes, downtown and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport are glimmering under a global spotlight, and the city, rightly proud of its hospitality tradition, is eager to show it can be the flawless host of a Super Bowl it worked so hard to earn. Mercedes-Benz Stadium, just two seasons old and already a crown jewel of Southern sports, will be on display for all to see.
"Everything I've been getting so far is superpositive," said Jessie Tuggle, the beloved linebacker who played his entire professional career for the Falcons and retired after the 2000 season. "I think people like being around people, and there are so many people around. They just love the N.F.L. experience."
And yet. Cue a new round of gripes over traffic. Trigger even more critiques of the Falcons' middling performances of late, and wonder how so many Super Bowl events seem so out of reach for so many football fans. Stir the complaints over the halftime show, and how and why Maroon 5 landed the biggest gig in a city with one of the country's richest music scenes.
It is even a moment when Atlanta's prized export, Coca-Cola, is a target for trolling by Pepsi, a major N.F.L. sponsor that has made no secret of its pleasure over a big week in one particular city. ("Look who's in town for Super Bowl LIII," read one Pepsi advertisement outside a Coke-sponsored shrine to Coke.)
But even with all of that -- the Pepsi flowing, the traffic slowing, the Falcons sputtering, Maroon 5 just being Maroon 5 -- hey, at least the Saints aren't playing. Alan Blinder

At 14, Katarina Tonks thought she was going crazy. A teenager with an overactive imagination in a small New Jersey town, Tonks wondered if it was normal to have so many stories in her head. So she talked to her psychologist mother, who recommended she take up writing. A quick internet search led her to Wattpad, an online social platform where anyone can write and share stories.
"I opened up a document that day and started writing," says Tonks, now 23. "It totally changed the way I was expressing my imagination and the way I was imagining these characters. It turned into my outlet." An outlet that just happens to have some 70 million readers -- many of whom aren't shy about sharing their opinions.
Tonks found that out when at 15 she started writing her second Wattpad story, "Death Is My BFF." The dark romance exploring a relationship between the Angel of Death and a young woman caught on with Wattpad readers, who shared thoughts on their favorite characters and plot twists as Tonks expanded the story into a book series. Based on fan response -- plus the input of a professional editor -- Tonks rewrote the series, whose books in their original and updated forms have racked up nearly 62 million reads on Wattpad.

It was only a matter of time before Hollywood took notice. Last year, Wattpad Studios -- which is responsible for adapting the platform's most successful stories for the entertainment industry -- brought Tonks' story to television producer Paul Shapiro, who then hammered out an acquisition deal for "Death Is My BFF" with Sony Pictures Television.
"[Shapiro] told me on the phone he had certain criteria and mine hit the mark in every spot he wanted," Tonks says.
Whether Tonks' project will be produced is still unknown, but it wouldn't be the first Wattpad story to go to Hollywood.
Last fall's Hulu teen thriller "Light as a Feather" was based on a 2013 Wattpad story written by Zoe Aarsen. And Netflix's teen rom-com "The Kissing Booth," came from Beth Reekles' 2011 Wattpad story, written when she was 15. It did so well on Netflix that the normally secretive streamer put out the word that "The Kissing Booth" was the streamer's most re-watched film of 2018.
Beyond its handful of higher-profile productions, including a feature film coming this spring, Wattpad estimates that nearly 1,000 of its stories have been turned into traditional books, TV shows, films and other digital content. It's partnered with NBCUniversal, SYFY, CW Seed and others to develop film and TV projects, and last month launched its own publishing imprint, Wattpad Books. Already, six Wattpad Books titles are planned for 2019, including LGBTQ fantasy and mystery stories.
"Wattpad Books is one way that we are continuously becoming and expanding into a more full-stacked entertainment company. ... From creation to distribution to monetization, you will see that continue," says Allen Lau, Wattpad's co-founder and CEO. "Ultimately, we want to make sure we are helping our writers advance their career in as many ways as possible."

Content treasure trove
A massive social network for readers and writers, Wattpad -- with more than 500 million stories in more than 50 languages -- has become a treasure trove of original content for Hollywood. Women 35 and younger make up the overwhelming majority of its users. Wattpad analyzes what its users are reading and how they're engaging with stories to determine trends in fiction storytelling and identify potential bestsellers. Wattpad's emergence in Hollywood underscores the rise of data-driven storytelling in a creative industry that traditionally has relied on inspiration and the instincts of a small group of largely homogeneous development executives.
About five years ago, the company began to invest in machine learning -- a form of artificial intelligence in which programs analyze and learn from data. Machine learning enabled Wattpad to better recommend stories based on users' reading habits, which increased time spent on the platform. Wattpad also developed what it calls Story DNA technology, which deconstructs stories -- examining sentence structure, word use and grammar -- to find the most popular trends in fiction and the next bestsellers.
One day, a Wattpad employee noticed that 5% of all reading on the site was going toward a romance story called "After" by Anna Todd. The story, which began in 2013 as One Direction fan fiction -- written a chapter a day by Todd on her smartphone -- has accumulated more than 1.5 billion reads on Wattpad and was published as a series of novels in 2014 by Simon & Schuster imprint Gallery Books, earning a spot on the New York Times bestseller list. In April, "After" will become a feature film, with Hero Fiennes Tiffin and Josephine Langford starring in the Paramount Pictures release.
For Wattpad, the success of "After" became an indicator that its stories could easily translate into other mediums.
Another indicator popped up in the Philippines, where a data-driven TV series called "Wattpad Presents" has adapted some of the site's top-trending titles -- close to 80 stories over 250 episodes and six seasons -- since 2014.
Wattpad was launched in 2006 by Lau and Ivan Yuen. Back then, the goal of the Toronto-based company was for people to read and share stories on their mobile phones. It took years before they understood the power of the data Wattpad accumulated every day from readers and writers.
"We realized that with millions of stories and billions of data points, it's impossible for a human to figure out exactly what's going on," says Lau. "A machine is very equipped to analyze and find patterns from billions of data points.
"We know where these people are, how they read for example," Lau adds. "Are they binge reading or are they just dropping off after a chapter and coming back in a day."
Nearly three years ago, after the success of "After" and "Wattpad Presents," the company launched Wattpad Studios to focus on adapting the most successful and binge-worthy stories for book publishing, gaming, TV and film.
"I'm not sure there's anyone that can really look at such a giant library of fiction that we have and really derive the trends," says the head of Wattpad Studios, Aron Levitz. "[Machine learning] allows us to be so far out in front of anybody else that we're really able to not only find great stories though data, but great stories from people from amazing backgrounds all over the world."
Levitz also touts the platform's engagement levels, saying the site's built-in audience takes out some of the inherent risks for creative industries. Each month, the Wattpad community spends 22 billion minutes consuming and creating content. The site's structure allows readers to comment down to the paragraph level on stories, which becomes data that can inform the development process.
"When I'm taking a story [from] 100,000 words down to a 90-page film script, something's got to go," Levitz says. "The [Wattpad] audience can actually show us the parts they were attached to and the parts that maybe we can cut without losing audience.
"It's not about taking away those brilliant creative layers that directors and showrunners and actors, directors of photography, bring to the process," Levitz adds. "But in that moment of darkness, that every writers room has at some point on what to cut, this can be an informative piece of data."
Wattpad's Story DNA technology is how Aarsen's story "Light as a Feather, Stiff as a Board" -- which made its way to Hulu as "Light as a Feather" and was then published by Simon & Schuster as a traditional book in October -- was found. Levitz says the story's success demonstrates Wattpad's blend of the art of creativity and the science of data.
"It has all the good parts of teen drama, some horror, some suspense. It has all the writings of a great book and, of course, we find this through data," he says. "You're talking about millions of reads in under six months. ... You're looking at half a billion minutes of total reading time on the story."
The thriller about a slumber party game that goes wrong for five teens was written in 2013 under the pseudonym Alexandra Fletcher by Aarsen, who studied film at New York University and worked for years in digital marketing while continuing to write. After publishing a first draft of "Light as a Feather" on Wattpad, Aarsen found rapid and intense engagement from readers. Five years later, the story is still one of the 25 most-read paranormal stories on the site, Levitz says.
"Writing in general is really isolating; you're alone and creating a story. On Wattpad, you're getting a lot of feedback every time you publish from your readers," Aarsen says. "If you're being clever and planning a twist and they guess it, you'll have to work harder."
Aarsen says there was interest in developing the story for television almost immediately through Kelsey Grammer's production company, Grammnet. Grammer worked with screenwriter R. Lee Fleming Jr. to turn the Wattpad story into a TV pitch, and the series was brought to life with AwesomenessTV and Hulu.
"I've adapted things before, and sometimes just because something is a good book doesn't necessarily translate easily into a series or into a movie," says Fleming, who's written other teen TV shows and films, including 1999's "She's All That." "With this one, I was really fortunate with the way things were set up. ... All of that was sort of ripe to be adapted."
Says AwesomenessTV's cohead, Shelley Zimmerman: "[Wattpad] delivered this underlying IP with a strong fanbase and wonderful characters."

'A cultural compass'
The science of Wattpad -- using data to detect trends in storytelling -- doesn't just smooth out the production process; it also helps shatter traditional barriers to Hollywood and the publishing industry.
"When you have the same figuratively 10 people who've chosen what we all watch on TV or go to the box office to see for the last 100 years, when you let audiences democratize the process, they start finding what they want," Levitz says. "A lot of the things that get written on Wattpad are written by a writer who doesn't see themselves reflected ... who doesn't see themselves on TV."
As co-president and executive producer of Wise Entertainment, an independent studio focused on developing "everything that is not white male" for film and TV, Mauricio Mota says he constantly monitors Wattpad.
"For us, Hollywood is still designed around a lot of dogmas -- it has to be IP, it has to have lots of celebrities, it has to be a New York Times bestselling book," Mota says. "We keep hearing those 'big truths,' but at the same time the new approach is what really makes the bar go up and what makes things change. [Wattpad has] a huge hand in the pulse of new authors and new themes and new characters and new genres. It's a cultural compass."
Hila Lifshitz-Assaf, a New York University assistant professor who specializes in technological innovation, says crowdsourcing is democratizing creativity and eliminating social barriers to creative fields. "It's much less about connections and who you know."
But Lifshitz-Assaf also warns against not having a clear policy related to non-human contributors on platforms like Wattpad. She says it could endanger human writing and creativity.
She references a writing competition prominently displayed on Wattpad last fall -- "Write With Zo" -- which challenged users to write in collaboration with a Microsoft artificial intelligence program.
"It's framed as, 'Let's write together,' but it's unclear about the writing style," she says. "I think we will have humans competing with artificial platforms. ... Soon they will start writing stories as well."
Lau, however, insists that humans will always be part of the creative process, saying that technology will only help writers improve their craft, assisting with everything from grammar checks to writer's block.
"A movie, TV show or writing is an art. There will always be humans involved," Lau says. "But what we see, the machine is so capable, our Story DNA is so capable, we can turn the humans into superheroes."

Texto completo: Tim Warren, a former Washington Post copy editor who also wrote book reviews, jazz, rock and bluegrass criticism, food articles, sports features and personality profiles for The Post and other publications, died Jan. 26 at a hospice center in Rockville, Md. He was 67.
The cause was cancer, said a sister, Kyle Ahrold.
Between 1980 and 2010, Mr. Warren was a Post copy editor in sports, foreign and national news, with the exception of a hiatus at the Baltimore Sun as book editor and feature writer from 1987 to 1994.
His 1998 freelance profile in the Washingtonian magazine of New York Times columnist Russell Baker earned him an award from the Washington chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. He was also a finalist for a James Beard Foundation Award for a 1999 feature story published in Smithsonian magazine titled "True Grits."
Timothy Philip Michael Blanton was born in Miami on Aug. 19, 1951; he soon took the surname Warren from his stepfather, an Air Force officer. He accompanied his family on military assignments before settling in Alexandria, Va., where he graduated in 1969 from T.C. Williams High School.
He later wrote in the Washingtonian about the 25th anniversary of the 1971 Virginia state championship football team of his high school alma mater. The team was made up of black and white players grouped together, many of them unwillingly. The team was undefeated in 13 games and unscored upon in nine, and was said to have helped improve citywide race relations. (The team became the subject of the 2000 movie "Remember the Titans," starring Denzel Washington.)
Mr. Warren attended Virginia Commonwealth and George Mason universities. From 1976 to 1980, he was an editorial assistant on the national news desk and a jazz and rock critic at the Washington Star newspaper. In recent years, he had been a consultant and part-time editor for the Pew Charitable Trusts.
Survivors include his wife of 33 years, Lettie Holman, and their two sons, Nicholas and Matthew Warren, all of Silver Spring, Md.; three brothers; and three sisters.
As an occasional food writer, Mr. Warren was said to be ever in search of the best wood-fired pizza ovens and New York-style delicatessens.
He disliked culinary snobbery. At an awards dinner for his "True Grits" story, his sister said, a diner at his table commented disparagingly, "Ah grits . . . the polenta of the South," when she learned the subject of Mr. Warren's food feature.
A few minutes later, polenta was served at the awards dinner by an Italian chef. "Ah polenta," commented Mr. Warren, "the grits of Italy."

Suspect arrested in woman's death
Police have arrested a person wanted after the death of a woman Thursday morning that authorities are treating as a homicide.
Authorities provided no details of the suspect, but said that person will be identified after the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office files formal charges. Someone found the woman about 10 a.m. Thursday in the porch area of the Grace Lutheran Church in the 1900 block of Carlson Boulevard.
The woman had visible trauma on her, police said Friday. Police arrested the suspect at the scene. No other information was released.
The homicide is the fourth in 2019 in Richmond, all of them since Jan. 19.

FAA investigates near-miss incident
Federal Aviation Administration officials are investigating a near-miss earlier this month between two single-engine planes over Oakland, authorities said.
At 3:36 p.m. Jan. 21, a southeast-bound Mooney 20P plane and a northeast-bound Cessna 172 were both flying at 2,000 feet over the city, an FAA spokesman said Thursday.
"The Cessna descended to avoid the Mooney," the statement read. "Our review indicates the closest vertical separation between the two aircraft was 500 feet."
Officials at the Oakland International Airport control tower filed a report about the near-miss later that day and investigated it the next day, and the FAA's quality-assurance office in Seattle also looked into the near-miss, the spokesman said.
According to FlightAware.com data, the Mooney was on a return flight from Charles M. Schulz Sonoma County Airport to San Carlos Airport when it encountered the Skyhawk-model Cessna, which was flying up from Palo Alto Airport.
The New York Times first reported the near-miss Thursday in an article alleging that the recent federal government shutdown affected investigations into airplane and highway crashes.

BERKELEY
Man shot several times
A 21-year-old man was shot numerous times Friday afternoon in South Berkeley, authorities said.
He was taken to a hospital and was reportedly in serious condition. His name has not been released and police have not said where he lived.
The shooting happened about 1:15 p.m. Friday in the area of Derby and Grant streets. Police responding to 911 calls found the man wounded, Lt. Peter Hong said.
Police were investigating if the man was shot by someone in a vehicle or someone who confronted him on the street. A motive has not been determined, and no arrests have been made.
Streets in the area were shut down while police investigated the shooting.
Authorities said it was the first shooting in Berkeley this year where someone was actually found to have been hit by gunfire.
Anyone with information is asked to call police at 510-981-5900.

When a poet shows he is jealous

Texto completo: Everyone loves poetry. In theory. Not that anyone actually wants their child to end up a poet.
In that sense, we — ever since I was an undergrad, I confess to occasionally publishing poems in little magazines with, as Calvin Trillin used to say, circulations in the high two figures — are like guitar players. Fine with parents if Junior wants to pluck a little. Just God forbid he should try to take it on the road.
But we continue to exalt poetry. To treat it as the best manmade thing in the world. As I wrote in “Poetry in Orbit,” a poem published in Gulf Stream Literary Magazine — a prose poem, as we dub it in the trade: “The coolest job is astronaut, right? Well, astronaut-poet. Every child’s dream. ‘Cause no one calls it astronautics in motion when someone has a fluid tennis swing. They call it poetry. In motion. As opposed to on the page no one reads. But poetry, still. Someone has to do the job.”
In recent decades, poetry has been called upon not just to be the best stuff ever but to take on its ancient task of bucking up a nation in times of despair. Good luck with that one, fellow poets. I’m not up to the task.
But one prominent poet, much-published in non-little magazines and a writing professor at the University of Florida, is up to the task of doing hatchet jobs on poets who are not very good ones, and that’s fine, a necessary tonic for the vast majority of poetry criticism, which often amounts to what’s known in the literary dodge as “logrolling”: writing only good reviews of peers who one runs into often at the hotel bars at our annual drinking conferences.
So The New York Times’ editors knew what they were about when they assigned William Logan to review last month “THE FLAME: Poems, Notebooks, Lyrics, Drawings,” a posthumous collection by the late songwriter, and, yes, poet Leonard Cohen.
Leonard Cohen was not a very good poet. But he was a great songwriter, and lyricist, and singer, who lived an extraordinary life.
Few — none, that I know of — great songwriters are also great poets. Bob Dylan is not even a good poet, nor is Joni Mitchell, nor … Ira Gershwin. But I don’t begrudge at all Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. That was for his words as sung, not as read. Just don’t bother to read his scribblings as such. Open any little mag if you want to read a good, even great, poem.
What Logan and many other Cohen-despising poet/critics are is jealous. Cohen, who started out as a poet, actually did very well at it, commercially. When his “Collected Poems, 1956-1968” came out, it sold 20,000 copies in just the summer of 1968, when it was published. Most poets don’t sell that many books in a lifetime. It was on my mother’s bookshelf. I remember one good line: something that was “as empty as the drawer where I used to keep my opium.” The poems were written when he was between 15 and 20. He got smart; saw that there was no real career in poetry as such — all poets have to teach, or, like Wallace Stevens, sell insurance, to keep body and soul together. He picked up a guitar instead, and that worked out fabulously.
But in his hatchet job, Logan pretends Cohen wasn’t any good at all: “He wasn’t much of a singer, either; but the gravelly renderings of his lyrics gradually attracted a mass audience that seemed more like a cult. … At any moment of the day, ‘Suzanne’ is probably playing in an elevator somewhere.” Unlike Logan’s poems. But not a good singer? That’s like saying Neil Young is not a “good” singer, or Dylan, for that matter. A generation left Broadway show tunes behind, for good reason. They covered “Hallelujah” to the point where it was overplayed. Because it is a really great song.

Texto completo: Former Gov. Jerry Brown said he looked forward to
retiring to his Colusa County ranch and had no interest in joining the crowded 2020
Democratic primary field.
In one of his first public appearances since leaving office, former California Gov. Jerry Brown spoke bluntly about the state of American politics and painted a gloomy picture of the threats posed by climate change and potential nuclear annihilation.
But even though his remarks were bleak, Brown's wry delivery and candor earned him much audience applause and laughter.
Brown sat down with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd on Thursday in front of a full house in the John Steinbeck room of the Rancho Mirage Public Library & Observatory as part of the sixth annual Rancho Mirage Writers Festival,
The event, which began Tuesday night with a special sit-down between Dowd and actor Tom Hanks, ends Friday.
Brown's one-on-one with Dowd on Thursday was an at-times light and at-other-times deep conversation about the state of politics in 2019.
The 80-year-old former governor covered a range of topics including California's budget, politicians both contemporary and historic, and the Athenian statesman Aristides.
And, despite Dowd's prodding, Brown made it clear he had no intention of running for president.
"Donald Trump is 72. Joe Biden is 76. Bernie Sanders is 77. Michael Bloomberg is 76. Elizabeth Warren is 69. So, why not get in?" Dowd asked.
Brown said he looked forward to retiring to his Colusa County ranch and had no interest in joining the crowded Democratic primary field, but would speak out to ensure politicians addressed his primary political concerns.
"On the issues that I'm concerned about, particularly climate change and the escalating new nuclear arms race, I'd like to see that in the presidential debate. I haven't seen it there yet in any serious way, so I might have to just stir the pot a bit. Not for myself, but for those other 25 people who're running," Brown said.
Brown brushed off questions about Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's third-party presidential bid, and said he was more interested in charging his hybrid car at the Starbucks near his ranch.
But, when Dowd asked him about U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who began her campaign for president on Monday in Oakland before an estimated 20,000 people, Brown, who ran for president in 1976, 1980 and 1992, said the initial publicity surrounding Harris bodes well for her campaign.
"She certainly started off with a bang. Having run for president myself three times — she's certainly doing better than I was doing," he said.
Brown gave Schultz, Harris and all the candidates who've launched their presidential bids a piece of advice from his 2010 gubernatorial campaign, when he ran against former Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman. As is his custom, Brown used an obscure historical allegory to illustrate his point. In the 4th Century B.C., Brown said, Athenians grew tired of a politician named Aristides, when his actions became too publicized for too long.
"From that I learned: Don't get overexposed," he said. "[Whitman] spent $100 million, a lot of it on television, before I spent my first million. So when I did, which was after Labor Day, I became the fresh face of California."
Brown's stories spanned much further back than the 2010 gubernatorial race. At one point, Dowd, who has reported on politics since the 1970s, shared memories of interviewing Brown during one of his presidential primary bids and asking about his father, former California Gov. Pat Brown.
"I remember I asked you once, one of those times you were running for president, about the Brown dynasty and you would say, 'These personal matters are not the stuff of historic change. How much do you know about Mao Zedong's personal life, or Churchill's or Julius Caesar's?'" she said.
Brown, reversing his earlier stance, said facets of politicians' personal lives could be relevant.
"Nobody ever talked about how drunk [Churchill] was at the White House," he said. "That's one of the extraordinary things, that Churchill drank so much and was so effective. That's a very interesting personal point. And I don't drink as much as Churchill and I'm not as effective."
Dowd also pressed Brown about the generation gap in American politics, the young upstarts vs. the veteran politicians.
He commended first-term members of Congress such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, for bringing new energy to politics, but wondered whether the enthusiasm would last.
"I think they're what you call catalysts," he said. "Politics is very dead in its cliches, its inauthenticities, its same-old, same-old."
But Brown also stressed the benefits of experience and said former Vice President Joe Biden could potentially be an effective president.
"Anyone under 75 is suspicious," Brown said of politicians. "I've had the experience of being the youngest governor in California and the oldest governor in the country, ever — that's when you really learn stuff, after the third or fourth decade of what you did."
Early in his political career, Brown's persona and liberal political stances earned him the nickname "Governor Moonbeam." But when he returned to the governor's office eight years ago, he developed a reputation for cautious governance and fiscal prudence.
When he entered office in 2011, California's budget was operating at a $26 billion deficit. But largely due to sustained economic recovery, the state's fiscal fortunes reversed.
In January, when Brown left office, California's budget had a combined $30 billion of surplus and reserve funds.
His caution — he vetoed one out of every six bills passed by the state legislature in its last session — has earned him scorn from some Democrats, who hope Brown's successor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, will be more willing to increase funding for health care, education and other social programs.
Brown attributed much of his success as governor to timing, saying his tenure benefitted from the longest economic recovery in state history. He then warned that a future downturn is inevitable.
The repercussions of a moderate recession could be particularly severe in California because of the state's tax structure, Brown said.
California's Legislative Analyst's Office forecasts that the current budget surplus could become a $40 billion deficit during a moderate recession because it relies on personal income tax revenue, which historically has been volatile during boom and bust cycles.
"We know what goes up must come down. That's the law of gravity and the law of financial gravity is up and down," Brown said. "The time to be cautious is when everything looks great."

Vilifying white men

Texto completo: Rush Limbaugh's December 2018 Limbaugh Letter has an article titled "Demonizing White Men." It highlights - with actual quotations from people in the media, academia and the political and entertainment arenas - the attack on white men as a class. You can decide whether these statements are decent, moral or even sensible. Should we support their visions?
Don Lemon, a CNN anchorman, said, "We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right, and we have to start doing something about them." Steven Clifford, former King Broadcasting CEO, said, "I will be leading a great movement to prohibit straight white males, who I believe supported Donald Trump by about 85 percent, from exercising the franchise (to vote), and I think that will save our democracy." Teen Vogue, a magazine targeting teenage girls, wrote, "Not only is white male terrorism as dangerous as Islamic extremism, but our collective safety rests in rooting out the source of their radicalization." Economist Paul Krugman, a New York Times columnist, wrote a column titled "The Angry White Male Caucus," in which he explained, "Trumpism is all about the fear of losing traditional privilege."
There have been similar despicable statements made by academics. James Livingston, a Rutgers history professor: "OK, officially, I now hate white people. ... I hereby resign from my race. F- these people." Stacey Patton, a Morgan State University professor: "There is nothing more dangerous in the United States than a white man who has expected to succeed and finds himself falling behind."
Then there's the political arena. Sen. Bernie Sanders: "There's no question that in Georgia and in Florida racism has reared its ugly head. And you have candidates who ran against (Andrew) Gillum and ran against Stacey Adams who were racist. ... And that is an outrage." Michael Avenatti, criticizing the GOP senators during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings: "These old white men still don't understand that assault victims and women deserve respect and to be heard." "What troubles me is ... they're all white men," commented former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm regarding GOP senators questioning Christine Blasey Ford at the Kavanaugh hearings.
Not to be outdone, entertainers have hopped on the demonizing-white-men bandwagon. Joy Behar, talking on ABC's "The View" about senators supporting Kavanaugh, said: "These white men - old, by the way - are not protecting women. They're protecting a man who is probably guilty." Actress Gabourey Sidibe, also on "The View," said: "Older white men are a problem, y'all, for everyone. We're all at risk." Moira Donegan wrote an article for The Guardian titled "Half of white women continue to vote Republican. What's wrong with them?" Renee Graham wrote a column in The Boston Globe that counseled, "Memo to black men: Stop voting Republican."
That is just a partial list of statements that would be viewed and condemned as racist simply by replacing "white men" with "black men," "Mexican men" or "Asian men." You can bet the rent money that university presidents and media executives would sanction any of their employees for making similar broad, sweeping statements about nonwhite men. Suppose a white anchorman said, "Black people are the greatest murder threat in this country." I guarantee you that he'd be shown the door.
There are only two ways to explain the silence by people who should know better. Either they agree with the sentiments expressed or they are out-and-out cowards. Decent American people ought to soundly reject and condemn this brazen attack on white men. I think that the attack is on masculinity itself and that white men are a convenient scapegoat - for now.

Texto completo: When University of Iowa officials canceled classes Tuesday before dangerously low temperatures gripped the Midwest, Gerald Belz and his parents agreed he would stay in Iowa City instead of driving home to Cedar Rapids in his truck, which had mechanical issues.
Belz, who was studying to become a doctor, was found unresponsive outside Halsey Hall at 2:48 a.m. Wednesday. He was transported to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead.
UI police said they believe Belz, 18, died from exposure to the extreme cold.
"At the time I thought that was the smart move," his father, Michael Belz, told the New York Times. "I didn't want him to get stuck somewhere driving. So he decided he would stay."
Belz is one of at least 11 people in the Midwest whose deaths are being blamed on exposure to cold as the Arctic's polar vortex expanded deep into the United States this week. UI police are investigating but said they do not suspect foul play.
Teammates recall Belz being a force Belz was far from the largest guy on the Kennedy High School football team in Cedar Rapids. But despite being smaller, and not a starter, he seems to loom in coaches and teammates' memory as a force.
The news came as a shock to Brian White, Belz's football coach and social studies teacher.
Belz had only just started his second semester as a pre-med major at the University of Iowa. White said every interaction he had with Belz, on and off the field, indicated Belz would be a success.
Belz had earned enough college credits in high school to be considered a sophomore in his first year at UI. The student was at the top of White's senior-level social studies class, even though he took it as a junior.
"You just knew great things were going to happen to that kid beyond high school, because of his disposition, the way he acted and how smart he was," White said. "You just knew he was going to be successful in life."
His personality shined on the field. White recalls looking up every day during roll call to see Belz smiling. He wasn't a loudmouth, White said; he spoke more with his actions and demeanor. "He wasn't the biggest kid, but he played so hard," White said. "Sometimes he would be a scout team running back (in practice) and he'd just get pummeled. Our defense and he would just jump right back up. The thing I always remember most is he always had a smile on his face."
University investigation ongoing UI police declined to say how long they believe Belz was outside before he was noticed by a patrolling officer or where he was headed Wednesday. The air temperature was 22 degrees below zero at 2:52 a.m. Wednesday, with a wind chill of minus 51 degrees.
In extreme cold, hypothermia can take hold in as little as five minutes in temperatures of minus 50 degrees if a person is wearing inadequate winter clothing or skin is exposed, especially the scalp, hands, fingers or face. At 30 below zero, hypothermia can set in in about 10 minutes.
Belz's father said emergency room doctors assured him that no alcohol was found in his son's system. Results from an autopsy could take six to eight weeks to be finalized, the Johnson County Medical Examiner's office confirmed.
Michael Belz told the New York Times he last saw his son on Sunday night. He said he ushered his son out the door of their Cedar Rapids home as snow began to fall Sunday night, worrying the young college student would face slick roads driving back to campus.
Around 10 p.m. on Sunday, Belz called home to tell his parents he'd made it back to school safely.
Belz was 'nothing but joy' Belz had a supporting role on the football team. Teammate Hunter Jeffrey said that Belz knew he probably wouldn't start, but he still put in maximum effort.
"He was nothing but joy," Jeffrey said.
Former teammate Marco Shanklin Jr.'s most distinct memory of Belz took place in the weight room three years ago. Shanklin was ready to quit early; Belz wouldn't let him.
"I didn't want to finish the set, and he just kept using people's words to motivate me," he said.
"He just told me to never quit in anything I ever did, and to always face adversity."
No matter how practice was going, or how many times he got knocked down, Belz always had a smile, said David Ernst, who worked with Belz as a defensive-back coach and receiver coach. Ernst recalls the whole team's joy when Belz caught an interception on the junior varsity team.
"It was fun as a coach," he said. "It was rewarding. That's what athletics are about, those moments when kids excel and you see them react."
Belz's enthusiasm fired up the team, Ernst said.
Former teammate Aijay Davis said that when a teammate was down, Belz would be there with a pump-up speech.
"He set a lot of examples for people," Davis said.
"I hope he realized that he did influence a lot of people's lives, even though they might not have told him so."

‘Medicare for All’ can mean at least two different things

Texto completo: The slogan “Medicare for All” can mean two things. Well, at least two. One of them would be a much bigger, and, to some people, much scarier change than the other. But the two meanings are both out there, which isn’t really helpful but makes it necessary to clarify the two ideas.
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, who is considered a top contender for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, gave a CNN televised town hall forum Tuesday night. She came across as strong, smart and brave. But my feelings about the “brave” part was undermined when I subsequently read about a small maneuver she employed to fuzz up her position on the future of health care.
In response to a question, Harris said that she absolutely favors a “Medicare for All” program. Her words suggested that she meant the version of “Medicare for All” that completely replaces and eliminates private health insurance and replaces it with what is sometimes called “single payer.”
But maybe not. Let me try to clarify/explore a few terms, because we’ll hear a lot about this matter as next campaign develops.
Under “socialized medicine,” pretty much all health care facilities are owned and operated by the government and health care providers are government employees. All citizens are covered. This is what they have in England. At present, full-bore “socialized medicine” is not part of the mainstream American policy discussion.
Under “single payer,” doctors and nurses are not all government employees and the federal government doesn’t own all the hospitals, but government pays all or most medical bills, which greatly reduces or eliminates the need for private health insurance.
Medicare is a single-payer system, but, of course, it doesn’t cover us until we hit age 65. The United States is among a small minority of wealthy nations in not having either of these systems (except for seniors, via Medicare, and the poor, via Medicaid).
America has long been nervous about anything that can be called “socialism,” and Republicans are adept at turning any discussion of increasing government’s role as a step toward socialism. “Socialized medicine” is a nonstarter in U.S. politics, used only as a club to pummel anything that increases the government’s role.
Versions of “single payer” also used to be considered politically suicidal, but that’s changing. Bernie Sanders is for single-payer, has been for years, which is among the reasons many handicappers assumed his chances for the 2016 presidential nomination were low. But they were wrong. Sanders came close. One reason, perhaps, is that he adapted his language to refer to the single-payer approach as “Medicare for All.”
In American politics, “socialism” is a bad word, “Medicare” is a good word. And I’d say our political culture is in a period of transition of how scary the term “single payer” is, and how powerful a tool it will be for the right to label all liberal ideas “socialism.” But that power isn’t gone, so Republicans pounced on what Harris said on CNN about Medicare for All to gin up the red menace.
“Medicare for All,” on the other hand, currently has two meanings. It may mean that private insurance goes away, the federal government pays all the bills, but the federal government would also, of course, have to decide what was covered. If you like your current private or employer-subsidized health insurance, you might be worried that “Medicare for All” might not pay for all the benefits you are currently getting.
But it turns out that there is a less radical, perhaps less-scary version of “Medicare for All,” because it is optional. Under this version of “Medicare for All,” all Americans, including those under 65, would have the option of buying into Medicare, if they choose, but would also have the option of keeping their private health insurance. It’s a Medicare option for all, but those who preferred their current private insurance could stay put. And Harris is apparently for that, too, although you wouldn’t have known that if you had only heard what she said on CNN.
This CNN story about Harris’ town hall forum includes a video clip of that exchange at the top. A woman from the audience asks Harris specifically whether she favored a health care solution that would “cut private insurance companies, as we know them, out of the equation.”
Harris replied: “I believe the solution … is that we need to have Medicare for All. That’s just the bottom line.”
The audience applauds. But there was nothing in the exchange to even hint that Harris might be referring to either of two ways of reaching the goal, one of which would phase out the private health insurance industry, and one of which would not.
I don’t mean to overdo the notion that Harris was deceiving, but she does seem to want to have it both ways without making that clear. The Medicare “option” for all plan might be great.
David Leonhardt of the New York Times used his daily email yesterday to clarify this. He did a good job. Harris’ staff explained the two versions of what might be called “Medicare for All,” and said that she favors both, but that the more radical approach that would make Medicare universal is “what she’s running on.”
I don’t want to overdo how dishonest her answer might have been. She didn’t exactly lie, but her answer seemed too cute, and meant to deceive. She should have said something like: “I favor making Medicare available to every American who wants it. There’s a bill in Congress that would do that by making a Medicare buy-in available to every American, while leaving the private health insurance industry to compete with that option. And there’s a bill that would do it by making Medicare universal for all Americans, which would mean the end of the private health insurance as we have known it. As president I would sign either of those bills. The goal is to have every American insured.”

Texto completo: Two years into his presidency Donald Trump has no clear legislative strategy, no policy agenda, no plan for remedying his persistent unpopularity and a path to re-election sufficiently bleak that he's trying to bait a political naïf, the Starbucks billionaire Howard Schultz, into running as a third-party spoiler. Also, he might be impeached.
Yet at the same time, amid all the domestic chaos and incompetence and political malpractice, this administration continues to act in foreign policy - not tweet obnoxiously, not rage behind the scenes, but act - as though it's following a serious grand strategy, one sufficiently coherent and plausible and forward-looking that future presidents might reasonably imitate it.
This Trump doctrine, in practice, isn't the isolationism that he sometimes promised on the campaign trail; nor is it the flailing bellicosity that many of his critics feared. It's a doctrine of disentanglement, retrenchment and realignment in which the United States tries to abandon its most idealistic hopes and unrealistic military commitments, narrow its list of potential enemies and consolidate its attempts at influence. The overarching goal isn't to cede U.S. primacy or abandon American alliances, as Mr. Trump's opponents often charge; rather, it's to maintain American primacy on a more manageable footing while focusing more energy and effort on containing the power and influence of China.
Consider the two administration efforts in the news this week. The first is the White House's decision to support the opposition leader in Venezuela and build a coalition to undermine the dictatorial Nicolas Maduro government. The second is the advancing effort to negotiate a deal with the Taliban that would end America's 17-years-and-counting military commitment in Afghanistan.
If a deal is struck and our forces actually withdraw, Mr. Trump's personal skepticism of the Afghanistan intervention will have helped produce an outcome that large parts of our foreign policy establishment long resisted - an endgame that accepts the possibility of true defeat, a full Taliban takeover, as the price of reducing American commitments and bringing American troops home.
At the same, the Venezuelan effort is striking in its establishment-foreign-policy normalcy. Trying to undermine a left-wing Latin American dictator while talking in flowery language about human rights is the kind of policy you might have expected from a President Marco Rubio (who is, indeed, a prime mover behind the policy), and as Uri Friedman of The Atlantic wrote, the strategy has been advanced in a very un-Trump-y way: With "a well-oiled diplomatic campaign, closely coordinated with allies and rigorously on message." There's even a Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush hand, Elliott Abrams, on hand to help run the administration's policy.
To Mr. Friedman, this normalcy is strange and dissonant and hypocritical. "Here was a president who preaches America First, who rarely invokes democracy and human rights in his unscripted remarks, who has voiced admiration for dictators such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, sticking his neck out to restore democracy in a country that doesn't usually figure among the top challenges to U.S. interests."
But in fact the administration's different approaches can be harmonized. No American president before the end of the Cold War would have found it strange or dissonant to take an interventionist and self-righteous line where Latin America was concerned, while accepting deals with bad actors and wooing autocrats in more far-flung and global theaters.
There is a rhetorical tension, obviously, involved in defending human rights in Venezuela while you ponder a treaty with the Taliban and seek an accommodation with Kim Jong Un or Bashar al-Assad - and Mr. Trump is not exactly the master of rhetorical finesse. But from the Monroe Doctrine onward, the United States has traditionally treated our hemispheric neighbors differently than Eurasian powers - for the very sound strategic reason that they are close to us and countries like Syria and Afghanistan are not.
This reasoning was abandoned by post-Cold War presidents, and especially by George W. Bush, in the heady days when it appeared that America could project power as easily in Kabul as in the Caribbean. And despite the Iraq disaster, most of Bush's would-be Republican heirs - John McCain and Mitt Romney as well as Mr. Rubio and Jeb(!) Bush - maintained a similarly maximalist posture, in which every theater was supposedly a vital one, every tyrant a potential enemy, and we should be prepared to fight in Afghanistan and Syria and Libya and eastern Ukraine as readily as we would fight for a NATO ally.
Compared with that vision, the Trump doctrine aims for a more limited and sustainable view of American commitments. Along with jihadism, it seeks to confront and contain two major state-based enemies, China and Iran, and it takes a harsh line toward their potential allies and clients in the Americas. But it has no nation-building ambitions in the Muslim world, no dreams of pushing NATO into the Caucasus, and in East Asia it's trying to woo the Kim regime into some kind of bizarre friendship instead of acting like Pyongyang is just as great a long-term danger as its patron in Beijing.
The administration's official European goals (if not Mr. Trump's behind-the-scenes anti-NATO grumbling) also fit plausibly into its larger framework: Building up a stronger military presence on NATO's Russia-facing flank while getting other countries to bear more of the military burden is the most plausible way to preserve the Western alliance's basic purposes while the United States refocuses on China. And in the long run, Mr. Trump's dream (whatever its motivations) of a better working relationship with Russia also fits with a retrench-and-refocus framework - with the major caveat that Mr. Putin seems too interested in disruption to make a genuine and cooperative détente imaginable for now.
Let me stress that I don't think that Mr. Trump's grand strategy is springing fully formed from the president's own mind (he isn't scribbling notes about the Monroe Doctrine, I assume), or for that matter anyone else's; instead it's emerging organically as a synthesis of his own blustering, quasi-isolationist impulses and the more hawkish and internationalist and status-quo-oriented views of the people working for him. That makes it interesting for future international relations scholars to study - but also vulnerable to sudden changes of personnel or presidential mood. (If we unleash a ground war in Venezuela tomorrow in a fit of Trumpian pique, you can disregard this column's analysis.)
And of course it has other vulnerabilities as well. Events often destroy even well-thought-through grand strategies, and every foreign-policy maneuver carries risks. The hawks who fear that jihadism will surge if we pull back from Afghanistan and Syria could be vindicated. So could the institutionalists who fear that Trump's bluster is damaging our standing and disillusioning our friends, and the human rights activists who regard this administration's cynicism as a carte blanche for thugs and dictators, and the simple Trump-fearers (like myself) who worry that he could make a truly catastrophic blunder should, say, the North Korea negotiations blow up or a real crisis with Russia or China comes along.
But those of us who fear Mr. Trump also need to be honest when he exceeds our expectations. Before his election, I wanted a Republican foreign policy that was less hubristic and more calculating than what most leading GOP politicians were offering, that showed a willingness to limit foreign interventions and conduct diplomatic experiments while also trying to maintain United States primacy in a more multipolar, Chinese-influenced world.
Within certain limits, and with a lot of stumbling and bluster, that's roughly what Mr. Trump has delivered. And however his foreign policy looks by November 2020, I suspect that future administrations of both parties will often find themselves imitating the strategy of his first two years.

Texto completo: When it comes to experiencing music, our ears tell us only so much. In "Go Ahead in the Rain," his book about A Tribe Called Quest, the poet and cultural critic Hanif Abdurraqib recalls the determination with which he listened to the hip-hop group's fourth album, "Beats, Rhymes and Life," when it was released in 1996. Thinking it would be their last, he was intent on loving it.
His hands, though, were narrating another story. At the time, Abdurraqib was a teenager in Columbus, Ohio, where it would get unbearably cold during the winter; fiddling with the buttons on his Walkman to skip a song on the cassette entailed exposing his skin to the frigid air. And yet: "I would pull my fingers out of gloves and rush to fast-forward what I could before the wind forced my hands back to the warmth they craved."
Abdurraqib's slender book is full of tactile moments like this, remembrances making it clear that A Tribe Called Quest will always evoke more for him than just a sound. "Go Ahead in the Rain" traces the story of the group over the past three decades. It pays attention to the larger changes in the culture, but its overall tenor is warm, immediate and intensely personal.
Abdurraqib begins with a soaring, wide-angle view of the musical traditions that slaves brought to America from West Africa -- drawing a path from a percussion that was outlawed by 18th-century slave codes to a jazz that was "born out of necessity" -- before landing on his own childhood as a "shy and nervous kid" who took up the trumpet in an attempt to connect with his father. A Tribe Called Quest offered another chance for connection; their early albums, like "People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm" (1990) and "The Low End Theory" (1991), with their jazz samples and socially conscious lyrics, were deemed "acceptable" in his parents' house, where a lot of rap was not.
Readers looking for a biography of the group will find some of the basics here, but it's how Abdurraqib filters the information -- absorbing it, refracting it through his own distinctive lens -- that gives this compact book its power. He covers, among other things, A Tribe Called Quest's beginnings in Queens; its involvement in the Afrocentric rap collective Native Tongues; and its nadir in the late '90s, when the visionary energy the group brought to bear on its first three albums dissipated into something that started to sound dutiful and desultory.
Two forces hastened A Tribe Called Quest's breakup in 1998, according to Abdurraqib. One was large and impersonal, having to do with the state of hip-hop in the '90s, when a flood of money deepened the apparent divide between commercialism and authenticity, presenting artists with a stark choice: "Be real enough to stay underground, or go pop enough to get money." He locates A Tribe Called Quest and its wide-ranging appeal "at the center of this tug-of-war," with the group getting worn down by the strain.
This smart structural analysis is plausible enough, but what moves Abdurraqib the most is the intense and fractious friendship between two of the group's core members, Q-Tip and Phife Dawg. (Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi White are also acknowledged as essential members in the book, but they appear mostly as onlookers to the main emotional drama.)
Abdurraqib remembers identifying with Phife from the start: the scrappy M.C. who mastered the ironic art of the punch line, cutting grandiose bombast with comic self-deprecation. Q-Tip gets respect here for his brilliance and ambition, but Abdurraqib likens him to a perfectionist older brother: demanding and a bit aloof, seemingly oblivious to how hard Phife was trying to prove himself.
The theme of mortality runs through the book, which is billed as a "love letter" on the cover but could also be called an elegy. Phife died of complications from diabetes in March 2016, just after A Tribe Called Quest had reunited and recorded "We Got It From Here ... Thank You 4 Your Service," their first new album in 18 years. The album was released just before midnight on Nov. 10, 2016, bearing lyrics that sounded veritably prophetic in light of the election results from just a couple of nights before. "All you black folks, you must go / All you Mexicans, you must go": What might have constituted biting satire in a more (ostensibly) innocent time was beginning to sound like a news transcript.
"Black folks have been creating with their backs against the wall for years, telling the future, speaking what is coming to the masses that aren't eager to hear it until what's coming actually arrives," Abdurraqib writes. He says he is drawn to vibrations, beats and bass lines -- "that which can be felt more than heard." You can trace a line between this sentiment and Abdurraqib's stubborn loyalty to cassettes long after CDs became available. CDs promised convenience and flawless digital sound, but cumbersome tapes -- "the most tedious and least practical" listening technology -- offered something more tangible; their fragility and physical constraints, the effort it took to skip songs, "locked a listener into a commitment."
Hip-hop albums in the 1990s were "sprawling, overrun with skits and Easter eggs" that you might miss if you messed with the fast-forward button. Similarly, the small size of Abdurraqib's book is belied by how much it contains. In one chapter, he moves from The Source magazine to Toni Morrison to Emmett Till and Otis Redding; in another he moves from Philando Castile to Alton Sterling to Sterling's job selling bootleg CDs and another "CD man" Abdurraqib once knew.
"It's funny, isn't it -- the things that play on our screens and in our heads for years, detached from any fullness," he writes. To isolate something, to shear it from its context, is to distort it; by gathering stories from the past, Abdurraqib situates A Tribe Called Quest within the fullness of history and memory.
With Phife gone, "a group like A Tribe Called Quest will never exist again," Abdurraqib writes. "At least now, I think, we can lay them to rest." This lush and generous book is a call to pay proper respects -- not just to a sound but to a feeling.

Preparation and persona make Romo's success predictable

Texto completo: One of the most compelling stories this week in Atlanta involves a 38-year-old quarterback who finally has made it to the Super Bowl after a career of painful disappointments. He doesn't play for either team, but Tony Romo will send tremors through Twitter practically every time he speaks Sunday.
During the AFC championship game this month, CBS's top football analyst burnished an already sparkling reputation when he correctly predicted a series of plays - blitzes by the defense, which receivers quarterback Tom Brady would throw to - in the second half of the New England Patriots' victory over the Kansas City Chiefs.
Romo's partner in the booth, the veteran Jim Nantz, fondly dubbed him "Romostradamus." "Brady's seeing what you're seeing," Nantz said, sounding somewhat in awe.
In the aftermath, Romo has been called a "football genius" by the New Yorker; others have asked whether he's already the best analyst in sports. Free agent baseball star Bryce Harper described Romo as "a wizard" and joked that he "just called Tony Romo to see where I'm going to play next year." The Wall Street Journal analyzed every game Romo called this season and found he had a 68 percent rate on his predictions.
Meanwhile, the rest of the sports broadcasting world has been paying attention to its newest attraction.
"As an announcer you say things like, 'The ball's going inside here' - and sometimes you get lucky and you're right," said Dick Vitale, a college basketball analyst for ESPN and one of the best-known color voices in sports. "When it's right you feel like a million dollars. But what Tony did in that environment in such a major moment, I mean that was just captivating to so many people."
Romo's star turn in the broadcast booth comes after an NFL career that was both remarkable - he played 13 seasons as an undrafted free agent out of Eastern Illinois - and, at least in some ways, disappointing. Despite making four Pro Bowls while playing for a flagship franchise, Romo had a 2-4 playoff record and never sniffed a Super Bowl. During his playing career, he was perhaps best known for famously botching a hold on an extra-point attempt in a playoff game and dating pop star Jessica Simpson. When Romo retired in 2017, NFL.com named the news conference at which he graciously handed off the Cowboys quarterback job to Dak Prescott as his most memorable career moment.
Immediately afterward, he was anointed CBS's top analyst. Two years into the role, Romo is garnering the kind of attention not seen for an NFL color analyst since John Madden. Romo is, in so many ways, everything the NFL isn't: If the league can be self-serious, overly corporate and buttoned up, Romo is spontaneous in the booth, freewheeling and joyous.
"Oh my gosh, Jim, Tom Brady has the ball at the 35 to go to the Super Bowl!" Romo squealed in delight late in the Patriots-Chiefs game.
"He has a twinkle in his eye, and there is a boyish excitement," said Bob Costas, the former NBC broadcasting legend.
In the canon of hall of fame-caliber announcers - think of Howard Cosell, Ernie Harwell and Vin Scully - most have been best known for their play-by-play, not their analysis. And few become cultural touchstones. Chicago Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray sang the seventh-inning stretch and was spoofed on "Saturday Night Live." Milwaukee Brewers announcer Bob Uecker starred in "Major League."
Then, of course, there is Madden. The former Oakland Raiders coach retired in 1978; before he joined CBS, Madden taught a class on football at the University of California that laid the groundwork for his professorial but approachable style (and later for an iconic video game).
On TV, Madden mastered the telestrator and explained things such as the nickel defense and the ins and outs of the offensive and defensive lines. But he was also full of quirks; when a field was muddy he told viewers they could know which players were running faster by how high they kicked up dirt onto their pants. In a world where so many announcers spoke in generalities - "They need to stop the run" - Madden seemed to elevate the very craft. "Madden's true legacy is as one of the sporting world's premier public intellectuals," Bryan Curtis wrote in Play Magazine .
Romo has seemingly taken the next step up the evolutionary depth chart by not just explaining the X's and O's but telling viewers what is about to happen.
"There's no plan of doing it at all," Romo said. "Sometimes you just get passionate and you get excited and in the moment you start, you know, just really talking out loud what's going through your brain. Sometimes you see a lot of stuff and then you just try and articulate that to the people who are watching."
Added Nantz: "This is the testament to years and years of his work and preparation. He's not guessing. He's not getting some sort of message from the gods."
Romo's technical knowledge is certainly aided by the fact that he was so recently a quarterback in the league. When he meets with coaches and players in the lead-up to games, he has often played with them or against them. The formations and schemes they discuss are the same he watched in his own game film just a couple years ago.
Still, several announcers around sports said there was more to Romo's buzz than just prognostication.
Vitale: "We have an epidemic out there. A lot of guys X-and-O people to death. People are bored. But Tony entertains. He's got enthusiasm and energy. You can feel he loves every play. He wishes he was under center. That's what made Madden great, too."
Legendary baseball broadcaster Ken "Hawk" Harrelson: "I like a bold guy. He's going out on a limb, which tells you he's not scared. But I also like Tony because he connects to fans. When an umpire blew a call, I got pissed, just like you sitting at home. He gets excited the way fans do."
Bill Raftery, the lead color commentator for college basketball on CBS: "It sounds philosophical, but he's a country kind of relaxed. In the booth you are who you were raised as, what your family was like, who you palled around with. I think it embodies the whole person."
The Romo-mania is in some ways reminiscent of the gushing reaction to Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski, who called figure skating for NBC at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi. The duo blended biting wit and effervescent fashion with sound analysis and uproarious fun. In an age of instant feedback, they were on TV for barely a day before the reviews were in.
"My mother called me and said the New York Times thought we should be the lead team in prime time, and I was like, 'No way,' " Weir said. "It happened really fast. We had the hair and the fashion and the full sensory overload, but we also understood - in this age of Twitter and social media - that you have to know what people are looking for."
In that vein, Romo has set a high bar for himself heading into the Super Bowl. He trended on social media and was showered with praise after his last game. As Vitale said, "People will be counting, 'He's right on this play; he's wrong on that one. He's 0 for 3, 2 for 4,' but I think he can live with that."
Costas said part of the infatuation with Romo also was due to his novelty - he is still so new to the booth - and predicted that it would get more difficult to predict plays with such regularity the further removed Romo is from his own career. But because of the response he has elicited, Costas also suggested the next wave of announcers probably will look to emulate Romo's example. "People are going to be saying, 'Let's go find the next Romo,' " he said. "But it's not that easy."
Dan Fouts, another CBS football analyst, hoped that the interest in Romo might spur networks to beef up more of their production teams with the resources usually reserved for the top pair, including extra help in the production truck to aid broadcasters during the games. "Hopefully they say the investment is worth it for everyone. They can raise the bar for everyone that way," he said.
As for whether future broadcast booths will be full of Romo-clones, Fouts also believes that's tricky.
"When I got hired, the bosses told me to be John Madden," he said. "But also be myself."

Texto completo: One of the biggest media personalities who passed away in 2018 was Jewish conservative intellectual and pundit Charles Krauthammer.
Shortly before his death, he instructed his son, Daniel, to finish his second book that, like his 2013 New York Times bestseller "Things That Matter: Three Decades of Passions, Pastimes and Politics," would be another collection of his best writings.
"The Point of It All" was released in December, almost six months after the elder Krauthammer died from small intestine cancer on June 21, 2018, at the age of 68. It consists of articles and essays from the syndicated columnist that deal with political, historical and philosophical issues. There are even a few chapters related to sports, as he was an avid fan of the Washington Nationals.
One of the 18 chapters over the five sections is titled "The Two Last Tribes of Israel," consisting of five columns in no chronological order. (There are Israel-related columns in other sections, including one titled "The Iranian 'Moderate.' ") They exemplify his stalwart support for the Jewish state, in addition to his eloquent observations of the Jewish community-past, present and future.
Below is an overview of a few memorable columns.
"The Miracle, at 60"
The first, "The Miracle, at 60," is about the six-decade anniversary of the State of Israel's independence and how-despite "the norm, the rule for every ancient people defeated, destroyed, scattered and exiled"-the Jewish people have not only survived, but have preserved their way of life, including Hebrew as their official language.
Despite defying conventional wisdom, Krauthammer writes, Israel faces an adversarial trend: "During its early years, Israel was often spoken of in such romantic terms. Today, such talk is considered naive, anachronistic, even insensitive, nothing more than Zionist myth designed to hide the true story, i.e., the Palestinian narrative of dispossession."
While Krauthammer acknowledges the suffering of the Palestinian people, he does not give its "fanatical leadership" a pass-"from Haj Amin al-Husseini, the grand mufti of Jerusalem (Nazi collaborator, who spent World War II in Berlin), to Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser to Yasser Arafat to Hamas of today-that repeatedly chose war rather than compromise and conciliation."
He adds that for the most part, the Palestinian narrative is heard in international circles and the media, blaming Israel for its suffering, as opposed to what Israel has faced since winning independence at "a very high cost" with 6,373 perishing, or in "American terms, it would take 35 Vietnam memorials to encompass such a monumental loss of life."
Krauthammer concludes that while the Arab-Israeli conflict is "complex," the "root cause is not."
"On the day the Arabs-and the Palestinians in particular-make a collective decision to accept the Jewish state, there will be peace, as Israel proved with its treaties with Egypt and Jordan," he says. "Until that day, there will be nothing but war. And every 'peace process,' however cynical or well meaning, will come to nothing."
The conflict remains unchanged. This article was timely when it was written, and it is timely now.
"Victimhood cannot be the foundation stone of Jewish identity"
During a Democratic presidential primary debate in March 2016 between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, the moderator, asked the latter why he didn't speak much about being Jewish.
Sanders replied that "I am very proud to be Jewish," and that the Holocaust eliminated his father's family. He proceeded to explain growing up and seeing survivors with camp numbers tattooed on their arms.
"I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being," he added.
Krauthammer writes about how this episode has the background of Sanders being thus far the most successful Jew to run for the nation's highest office, and that in doing so embodies the encouraging state of American Jewry.
With that progress comes a dire warning, Krauthammer writes: Whereas American Jews would most likely identify themselves as Orthodox, Conservative or Reform, some people such as Sanders are categorized as descending from Holocaust survivors. While understandable, Krauthammer says, it dilutes the meaning behind one's Judaism.
"The memories created are indelible. And deeply valuable," he writes. "Indeed, though my own family was largely spared, the Holocaust forms an ineradicable element of my own Jewish consciousness."
"But I worry about the balance," he continues. "As Jewish practice, learning and knowledge diminish over time, my concern is that Holocaust memory is emerging as the dominant feature of Jewishness in America."
"I worry that a people with a 3,000-year history of creative genius, enriched by intimate relations with every culture from Paris to Patagonia, should be placing such weight on martyrdom-and indeed, for this generation, martyrdom once removed," he added.
While Krauthammer notes that he is not criticizing Sanders and credits him for being genuine, he expresses concern that diminishing Jewish identity to the Shoah, as much as it's crucial to preserve its memory, has adverse consequences for future generations.
"There must be balance. It would be a tragedy for American Jews to make the Holocaust the principal legacy bequeathed to their children," he writes. "After all, the Jewish people are living through a miraculous age: the rebirth of Jewish sovereignty, the revival of Hebrew (a cultural resurrection unique in human history), the flowering of a new Hebraic culture radiating throughout the Jewish world.
"Memory is sacred, but victimhood cannot be the foundation stone of Jewish identity. Traditional Judaism has 613 commandments," he continues. "The philosopher Emil Fackenheim famously said that the 614th is to deny Hitler any posthumous victories. The reduction of Jewish identity to victimhood would be one such victory. It must not be permitted."
The end of the book consists of the eulogy Daniel Krauthammer gave at his father's funeral. It's too long to describe in this article, but it's recommend reading about what his father meant to him (and to dedicated readers everywhere) through not just his unparalleled intellect, but also his love for his family and others as he attempted to lead an exemplary life, about which he expressed gratitude for in his final column.

Texto completo: The family of a man shot in a barrage of bullets fired by Sacramento police has filed a $20 million federal lawsuit, claiming officers racially profiled the victim in a case that's drawn national interest in the ongoing debate about excessive force.
Lawyers for the family of Stephon Clark say the officers failed to identify themselves as police before they abruptly began firing at Clark in his grandparents' backyard on March 18. Officers suggested in a preliminary investigation that they thought Clark had a gun, but he was only carrying a cellphone when he died.
"The involved officers . . . fired 20 shots striking (Clark) approximately eight times," according to the lawsuit, filed this week in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California.
"The conduct of officers Terrence Mercadal and Jared Robinet was willful, wanton, malicious, and done with reckless disregard for the rights and safety" of Clark, the lawsuit alleges. It says the officers violated Clark's basic civil rights.
The Sacramento District Attorney's Office said in a statement that it is continuing its review of the case to see if criminal charges might apply.
"As always, our review will only address the question of whether the conduct of the two Sacramento Police officers constitutes a prosecutable crime under established California law," the statement said.
The California Attorney General’s Office has previously indicated it will also conduct an independent review of the incident.
The family of Clark, 22, had filed preliminary paperwork with the city in September, seeking more than $15 million in wrongful death damages, city officials reported at the time. The amount sought in the claims is more than a third of the size of the city’s $37 million parks budget.
But often, amounts initially sought in lawsuits are whittled down during legal negotiations and court proceedings.
Protests and peaceful rallies in Sacramento disrupted traffic, blocked access to NBA basketball games and interrupted a local city council meeting after Clark was shot. His death reignited the familiar frustration and anger after similar police shootings of black unarmed men.
One of the officers was black and the other was white; both were later placed on paid administrative leave, the New York Times reported.
The lawsuit filed this week alleges that Clark's family has greatly suffered throughout the ordeal.
Clark "suffered extreme mental and physical pain and suffering and eventually suffered a loss of life and earning capacity," the lawsuit says. "Plaintiffs have also been deprived of the life-long love, companionship, comfort, support, society, care, and sustenance of (Clark,) and will continue to be so deprived for the remainder of their natural lives. "
Police had initially gone to Clark's grandparents' neighborhood to investigate a complaint about someone breaking car windows. A police helicopter guided the officers to Clark.

In statements, the officers said Clark ran from them and, in darkness and confusion, they opened fire when one of them announced Clark had a gun, according to press accounts. They said they began shooting because they feared they were about to be shot.
The district attorney's office said this week that it has received "a voluminous investigative report and related materials" from the police department that it is reviewing.
"Two weeks ago, on January 16, 2019, we received further substantial investigative reports and related materials from the Attorney General’s Department of Justice investigators," the district attorney's office said on its web site. "Our timeline for completion of our review has thus been delayed as we process the supplemental materials. We will take whatever time is needed to ensure a fair, thorough, and accurate review of this matter. "

Oscars migraine? 'Green Book,' 'Bohemian Rhapsody' controversies explained

Resumen: A rundown of the most controversial Oscar best-picture nominations, and what the outcries are about, before the Academy Awards are given out Feb. 24.

Texto completo: Outcry over Oscar-nominated movies isn't unusual, especially in the competitive Hollywood arena where one movie's disaster is another movie's gain.
Just look at modern history: Last year's best picture contender "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri" was castigated by critics for letting its racist cop (played by Sam Rockwell) off the hook by the time the credits rolled. "Selma" played with the facts around President Johnson's support of Martin Luther King Jr. "Zero Dark Thirty," about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, was famously embroiled in scandal, with some claiming it glorified torture.
And "The Birth of a Nation" never made it into the 2017 Oscar race after being hobbled by filmmaker Nate Parker's personal history.
But in the social media-drenched climate of 2019, the fires have been particularly quick to burst out. Here's a guide to the best-picture nominees that are dealing with contentious debates leading up to the Academy Awards on Feb. 24 (ABC, 8 p. m. ET/5 PT).
Oscar watch! What a 'Black Panther' win and other SAG Awards mean for the Academy Awards
Opinion: Why 'Black Panther' really deserves that Oscar best-picture nod
'Green Book' is called out for accuracy
For an ultimately uplifting story of the real-life relationship between black pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and his Italian-American chauffeur Tony "Lip" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), "Green Book" has been one of the most polarizing films of the year, with some critics chastising its portrayal of race relations, told predominately from the white character's point of view.
Shirley's family has called into question the veracity of key details, calling "Green Book" a “symphony of lies," and asserting they were never consulted for the project. The filmmakers have stood by the story and Shirley backs up many plot points in newly released interview tapes. "I think people need to go back and hear what Dr. Shirley has to say for himself," Ali said Sunday after winning a Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance.
The filmmakers have dealt with personal tumult as well. In January, reports from 1998 resurfaced, chronicling director Peter Farrelly's old habit of flashing his penis as a prank on movie sets. Farrelly said he was "deeply sorry" for his past behavior.
Screenwriter Nick Vallelonga, Tony's son, came under fire for a 2015 tweet in which he supported then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's discredited claim that Muslims in New Jersey were seen on TV cheering the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Vallelonga apologized and has vowed "to do better. "
Fire danger level: Moderate. Though getting hit from all directions, "Green Book" still has a lot of love in Hollywood, as evidenced by key wins at the Golden Globes and Producers Guild Awards.
'Bohemian Rhapsody' has a Bryan Singer problem
Although everyone agrees Rami Malek crushed it as Freddie Mercury, the fan-favorite Queen film arrives in the best-picture race laden with controversy. The biggest issue? Singer, the biopic's original (and still credited) director. He was fired toward the end of production, which is messy enough. But in January, The Atlantic published a lengthy report detailing allegations of Singer's sexual misconduct, in some instances with minors. The 53-year-old director has denied any wrongdoing, calling the report "a homophobic smear piece. " Queen guitarist Brian May has apologized for previously defending Singer.
Meanwhile, a chorus of LGBTQ voices have accused "Bohemian Rhapsody" of botching its portrayal of Freddie Mercury's sexuality and suggesting that being gay was the frontman's downfall. Producer Graham King has insisted that the intention wasn't to equate "being gay means being dark. "
Fire danger level: High. In the #MeToo era, Singer's sullied name remains an albatross around the neck of "Bohemian Rhapsody" in the Oscar race, especially given that the film centers on a gay icon.
'Vice' pits Hollywood against Republicans (again)
The gonzo biopic of former Vice President Dick Cheney was always going to be a flash point for political controversy, depicting him with ruthless ambition and cunning. Time wrote that "Vice" turned Cheney (played by Christian Bale) into a "cartoon villain," while the National Review called it "conservative vitriol" and "bad history. "
"We really did our best to be accurate with the historic timeline," McKay told USA TODAY, calling "Vice" an incredible story, "regardless of your political leanings. "
Fact-checking 'Vice': Did Dick Cheney really do all of that?
Piling on: While accepting the Golden Globe for best actor, Bale said, "Thank you to Satan for giving me inspiration. " Cheney's daughter, Wyoming U. S. Rep. Liz Cheney, fired back by tweeting a 2008 article from The Independent about Bale’s arrest for allegedly assaulting his mother and sister. “Satan probably inspired him to do this, too,” she wrote. (Bale was never charged for assault, with Crown Prosecution Service citing insufficient evidence. )
Fire danger level: Low. There's too much blowback directed at other movies to really knock "Vice" too hard at this stage in the game.
Does 'A Star Is Born' have issues with agency?
Ally and Jackson's love story has powered this Oscar season, despite an anemic showing at awards shows of late. While the re-imagining of the classic Hollywood tale has avoided major cultural missteps, some have found the film's change of focus from Ally to Jackson in the second hour problematic.
Vox took issue with Ally's lack of agency in the script, while also calling out "A Star Is Born" for failing to present an "alternative representation of women excelling in a career independent of a man’s actions, direction, success, or reaction to her success. "
The New York Times weighed the film's agenda around gender, noting that "for all its romanticism, the movie reads as a pessimistic take on heterosexual romantic relationships. Here, lasting equality between a man and a woman in love – artists in the same field – isn’t just difficult, it actually kills the guy. "
So is Bradley Cooper's version a modern enough retelling? Agree or disagree, it won't matter much come Oscar night, as such squabbling has been drowned out by the film's die-hard fans.
Fire danger level: Low. Love trumps nitpicking where this "Star" is concerned.
Could 'Roma' dethrone the theater experience?
Critics have lavished praise on Alfonso Cuaron's epic tale of life in 1970s Mexico, but theater geeks have taken issue with how Netflix rolled it out, putting the film in a handful of theaters before it arrived on the streaming service. Critics have called this a cosmetic release and maintain that Netflix's distribution plan, placing movies online at the same time as in theaters, threatens moviegoing at large.
A best picture win (the highest prize in the film industry) for Netflix could resurface the question: Are movie theaters still relevant?
Even after winning two Golden Globes, Cuaron was asked about Netflix backstage in a testy exchange. "A Mexican film in black and white, in Spanish and Mixtec, without stars – how big did you think it would be as a conventional theatrical release?” he replied.
Fire danger level: Moderate. Academy voters are still largely comprised of older film purists, and "Roma" remains a threat to their filmmaking status quo.

Texto completo: Lincoln Land Community College invites the public to its 11th annual Lincoln Lecture Tuesday, Feb. 12 at 9 a.m. in the R.H. Stephens Room of Menard Hall on the Springfield campus, 5250 Shepherd Road.
Dr. Christian McWhirter, Lincoln historian at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, will speak on "Music in the Life of Mr. Lincoln."
Abraham Lincoln adored music his entire life, but he also understood how to harness its power to motivate listeners and shape attitudes.
Dr. McWhirter will explore Lincoln’s musical tastes and share stories about how the president used music to help with the Civil War and heal the nation’s wounds. The presentation features music of the era performed by Benjamin Holbrook and Hannah Jellen.
McWhirter previously served as an assistant editor for The Papers of Abraham Lincoln.
His writings on the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln and popular culture have appeared in numerous publications, including The New York Times, Chicago History and Civil War Monitor.
His 2012 book, "Battle Hymns: The Power and Popularity of Music in the Civil War," was a selection of the National History Book Club.
Holbrook is a second-year Ph.D. student in musicology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where his studies focus on the intersections of American music, history and politics.
Prior to pursuing doctoral studies, he completed a bachelor’s degree in music education focusing on choral music at Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio.
After teaching choir and general music in Campbell, Ohio, Benjamin completed a master’s degree in music history at Butler University with a master’s thesis on the music of "Occupy Wall Street."
Originally from the American Bottoms in southwestern Illinois, Jellen has lived in central Illinois since 2011.
In 2015, she earned a bachelor’s degree in music from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she also earned her master’s degree in library and information science in 2017.
She is currently finishing a master’s degree in historical musicology and conducting research on 19th century American vernacular music, particularly the music of the Civil War.
Before returning to graduate school, Hannah worked at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in the manuscripts department.
In addition, LLCC Outreach Centers will also host Lincoln-themed activities in February.
On Feb. 1, LLCC-Litchfield will host a presentation by Ron Spears, local Lincoln expert and retired judge, from 1-2 p.m. in L102.

Texto completo: The great American journalist, memoirist and ironist Russell Baker has passed on at the fine age of 93. Though he did many different things, including writing a play (because he said he was tired of working alone) and hosting "Masterpiece Theater," he was best known as the humor columnist for The New York Times.
That he was never replaced suggests two things: That The Times ceased to see the value of humor and that Mr. Baker was irreplaceable. The latter contention is certainly true.
Humor is incredibly difficult to write, and almost no one can do it. Mr. Baker made it look easy but repeatedly assured us it was not. His style was simply to document some sliver of our times (like the fact that Richard Nixon had only one friend or the truth that aspirin bottles are most difficult to open for those who need the aspirin most desperately) and hope that, with the slightest of turns by him, the absurdity of our common plight would be made plain.
What made Mr. Baker great was the emotion beneath his stoicism and sophistication. He was really very angry about humanity. And he was really very hurt by life. Now and then, toward the end of his Times tenure, he dropped all pretense of humor and let loose with a rant and a rave. He said that this was how he knew it was time to quit. But those rare columns were gems.
His memoir about being raised in relative poverty in the South, "Growing Up," is a masterpiece of storytelling and prose style. He wrote in that book: "The only thing I was fit for was to be a writer, and this notion rested solely on my suspicion that I would never be fit for real work, and that writing didn't require any." He also said that he knew he was an essayist and not a reporter after walking to lunch with the late, great James Reston one day. Reston saw a fire truck and wondered, "Where's the fire?" Mr. Baker said he wondered what he might have for lunch, and where.
Russell Baker was really a conservative, but not the kind many people would understand these these days. If he wrote any bad sentences in his life, they were few. We know he wrote many sublime ones.
This one is illustrative of both his values and his style: "We all come from the past, and children ought to know what it was that went into their making, to know that life is a braided cord of humanity stretching up from time long gone, and that it cannot be defined by the span of a single journey from diaper to shroud."

Texto completo: Despite the recent settlement of the Los Angeles teachers strike, mostly in the teacher union’s favor, the deal largely ignores the shaky financial realities of the school district. While the union crows about its apparent victory, the potential fiscal disaster should make teachers consider leaving the union, not rallying around it.
In addition to a 6 percent raise for teachers, the settlement deal includes more staff at schools and a cap on class sizes. Yet, the district’s finances mean that the deal is built on quicksand.
As the New York Times pointed out, “the deal essentially punted on the question of how the district would come up with the $403 million to pay for the additional staff members.”
Further, the district can only afford the deal if it can pass a local parcel tax in 2020 and receive increased state funding from Sacramento.
These glaring financial questions clash with the district’s current bottom line.
For example, state law requires the district to maintain a minimum 1 percent budget reserve, and the district has a structural deficit, spending more than it takes in.
That structural deficit will soon end up causing the district to dip below the state-mandated 1 percent minimum.
Los Angeles County Office of Education superintendent Debra Duardo recently told the education group Speak Up, “it’s gotten to the point where [the district] can’t show us that they can maintain a 1 percent reserve in their third year out.”
The County estimates that by 2021-22, “the district will be bankrupt.”
Duardo points out, “Especially at a district as large as LAUSD, if they were to go insolvent, then they would be in really big trouble.”
What kind of trouble? For teachers, here is the chilling warning.
The district, says Duardo, “would actually run out of the cash they need to pay their teachers and all of their salaries.”
Duardo explains that a budget reserve is a one-time pot of cash, and “that’s not money you [will] have [again in the future].”
In response to a question about the district giving in to the union’s demands, Duardo is clear about the ramifications: “The law is set up where if they were to show us in their budget that they don’t have enough money to maintain that reserve, and even go further into the negative — which would concern us that they may be at risk of becoming insolvent — then the next step would be for us to assign a fiscal advisor.”
The kicker: “And a fiscal advisor has stay-and-rescind authority, which means that if there are decisions being made that put the district at risk of becoming insolvent, then we could override decisions that the board is making.”
The union claims that the district is not deficit spending, but Duardo points to the simple fiscal fact that the district’s reserve is plunging, so if there were no deficit spending “we wouldn’t see this reserve dwindling down to below 1 percent.”
The new settlement deal, therefore, may be a Pyrrhic victory for teachers that could cause harm to them and their students.
Instead of blindly following their union, teachers should consider taking advantage of their new rights under the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, which held that public employees cannot be forced to pay dues or fees to unions.
Justice Samuel Alito, who authored the Janus majority opinion, wrote that it is an unconstitutional infringement on the rights of public employees to require them “to provide financial support for a union that ‘takes many positions during collective bargaining that have powerful political and civic consequences.’”
L.A. teachers should make use of their Janus rights and walk away from the union, not walk with it over a cliff.

Going gaga over the ladies

Texto completo: The major media have gone gaga over the number of women newly elected to Congress and those announcing their run for the White House in 2020, with more female candidates likely to follow suit.
But media's bias — one of many — is revealed in their focus on mostly liberal women with barely a mention, if they are mentioned at all, of women who are conservative. Reporters, commentators and hosts on major networks, and including some cable outlets, speak of "women's issues," as if all women think, or should think, alike.
Worse, they never examine whether ideas floated by liberal women are anything new or whether they have worked in the past or are working presently. Many liberal pronouncements seem to be taken at face value, with little pushback to explain how they plan to make their proposals work, especially those that have been tried and failed before (consider programs to wipe out poverty, along with increased spending to improve public education, as just two of many examples).
Another example: the presidential candidacy announcement by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). Harris has been in the Senate for only two years but already she hears "Hail to the Chief" playing for her? Who does she think she is, Barack Obama?
In predictable liberal fashion, Harris wants to impose a $3 trillion tax plan on the country at a time when, according to Investor's Business Daily, "President Trump's $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could kick economic growth into high gear." Harris also tracks with Sen.Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in promoting Medicare for all that is projected to cost $30 trillion. With a national debt at nearly $22 trillion and soaring, the idea that we could absorb additional debt is a recipe for bankruptcy, especially when one considers that many initial cost estimates for past government programs have far exceeded projections.
Federal tax revenues have already hit record highs. The obvious problem is not insufficient revenue; rather, it is lack of spending discipline and the desire to give people whatever they want, hoping a growing addiction to government will produce more votes for the politicians dispensing "free" goodies.
Back to media's fixation: Why do major media outlets trumpet the causes of women, gays, African Americans, Hispanics and other groups who are liberal? Why do the ideas of conservative women never seem to receive that same level of attention? If you have to ask the question you haven't been paying attention.
It seems the major media long ago abandoned fairness, balance, even accuracy. Especially in the Trump era, they have displayed naked ideological cheerleading for liberals and their proposals. Any fair examination of major newspapers — from the front page, to the editorial and op-ed pages — proves the point. It has become much easier to speed read The Washington Post and The New York Times, because every day they contain little else but a steady drumbeat of anti-Trump stories, editorials and columns. The conservative Media Research Center has calculated that 90 percent of TV coverage of the first two years of the Trump administration has been negative.
Whatever one's views, this is not healthy for the credibility and stability of journalism, the political parties or the country.
Yes, there are far fewer Republican women in Congress than female Democrats, but that is not an invitation to focus solely on the Democrats while ignoring Republican and especially conservative Republican women. Their ideas and proposals deserve at least equal consideration and examination.

Anthony Davis requests a trade from New Orleans, giving the Lakers an opportunity

Texto completo: For the last month and a half, no one has been discussed more as the Lakers’ mythical second superstar as much as Anthony Davis.
As of Monday morning, that pipe dream seems a little closer to reality.
ESPN reported that the 6-foot-10, five-time All Star has officially requested a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans, where he’s spent the first seven seasons of his career. While the Pelicans would be able to offer Davis a supermax contract extension this summer with an estimated value of $240 million, Davis’ agent, Rich Paul, has said that he won’t sign an extension, preferring instead to compete for a championship.
With the 22-28 Pelicans now dealing with an unhappy superstar, the expectation is that the Lakers will attempt to muscle into the bidding before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. While ESPN reported that New Orleans does not want to deal Davis before the summer – when more suitors such as the Boston Celtics will be available – now is the Lakers’ best chance to land one of the best two-way players in the NBA.
Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who had sworn in front of Los Angeles media a month ago that New Orleans would not trade Davis, adopted a less rigid posture as he addressed reporters after practice on Monday morning.
“Obviously it’s in the open and everyone knows,” Gentry said. “For us, it’s business as usual.”
Davis has been named to the All-NBA first team three of the last four years. Averaging 29.3 points, 13.3 rebounds and 2.6 blocked shots this season, Davis will turn 26 in March. The dream of pairing a superstar entering his prime with LeBron James, who is still producing prime-level numbers, is an enticing one for the Lakers, who desire a return to the NBA’s biggest stage for the first time since 2010.
It was an earth-shaking announcement in New Orleans, where the Pelicans released an official statement confirming the report while saying they would make any given trade on their own timeline.
“Relative to specific talks of a trade, we will do this on our terms and our timeline,” the statement read. “One that makes the most sense for our team and it will not be dictated by those outside of our organization. We have also requested the League to strictly enforce the tampering rules associated with this transaction.”
Mention of tampering seems to carry a specific edge toward the Lakers: The organization has been fined twice for tampering under the Magic Johnson-led front office. The New York Times reported Monday afternoon that the NBA was investigating tampering concerns regarding Davis, though not specifc to any one team.
But that hasn’t stopped the speculation that Davis will one day be a Laker.
Some of the most hotly discussed trade assets the Lakers have are their own promising young players: Kyle Kuzma (19.1 ppg, 5.9 rpg); Lonzo Ball (9.9 ppg, 5.4 apg); and Brandon Ingram (16.6 ppg, 4.9 rpg). Kuzma is 23, while Ball and Ingram are 21. All are still on their rookie deals with the Lakers.
Other potential trade assets include 23-year-old guard Josh Hart (8.9 ppg, 4.1 rpg) and 21-year-old center Ivica Zubac (8.6 ppg, 5.0 rpg), who has been on the rise in recent weeks. The Lakers also control their first-round draft picks for the foreseeable future.
If the Lakers were to make a trade, they’d likely also have to include one of their higher-salary players to come close enough on Davis’ $25.4 million salary. Aside from James, some of the highest-paid Lakers included Kentavious Caldwell-Pope ($12 million, but with power to veto a trade) and Rajon Rondo ($9 million).
James has welcomed the idea of playing with Davis, a possibility he called “amazing” back in December. Paul also serves as James’ agent.
The implications of a trade for Davis also reached the Lakers’ practice Friday, but they appeared just as stoic. Ingram said trading for Davis would be “good for the Lakers, or whatever team that gets him,” but maintained that players have been shutting out the persistent trade rumors that the roster could be totally upheaved.
“It feels that (speculation is) on the outside of what’s in this gym,” he said at the team’s training facility. “I think you look on social networks and look on everything else, you have all these stories of this player, this player, this player. But no one in this room, or the players, or the coaches, or the general manager doesn’t say a word about it. … We only listen to the important people in this building.”
It’s worth noting that even though the Lakers’ core players are young, they’ve done plenty of cycles through the rumor mill near the trade deadline. Ball, Kuzma and Ingram were also widely discussed over the summer as possible assets in a deal with the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard, who later was traded to the Toronto Raptors.
Coach Luke Walton said he thinks his young players have shown a stronger ability to stay above the fray this January, even as trade rumors swirl more and more. He observed that Monday’s practice, which included James, was a focused session.
“There seems to be more comfort this time around than last year when all this was happening,” Walton said. “It’s just like anything in this league: their skill set, their bodies physically. The mental part of going through these types of things gets a little better every year it goes on. You go from being young to a vet and before you know it you don’t even think about this stuff.”
It’s unclear how much, if at all, Davis will play for the Pelicans before any deal is done. Teammate Jrue Holiday said he had no hard feelings toward Davis, whom he called “a professional.”
“Whatever decision he makes, I can’t be upset with him,” Holiday said. “I know this is a business, but he’s doing what’s best for him.”

Goshay: America, choose your King

Texto completo: He wanted, demanded, that the country he loved live up to all those things the founders said were self-evident.
In his last days, he was starting to devote more time and energy to the causes of war and economic injustice. His death in Memphis was the result of his speaking out on behalf of black garbage workers who simply wanted to be paid and treated as equals.
He doubtlessly would be dismayed right now at the spectacle of thousands of government workers scrambling to stay afloat in the richest and most powerful country on earth.
King never fed into the fear of immigrants. He never tried to pit the poor against one another, or blacks against Latinos and others, not in a country where there is enough for everyone. In describing his prophetic view from the mountaintop, he made no mention of a wall.
Martin Luther King Jr. would be disappointed but hardly surprised about Rep. Steve King, who has the effrontery to say what a lot of people secretly think.
For 20 years, there has been a conspiracy of silence in Congress as Steve King has insulted, denigrated and demonized immigrants and people of color, from those seeking asylum to those who work in the meat-processing plants that dot the Midwest because many Americans won't.
Of the Muslims working in those plants he said: "I don't want people doing my pork that won't eat it, let alone hope I go to hell for eating pork chops."
He once noted, "The idea of multiculturalism, that every culture is equal - that's not objectively true. ... We've been fed that information for the past 25 years, and we're not going to become a greater nation if we continue to do that."
Steve King was stripped of his congressional committee seats after a New York Times profile in which he was quoted as saying: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?"
Steve King says he was misquoted, that his ancestors were abolitionists, yet he keeps a Confederate flag on his desk. It's an unapologetic dog-whistle to those who refuse to let go of that last-gasp, lost cause of white supremacy.
But America always has been about moving forward. We are a nation of strivers, always looking to be better, always wrestling with our past, even as we charge headlong into the future.
Why is Steve King in trouble after all this time? Because the seeds planted by Martin Luther King Jr. in the hardscrabble and thorny soil of resistance are breaking through, bright and green with promise. Because the children of immigrants long dismissed by Steve King now are walking the halls of Congress.
It's time to choose which King you would prefer the world envision when it hears the word "America."

Texto completo: President Trump remains bullish that the North Korea nuclear threat can be contained. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, the president praised the "incredible meeting" he had the day before with a top representative of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, trumpeting the "tremendous progress" the two sides had made.
The optimistic view is that the White House meeting with Kim Yong-chol, a former North Korean intelligence chief and now his government's lead nuclear negotiator, was indeed productive, and Mr. Trump is on his way to resolving one of the world's most complex and dangerous nuclear weapons problems.
But a path to that outcome isn't yet visible to the outside world. North Korea has forgone nuclear tests, missile tests and rhetorical attacks for more than 400 days. That's an important development. At the same time, however, it continues to produce nuclear fuel, weapons and missiles. So, as the two leaders prepare for their second summit (reportedly next month in Vietnam), the pressure is on the Trump administration to articulate a realistic strategy for achieving a mutually agreed upon outcome.
No such strategy was evident last June when Mr. Trump broke with decades of foreign policy precedent by meeting directly with Mr. Kim in Singapore, in the first summit between American and North Korean leaders. Mr. Trump deserves credit for opening up this dialogue, but it has, so far, yielded few tangible results.
The one concrete product of the Singapore meeting, a concluding statement, was so poorly drafted that it laid the groundwork for months of stalemate. It committed the two leaders to "work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," without even defining "denuclearization," let alone explicitly agreeing on the sequence of actions to be taken.
Publicly, the two sides still hew to staunch positions: The Trump administration insists that tough sanctions will stay in place until North Korea completely gives up its nuclear arsenal. North Korean officials insist on sanctions relief early in the process.
But small signs of movement led to plans for the second summit. Mr. Trump backed off his insistence on immediate disarmament, and his administration recently eased travel restrictions so American aid workers and humanitarian supplies could once again enter the impoverished country.
Even if complete denuclearization is not possible, negotiators should at least seek a permanent end to testing and the production of fissile material.

Texto completo: TONIGHT'S MUST-SEE: "Rent" live, 8 p.m., Fox.
Back in 1986, a friend asked Jonathan Larson what he was working on. The reply: "I'm the future of the American musical." That seemed unlikely. Larson would share the same shabby apartment for 15 years, hold he same waiter job for nine years, write and re-write a modern-day "La Boheme" for seven.
He died of an aneurysm at 35 in 1996, on the eve of the opening. "'Rent' ... shimmers with hope for the future of the American musical," the New York Times wrote. It won Tonys and a Pulitzer, staying on Broadway for 12 years. This live production has Jordan Fisher, Vanessa Hudgens, Mario and more.
TONIGHT'S MUST-SEE II: "Three Identical Strangers," 9 and 11 p.m., CNN, barring breaking news.
On his first day at an obscure college, Bobby Shafran kept being greeted like an old friend. It took a while to figure it out: Eddie Galland – the twin he never knew about – had been there a year earlier. But they weren't just twins; their story attracted David Kellman, re-uniting triplets separated at birth.
This compelling documentary starts with three 19-year-olds embracing life. Enjoy that while it lasts; coming up are serious issues – science ethics, parenting, nature vs. nurture – in a far-ranging film
TONIGHT'S ALTERNATIVE: "Valley of the Boom" conclusion, 9-11 p.m., National Geographic, rerunning at 11.
The opening of this superb, three-week mini-series saw three companies in the internet's early days. The mid-section (rerunning at 9 and 10 a.m. ET) saw them get big-time investors, then wobble.
Two – Netscape and theGlobe.com – were earnest efforts, slammed by a get-big-or-die world. But the third was a scam; a felon (wonderfully played by Steve Zahn), on the lam, raised money for a company (Pixelon) that didn't work. Using lots of detours – including comments from experts and from some of the people portrayed -- "Boom" tells the story brilliantly.
Other choices include:
Movie memories, all day, Turner Classic Movies. This wraps up a 48-hour marathon, with winners of the Screen Actors Guild's lifetime achievemen award. The final films are Dick Van Dyke in "Bye Bye Birdie" (1963) at 2:15 p.m., Debbie Reynolds in "The Mating Game" (1959) at 4:15 and Alan Alda – who gets his lifetime award tonight – in Neil Simon's witty "California Suite" (1978) at 6.
Pro Bowl, 3 p.m.., ABC and ESPN, with preview at 2:45. Football's top players – minus the ones who are injured or in next week's Super Bowl – collide.
"SAG Awards," 8-10 p.m., TNT and TBS. Megan Mullally hosts the Screen Actors Guild event. TNT follows with the opener of Chris Pine in "I Am the Night."
"Masterpiece: Victoria," 9 p.m., PBS. It was Albert's idea to have everyone move away from the chaos of London protests. In a fairly good episode, Victoria is restless and disagreements are growing.
"Madam Secretary," 10 p.m., CBS. An American-made cluster bomb has killed children in Syria. Now Elizabeth scrambles to learn what happened.
"Black Monday," 10 p.m., Showtime. In the final minute of last week's rowdy opener, we learned how clever Mo (Don Cheadle) is: He tricked Blair Pfaff into working for him, because Blair's future in-laws own crucial stock. In a good follow-up tonight, Blair is hazed and Mo's favorite co-worker is restless.
"SMILF," 10:30, Showtime. How grim does this episode get? It starts with a nightmare scene involving disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, then gets darker. On the plus side, there's strong work from Rosie O'Donnell as Bridgette's newly widowed mother and Connie Britton as a self-centered employer.

Texto completo: What are you prepared to do?
The answer, I think, must be, "More."
This time of year, we are prompted to reflect on ourselves and resolve to improve. It's also a time of year when we are encouraged to reflect on our collective selves and aim to do better.
When we think of the "State of the Dream" that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King offered us, we hear again his soaring oratory. We think of John Lewis, one of the original Freedom Riders, now a revered member of the government he helped reshape, the "conscience of the House" of Representatives.
We are thankful that the "whites" and "colored" signs are gone from our public spaces. We are proud of the progress we have made — and we should also acknowledge the work that still remains ahead of us.
"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice," we say.
And that is true.
But it doesn't mean we can assume that time is on our side. It means we must get up and do some of the work to bend it.
"You have to get out there and push, and pull, to try to make things better for the generation yet unborn," said Lewis in a recent episode of "Oprah's Master Class The Podcast. "We have to be engaged, all of us, as members of the human family, as citizens of this country.... The fight is not over. We have to continue to fight."
In 2017, the Florida Department of Education released kindergarten readiness data for the first time in three years. It showed that as a whole, the Pensacola area has a long way to go toward bending that arc of history in favor of our children.
That year's data showed that 46 percent of Escambia schoolchildren were kindergarten ready in 2017. In Santa Rosa County, the readiness rate was 60 percent.
The state also offered the data broken down by school.
There are 32 elementary schools in Escambia County; 23 of our elementary schools had readiness rates of 50 or less. The lowest readiness rate for a school was 21.67 percent.
There are 14 elementary schools in Santa Rosa County; 5 of those schools had readiness rates at or below 50 percent. The lowest readiness rate for a school was 38.46 percent.
The Daily Mail, The New York Times and other publications last fall highlighted research from the U.S. Census Bureau, Harvard and Brown universities that shows at the Census tract — or neighborhood — level, which ZIP codes offer children born in poverty a better path out of that life.
You can go through the data here: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/upshot/maps-neighborhoods-shape-child-poverty.html
Children born in the neighborhoods where SCI's parent outreach program is working will earn between $18,000 and $21,000 a year as adults, according to the data analysis.
Change the neighborhood, and adult earning power goes up — some.
Kids born into poverty in Scenic Heights or Cordova Park will make between $34,000 and $41,000 as adults, the analysis shows.
This is why we must re-commit ourselves to the work of an Early Learning City.
Kae Dixon is a mother of four and an SCI volunteer. The New York native has lived in the Pensacola area for some time. She believes that SCI's early learning work is "the front line of the future."
To make this change on a community level, Dixon says a special kind of person is key.
"It will take people who believe in gardening," she says.
We couldn't agree more.
The seeds we are planting will grow, but they need to be nurtured, with time and patience. We need to work on the ground, sometimes on hands and knees, and we must get a little dirt on our hands to do it.
But we believe the reward will be great.
Shannon Nickinson is the director of early learning for Studer Community Institute. She can be reached at snickinson@studeri.org.

Texto completo: Rep. King applauded at first Iowa event since House rebuke
PRIMGHAR, Iowa -- Constituents applauded Republican Rep. Steve King on Saturday at the Iowa congressman's first public event since being rebuked by his House colleagues over racist comments he had made to a newspaper earlier this month.
King told the roughly 75 people who showed up for the first of 39 planned town hall meetings in his sprawling district that he doesn't adhere to a white supremacist ideology and he repeated his assertion that he's not racist.
The nine-term House member caused an uproar after he was quoted in a New York Times story saying, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?" King claimed his comments were taken out of context, but the House voted 424-1 to rebuke him, with King himself voting in favor of the resolution, and Republican leaders denied him any committee assignments.
Addressing what he called "the elephant in the room" in his opening remarks at Saturday's event, King expressed frustration that his comments about white nationalism and white supremacy in The New York Times interview led to even his fellow Republicans disowning him.
"It is stunning and astonishing to me that four words in a New York Times quote can outweigh 20-some years of public service, 20-some years of giving you my word every day," King said.

Trudeau fires envoy to China over U.S. extradition remarks
TORONTO -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired Canada's ambassador to China after the envoy said it would be "great" if the U.S. dropped its extradition request for a Chinese tech executive arrested in Canada. Trudeau said Saturday he had asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation Friday night.
McCallum made the remark Friday to the Toronto Star. That came a day after he issued a statement saying he misspoke about the case earlier and regretted saying Meng Wanzhou has a strong case against extradition.
The arrest of the daughter of the founder of Huawei Technologies Ltd. at Vancouver's airport Dec. 1 damaged relations between China and Canada. The U.S. wants her extradited to face charges that she committed fraud by misleading banks about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.

U.S. envoy points to 'significant progress' in talks with Taliban
KABUL, Afghanistan -- The U.S. peace envoy to Afghanistan said Saturday that "significant progress" was made during lengthy talks with the Taliban in Qatar and that he was traveling to Afghanistan for more discussions aimed at ending the country's 17-year war.
Zalmay Khalilzad said on Twitter that he wants to build on six days of meetings in Doha.
Taliban officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they have reached an understanding on the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops and that Afghan soil will not be used for attacks or threats against other countries.
There was also no indication that the Taliban would agree to a cease-fireor when the Taliban would hold direct talks with the Afghan government, something they have continued to reject.

Manhunt underway for suspect in 5 related killings in Louisiana
NEW ORLEANS -- Authorities in Louisiana say separate but related shootings Saturday in two parishes have left five people dead, and they're searching for a 21-year-old man they say is "armed and dangerous."
Ascension Parish Sheriff Bobby Webre said Dakota Theriot is the "prime suspect" in the deaths of Keith and Elizabeth Theriot of Gonzales, his parents.
The sheriff said three other shooting deaths occurred Saturday in neighboring Livingston Parish, about 70 miles west of New Orleans.
"We feel that they are related," Webre said.
Livingston Parish Sheriff Jason Ard identified the victims as Billy Ernest, 43, Summer Ernest, 20, and Tanner Ernest, 17. Two children fled. A neighbor said Theriot was the older daughter's boyfriend.

Merkel calls on each citizen to fight anti-Semitism
BERLIN -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on every citizen to help fight anti-Semitism ahead of International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
Merkel said Saturday in her weekly podcast: "Today we are seeing a very different kind of anti-Semitism: there's the hatred of Jews by our local people, but also by Muslim migrants."
In recent years, Germany has seen a rising number of attacks against Jews that led the government to appoint a commissioner against anti-Semitism. It's also funding the creation of a national registration office for anti-Semitic hate crimes.
On Sunday, Germany and other countries will mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day -- 74 years after the Soviet army liberated the Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland. Some 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust (this sentence as published has been corrected in this text).

Death toll rises to 40 in collapse at Brazil mine
BRUMADINHO, Brazil -- The death toll from the collapse of a dam holding back mine waste in southeastern Brazil rose to 40 Saturday as searchers in helicopters and rescuers laboring in deep mud uncovered more bodies. More than 200 people were still missing and authorities expected the death toll to rise.
Romeu Zema, the governor of the state of Minas Gerais, warned that those responsible "would be punished."
Daily Folha de S.Paulo reported Saturday that the dam's mining complex, owned and operated by Brazilian mining company Vale, was issued an expedited license to expand in December due to "decreased risk."
Preservation groups in the area say the approval was unlawful.
In addition to the 40 bodies recovered, 23 people were hospitalized.

In Mexico: The death toll from a pipeline explosion last week in Tlahuelilpan, a town in central Mexico, has risen to 114, while 33 people remain hospitalized. Hundreds of people were in the vicinity of an illegal pipeline tap that spewed gasoline in the town Jan. 18 when the liquid caught fire and exploded into a fireball.

In France: The yellow vest movement kept pressure on President Emmanuel Macron with mainly peaceful marches and scattered skirmishes Saturday, its 11th straight weekend. Protests took place in Paris and other cities, centered on Macron policies seen as favoring the rich. France deployed 80,000 police officers.

What Path Takes You to Congress?

Texto completo: The United States does not grant titles of nobility. There are no lords, barons or dukes here. At least, not officially.
Unofficially, however, Congress is made up of people who have credentials and experiences vastly different from those of most citizens. Unofficially, considering education, career, family background and personal wealth, it seems that America has a ruling class -- or at least a limited number of ways to enter the halls of power.
Here, we've traced the pre-congressional career of every House member in the 116th Congress, showing the narrow but well-trodden paths through prestigious schools, lucrative jobs and local political offices that led the latest crop of legislators to Capitol Hill.
The new House has a notable number of political novices, and more women and people of color than any Congress in history. But a majority of members, even the new ones, still made it to Washington by way of institutions and professions that are out of reach for most Americans.
The path to the House starts with higher education. Almost 95 percent of the representatives have at least a bachelor's degree, compared with about a third of Americans 25 and older. About half of members graduated from public universities, often in their home states, but more than 10 percent of representatives have bachelor's degrees from elite, private colleges.
It makes sense to elect educated leaders, and voters seem to think a college education is a necessary qualification for office. But the link between having a degree and being a more effective politician is tenuous. Research on legislators in the United States and in Brazil shows that lawmakers with more formal education are not more productive, more popular or less likely to be corrupt.
After college, the majority of representatives have successful white-collar careers before running for office. More than 70 percent of House members were lawyers in private practice, businesspeople (including employees in insurance, banking, finance and real estate) or medical professionals. That work can inform the types of bills they introduce, according to research by Katie Francis, a faculty member at Western Governors University. Doctors sponsor more health care legislation, for example.
Among both Democrats and Republicans, lawyers are staggeringly overrepresented: They constitute less than 1 percent of the voting-age population but more than one-third of the House. Perhaps it is natural for the people writing laws to study them first. But the United States is an exception internationally. Research by Adam Bonica of Stanford and Maya Sen of Harvard found that in Sweden, France and Denmark, lawyers make up less than 10 percent of the legislature.
Not only are lawyers more likely to run for office, but they are also more likely to win. This success is largely because of the advantage they have in early fund-raising, drawing from professional networks of other lawyers and affluent professionals.
Once in office, lawyers tend to vote in a way that benefits their profession. They are less likely to support laws that would cap awards for damages or regulate legal fees, according to Mr. Bonica and Ms. Sen's research.
Also overrepresented are members with business experience, who sometimes argue that their "outside the Beltway" experience will enable them to run government more like a business -- to reduce grift and waste and to pass laws more efficiently. Indeed, a majority of Americans think the country would be better governed with more people from business and management, according to a 2014 Gallup poll.
House members with business backgrounds get more contributions from corporations and vote for pro-business legislation more often. And research has shown that states with more legislators who worked in the insurance industry are likely to pass bills more favorable to it.
Other professions are underrepresented, with material consequences for lawmaking. Only about 15 United States representatives are scientists or engineers, which could partly explain lackluster action on climate change and ineffectual regulation of technology companies.
Notably absent are legislators who have held blue-collar or service jobs. Nicholas Carnes, a Duke professor of public policy, notes that there is no dearth of politically ambitious, qualified working-class candidates. And when working-class candidates run, they do just as well as candidates from other backgrounds. But blue-collar workers are less able to shoulder the practical burdens associated with running a campaign -- like taking time off from paid employment -- and less likely to be asked to run by local party leaders and officials.
In part because Congress is filled with successful white-collar professionals, the House is much, much richer than the people it represents. More than half of House members are millionaires, compared with about 3 percent of the public, according to Mr. Carnes.
Over all, wealthy politicians support legislation that benefits their own class at the expense of others. Wealthier legislators are, for instance, more likely to vote to repeal the estate tax.
"The rosy notion that lawmakers from business and professional backgrounds want what is best for everyone is seriously out of line with the realities of legislative decision-making in the United States," Mr. Carnes wrote in his book "White-Collar Government."
Women tend to have followed more varied paths to Capitol Hill: A smaller proportion are lawyers and businesspeople.
While men might run for office because of a "longstanding desire to be an elected official," women are more likely to run because "they encounter something in their engagement with the political system that angers them enough or frustrates them enough," said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics.
When they run, men and women have roughly the same chance of winning. But research by Sarah A. Fulton, a political scientist at Texas A&M University, shows that female candidates tend to be more qualified.
Historically, it is somewhat rare for representatives to reach the House without holding previous political office. Nearly 200 representatives have experience in a state legislature; others were mayors, local district attorneys or state agency heads. These experiences aren't just symbolic. New legislators with political experience introduce and pass more bills, according to Ms. Francis' research.
But drawing politicians from local governments and state legislatures also gives an edge to people who can afford to take those jobs. In some states, those positions don't pay enough to live on. New Hampshire's legislature, for example, pays just $ 200 per two-year term. As a result, state politicians are often "local economic elites and corporate titans," said Jake Grumbach, a researcher at Princeton.
The new representatives in the 116th Congress, however, do represent a significant break from the past. More than 40 percent of those elected in November are political novices who have never worked in government. Many were inspired to run in order to stand up to President Trump's agenda -- two-thirds of new members are Democrats -- but they may also have been emboldened by Mr. Trump's lack of political experience.
"That hasn't translated into lots of working-class candidates in this cycle," Mr. Carnes said, but "the larger narrative I see on both sides is, 'You don't have to be an establishment type to be a good politician."'
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: In 1900, there were two great philosophers working side by side at Harvard, William James and Josiah Royce. James was from an eminent Boston family and had all the grace, brilliance and sophistication that his class aspired to. Royce, as historian Allen Guelzo points out, was the first major American philosopher born west of the Mississippi. His parents were Forty-Niners who moved to California but failed to find gold. He grew up in squalor, was stocky, lonely and probably knew more about despair and the brooding shadows that can come in life.
James and Royce admired and learned from each other, but their philosophies were different. James was pragmatic and tough-minded, looking for empirical truth. Royce was more idealistic and tender-minded, more spiritual and abstract.
They differed on the individual's role in society. As David Lamberth of Harvard notes, James' emphasis was on tolerance. We live in a pluralistic society and we each know only a fragment of the truth. People should give one another enough social space so they can be themselves. For Royce the good life meant tightly binding yourself to others - giving yourself away with others for the sake of a noble cause. Tolerance is not enough.
James' influence is now enormous - deservedly so. Royce is almost entirely forgotten. And yet I would say that Royce is the philosopher we need today. In an age of division, fragmentation and isolation, Royce is the philosopher we don't know we have. He is the philosopher of binding and connection.
Royce argued that meaningful lives are marked, above all, by loyalty. Out on the frontier, he had seen the chaos and anarchy that ensues when it's every man for himself, when society is just a bunch of individuals searching for gain.
So for him the good human life meant loyalty, "the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause."
Of course, there can be good causes and bad causes. So Royce argued that if loyalty is the center of the good life, then we should admire those causes, based on mutual affection, that value and enhance other people's loyalty.
We should despise those causes, based on a shared animosity, that destroy other people's loyalty. 
Before Martin Luther King Jr. used it, Royce popularized the phrase "the beloved community." In the beloved community, political opponents honor the loyalty the rival has for a cause, and learn from it.
According to Royce, communities find their voice when they own their own betrayals; evil exists so we can struggle to overcome it.
Royce took his philosophy one more crucial step: Though we have our different communities, underneath there is an absolute unity to life. He believed that all separate individuals and all separate loyalties are mere fragments of a spiritual unity - an Absolute Knower, a moral truth.
That sense of an ultimate unity at the end things, shines back on us, because it means all our diverse loyalties are actually parts of the same loyalty. We all, he wrote, "seek a city out of sight." This sense of ultimate unity, of human brotherhood and sisterhood, is what is missing in a lot of the current pessimism and divisiveness.
Royce's philosophy is helpful with the problem we have today. How does the individual fit into the community and how does each community fit into the whole? He offered a shift in perspective. When evaluating your life, don't ask, "How happy am I?" Ask, "How loyal am I, and to what?"

Texto completo: It’s over. After 12 years of daily contact, I am finished with Facebook. It's not easy. We had a long meaningful connection — my avatar had more than 1200 virtual friends from every stage of my life.
Thousands of tiny takes and status updates from two-dimensional acquaintances had nearly replaced physical, personal contact. And those digital updates, links and images carried surprising emotional value. For instance, though my mother died four years ago at 90, I’ve still wished her happy birthday each year on her dormant Facebook page.
I was an enthusiastic early adapter. I joined in early 2006, when there were fewer than 12 million members. So intriguing was the prospect of a world wide Rolodex, I forged an email address with an . edu suffix in order to qualify.

Covington Catholic furor is a warning to end our dangerous social media mob mentality
Your photoshopped, Insta-perfect life is a fake — here's the key to make it a little more real
I deleted my Twitter account. It's a breeding ground for thoughtlessness and contempt.
Though well into my 50’s when Mark Zuckerberg launched his online club, I considered myself internet literate. I wrote for an online magazine, comfortably searched on Google, banked online and bought bargains on eBay. I used email daily and instant messaged my children.
Online becomes real life
But Facebook, guiding my idea of friendship from analog affection to digital distraction, became my entry into social media. Before joining, friendship had been an analog connection, exclusively three-dimensional, and suddenly it was accessible through another, limitless portal.
Social scientist Robin Dunbar holds that humans have a social connection capacity of roughly 150 individuals — (although I doubt marketing algorithms drive his research). But, in the beginning of Facebook, there were literally millions of additional friends to choose from.
In real life, I know when I’ve been unfriended and feel sadness with such a loss. But, recognizing the difference between human and avatar, I’d hardly notice falling off with a fair-weather Facebook friend.
My timeline was stacked with my Generation X, millennial colleagues and some childhood friends of my grown-up children. In the days before everyone had a Twitter game, The New York Times Magazine had an item about the most entertaining status updates on Facebook. A week or two later, one of these cyber celebrities requested my friendship. Flattered, I readily accepted, years before I learned the meaning of "FOMO. "
I searched for a few familiar names from high school but my new virtual companions skewed much younger. Around 2008 a person whose name I didn’t recognize reached across the decades to befriend me. His profile showed he attended my high school class of 1967 and my memory conjured a shy boy among the coat locker-lined hallways, just outside of my field of vision.
With the mental image of him came a sharp, unpleasant recollection of my own adolescent judging. A little shaken that my history had so abruptly caught up with me, I messaged my former classmate, apologizing for the callow, dismissive teenager I had been. He replied graciously, feigning ignorance of my prehistoric microaggression. Unfortunately, though my social skills had improved since my teenage years, my digital interface abilities were still subpar. I slighted him again by accidentally deleting his friend request.
Meantime, I cyber-gifted virtual cupcakes, posted videos, and quoted song lyrics to my new pixilated pals. I wrote often on Slate, Aol and the Washington Post about Facebook’s college-age founder’s controversies and public presence. I was solidly team Zuckerberg when Aaron Sorkin’s film "The Social Network" was released in 2010. Although I was skeptical when my new friend Mark claimed his site would soon act as a “personalized” and customized news source, I was fully committed to sharing images of my 3-year old grandson. I dreamed Facebook and I would grow old together, anticipating applications for home-bound seniors that could help us dote on our families.
Facebook: The anti-social network
By then radio stations, super markets and members of Congress had all signed up. Persons were depersonalized and “timelines” indeed became “news feeds” with unsubstantiated opinions sponsored by unknown pulpits dotting my virtual front page.
As the club got bigger, my younger friends drifted away to other social media. Suddenly, my boomer cohort came aboard. My 50-year class reunion in 2017 was organized via a closed group on the site.
Sadly, by then, the 2016 election had negatively colored my Facebook feed. Even before I learned that ersatz engagement may have impacted its results, the division and name calling among previously pleasant posters had gotten tiresome. I found myself mollifying my conservative contacts who were insulted by the indignation of my more liberal friends.
By last March, when Cambridge Analytica was suspected to have surreptitiously affected election results using tens of millions of Facebook members’ personal data, my ardor had dimmed more definitively. The massive security breach in September was proof the site was sloppy with my secrets. The final blow to our crumbling relationship came with December’s revelations that my once beloved was cheating on me with other commercial sites. My friendship facilitator had betrayed me. I was weary of being commodified.
As 2018 came to its inauspicious end, I posted a "Dear Facebook, it’s over," status update citing our lost faith. “The trust is gone in our relationship. ”
Our separation is cordial. I have not deleted the software from my laptop despite helpful instructions online on how to archive and sever. It seems too soon to be burning portals.
I changed my status to “closed” and have gone silent, with a sentimental sigh for lost love. I like to think my contacts are continuing the conversation without me.

U.S. Senator Tim Scott Critical of GOP on Racism and Rep. Steve King

Texto completo: Stating what has become even more of an issue for the GOP during the presidency of Donald Trump, Sen. Tim Scott, wrote:
"We are often still struggling when it comes to civility and fairness. This was driven home once again Thursday as Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) wondered aloud: 'White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?"'
In a blistering op-ed in The Washington Post, the U.S. Senate's only African American Republican, took the Republican Party to task on the issue of racism. Sen. Scott has been openly reluctant to support Donald Trump. He notably skipped the Republican National Convention in 2016.
On January 10, Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa wondered out loud when the term "white supremacists" became a negative during an interview with The New York Times.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" King said during the interview. In a familiar pattern, Rep. King sought to "clarify" his comments a day later. But the U.S. Representative has a long history of comments that can easily be defined as racist.
"I want to make one thing abundantly clear; I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define. Further, I condemn anyone that supports this evil and bigoted ideology which saw in its ultimate expression the systematic murder of 6 million innocent Jewish lives," Rep. King said on January 11.
In July 2013, King said of Mexican immigrants that, "For every one who's a valedictorian, there's another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds-and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert."
Rep. King displayed the Confederate flag on his office desk in 2016 removing it later after a Confederate flag-waver shot two law enforcement officers in Iowa.
In March 2017, he wrote "culture and demographics are our destiny. We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies" and, "you need to teach your children your values" and "with the inter-marriage, I'd like to see an America that is just so homogenous that we look a lot the same."
Rep. King's words are familiar to that of the rhetoric of David Duke and Richard Spencer and other prominent white supremacists. Though he was been criticized by Speaker Paul Ryan for his past comments, many Republicans have remained silent during Rep. King's racial controversies.
Sen. Scott has become tired of that practice.
Sen. Scott cataloged recent racist incidents in the U.S. saying, "Three months ago, a white supremacist killed two black people in a parking lot in Kentucky. We are only 18 months from Charlottesville, where white nationalists killed a white woman with a car and severely beat multiple black people. A
"lmost four years ago, a white supremacist murdered nine African Americans in a church in Charleston, S.C. In 1998, white supremacists dragged James Byrd Jr., behind a pickup truck through Jasper, Tex., decapitating him in the process."
"I will admit I am unsure who is offended by the term "Western civilization" on its own, but anyone who needs "white nationalist" or "white supremacist" defined, described and defended does lack some pretty common knowledge," Sen. Scott continued.
"When people with opinions similar to King's open their mouths, they damage not only the Republican Party and the conservative brand but also our nation as a whole," Sen. Scott continued.
The backdrop of Rep. King's latest racially-motivated comments is President Trump's insistence on building a wall at the border of Mexico. Trump ran on a platform that defined Mexican immigrants as violent and dangerous.
Noteably, after white supremacists marched with torches in Charlottesville, Va., President Trump was not only slow in denouncing their message but declared that - "both sides" - were "violent."
"Silence is no longer acceptable," Sen. Scott concluded.

Trump pursued a deal in Russia and hid it from voters

Texto completo: Americans might soon learn what, if anything, special counsel Robert Mueller has found out about potential collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.
But there's one Trump-Moscow link where the emerging evidence is already as damning as it is disturbing.
During much, if not all, of Trump's campaign he sought to enrich himself by pursuing a luxury hotel-condominium-office deal in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow.
And as a candidate, Trump repeatedly misled or lied to voters about his business with Russia. "I have nothing to do with Russia," he told reporters in July 2016. "I don't deal there," he said during the Oct. 9 presidential debate.
OTHER VIEWS: ' ‘We still have no evidence of collusion’
The truth is, Trump had coveted a lucrative hotel project in Russia — whether to build one or license his name to be emblazoned on a skyscraper — for decades. "We will be in Moscow at some point," he said in a 2007 deposition.
Later, as a presidential candidate, he secretly signed an 18-page letter of intent for Trump Tower Moscow on Oct. 28, 2015, the day of the third Republican presidential debate.
Court filings by Mueller in November make clear that negotiations led by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen continued through at least June 2016. Cohen lied about this to Congress to "give the false impression that the Moscow Project ended before 'the Iowa caucus and . . . the very first primary,' " according to the filings.
You have to wonder what the fallout would have been if those negotiations had been exposed before Trump debated his Republican primary opponents or Hillary Clinton. The electorate certainly was robbed of knowing about this crucial information at a time when:
► There were news reports that Russia was interfering in the election.
► Trump was expressing praise and admiration for President Vladimir Putin, even as he was insulting hundreds of other people, places and things on Twitter.
► The candidate said that, as president, he would consider easing sanctions placed against Russia for its violent seizure of Crimea.
► Trump was questioning America's continued role in NATO, a bulwark against Russian aggression that Putin has historically despised.
► A plank in the GOP platform regarding U. S. support for Ukraine was watered down.
► Trump challenged Moscow to release Democratic emails that Russians were reported to have hacked.
How does the president explain the appearance of a quid pro quo? By claiming that he was just keeping his options open. "There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won," Trump said in November, "in which case I would have gotten back into the (real estate development) business. And why should I lose lots of opportunities?"
Exactly when the Trump Tower Moscow "opportunity" collapsed remains murky. On Sunday, the president's current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, quoted Trump as telling him that project talks were "going on from the day I announced to the day I won. " By Monday, Giuliani was scrambling to walk back his comments to The New York Times and other news outlets.
But whether Trump was pursuing the arrangement until he clinched the Republican nomination, or right up until he was elected president, isn't the main point. What matters is that a presidential candidate was secretly negotiating a major business deal with a major U. S. adversary — an extraordinary conflict of interest that was concealed from voters.

Texto completo: Harris Wofford, who died this week at 92, was so lacking in cynicism and guile that people today would scarce believe a man like him ever won a seat in the United States Senate.
Born into a well-to-do family, young Harris walked to church Sundays rather than ride in his Republican father's car, which sported an "Alf Landon for President" sticker. Harris wanted FDR to win again and, at nine years of age, was voting with his feet.
It's hard to imagine a nine-year-old New Dealer. It's harder, still, to imagine a 23-year-old campaigning for a united world government, a 28-year-old white Howard Law School student or a successful U.S. Senate candidate who won Pennsylvania on the issue of single-payer national health care.
Wofford was all of those things - most of them toxic for a candidate - and he not only overcame them, he used them as grappling hooks to scale the sheer walls of electoral politics. Wofford won a Senate seat campaigning for socialized medicine, all the while telling stories about himself that would doom a contemporary candidate.
World government? United World Federalists? He would quote Gandhi. Wofford's own words turned up in the speeches of Martin Luther King Jr. He persuaded John F. Kennedy to place a phone call to King's wife while her husband languished in an Alabama jail - something many thought a suicide mission for a presidential candidate seeking the Southern vote in 1960.
Bob Casey Sr., the buttoned-down Democratic governor, appointed Wofford to the Senate in 1991 after Republican John Heinz died in a fiery, mid-air plane-helicopter collision. Casey had cast about for someone to take the post. Lee Iacocca and a few others turned him down, knowing that Republicans would nominate superstar Dick Thornburgh. It was going to be a slaughter.
Wofford just went on being Wofford. He gave me an on-the-record interview in which he talked about the time he helped to loot a Chinese city that had just been captured by the Japanese.
It happened in 1937, during a round-the-world cruise with his grandmother. The ship had docked outside a bombed and brutalized Shanghai. The Japanese sold looting licenses. For $5, passengers could roam the city for a few hours, and take anything they could carry back to the boat.
Harris returned to the ship with a large, stuffed ostrich.
"I saw my grandmother's face and she was just crestfallen," he said. "I had to carry this thing all around the world with me." When it began to smell too much, he heaved the thing overboard outside Honolulu.
Wofford told this story and countless others about himself. Republicans started the 1991 campaign by computerizing the paper trail Wofford had written or spoken for the record. He laughed. Plenty there, he told me. But he knew that being too careful risked being uninteresting, and Harris Wofford wasn't born to be uninteresting.
Casey explained Wofford to me this way: "He's very candid and he's not a politician in that sense. He's not calculating. There's a certain kind of innocence about him."
When a political sponsor describes his man in the language a defense lawyer would use in front of a judge, the smart money isn't going in that direction.
And Wofford turned around and won the contest; won it handily and sent Mr. Thornburgh into political retirement.
Three years later, Rick Santorum arrived. The new Democratic president, Bill Clinton, was in crash-and-burn mode, and much of it centered around his proposal for Wofford-style national health insurance. Mr. Clinton, in a rare moment of political miscalculation, had handed leadership of the health reform task force to his spouse, tripping off a host of attacks from multiple angles.
Wofford went down with national health insurance. Mr. Santorum boldly turned Wofford's idealism against him. Wofford's only other major bill was to create a sort of domestic Peace Corps, called AmeriCorps, for young people to build projects and work in impoverished towns.
Mr. Santorum likened it to "a bunch of hippies sitting around a campfire singing 'Kumbaya.' "It was the dawn of a new and cynical age and Wofford had outlived his own.
Mr. Santorum's crew sang "Kumbaya" on election night 1994, when they beat Wofford. Mr. Clinton appointed Wofford to head AmeriCorps, and Mr. Santorum, became his biggest ally. It was hard not to fall for this guy, even after you'd beaten him.
In his final years, Wofford remarried. His first wife, Clare, had died two years after he'd left the Senate. In 2016, he published an op-ed in The New York Times with the headline, "Finding Love Again: This Time With a Man."
At 90, Wofford was announcing his impending marriage to a man. He rejected the label of "gay." Joy was something bigger than identity.
Wofford had been extraordinarily happy with Clare. Now he was extraordinarily happy with a young man named Matthew.
Wofford had a talent for happiness. That's one hell of a political legacy.
Dennis Roddy spent 40 years covering politics for The Pittsburgh Press and the Post-Gazette. He now is senior adviser at ColdSpark, a Pittsburgh consulting firm.

Texto completo: It's known worldwide as the windshield phenomenon. I hadn't heard of it until I went online in August after a trip to Grand Marais, Minn.
We had driven over 500 miles, collecting only four insect smears on our windshield. I remember trips when I had to stop at a filling station not for gas, but to clean a windshield covered with flattened bugs.
I couldn't recall when that last happened. The change was insidious.
Insects, according to researchers, are disappearing in a way similar to the disappearance of birds, only more so. The decline is constant, but so slow as to be unrecognizable until, suddenly, with one focused look it's all too apparent.
For a long time we have blamed habitat loss as a major reason for declining bird numbers. That certainly is a factor. But what if loss of insects is a major factor?
Bob Janssen, who lives in Golden Valley, for decades has been an observer of Minnesota birds and changes to bird population. I asked him if he knew anything about an insect problem here.
"Look through your windshield," he said. "That will tell you a lot." Dead bugs on summer windshields are a thing of the past, he said. He shared concern for bird species that rely on insects for food.
Recent studies in Canada focused on a perceived reduction in tree swallow numbers. That species feeds
exclusively on flying insects.
"Birds are very resilient," Janssen said, "but they can't get along without food."
The cover story in a recent issue of the New York Times Sunday magazine called this decline "an insect apocalypse." The story recounts study after study documenting steeply falling insect populations.
Dramatic insect declines around the world were documented in a mid-October report published by the National Academy of Sciences.
Birds are not alone -- the populations of other animals that eat insects are declining as well, the report said.
In a Puerto Rico study, undertaken in 2012, the decline of birds species eating insects closely followed a decline in the number of insects. Birds whose diet is mainly fruit or grain showed no corresponding decreases.
Data from that study in Puerto Rico were compared with data from 1976. The abundance of insects had fallen by 99 percent.
Scientists attribute the decline in Puerto Rico to an increase in forest temperatures of just under 4 degrees F. over the past 40 years.
That seems like a small increase. The researchers explained that insects long ago adapted to an unchanging range of temperature. They don't do well when temperatures exceed the norm.
Unlike animals, bugs cannot regulate their internal temperatures. This can impact reproduction. Sperm counts lessen, and sperm lose motility. The loss cascades, generation after ever-smaller generation.
Studies in Britain, Germany, Singapore, Costa Rica, Brazil, Mexico and Australia also found insect declines. Three of the studies gave climate sensitivity as a specific reason for decline.
In Minnesota, about a quarter of our resident summer bird species are threatened with the need to move north as the climate warms, according to Minnesota Audubon.
If insects move north to find suitable temperatures, birds would follow. This assumes, of course, that the move would accommodate insect needs.
Our songbirds eat either seeds or insects. Some birds also eat fruit. But almost all songbirds rely on insects to feed recently hatched young.
Insects offer the high protein and fat content necessary to support rapid growth of nestlings. Birds must be mature enough to care for themselves before fall migration or winter. Insects are the fuel for this race.
The Puerto Rico study ruled out the likelihood that habitat change or pesticides were major influences in the declines.
Meanwhile, a clean windshield gives you a good look down the road, and also, at the rate we're going, into our future.

Texto completo: It’s a whole new day on the station that bills itself as "Lake County’s Best Variety."
Tuesday marked the debut of a new talent lineup on WXLC 102.3-FM, the Alpha Media hot adult-contemporary station.
Signing on as morning personality from 5 to 10 a.m. weekdays is Wes McKane, who hosted mornings for 16 years at two stations in Milwaukee — WMYX and WXSS — until 2017. Since then McKane has been operating Edge Marketing and Media, a podcast network and social media services firm he co-founded.
He replaces Jimmy Novak, a 10-year veteran of 102.3 XLC whose last day on the air was Friday.
Joining McKane as morning co-host is Leah Andersen, who most recently was weekend host and morning fill-in co-host on Alpha Media active rock WIIL 95.1-FM.
Continuing as midday host from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. is Frank Wright, who was promoted last month to the additional job of content director for 102.3 XLC.
Moving up to afternoons from 3 to 7 p.m. is Jason Cornell, who previously hosted evenings. He replaces Haynes Johns, who exited in November. Cornell also serves as the station’s chief engineer.
New nighttime personality from 7 p.m. to midnight is Janelle Rominski, who doubles as promotions director.
"Wes and Leah are going to be a blast to listen to as they wake up with Lake County," Wright said in a statement. "Jason has been a staple of the station for years and is eager to get you home in the afternoon. Janelle is excited for her chance to highlight her passion for music.
"I’m very excited with the direction these changes will mean for the station."
In the latest Nielsen Audio survey of the Chicago metropolitan area, WXLC tied for 39th with a 0.2 percent audience share.
Blago’s rise and fall "Public Official A," a true crime podcast that examines the rise and fall of Rod Blagojevich, has just been released by Chicago Public Media WBEZ 91.5-FM.
Marking 10 years since the imprisoned former governor was arrested for corruption, the podcast draws on six hours of conversations with his wife, Patti, as well as interviews with former top aides, FBI agents and New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman. Additional episodes will be released every Friday on WBEZ’s website and app, Pocket Casts, Apple Podcasts and other platforms.
The series is hosted by Dave McKinney, state politics reporter for WBEZ, who covered Blagojevich for the Sun-Times.
"Rod Blagojevich is one of the most complex, charismatic and flawed figures in contemporary American politics, and his rise and fall contains all of the echoes of a Shakespearean tragedy," Steve Edwards, vice president and chief content officer of WBEZ, said in a statement.
Tara Molina Two new reporters have been hired at CBS-owned WBBM-Channel 2 — and both are graduates of the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University-.
Starting Monday is Tara Molina, just in from WEWS, the ABC affiliate in Cleveland, where she specialized in "topical investigative reporting."
Joining CBS 2 next month is Mugo Odigwe, a freelance reporter at KOVR, the CBS-owned station in Sacramento, California.

NYC'S NOODLE QUEEN, SUPERIOR MOTORS TEAM UP FOR DINNER

Texto completo: Simone Tong put mixian on the map in New York City two years ago, and she is hoping to repeat that feat in Pittsburgh.
The chef and owner of Little Tong Noodle Shop, who has championed the spaghetti-shaped rice noodle, is teaming up with chef-owner Kevin Sousa of Superior Motors for a six-course Chinese New Year dinner on Feb. 5 at his Braddock restaurant.
Mixian [pronounced mee-shee-en], a native of the Yunnan province in China, is a humble and light rice noodle that has a special place in Ms. Tong's heart for a simple reason. "I love it, and want to share it with people around me."
When she opened Little Tong in the East Village in March 2017, she devoted the entree section to mixians, serving them with pork, chicken, shrimp or vegetables. When the mixian buzz spread, the critics raved, especially about the Grandma chicken mixian. The New Yorker called it "T.L.C. at its finest."
In his two-star review, New York Times critic, Pete Wells, wrote: "Little Tong Noodle Shop plunges mixian into soups and sauces that make a definite impression" and called the Grandma chicken mixian "the most interesting chicken noodle soup in the city right now."
Last year, she opened a second Little Tong location, which offers only counter service, in Midtown East. And in spring, she is opening a full-service Chinese-inspired restaurant in the West Village called Silver Apricot that will feature housemade cheeses, charcuterie and breads and give emphasis to wine, sake and beer, as well.
Ms. Tong's life in the kitchen began as an English-Chinese translator for a French chef when she worked at her mother's restaurant in her native Chengdu. Growing up she moved around to different cities and countries, and lived with her family in Macau, studied in Beijing and Australia and spent her teen years in Singapore. After she got her undergraduate degree from the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill in economics and psychology, she returned to China.
In 2009, after watching an episode of the TV show, "After Hours With Daniel," which featured chef Wylie Dufresne of wd-50, she was determined to work at the influential avant-garde New York City restaurant, which closed in 2014. She moved her way up the kitchen ladder from a prep cook to the "highest honor" of being the fish cook. "I dabbled in a little bit of everything at wd-50. That's where I fulfilled my dreams and learned most of my techniques," she says.
That's also where she met and worked with Christopher Clark, who would later become the general manager at Superior Motors. "Ever since I met her, I thought she had a strong voice about food and knew how to extract flavors," he says. "I thought she was a young cook who was going to develop into something special."
Mr. Sousa and he were looking for fresh original voices for their dinner series, which debuted in December with an ice cream dinner with Sam Mason, who also worked at wd-50 as a pastry chef. And Ms. Tong, 36, seemed a natural fit.
Holding the dinner on Feb. 5 has a lot of significance for her.
"It is my dad's birthday, and I wanted my Macau cousin who now lives in Pittsburgh to join in on the celebration. Only afterward did I remember that this year, the first day of the Chinese New Year also falls on the same date," she says.
She says the Lunar New Year is like Thanksgiving, but on steroids as the celebration traditionally lasts for 15 days. "So instead of one Thanksgiving meal, we have 15," she says, laughing.
Typically, revelers spend the first day paying their respects to the elders in the family and spending time with them, and so was it a sacrifice to be cooking for 150 diners in Braddock that night?
"Not at all," she responds without hesitation. "For the past nine years, I have always worked on Chinese New Year's Day, And I do get to celebrate it with my family - my restaurant family." She adds that Mr. Clark had suggested holding the dinner later in February but she insisted on Feb. 5 - to celebrate her dad.
Mr. Sousa says he left it to Ms. Tong to chalk out the menu. "I'm excited to be exposed to the Yunnanese cuisine as I am not very familiar with it," he says. "My goal is always to learn something from visiting chefs."
The $85 dinner will have two seatings - 6 and 8 p.m. - and an optional wine pairing for $30. Sommelier Domenic Fiore will be pouring wines, which are from Artisan's Cellar. Tickets are available at www.exploretock.com/superiormotors.
It starts with a cold Chinese broccoli salad stir-fried with the high quality binchotan (Japanese charcoal) oil, and tossed with pickled beets and caramelized cheese curds. Shaved house-cured egg yolk is the finishing touch on top.
Beef tartare flavored with pickled mustard seeds, sun-dried tomato, fried shallots and served with a flaky roti-like pancake is the second course. It is followed by black truffle-filled chicken dumplings cooked in chicken broth and herb oils. A seafood course is next, where firm-textured tiger prawns are served with toasted almonds, chili, fried garlic and shiso, an herb that is the love child of mint and basil.
Ms. Tong's signature mixian shows up in the last course before dessert and is served with premium Japanese Wagyu beef cooked with the flying saucer-looking pattypan squash and pixian chili bean paste.
Adzuki bean is for dessert, and that will be prepared by Mr. Sousa. He is serving the red mung beans with pickled pineapple, toasted rice sorbet, dark chocolate ganache with adzuki bean jam filling and a chocolate/sesame tuile.
When coming up with the menu at Braddock, Ms. Tong says she was looking for foods that people will enjoy eating in real time and "not be thinking of what it will taste like in some village in some part of China."
"It is hard to replicate something authentic, but it is a lot easier to define something delicious," she says.
So is mixian the next big Asian noodle in the U.S. foodscape?
Ms. Tong is confident it will resonate with people provided "the noodles are made right and the sauce is flavorful." It might just take some time. After all, she says, it took ramen years to become mainstream on the Stateside even though it had been around for a long time.

TRUMP'S TOUGH TALK ABOUT TAKING RUSSIA'S OIL BUSINESS FACES SKEPTICISM: Trump claims he has been tougher on Russia because rising U.S. oil exports have made it harder for Moscow to keep its share of the global energy market.


But the U.S. oil industry is skeptical of that claim, primarily because Russia appears to be increasing its oil exports in the last year, rather than losing out on market share to the U.S.


Russia upping its supply: In fact, Russia is increasing its supply of oil, even as it is supposed to be going along with an OPEC-led pledge to cut oil production in order to avoid an oil supply glut and drive up prices. Russia doesn’t appear to be meeting its end of the Saudi Arabia-led OPEC deal, said Sabrina Fang , spokeswoman for the American Petroleum Institute, the lead trade association for the U.S. oil industry.


“Russia is an enigma in that they have pledged cutbacks to OPEC, but [the International Energy Association] and OPEC data still show their supply increasing,” Fang said in an email.


Displacing OPEC: The only thing the U.S. oil industry can be certain of is that Mideast suppliers and OPEC have been in decline, she said. Their share has diminished as U.S. oil suppliers have stepped up to meet all new rising demand for oil, with the U.S. leading the world as the largest oil supplier.


It is OPEC members, countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, rather than Russia that have suffered more from the U.S. ramp-up in oil production, according to API's analysis.


Russia and US in the lead: In fact, both Russia and the U.S. are projected to drive most of the growth in oil production in the new year among non-OPEC countries, according to OPEC’s monthly report released Jan. 17.

COLD WEATHER SPARKS WARNINGS, ALERTS ACROSS US: Utility Southern California Gas Co. warned residents in its service area Monday to conserve their use of natural gas because of increased demand for home heating during a current spat of cold weather.


The utility issued a “dial it down” alert for Monday night through Thursday morning.


It requests Southern California residents conserve their energy especially at night, when natural gas demand is highest for home heating, hot water, and cooking. Southern California Gas Co. offered tips for conserving energy, saying residents should wash clothes with cold water, take shorter showers — and dress warmer.


It’s cold everywhere: Grid operator PJM Interconnection, meanwhile, extended a cold-weather alert until noon today for its entire 13-state region from Illinois to Virginia.


AMERICANS ARE INCREASINGLY WORRIED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE: More than 70 percent of Americans say extreme weather events in the last five years have influenced their opinion of climate change, according to a poll released Tuesday.


Half of people polled said recent events such as deadly wildfires in California, and hurricanes in Houston, Florida, and Puerto Rico have influenced their thinking on climate change a “great deal” or a lot.


The poll of 1,202 adults was conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. It was conducted in November, before the release of a U.S. government report that said global warming will impose hundreds of billions of dollars of damages on the U.S. economy, much of it generated by disaster response and adaptation.


There’s a trend brewing: A second poll released Tuesday by Yale’s Program on Climate Change Communication found that a record number of respondents, 73 percent, said that global warming is happening. That’s a jump of 10 percentage points from the same poll in 2015.


What to do about it: Forty-four percent of respondents in the AP poll who believe climate change is happening support a carbon tax, while 25 percent said they neither support or oppose it.


Two-thirds of those support a carbon tax if the revenues were used for restoring forests and wetlands, and more than half support it if the proceeds were used for research and development of renewable energy and public transportation programs.


Those two methods outperformed an approach preferred by free-market groups, and some centrist Republicans, that would refund the tax revenue to American households. About 49 percent said they would favor a “tax rebate to all Americans.”


TOYOTA AND PANASONIC TEAM UP ON ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERIES: Toyota and Panasonic announced Tuesday morning a partnership to develop batteries for electric vehicles as a way to combat climate change.


Toyota, Japan’s leading automaker, and Panasonic, the Japanese electronics maker, will establish a joint venture focused on research and development of EV batteries, engineering, manufacturing, and sales.


The companies, which did not disclose how much money they would invest, said the venture will be running by the end of 2020.


“Today’s automotive world is also being called on by society to help find solutions to such issues as those related to global warming, resources and energy,” they said in a joint statement.


Challenges facing batteries and EVs: Electric vehicles are benefiting from lower prices for lithium-ion batteries and technical advances that are increasing how far a car can drive before having to be recharged and reducing recharging times. But some raw materials essential to electric vehicles remain scarce, there is a shortage of places to recharge, and battery-powered cars cost thousands of dollars more than most gasoline vehicles.


PIPELINE EXPLOSION IN OHIO FORCES EVACUATION FROM HOMES: An explosion of a natural gas pipeline in Ohio on Monday caused a fireball that damaged homes, prompting the evacuation of residents.


Enbridge, the Canadian-based pipeline operator, said two people were injured and two structures were damaged from the explosion.


The company said it shutdown the section of the pipeline that exploded.


The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has sent an investigator to the scene to probe how the explosion happened, the agency told Reuters.


The Texas Eastern pipeline, as its called, transports natural gas from the Gulf Coast and Texas to customers in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast.


INTERIOR’S BERNHARDT JOINS TRUMP AT MLK MEMORIAL: Interior Department Acting Secretary David Bernhardt joined Trump and Vice President Mike Pence Monday on a visit to the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial in Washington D.C.









bernhardt







While social media had fun poking Bernhardt about his relative anonymity, he clearly is in good standing with the president. Josh has previously reported Bernhardt has a strong chance of being nominated to stay on as Interior secretary, after replacing Ryan Zinke on an acting basis earlier this month.


CARBON PRICING DROPPED FROM NEW FRANCE-GERMANY TREATY: France and Germany removed carbon pricing from a list of bilateral initiatives to pursue in their new treaty, the European media outlet EURACTIV reported Tuesday.


The signing of the Elysée treaty is meant to cement the two countries post-war reconciliation. A previous version of the treaty mentioned carbon pricing as an area for France and Germany to work together.


The revised text says the countries will adopt “ambitious measures to fight climate change” and “act in close relationship” with one another “in order to formulate common approaches and policies,” but it does not mention carbon pricing.


A silver lining: France and Germany remain participants in the EU ETS, the European Union’s emissions trading program.

The irony of media going all-in on a selectively edited video from the March for Life

Texto completo: Selectively edited videos are bad. Except when they aren’t.

That’s at least one of the big takeaways from the press’ disastrous promotion this weekend of bogus allegations of racism against teenagers at the March for Life. They were harassed by an elderly Native American protester, after being berated and abused by a hateful sect known as the Black Hebrew Israelites, but their situation got really bad only because of a single, selectively edited video of the incident that took place the day after the March for Life.

Forgive my eyerolling as I think back to the high standard of proof that the national media set in 2015 following the release of the undercover Planned Parenthood tapes. A court has since concluded that those tapes were kosher, but the media described them as "selectively edited" when they were released.

The video in this story, in contrast, actually was selectively edited. The New York Times claimed in a headline published Saturday that high school students in “Make America Great Again” hats mobbed Nathan Phillips, an elderly Native American protester and Vietnam War veteran.

“A Native American Vietnam War veteran was seen being harassed and mocked by a group of MAGA hat-wearing teens,” read a headline published this weekend by the Huffington Post.

The Huffington Post also featured the story on its front page Saturday under a banner that blared: “MAGA HATS, MEGA HATE: HARASSMENT AT NATIVE MARCH.”

Politico ran with a story headline, “Oklahoma senator blames hateful rhetoric for teens harassing Native American.”

“Video Shows MAGA-Clad Teenagers Harassing, Mocking Native American Vietnam,” read a headline from Slate.

Mother Jones likewise claimed the teens “taunted” an Omaha Elder.

Every single one of these stories is based on a single, shaky video that was posted to social with the caption, “Is this how we make America great ‘again’?” The video is exactly three minutes and 44 seconds long. It begins in the middle of the March for Life incident, and it ends abruptly before the alleged confrontation has even concluded. Obviously, the video is missing crucial context. It does not capture what led up to the incident or its aftermath.

This caused certain newsrooms to jump in and get behind a story of something that didn't actually happen, that the teens “mobbed” and “taunted” an elderly Native American.

And to think it was just a few years ago that these exact same media organizations claimed the Center for Medical Progress’ hours and hours of uncut undercover footage was “selectively edited.” This meant that the group's claim that it had caught Planned Parenthood associates discussing the processes by which organs from the remains of aborted children can be harvested and sold (er, donated for a fee) was ultimately untrustworthy.

"Second Heavily Edited Planned Parenthood Attack Video Is Also a Big Bust,” read one Slate headline.

"[A] little-known anti-abortion activist," Mother Jones reported, "ignited a firestorm by releasing ... selectively edited videos."

“Report for Planned Parenthood finds sting videos manipulated,” Politico reported following the release of a “study” the so-called women’s health organization commissioned from the Democratically aligned Fusion GPS. The Politico report was careful to note that Fusion GPS went so far as to bring in "video and transcription experts" who are "not associated with Planned Parenthood."

The firm's "findings" are the first "comprehensive account of the video's discrepancies,” Politico reported.

"Planned Parenthood Videos Were Altered, Analysis Finds,” the New York Times also reported at the time.

The Huffington Post went with this: "'Sting' Videos Of Planned Parenthood Are Totally Manipulated, Forensic Analysis Finds,” adding that even “the supposedly unedited 'full' footage is misleadingly altered, experts say.”

For what it’s worth, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, after an exhaustive review of hundreds of hours of tape, found last week that the tapes had definitely not been selectively edited. But I guess none of that matters now that the press has made selectively edited tapes great again.

It’s just so weird that certain newsrooms developed a standard for verification that lasted exactly as long as it took for the Planned Parenthood fetal tissue scandal to blow over. Quite a mystery.

Chief Justice John Roberts right to push back against Trump, defend judiciary

Texto completo: In November, a federal judge in San Francisco struck down President Trump’s attempt to limit asylum-seekers to legal points of entry. Trump complained about the action of “an Obama Judge.”
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts criticized Trump, saying America does not have “Obama judges or Trump judges . . . What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”
In December, a federal judge in Texas struck down the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”). The judge had been appointed by President George W. Bush. Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Connecticut, said that “Republicans just blew up our health care system.” Press comments have portrayed the judge’s ruling as political and characterized the Fifth Circuit (comprised of Southern states), which will hear any appeal, that way as well.
Will Chief Justice Roberts be even-handed now and criticize those calling the federal court decision in Texas the act of Republicans? Perhaps he regrets having entered this forum in the first place. Roberts has challenged Trump in a sport at which Trump excels. When federal District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii ruled against the Trump travel ban (called the “Muslim ban” by its detractors), Trump was fulsome in criticizing the judge as political because President Obama had appointed him. Trump called the San Diego judge hearing the case against Trump University biased because the Indiana-born Judge’s parents were from Mexico — making at least two offensive leaps that a judge who was the son of Mexican immigrants would be prejudiced against Trump due to Trump’s comments on Mexicans, and that the prejudice would be so great it would affect the judge’s impartiality in a matter totally unrelated to Mexico or immigration.
Federal judges are called to make decisions based on the law, not their own policy preferences. President Trump and Senator Murphy have done much harm in blurring that distinction.
This is not to say federal judges are identical. Litigants choose courts to file suits where they have the best chance of winning. Trump noted the “Obama Judge” was in San Francisco, within the liberal-leaning 9th Circuit that often rules against him. After the Obamacare ruling, the New York Times observed that “conservative lawyers are known to choose [the federal court in Texas] to file cases.” Neither practice is improper, so long as the court decision itself is based on nonpolitical grounds.
When Trump opponents win at the trial court level, they then try to get the court to apply its ruling to the entire country. That’s what the federal judge in San Francisco did, blocking Trump’s asylum policy nationwide. The federal judge in Texas has not yet given national application to his order striking down Obamacare. If he does, expect Democratic politicians who praised the San Francisco judge’s nationwide order to be outraged by the Texas judge doing the same thing, and expect Trump to praise the judge’s wisdom.
The judiciary interprets laws; it has no power to make laws. Judges are fairly criticized when their legal interpretation seems to create new law that Congress or state legislatures never intended. But Murphy and Trump labeling judges based on which president appointed them goes far beyond fair criticism. This kind of attack, if repeated often enough, will eventually impede the vital function courts perform in our constitutional scheme. A calumny often repeated sometimes sticks. When the law compels a politically unpopular outcome in a case, Americans should hope the judge ignores the political and does what’s right. That’s especially important to those who care deeply about civil liberties. I doubt the Bill of Rights’ protections for criminals would be approved in a popular referendum today. Segregated schools were the result of popular majority votes. America loses something precious if the third branch, fearful of being labeled political, begins to act in a political way.

When the law compels a politically unpopular outcome in a case, Americans should hope the judge ignores the political and does what’s right. That’s especially important to those who care deeply about civil liberties. I doubt the Bill of Rights’ protections for criminals would be approved in a popular referendum today. Segregated schools were the result of popular majority votes. America loses something precious if the third branch, fearful of being labeled political, begins to act in a political way.

Texto completo: I would think a partially closed federal government should cost us less, wouldn't you?
Well, think again. Even though it's counterintuitive, it often costs more, at least during the disruption. Yup. Here are some reasons why.
In The New York Times (Jan. 10, 2019), Jim Tankersley identified the biggest cost: when federal employees get paid for work they aren't allowed to do, even though it's eventually paid. He writes, "Paying someone to empty trash bins in parks is better than paying that same person to sit at home, while the trash piles up, and then paying more, later, to empty the trash.
He figures that when the government spends money on something, it's better to get something in return than nothing.
Oh, sorry. Maybe you heard federal employees weren't being paid. You're right, sort of. They're not being paid now, but they will be later.
President Donald Trump signed the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 last week. That act, "requires the compensation of government employees for wages lost, work performed, or leave used during a lapse in appropriations that begins on or after Dec. 22, 2018. In other words, federal government workers will be paid after the shutdown is over. Done deal.
Now this doesn't help them now, of course. But it doesn't reduce taxpayers' overall expenses either. Note that the Act does not cover all effected workers. Independent contractors and workers laid off from small businesses because of the shutdown probably will never recover their lost wages.
This payment for work not done was the highest cost identified during the Obama era shutdown in 2013 at about $2.5 billion ("Impacts and Costs of the October 2013 Federal Government Shutdown, page 4).
The Peter T. Peterson Foundation noted that a shutdown requires programs and government operations to be stopped, only to eventually be started up again, and that has disruption costs. The Congressional Research Service of the Office of Management and Budget estimated the 16-day shutdown in 2013 cost the government an additional $2 billion in such lost productivity.
A Macroeconomic Advisers paper also studying the 2013 shutdown found it can impose costs on the economy in increased unemployment, lower growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and higher borrowing costs.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated the government shutdown in October 2013 reduced fourth-quarter GDP that year by 0.3 percentage points. An S&P Global analysis found a government shutdown in 2017 could have reduced real fourth-quarter GDP growth by $6.5 billion per week.
Added to this, some government activities produce revenue. National parks, like Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California, are now closed to prevent damage from unsupervised visitors. However, any savings in operations are offset by the loss of a $30-per-vehicle visit fee. That means the loss of some 10,000 visiting vehicles per day or $15 million annualized in this one park.
The government is also required to pay interest on contracts, grants and other obligations during a shutdown. Already, the federal government has missed paying $5 million of its quarterly $16.5 million water bill to the District of Columbia in January.
Kevin Hassett, Trump's chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the administration now calculates the shutdown reduces quarterly economic growth by 0.13 percentage points for every week it lasts - the cumulative effect of lost work from contractors and furloughed employees who are not paid and who are not investing and spending.
That means the economy has already lost nearly half a percentage point from the four-week shutdown. Last year, economic growth in the first quarter was 2.2 percent.
Overall, closing government temporarily costs us more than operating it. So, why would anyone ever want to shut it down?
C'mon people. We're already spending more than we're taking in. All the shutdown is doing is adding to our debt.

Chief Justice John Roberts right to push back against Trump, defend judiciary

Texto completo: In November, a federal judge in San Francisco struck down President Trump’s attempt to limit asylum-seekers to legal points of entry. Trump complained about the action of “an Obama Judge.”
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts criticized Trump, saying America does not have “Obama judges or Trump judges . . . What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”
In December, a federal judge in Texas struck down the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”). The judge had been appointed by President George W. Bush. Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Connecticut, said that “Republicans just blew up our health care system.” Press comments have portrayed the judge’s ruling as political and characterized the Fifth Circuit (comprised of Southern states), which will hear any appeal, that way as well.
Will Chief Justice Roberts be even-handed now and criticize those calling the federal court decision in Texas the act of Republicans? Perhaps he regrets having entered this forum in the first place. Roberts has challenged Trump in a sport at which Trump excels. When federal District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii ruled against the Trump travel ban (called the “Muslim ban” by its detractors), Trump was fulsome in criticizing the judge as political because President Obama had appointed him. Trump called the San Diego judge hearing the case against Trump University biased because the Indiana-born Judge’s parents were from Mexico — making at least two offensive leaps that a judge who was the son of Mexican immigrants would be prejudiced against Trump due to Trump’s comments on Mexicans, and that the prejudice would be so great it would affect the judge’s impartiality in a matter totally unrelated to Mexico or immigration.
Federal judges are called to make decisions based on the law, not their own policy preferences. President Trump and Senator Murphy have done much harm in blurring that distinction.
This is not to say federal judges are identical. Litigants choose courts to file suits where they have the best chance of winning. Trump noted the “Obama Judge” was in San Francisco, within the liberal-leaning 9th Circuit that often rules against him. After the Obamacare ruling, the New York Times observed that “conservative lawyers are known to choose [the federal court in Texas] to file cases.” Neither practice is improper, so long as the court decision itself is based on nonpolitical grounds.
When Trump opponents win at the trial court level, they then try to get the court to apply its ruling to the entire country. That’s what the federal judge in San Francisco did, blocking Trump’s asylum policy nationwide. The federal judge in Texas has not yet given national application to his order striking down Obamacare. If he does, expect Democratic politicians who praised the San Francisco judge’s nationwide order to be outraged by the Texas judge doing the same thing, and expect Trump to praise the judge’s wisdom.
The judiciary interprets laws; it has no power to make laws. Judges are fairly criticized when their legal interpretation seems to create new law that Congress or state legislatures never intended. But Murphy and Trump labeling judges based on which president appointed them goes far beyond fair criticism. This kind of attack, if repeated often enough, will eventually impede the vital function courts perform in our constitutional scheme. A calumny often repeated sometimes sticks. When the law compels a politically unpopular outcome in a case, Americans should hope the judge ignores the political and does what’s right. That’s especially important to those who care deeply about civil liberties. I doubt the Bill of Rights’ protections for criminals would be approved in a popular referendum today. Segregated schools were the result of popular majority votes. America loses something precious if the third branch, fearful of being labeled political, begins to act in a political way.

Texto completo: To our readers:
We're excited! After many months of work, today we're debuting the fresh new design of our print edition. We hope it looks cleaner, more inviting, and offers readers a few more features.
Turn this page to find the biggest new thing: Page A3 is now called “In The Know,” a page dedicated to the most important regional, national and international news stories of the day. Readers tell us they are particularly interested in Washington state news, and this is a way to showcase it, rather than leave it on Page C2. To make room, you'll now find the New York Times Crossword and the People column on Page D2.
We're also changing the days some of our Life sections appear. The main reason for doing this is to publish local content earlier in the week to give readers at least one day's warning about local events that are coming up, rather than a few hours. The new lineup is today, Health; Tuesday, Home & Garden plus a page of Science; Wednesday, Food; Thursday, local Life and Music; Friday, local Life and Pets; Saturday, Community. Community is the new name for the Neighbors section, which readers told us was confusing. The content, which is traditional community news, will remain the same. Finally, Sunday Life will not change.
Some features in the Life section are switching pages. Comics will appear on Page D5, and the D5 puzzles and TV grid will be on Page D4. We did this so that our two crossword puzzles are still printed on different sheets of paper, in case both spouses like to work them at the same time.
Here's what isn't changing: Our commitment to bringing you the local news every day of the year. Our type fonts and sizes. Our page size. Our general organization of the newspaper (four news sections on weekdays and five on Sundays). We didn't want to fix what we didn't think was broken!
If you'd like to let us know what you think, please call us at 360-735-4448 or email us at news-comments@co

State's Indian tribes feel pain of shutdown

Texto completo: GREEN BAY – The children had just awakened from a nap and were still rubbing sleep from their eyes when they pulled up tiny chairs at two small U-shaped tables.
Bowing their heads to say grace in their Oneida native language, the Head Start students were about to snack on Kiwi slices and rice cakes washed down with cups of water.
The Oneida Nation spends $233,000 annually on its Head Start program, which oversees 152 children at two locations on the reservation. Almost three-fourths of Head Start funding for the Green Bay-area tribe is paid through federal funds — roughly $172,000.
But all federal funds flowing to the Oneida and other Wisconsin tribes, as well as Indian tribes across the country, have dried up since the federal government shutdown.
Wisconsin tribes are using their own funds to continue to provide education, health, law enforcement, food pantries and other services, but if the shutdown lasts much longer — and there's no sign of the impasse ending any time soon — some services could be curtailed or cut, hiring might be frozen, workers could be laid off and other drastic measures taken.
"We're fortunate we have the infrastructure and manpower here. A lot of tribes don't have that," Oneida Vice Chairman Brandon Yellowbird Stevens said. "We can supplant the loss of funds with emergency contingency funding."
But the tribe's emergency funding is not limitless. It's designed for emergencies, and no one knows how long the federal shutdown, already the longest, will last.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has furloughed 2,295 of its 4,057 employees, the New York Times reported.
When Oneida self-government coordinator Candice Skenandore tries to contact someone at the bureau, which she does daily for her job, she gets automatic email replies that the person she's trying to reach is on furlough for an indefinite time. It's the same for voicemail.
Skenandore is in the middle of negotiations for a new funding agreement for the tribe's health services and she's waiting for grant approvals and funding OKs for several programs. But everything is on hold and Skenandore knows it will take several weeks, if not months, for federal employees to get up to speed once the shutdown ends.
Skenandore is supposed to attend a tribal self-governance advisory board meeting in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 21, but she's not sure if the meeting will be held.
The shutdown "is stopping us from doing what we need to do to improve our health services," said Skenandore, whose position is federally funded. The tribe is paying her salary during the shutdown.
About 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives receive basic services from the Department of Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. Some tribes, like the Oneida, administer services funded by BIA money, while other tribes have their programs run by federal workers, many of whom are tribal members.
Services tied to decades-old treaties Because of treaties negotiated decades ago, the money funneled to tribes for health care, education, law enforcement and other services is in exchange for tribal nations giving up millions of acres of land in the 1800s. In effect, the tribes prepaid with land for funds now held up by the shutdown.
There's no guarantee tribes will ever see that money.
Stevens said the Oneida tribe never got the money it was owed and was not paid during the government shutdown of 2013.
"We ceded millions of acres of land and, in return, the United States said they would pay for health and education," Stevens said.
The Oneida tribe was based in New York at the time and gave up 3 million acres. It later moved to Wisconsin.
Stevens points out that the Oneida were among America's first allies, fighting alongside American troops and helping feed George Washington's army when it was hunkered down at Valley Forge during the brutal winter of 1777. The tribe continues to receive a symbolic annuity payment of $1,800 each year from the Treasury Department as part of a treaty signed at the end of the Revolutionary War.
The tribe operates a 48-bed nursing home and a health center that handles 350,000 patient visits annually, offering family practice, internal medicine, behavioral health, dental, optical and public health services among other things. Its pharmacy dispenses between 1,000 and 1,200 prescriptions daily, said Debbie Danforth, comprehensive health director for operations.
Last week Danforth was on a conference call with other tribal health directors and learned that while some tribes are able to continue to provide services during the shutdown like the Oneida, some might have to close their clinics in a few weeks.
'It's truly scary' "It's truly scary for some tribes," Danforth said.
Of the Oneida Nation's roughly $490 million 2019 fiscal year budget, about $50 million comes from federal grants and self-governance funds. There are 17,165 enrolled members in the Oneida tribe with more than 4,400 living on the reservation, including 1,000 who are 55 or older.
"Our message to Congress: these should not be discretionary, we shouldn't be the first to be cut," Stevens said.
Wisconsin's other tribes are facing the same difficulties as the Oneida.
The Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is the largest employer in Shawano County with about 900 employees. The tribe does not have its own school system but provides tutors and a public safety officer for school districts where tribal members attend, in Gresham and Bowler. It handles snowplowing and repairing roads for many smaller communities in Shawano County.
About 1,475 people are enrolled in the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe with 500 living on the reservation.
"But many of those are aging so their health care needs are great," Stockbridge-Munsee President Shannon Holsey said.
"A majority of our citizens are no longer in the workforce. They're living on fixed incomes and they look to the tribal nations for needs such as transportation to medical appointments and healthy food distribution through Meals on Wheels," Holsey said.
The biggest priority for the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe is its rural health clinic in Bowler, which offers general medicine, dental, behavioral health, chiropractic and community health services as well as a pharmacy. Since there are no buses or public transportation, the tribe shuttles members who cannot get to a doctor on their own and sends a registered nurse to help people who forget to take their medicine.
The tribe is paying for services normally provided by federal funds out of its reserves but Holsey said there's a limit to that, especially for a small tribe like the Stockbridge-Munsee.
Lac du Flambeau tightens spending Two weeks into the shutdown, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa decided to freeze all capital expenditures until further notice and told employees to be frugal in spending.
Not all federal grants have been affected by the shutdown but some have and tribal administrators are meeting regularly with the tribe's accounting staff.
"We want to avoid disruption in services wherever possible and we are working carefully to determine the impact to our general fund and to avoid layoffs," Lac du Flambeau President Joseph Wildcat Sr. said in a statement.
The Menominee Indian Tribe is also using reserve funds to keep essential programs open, Chairman Douglas Cox said.
Like all tribes, the Menominee use a mix of funding to pay for services ranging from a police force and tribal court system to a large health clinic and K-8 school. Menominee Indian High School is a state school district and is not affected by the shutdown.
There are 9,300 enrolled Menominee members with about 4,000 living on or near the reservation.
Cox estimates about 60 percent of the tribe's $19 million annual operating budget is funded through federal grants. Cox and other leaders are reviewing the tribe's finances daily during the shutdown to ensure services continue to be provided.
Cox is worried money due to the tribes from this federal government shutdown will never be paid because Congress would have to approve paying those funds separately, just like it is expected to do for federal workers who are not getting paychecks.
"We certainly hope this (shutdown) doesn't continue and they come to some resolution so they're no longer holding back our dollars for something so frivolous," Cox said in a phone interview.

Texto completo: David Brooks, the venerable columnist of the New York Times, posits that "capitalism is a wonderful system" but suggests that it's lost its way because "moral norms" have gone astray "and it needs to serve a larger social good."
It sure does.
"Remoralizing and resocializing the market is the great project of the moment," he wrote in the Jan. 10 edition of the Times. "The crucial question is not: How can we have a good economy? It's: How can we have a good society? How can we have a society in which it's easier to be a good person?"
Agreeing with Brooks, who is big on morals and ethics, is a given, with a major caveat: a dollop of government regulation to keep everyone honest, to curb the appetites of capitalists who would abuse the system. It should be shouted out loud, not merely alluded to.
If you want people to be good, they need rules to guide them when interacting with others or society at large, like proper manners. Ever been in class just before a teacher arrives? Pandemonium, right?
Wall Street is a good example of a need for control. Freedom needs to be monitored, the way lights control traffic. Imagine the chaos if everyone entered the intersection of St. Francis Drive and Cerrillos Road all at once.
Brooks doesn't say outright how to remoralize and resocialize the markets, how to regulate it, settling instead for expecting the reader to read between the lines. But it's people who run the markets, the economy. Does he expect people to police themselves? Who's supposed to be in charge? The government, no?
He doesn't directly mention regulation, but he wrote that the loosening of rules in the 1970s by President Jimmy Carter reducing taxes and Sen. Ted Kennedy by deregulating the airlines and the trucking industry created a situation in which "anything you could legally do to make money was deemed OK. A billion-dollar salary for a hedge fund manager? Perfectly acceptable."
What happens when there are no controls? Capitalism ran amok in 2007-08, first with subprime mortgages so that people earning merely hundreds of dollars a week had mortgages of $500,000 or more. How could they be expected to pay back a loan that size?
What can happen when "social trust," as Brooks put it, is violated and leaders lie in order to get their way in implementing policy? War. (See Iraq, March 2003.) President Donald Trump lies. Does that make America great?
Different example? Give corporations a huge tax cut in naive hopes they will use the money to hire more people, expand their businesses, develop new products. Doesn't happen. The corporations use the extra money to buy back their own stocks in order to satisfy their investors. How does that help society as a whole?
Another one: Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933 in a bid to control the banks following the 1929 stock market crash. It was repealed in 1999. No control. Repeal led to banks investing peoples' deposits in unregulated instruments called derivatives, causing the 2008 financial crisis. How's that for benefiting society? For ensuring good?
"Today the amoralism of the trading floor governs corporate decision-making," Brooks wrote.
People and their society need to be regulated, wisely and gently, in order to create a more perfect union.

Texto completo: Our topic for today: three stories and a letter.
The stories all made recent headlines. The first was about the state of Florida posthumously pardoning the Groveland Four, a group of African-American men who suffered torture, prison and murder after being falsely accused of raping a white woman in 1949.
The second concerns broad Republican condemnation of one of their own, Rep. Steve King, for an interview with The New York Times in which he questioned why the terms "white nationalist" and "white supremacist" should be considered offensive.
The third involves a directive -- since rescinded -- NBC News sent its writers, reporters and anchors about King's words. "Be careful to avoid characterizing King's remarks as racist," it said, suggesting that the remarks instead be described as 'what many are calling racist'."
As for the letter: It was written by Martin Luther King Jr., whose 90th birthday the nation commemorates Monday. King famously penned the epistle from a jail cell in Birmingham in response to a group of white clergymen, eight moderate, principled men, who had condemned as "unwise and untimely" his demonstrations against segregation in their city.
One passage of King's response seems especially apropos to this moment. In it, he confessed that he had become "gravely disappointed with the white moderate." Too often, he said, they were "more devoted to 'order' than to justice;" and preferred "a negative peace, which is the absence of tension to a positive peace, which is the presence of justice."
Added King: "Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will."
Make no mistake: King well knew that all over the South, liberal white kids were risking their lives for black freedom. He was calling out other white people, often older, more moderate white people like those eight men, for the tepidness and flaccidity of their commitment to racial reconciliation. This was 1963, but as the stories above suggest, that problem endures.
It is possible, for instance, to celebrate that Florida has finally done right by the Groveland Four -- and yet, to also be disgusted that it takes 70 years for the state to belatedly admit its crimes and deliver some small measure of delayed "justice."
It is possible to consider the GOP's condemnation of Steve King all well and fine, yet also a little arbitrary and affected given that King has a history of racist rhetoric that passed without his party seeming to much notice or care -- and that the GOP itself has a long record of thinly-veiled racism as obvious as the writing on Barack Obama's birth certificate.
It is possible to concede that NBC has an interest in ensuring its people remain disinterested observers of events they report, yet feel that in asking them to refrain from calling obvious racism obvious racism, the network doesn't embody journalistic rigor so much as it does white peoples' too frequent refusal to call out such racism even when it's right in front of them.
We may safely assume most NBC executives, Republican lawmakers and Florida officials would say -- and probably believe -- all the right things if you asked about their commitment to racial justice. Yet given a chance to put force behind that commitment, they failed. In Florida's case, they failed for seven decades.
"The ultimate tragedy," King once said, "is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people." He was right.
If you are good, yet silent, maybe you're not really as good as you think.

A Perilous Beauty: City Snowstorms Over the Years

Texto completo: Waiting for the first real snow of winter is an annual exercise in anticipation and dread, with the accompanying hallmarks invariably falling into place: breathless headlines, familiar checkout line chatter, readying the shovels and snowblowers, restocking the cocoa, bracing for traffic tie-ups and rail delays -- or perhaps doing nothing at all.
If that all feels eternal, consider what it was like to endure a snowstorm in a time before Gore-Tex and Doppler radar, snow blowers and plow trucks, subway commutes and automobile windshields -- actually, before automobiles. Instant hot chocolate didn't become a supermarket staple until the 1940s, and it took Swiss Miss until 1972 to roll out a revolutionary cocoa mix with mini marshmallows already inside. ("What'll Swiss Miss think of next," the first ads asked.)
Early New York Times photographs of snowstorms really capture the havoc, misery and peril a blizzard could visit on the city in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The Blizzard of 1888, for example, dumped 21 inches of snow on the city and killed an estimated 200 New Yorkers. But even a garden-variety snowstorm in those days would menace New York's main form of transit -- horses -- and impose human suffering of all kinds, while posing the immense logistical challenge of clearing an entire metropolis of snow.
Still, then as now, snow slowed the city down in a stop-and-look-around way. It brought a serene kind of beauty and wonder, turning almost anyone into Peter, the wide-eyed child hero of Ezra Jack Keats's 1962 ode to winter reverie, "The Snowy Day."
"King Winter's Carnival," one Times headline declared in February 1900, after a Saturday storm gave way to wintry recreation and a sun-dappled landscape of snow and ice on Sunday. "The City Filled with the Music of Laughter and Sleighbells."
Of course, just as it does today, it would all turn to graying slush soon enough.

Capitalizing on a Return

Texto completo: When Fox pulled the plug on "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" in May, many fans and critics were shocked. But Stephanie Beatriz, who plays the no-nonsense detective Rosa Diaz, was more cleareyed.
"I didn't think we were done with the world of 'Brooklyn,' but I'm also realistic," she said recently. "I thought to myself maybe if Netflix or Hulu picks it up and lets us finish out the ride for a few more episodes, then maybe that seems like the best-case scenario."
Instead, NBC greenlit a 13-episode season and later extended it by five episodes -- Season 6 of "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" began Jan. 10. The renewal gives fans a chance to uncover more about Rosa, a leather jacket-clad crime fighter who was only starting to open up, on a personal level, by the end of the show's run on Fox. While Rosa had previously shared vague bits of history -- like the time she got kicked out of a dance academy for "beating up the ballerinas" -- her biggest reveal of all happened last season, when she came out as bisexual.
"Over the last six seasons, Rosa has gone from being an enigma whom people knew nothing about, to an enigma whom people now know an incredibly tiny amount about," the showrunner Dan Goor said.
Rosa is best known to fans for her anger management issues, deadpan disposition and secrecy.
"In comedy you have the 'straight man,' who's basically the deadpan, flat comedy partner," Beatriz said. "And in 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine,' the bi woman is a straight man, which is hilarious."
In reality, the generally bubbly Beatriz, 37, is the emotional antithesis of her character. Even so, she sees shades of her own personality in Rosa's fierceness and candor, and the inspiration for the character's bisexual identity was informed by the actress's own life.
Beatriz disclosed that she identified as queer in a 2016 tweet, responding to an interview featuring the bisexual actress Aubrey Plaza. If the revelation on the show got attention and made Rosa's identification official, it was not especially noteworthy to the woman who portrays her.
"Secretly in my mind, I think, I was playing her as someone who was attracted to all genders," Beatriz said.
Born in Neuquén, Argentina, Beatriz emigrated with her parents when she was 2 years old to Webster, Tex., just outside Houston. Her interest in acting began with that perennial refuge for young outsiders: high school theater.
"That's where the weird kids were; that's where the gay kids felt comfortable. A lot of people of color gravitated toward that group," Beatriz said. "I just felt like the best version of myself when I was with that group of kids."
After high school, Beatriz graduated with a theater degree from Stephens College in Missouri, then moved to New York.
"I knew there was space for me in theater, but I didn't know if there was space for me in TV and film," she said. Eventually, she found her place: Following bit parts in a few TV series and a notable supporting turn in the film "Short Term 12," Beatriz got her big break in "Brooklyn Nine-Nine," which debuted in 2013.
In portraying a "tough good guy," Beatriz found inspiration in spaghetti Westerns, a genre which sometimes featured a character in an all-black get-up. She describes it as a "robot-cowboy" look: "I think I was taking elements of that archetype when I started thinking about her as a character. I remember going into the first costume fitting and saying, 'I think it's a lot of black."'
Aside from her inscrutable nature, Rosa is known for her sardonic tone and dedication to being a solid detective.
But as the writers began working on Season 5, Goor asked Beatriz if she would be comfortable with Rosa coming out as bisexual, to parallel Beatriz's own revelation.
"I was thrilled by it," Beatriz said. She was open with the staff about her own experiences, as well as the experiences of other queer Latinos in her life, "because I wanted the story to feel real."
True to form for the brusque Rosa, the disclosure came in two sentences: "I'm dating a woman. I'm bi."
The actress was more forthcoming, sharing with the writers specific sentiments she had heard in her own life.
"'Well, you're not gay; you could still marry a man,"' she recounted. "Which is like, 'I'm holding out hope that you're straight, honey."'
Beatriz was reminded again of the perceptions particular to bisexuality in October, when she did marry a man: her husband Brad Boehlefeld.
[Here is The New York Times's list of the best movies on Netflix right now.]
"People that maybe don't understand bisexuality completely and haven't had a lot of experience with it, might have questioned [my marriage]," she said. "I'm in a partnership that's monogamous for the rest of my life that's exciting to me, but [that] may be disappointing to some fans."
A proudly silly cop sitcom might seem like an unlikely catalyst for change, Beatriz said. But in Rosa's progression, she sees the chance to move the emotional needle for a certain segment of the fan base.
"I've been watching this character on my favorite show for five seasons -- now do I hate her because she's bi?" she said, rhetorically. "I think the best learning, growing and conversations with people can come out of art, and particularly fun art that makes you laugh."
After the brief brush with cancellation, Beatriz now gets to continue Rosa's story line on "Brooklyn Nine-Nine." There are hints of an evolved Rosa in the new season; in the premiere, the character's soft side peeks through when she expresses concern over Captain Holt (Andre Braugher) losing out on the position of police commissioner. (Her gruff nature quickly returns, however, when she finds herself on the verge of losing an important case.) While Beatriz is coy about the details, she promises more evident growth for the formerly buttoned-up Rosa, who will continue to slowly let her co-workers into her life.
"I also can say the exploration of Rosa's romantic life and her inner-workings will continue," she said. Whatever the dubious response to her own relationships, Beatriz stated that she will keep using her platform to be a vocal LGBTQ advocate.
In Season 6, Beatriz also realized a professional goal: She directed an episode of "Brooklyn Nine-Nine," which will air March 14. She admitted that along the way she had to overcome "me da pena," a Spanish expression that describes the sensation of both embarrassment and the shame surrounding it.
"I think a lot of women identify with that feeling," Beatriz said. "We're all sort of culturally talking about this moment now where women have felt like, 'Why haven't I asked? Why not me?"' But she took the arrival of the once improbable sixth season of "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" as a sign that she needed to ask for what she wanted, and Goor gave her the go-ahead.
The self-doubt Beatriz once felt has inverted into a kind of fierce determination that Rosa Diaz would be proud of, she said, and she's trying to remain open to whatever opportunities come her way.
"I just really like telling stories," she said. "And it turns out I'm pretty good at it."

Texto completo: Taos Pueblo photographer Debbie Lujan caused a social media sensation today (Jan. 18) when she posted a picture of herself on Facebook – posing with Beto O'Rourke at Taos Pueblo.
O'Rourke was the 2018 Democratic senate candidate for Texas who was defeated by Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. According to The New York Times election results, Cruz received 50.9% of the vote and O'Rourke received 48.3%.
"Tina Martinez of Taos Day School was giving him a tour of the Pueblo. There were hardly any tourists around," said Lujan. "He was very gracious and very easy to talk to."
Lujan has a gallery, Summer Rain Arts, on the north side of the Pueblo. She admits that she normally doesn't take "just anybody" to the top of her village house (the second story). "He was very interested in the American experience, talking to people from different backgrounds," she said.
O'Rourke was interested in learning about Taos Pueblo and had not known about the return of their sacred Blue Lake in 1970 by President Nixon.
Lujan, a well-known local photographer, is also a classically trained violinist and plays with the Roswell Symphony so she knows a lot of people in El Paso, which they conversed about. "I think he's always looking for that personal connection," Lujan said.
O'Rourke is on a road trip that is being followed by national media outlets – given the speculation that the fourth-generation Texan may add his name to the list of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.
By her account, he was very humble and he downplayed her comment, "You're a celebrity."
O'Rourke mentioned he had already traveled in Kansas, the Panhandle, around New Mexico, and was in Pueblo, Colorado last night.
The El Paso Times reports O'Rourke is scheduled to sit down for an interview with Oprah Winfrey on February. 5.

Texto completo: Dear Readers: Back in the day the first thing I’d read when I opened my Daily Herald was Jim O’Donnell’s media column. I found him to be bright and articulate with a vocabulary shared by few. I knew someday I’d enjoy working with him if given the chance.
O’Donnell, with his decades of connections, knows the Chicago sports scene, so what better than to have him complement our lineup of knowledgeable, familiar experts: Dietz, Gregor, McGraw, Miles and Rozner.
O’Donnell returns today to the Friday Sports pages of The Daily Herald with a sports media column. I’m confident you’ll enjoy his eye for detail, insight, great reporting and occasional feather-ruffling.
In addition to previous work here, the award-winning O’Donnell has written for Frank Deford’s National Sports Daily, the Sun-Times, the Tribune and The New York Times. He also worked on two best-selling books authorized by Michael Jordan, and while a freelance radio writer he worked with Steve Dahl and Garry Meier.
He’s back with us. Once you read his column, you’ll want to keep reading him.
Mike Smith, Sports Editor

Texto completo: (JNS) The media watchdog CAMERA took aim at The New York Times this week after the newspaper falsified Pew research in a news analysis alleging a "great schism" between American and Israeli Jewish populations.
Written by the paper's deputy Washington editor Jonathan Weisman, the Times article claims that Israeli and American Jews "see the world in starkly different ways," and suggests that "neither side sees the other as caring for its basic well-being."
"It's a sweeping hypothesis," says Gilead Ini, a veteran media analyst at CAMERA. "And yet his analysis doesn't offer a single statistic to directly substantiate his claim."

No, the government shutdown isn’t a ‘crisis’

Texto completo: This government shutdown is now longer than any in history. The media keep using the word “crisis.”
“Shutdown sows chaos, confusion and anxiety!” says The Washington Post. “Pain spreads widely.”
The New York Times headlined, it’s all “just too much!”
But wait. Looking around America, I see people going about their business — families eating in restaurants, employees going to work, children playing in playgrounds, etc. I have to ask: Where’s the crisis?
Pundits talk as if government is the most important part of America, but it isn’t.
We need some government, limited government. But most of life, the best of life, goes on without government, many of the best parts in spite of government.
Of course, the shutdown is a big deal to the 800,000 people who aren’t being paid. But they will get paid. Government workers always do — after shutdowns.
Columnist Paul Krugman calls this shutdown, “Trump’s big libertarian experiment.” But it’s not libertarian. Government’s excessive rules are still in effect, and eventually government workers will be paid for not working. That makes this a most un-libertarian experiment.
But there are lessons to be learned.
During a shutdown when Barack Obama was president, government officials were so eager to make a point by inconveniencing people that they even stopped visitors from entering public parks.
Trump’s administration isn’t doing that, so PBS found a new crisis: “Trash cans spilling… (P)ark services can’t clean up the mess until Congress and the president reach a spending deal,” reported “NewsHour.”
But volunteers appeared to pick up some of the trash.
Given a chance, private citizens often step in to do things government says only government can do.
The Washington Post ran a front-page headline about farmers “reeling… because they aren’t receiving government support checks.”
But why do farmers even get “support checks”?
One justification is “saving family farms.” But the money goes to big farms.
Government doesn’t need to “guarantee the food supply,” another justification for subsidies. Most fruit and vegetable farmers get no subsidies, yet there are no shortages of peaches, plums, green beans, etc.
Subsidies are a scam created by politicians who get money from wheat, cotton, corn and soybean agribusinesses. Those farmers should suck it up and live without subsidies, too.
During shutdowns, government tells “nonessential workers” not to come to work. But if they’re nonessential, then why do we pay 400,000 of them?
Why do we still pay 100,000 American soldiers in Germany, Japan, Italy and England? Didn’t we win those wars?
We could take a chainsaw to so much of government.
The New York Times shrieks, “Shutdown Curtails FDA Food Inspections!”
Only if you read on do you learn that meat and poultry inspection is done by the Department of Agriculture. They’re still working. And the FDA is restarting some inspections as well.
More important, meat is usually safe not because of government — but because of competition.
Food sellers worry about their reputations. They know they’ll get bad publicity if they poison people (think Chipotle), so they take many more safety measures than government requires.
One meat producer told me that they employ 2,000 more safety inspectors than the law demands.
Lazy reporters cover politicians. Interviewees are usually in one place — often Washington, D.C. Interviewing politicians is easier than covering people pursuing their own interests all over America. But those are the people who make America work.
While pundits and politicians act as if everything needs government intervention, the opposite is true.
Even security work is done better by the private sector. At San Francisco’s airport, security lines move faster. Passengers told me, “The screeners are nicer!” The TSA even acknowledged that those screeners are better at finding contraband. That’s because San Francisco (Kansas City, Seattle and a dozen smaller airports) privatized the screening process. Private companies are responsible for security.
Private contractors are better because they must compete. Perform badly, and they get fired.
But government never fires itself.
Government workers shout, “We are essential!” But I say: “Give me a break. Most of you are not.”

Gillette commercial controversy: Give men credit instead of painting masculinity as poison

Texto completo: When I viewed Gillette’s “toxic masculinity” TV ad — the one that portrays a line of men shrugging, “Boys will be boys,” while their fellows bully the weak, help themselves to unwanted sexual contact, and shut up their female colleagues at work — my first, admittedly tongue-in-cheek thought was: how clever.
Let’s see, I reasoned: Gillette’s specialty is shaving equipment, and ever increasing numbers of men, especially beard-crazy millennials, aren’t shaving these days. Gillette is simply repositioning itself from a marketer to men into a marketer to women. And what sells better to women than male-bashing? From “doofus Dad” commercials hawking laundry detergent, to a #MeToo movement that mushroomed overnight from allegations of sexual exploitation in the entertainment industry to complaints about bad dates with guys with crude foreplay skills, women make a ready audience for material that tells them that there’s something fundamentally wrong — maybe it’s patriarchal cultural conditioning — with the other half of the human race.
Read more commentary:
Gillette commercial controversy: Men should just get over it and adapt to #MeToo era
If you're mad at Gillette's toxic masculinity commercial, maybe you're the problem
Why did it take Susan Zirinsky 46 years to become president of CBS News?
New York Times best-selling author Jessica Valenti writes: “It’s true that women are fed up with sexual violence and harassment; but it’s also true that what this culture considers ‘normal’ sexual behavior is often harmful to women, and that we want that to stop, too. ” In other words, normal maleness is bad and needs to be changed — and that’s why Jessica Valenti is a New York Times best-selling author.
Gillette's male-bashing ploy as marketing
There is some irony here. A leading study involving 8,520 women published in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology in 2016 suggests that men are growing facial hair, and eschewing shaving, because women like it that way. The study concludes that women prefer men with beards because they view beards — from stubble to the full-blown thing — "as a signal of intrasexual formidability," that is, of being tough and aggressive and masculine, which women view as valuable traits for protecting themselves and their children.
In short, women may say masculinity is toxic, but they go for toxic every time. You might conclude that Gillette, by invoking every cliché in the male-bashing handbook, lets women have their masculinity cake and eat it, too — and also pick up one of Gillette’s Venus line of razors for females while they’re at it.
That was my tongue-in-cheek take on the ad. Now for my serious take. Many people might ask: What’s wrong with telling men not to bully each other or harass women? After all, males commit the overwhelming majority of violent crimes — a byproduct of the physical aggressiveness that goes with testosterone.
Men deserve more credit than Gillette gives
The problem with the Gillette ad isn’t that it points out that males commit antisocial acts. It’s its blithe assumption that other males routinely let them get away with it. This is what has infuriated hundreds of thousands of men to the point of threatening to boycott Gillette.
They rightfully point out that supposedly patriarchal Western culture (which, by the way, treats women more respectfully than any other culture humans have ever invented) doesn’t “normalize” male acts that harm others, but, rather, quite the opposite. Men might say “boys will be boys” when their son breaks a lamp playing fetch with the dog in the living room. They don’t say it when their son joins a gang that beats up other boys in the schoolyard. This is not to say such activity, along with its adult equivalents, isn’t uncommon, or that there isn’t often peer pressure for men, especially young men, to misbehave. But men have devised institutions — called civilization — designed to channel male aggression in positive directions, such as heroism that saves lives or hard work that supports families. They deserve credit for that.
One of those institutions is fatherhood. It’s fathers who are chiefly responsible for turning young male barbarians into gentlemen instead of rapists, boors and bullies. Right now, one out of every four boys in America grows up in a home without a father and pays a price in the well-documented social disorder that has ensued. If Gillette wants to get into the preaching business, it might want to focus on that problem instead of tarring men in general as violence-enablers in need of re-education and their very masculinity as a kind of poison.

Veterans like me face war in Iraq, too little mental health help at home

Texto completo: Sometimes, trauma can be more deadly than war itself. But the VA's existing mental health services are woefully inadequate for a growing problem.
I'm supposed to be a statistic.
On July 14, 2012, drowning in grief and guilt, I tried to kill myself. Like so many veterans, I had found civilian life desperately difficult. War had drained me of joy. The sights, sounds and smells of the battlefield had been relentlessly looping in my head. The suffering seemed endless. And so, thinking there were no other options of escape, I turned to suicide.
Luckily, I survived. I avoided becoming one of the 20 veterans who kill themselves every day in this country. But I also witnessed firsthand all the ways that our nation's mental health resources fail our fighting men and women.
I enlisted in the military on Sept. 11, 2001. My first major combat experience came on a deployment to Sadr City, Iraq, in the winter of 2005, the apex of the insurgency.
War inflicts permanent psychic scars on survivors. Scrubbing a friend's flesh out of a Bradley reconnaissance vehicle, packing up the cold clothes of a new dad to ship home to his family, pulling tortured corpses out of a water treatment facility — the trauma from these experiences is deep and lasting.
Veterans lost to trauma, rather than combat That trauma can be more deadly than war itself. More of my brothers from that deployment have died from suicide than combat: Nine were killed in Iraq; 15 have killed themselves back at home.
Our company commander, a decorated vet boasting four Meritorious Service Medals, shot himself on Jan. 16, 2016. He was just 44 years old.
My grandfather, a World War II veteran, committed suicide when my father was sent to Vietnam.
And just last month, decorated Navy Vice Adm. Scott Stearney's body was found in his Bahrain residence after an apparent suicide. During his life, Vice Adm. Stearney was awarded the Air Medal, the Legion of Merit and the Defense Superior Service Medal.
Vets shouldn't be dying in a VA parking lot Existing mental health services for vets are clearly insufficient. From 2001 to 2014, vet suicides have jumped 32 percent. The problem is only going to get worse.
Too many VA facilities simply don't have enough staff to provide personalized care. Therapists are badly outnumbered and vets are hurried through their offices.
Sometimes, staffing shortages force facilities to simply turn vets away, leading to the grotesque phenomenon of desperate soldiers killing themselves on VA grounds.
One 51-year-old Persian Gulf War veteran set himself on fire in front of a New Jersey VA clinic after a canceled appointment. Another veteran shot himself in the waiting room of a VA medical center. A 76-year-old vet shot himself in the parking lot of his Long Island VA facility because "he went to the ER and was denied service," as a hospital employee explained to The New York Times.
But improving treatment requires more than new resources. Our mental health system must also evolve its therapeutic paradigms to be more proactive, treating the root causes of mental illness. T
One of those key precursors is isolation. We go to war with our brothers — but we're left to fight demons at home by ourselves. The VA mental health system needs to create more opportunities for vets to meet each other, share their stories, break that isolation, and process their pain. T
That's why my organization, the Independence Fund, is teaming up with the VA to carry out Operation Resiliency. The just launched partnership provides mental health training retreats for vets and their families, and encourages camaraderie among vets through adaptive sports.
Our military should have a role in prevention as well. Americans are expertly trained to go into battle but receive virtually zero training on what comes next. Each branch of the military should work with vets and their families to develop a personalized mental health plan for when they get home.
Veteran suicide is a national scandal. We must repair and expand the mental health system for our fighting men and women. We must win the war at home.
Danny O'Neel, an Iraq War veteran, is a speaker on suicide prevention, PTSD and mental health for the Independence Fund.
Sometimes, trauma can be more deadly than war itself. But the VA's existing mental health services are woefully inadequate for a growing problem.

Ex-congresswoman returns to politics

Texto completo: Reinvigorated and seemingly fiery as ever, former Congresswoman Jean Schmidt is ending her six-year stint on the political sideline.
The suburban Cincinnati Republican has filed to run for the Ohio House in 2020, hoping to return to Columbus for a second go-around in her political career.
Schmidt, 67, started getting the itch to return to politics about 11/2 years ago, when the woman once called a "tough street fighter" by the New York Times started advocating for women and men who say they've been wrongfully convicted of a crime.
"I had to get my family to buy into it," Schmidt told Politics Extra on Tuesday, referring to her return to politics. "Last summer, I received a call from a prominent Columbus Republican asking me to come back. That's when my husband, Peter, said, 'Why don't you do it?' I'm excited about it."
Schmidt was in Columbus from 2001 until 2004, representing House District 65, which spans northwestern Clermont County. Union Township Republican John Becker currently holds the seat, and he will be term-limited at the end of next year.
Schmidt has long-standing relationships with new Gov. Mike DeWine and state House Speaker Larry Householder. Their support would be critical, especially if Schmidt ends up having a primary opponent.
Many figured Schmidt's political career was over after she served three full terms in Washington. Amid the cloud of an ethical issue stemming from her relationship with a Turkish-American interest group, Schmidt was unceremoniously ousted in the 2012 GOP primary by tea party-backed political newbie Brad Wenstrup.
"No regrets," Schmidt said. "Moving forward."
It took more than a year for Schmidt's family to warm up to the idea of her making a comeback, she said.
Some things that happened in Schmidt's final term had taken a toll on the family, including the intense backlash and media scrutiny Schmidt had faced amid the monthslong ethics investigation in 2011. The House Ethics Committee determined she had improperly accepted around $500,000 worth of free legal services from the Turkish group.
Then in early 2012, Schmidt's conservatism and loyalty to the GOP were called into question by some members of her own party after she gave then-President Barack Obama a seemingly innocuous kiss on the cheek during his State of the Union address.
There were other controversies during Schmidt's time in Washington, including soon after she arrived in 2005. She caused a firestorm after saying on the floor that "cowards cut and run, Marines never do" in response to Pennsylvania Democrat John Murtha's push back on the GOP's efforts to withdrawal troops from Iraq. Murtha, who died in 2010, was a Marine veteran.
Schmidt now calls the divisive rhetoric that has poisoned today's politics "shameful" and "very sad."
"It breaks my heart for the country," Schmidt said.
Both sides are at fault, she added, believing social media has contributed to the incivility. She is not on Facebook or Twitter, but acknowledged she'll likely have to have a social media presence in the upcoming campaign.
Schmidt has been busy since leaving politics. She remains an avid runner, having completed more than 140 marathons. She regularly teaches political science courses at Chatfield College's campuses in Over-the-Rhine and Brown County.
Schmidt spends a lot of time with her two elementary-aged grandsons. She was taking one of them to basketball practice when I called her Tuesday afternoon.
For nearly a decade, Schmidt has volunteered with City Gospel Mission's Flying Pig Marathon training program. She works with women in the mission's long-term recovery program for drug and alcohol addiction.
Schmidt took an interest to helping women and men in the prison system after a friend recommended she read former Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro's book, "False Justice: Eight Myths That Convict the Innocent."
She's gotten to know Cincinnati attorney David Singleton of the Ohio Justice and Policy Center. Singleton and Indian Hill resident Michele Young have helped the former Miami Township trustee connect with Tyra Patterson, who was recently featured in The Enquirer for her successful re-entry after serving a long prison sentence.
Patterson maintained that she was wrongfully convicted for the 1994 shooting death of a 15-year-old girl in Dayton, Ohio. She received a sentence of 43 years to life in prison, but was released in December 2017.
Schmidt has helped mentor Patterson. They trained together for the Flying Pig 5K last spring.
"I went to the parole board hearing in Dayton, and I said, 'Oh, my God, this woman is innocent,'"Schmidt said.
"This is what made me start to think about getting back into politics," Schmidt added. "Something has to be done."
Some call her "Mean Jean." These days, though, she seems more like "Meaningful Jean."

Texto completo: The Hebrew Free Loan Association has created a fund to assist federal workers in the Pittsburgh region who are affected by the government shutdown.
The association will make interest-free loans of up to $2,500 available to furloughed federal employees effective immediately.
The loans do not have to be repaid until the workers are reinstated and receiving paychecks.
"We try to respond to financial needs in the community as they arise," said Aviva Lubowsky, director of marketing and development for the association based in Greenfield.
The association last week was contacted by an employee of the U.S. Coast Guard and one from the U.S. Attorney's office in Pittsburgh seeking assistance.
"We became aware the employees were going to miss their first paychecks so we put together a proposal" to help them, she said.
To qualify, the government workers must live in Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Washington or Westmoreland counties.
All federal workers not being paid including those qualified as essential, nonessential or contractors are eligible.
Although contractors are not guaranteed to receive back pay when the shutdown ends, the association included them in the program because of the need among federal workers to cover day-to-day expenses, said Ms. Lubowsky.
She declined to disclose the total amount set aside for the loans.
To keep up with expected demand for the loans, the nonprofit association is seeking donations from the public.
The association, founded in 1887 by a congregation of Jewish immigrants in the Hill District, typically makes about 100 loans a year that average $6,000 to $8,000.

ODDS OF DYING FROM ACCIDENTAL OPIOID OVERDOSE IN U.S. SURPASS THOSE OF DYING IN CAR ACCIDENT

Texto completo: For the first time on record the odds of accidentally dying from an opioid overdose in the United States are now greater than those of dying in an automobile accident.
The grim finding comes from the National Safety Council, which analyzed preventable injury and fatality statistics from 2017.
The NSC also found the lifetime odds of death for this form of overdose were greater than the risk of death from falls, pedestrian incidents, drowning and fire.
Examining a variety of federal and state data, the NSC found the lifetime odds of dying from an accidental opioid overdose were 1 in 96. For motor vehicle accidents the odds were 1 in 103 and 1 in 114 for falls. The lifetime odds of suicide were greater, at 1 in 88.
"Too many people still believe the opioid crisis is abstract and will not impact them. Many still do not see it as a major threat to them or their family," Maureen Vogel, spokeswoman for the National Safety Council, told CNN in an email. "These data show the gravity of the crisis. We have known for some time that opioid overdose is an everyday killer, and these odds illustrate that in a very jarring way."
The NSC highlights, however, that the odds given are statistical averages over the whole U.S. population and do not necessarily reflect the chances of death for a particular person from a particular external cause. In addition they are lifetime odds, based on dividing the one-year odds by the life expectancy of a person born in 2017.
In 2017 preventable injury deaths were 169,936 - an increase of 5.3 percent from the year before and a 96 percent increase from figures in 1992.
"The data really underscore the importance of knowing the biggest risks to our safety," Ms. Vogel said. "The Council calculates the Odds of Dying not to scare Americans, but to empower them to make safer decisions and improve their chances of longevity."

Media Veterans Devise a New Strategy to Combat Online Fakery

Texto completo: On the internet, conspiracy theories, propaganda and plain old inaccuracies can stump even the most thoughtful readers, spreading faster than you can say "fake news."
A small start-up, NewsGuard, says it may have a solution. The effort is led by a pair of veteran news executives -- Steven Brill, an author and the founder of the magazine The American Lawyer, and Gordon Crovitz, a former publisher of The Wall Street Journal. On Wednesday the company announced that it had signed Microsoft as its first major client.
NewsGuard has created the equivalent of nutrition labels for news organizations, rating more than 2,000 news and information sites with tags: red for unreliable, green for trustworthy. A team of roughly 50 journalists and analysts is making the evaluations.
NewsGuard has given its stamp of approval to established publications like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, as well as later entrants like BuzzFeed and Newsmax. FoxNews.com, The Hill, The Daily Beast and HuffPost have also gotten green lights.
Sites to watch out for, according to NewsGuard, include Infowars and Breitbart on the right, and Daily Kos on the left. Media Matters, a left-leaning advocacy organization with a prolific media-watchdog blog, has received a green rating, but scores negatively on four of the nine criteria used by NewsGuard.
The start-up hopes to become a regular part of the reading experience on the web. Its premise is that it is more efficient to rate news organizations than the endless stream of articles rolled out each hour.
The service, free to readers, offers a browser extension that shows a news operation's rating when a reader lands on its site. The NewsGuard tag also appears in search results next to article links for those who have the extension.
"The point is to make this ubiquitous," Mr. Brill said in an interview.
To make money, the company has pitched major technology companies to license its software and incorporate its ratings into their services. The first major tech player to sign on is Microsoft, which has agreed to install the system onto its mobile browser, NewsGuard said.
The venture is not Mr. Brill's first go-round on the media beat. In 1998, he founded the monthly magazine Brill's Content, which chronicled how the journalism sausage got made until it closed in 2001.
He acknowledged that, for now, NewsGuard's analysis lacked the distribution to have a major effect, but a Gallup survey funded by the Knight Foundation suggested that independent ratings can change how people consume news. Readers who participated in the poll were less likely to share headlines that were flagged as potentially misleading. (The Knight Foundation is also an investor in NewsGuard.)
NewsGuard has raised about $6 million at a valuation of around $20 million. Its biggest corporate backer is Publicis, an advertising holding company.
Both founders said they were surprised, at first, by the advertising industry's interest in their project. "For them, it's the whole problem of fake news being an issue for 'brand safety,"' Mr. Brill said. "I hadn't even heard that term until we looked out for investors."
Last year, some advertisers fled YouTube after they noticed their messages were appearing alongside videos promoting terrorists. And while they haven't abandoned Facebook, marketers are requesting more data to make sure their brands aren't being associated with questionable content.
Facebook has become a flash point for the spread of false reports. To combat media pollution, the company has worked with fact checkers and has enlisted third-party groups, including The Associated Press, Snopes and PolitiFact, to make evaluations. Still, it can take up to three days for Facebook to verify content -- which has little or no effect, in most cases, since articles go viral in minutes.
Facebook and other social networks have not signed on with NewsGuard, but Mr. Brill and Mr. Crovitz anticipate that some kind of ratings service will eventually be adopted across the web. And despite their positioning as a nutrition label for news, they said no one should interpret their work as an endorsement for some kind of media equivalent to the Food and Drug Administration.
"We'd be very uncomfortable if the government were mandating anything with regard to news," Mr. Crovitz said. "That would violate free speech values. You have the First Amendment."

Turkey Seeks Warrant for Knicks' Kanter

Texto completo: Turkish prosecutors are seeking an international arrest warrant for Knicks center Enes Kanter, accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization.
The Sabah newspaper said the Istanbul chief prosecutor's office had also prepared an extradition request for Kanter, a Turkish citizen who has been a vocal critic of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country's president. Officials at the prosecutor's office could not be reached by The Associated Press for comment.
Kanter, who did not travel with the Knicks this week for their game in London after saying he feared he might be killed there over his opposition to Erdogan, responded on Twitter that the Turkish government could not present "any single piece of evidence of my wrongdoing."
"I don't even have a parking ticket in the U.S.," he wrote Wednesday. In a subsequent tweet, he posted an image of himself dunking and wrote, "The only thing I terrorize is the rim."
Kanter's Turkish passport was revoked in 2017. Now, Sabah said, prosecutors are seeking an Interpol "red notice" citing Kanter's ties to Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Muslim cleric who is blamed by the Turkish government for a failed coup in the country in 2016. The prosecutors also accused Kanter of providing financial support to the so-called Gulen movement, Sabah said.
When Kanter announced on Jan. 4 that he would not travel with the Knicks, who play the Washington Wizards at the O2 arena on Thursday, he said he feared assassination if he left the United States or Canada.
"The N.B.A. provides a big platform to shed light on the human rights violations in Turkey and gives a voice to the thousands of people persecuted," Kanter said in an interview with The New York Times last week. "This platform allows me to speak my mind."
The team said at the time Kanter would not make the trip because of a visa issue.
Kanter denied that was the problem, posting a photo of a travel document on social media and making it clear his concern was danger from agents of Erdogan, whom he has referred to as "the Hitler of our century."
"They've got a lot of spies there," Kanter said. "I think I can get killed there easy. It would be a very ugly situation."
Turkish officials, including the former N.B.A. player Hidayet Turkoglu, who is now a chief adviser to Erdogan, have dismissed his fears.
"He is trying to get the limelight with irrational justifications and political remarks," Turkoglu, who went by Hedo in the N.B.A., said on Twitter.
But Kanter told The Times last week that death threats had been "coming a lot more and more every day."
"I was scared," he added. "I'm not going to lie."
Since the Knicks went overseas, Kanter has posted a number of photographs of himself meeting with members of Congress. He also wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post explaining his decision and his reasons for standing against Erdogan.
"My decision not to travel to London was difficult from a competitive standpoint but much easier from a safety one," he wrote. "It helps puts a spotlight on how a dictator is wrecking Turkey -- people have been killed, thousands are unjustly imprisoned, and countless lives have been ruined. That is no game."

Texto completo: -- The House voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to condemn white nationalism and white supremacy, a measure prompted by the comments of Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who openly questioned why those terms had become offensive.
Having been stripped of his committee assignments Monday and facing further reproach, King went to the House floor Tuesday to say that he would support the resolution while continuing to protest that he had been misquoted in The New York Times article.
"There is no tape for this interview I did. There's no way to go back and listen," he said, conceding that he might have said the quoted words but challenging how they have been interpreted. "That ideology never showed up in my head. I don't know how it would have come out of my mouth."
The resolution, introduced by House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., mentions King's remarks in its preamble, but the measure does not directly rebuke King himself. It passed 424-1, with Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., voting no because he favors a censure of King.
Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American congressional leader, called white nationalism and white supremacy "clear and present dangers to our great Republic," in floor remarks Tuesday.
"When elected representatives give cover and comfort to those who spread racial divisiveness, we embolden those on the fringes on our society, and we have seen some of the results," he said citing the hate-motivated murders of black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., and synagogue attendees in Pittsburgh.
King sat apart from his colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle as Clyburn spoke. Moments later, King rose, made the sign of the cross, and descended into the well of the House to give his remarks.
King said he came from a family of abolitionists, before ultimately calling on his colleagues to support a measure that is intended to serve as a serious admonition against him.
"All men and all women are created equal," he said. "It is in my heart, it is in my soul, and it is in my works."
But those words came too late for his own Republican colleagues, not to mention scores of Democrats who are ready to pursue more serious actions against King, including censure -- the most serious House sanction short of expulsion.
Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, called Tuesday for King to "find another line of work," a day after GOP leaders moved to punish King by stripping him of his committee assignments and King earned a rebuke from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., condemned King's comments but stopped short of calling for his resignation.
"I think that's up to Steve King," he said.
Some Democrats are pressing for further punishment. Two Democrats have filed censure resolutions that are set to see floor action by Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters Tuesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., praised Republican leaders for their action but left open the possibility that he would vote for a censure resolution.
Hoyer exploded when asked how King's behavior compared to the last House member to be censured, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
King's conduct, he said, "far exceeds" Rangel's actions, which included improperly using his office to solicit funds and failing to pay taxes on a vacation home. Hoyer served as majority leader during Rangel's 2010 ethics proceedings and pushed to reprimand Rangel, a lesser punishment than censure.
"What King is doing and what others have done is to encourage the undermining of the basic principles of our country," he said.<

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The House nearly unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday condemning Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, for questioning why phrases such as "white supremacist" are offensive.
King voted for the resolution himself. It passed 424 to 1.
Before the vote, King said he agreed with South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn's resolution, titled "Rejecting White nationalism and White supremacy." The resolution invoked King's comments and condemned such words as "hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States."
"I regret that we are in this place," King said, adding that he rejects such ideologies. "I agree with every word that you have put in this. It's an honest and a direct resolution put together to address a subject that has been too long before the public dialogue in this country.
"I want to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's vote for this resolution. I'm putting up a yes on the board here," King said.
He said his "white supremacist" comments had not come across as he intended.
King sat alone on the GOP side of the chamber as Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, urged his colleagues to support the resolution. A handful of Republicans sat nearby. Many stood up to condemn racism.
On the other side of the aisle, about two dozen Democrats sat in rapt silence as Clyburn, a civil rights veteran, invoked the work of Martin Luther King Jr., whose birthday was Tuesday.
"Now is the time to do right," Clyburn said before the vote. "This body must speak out against this evil."
The sole "no" vote came from Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., an African-American, who said the measure did not go far enough.
Minimally, King should be censured, Rush said Tuesday, and if he continues making such remarks, he should be expelled from Congress.
"Steve King has made a career out of being a racist, and he needs to be called out as such," he said.
The vote followed a series of condemnations from lawmakers in both parties. A handful of prominent Republicans said King should leave Congress, and top House Republicans voted Monday not to assign King any committees in the new Congress. King was on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business Committees.
He had been the chairman of the immigration and border security subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee when Republicans controlled the House.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization – how did that language become offensive?" King said in an interview with The New York Times last week. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
"The House Republicans denounce his language. We do not believe in his language, and we've decided that he will not serve on any" committees, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Tuesday. He said it was up to King whether he should resign.
Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the No. 3 House Republican, went further, echoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.: "I think that he should find another line of work," she said. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, also called on King to resign.
Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, 235-199, with the help of a coalition of women, African-Americans and Hispanics. They ushered in the most diverse class yet, breaking records for the number of women and minorities. The House GOP became less diverse, seeing a decline in the number of women and the loss of the sole African-American Republican woman in the House, Mia Love of Utah.
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., applauded Republican leaders for their "strong" actions against King on Tuesday. "I think they did the right thing," he said. "I think they're very concerned about their party being perceived as a Steve King party."
Hoyer said the party was discussing two measures that would censure King – one by Rush and a more narrow one from Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio – acknowledging that such actions could open a Pandora's box. "It is a big deal to be censured," he said.
Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce, the first Republican to join Ryan's censure resolution and a member of the steering committee that stripped King of his committees, told USA TODAY he tried to have a "man-to-man" conversation with King when he "made stupid comments" about immigrants in 2013.
"My point was that when you say stupid things, it splashes on all of us," Joyce said. "He said, well, he gets good publicity out of it. I said, 'Well you need to think about other people here because it's not right.'"

'No room for white supremacy'

Texto completo: Rep. Kevin McCarthy appears to have passed his first test as House Republicans' minority leader this week -- holding the party together to sanction one of its own, Iowa Rep. Steve King, for his latest racially charged comments.
McCarthy, of Bakersfield, decided late Monday to bar King from membership on any committees in the new Congress, a move that shows a rare willingness by a Republican leader to discipline those in the party.
On Tuesday, the House overwhelmingly supported the sanction, even as some members in both parties supported stronger action -- even King's exit from Congress.

King, who like McCarthy has been one of President Trump's closest allies in Congress, recently was quoted in the New York Times asking, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?"
It was far from the first time that King has publicly made comments widely considered racist, and his sentiments have been common knowledge for years. Yet previous House Republican leaders, including former Speakers Paul D. Ryan and John A. Boehner, have avoided punishing him.
"I'm a brand-new leader. I listened to what Steve said. I brought Steve in and met with him. I also did research on what Steve has said in the past," McCarthy said. "There is no room for white supremacy. That's why I took a strong action."
Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a respected senior Republican, said that by acting as he did, McCarthy set a standard for how he expects members of the party conference to behave.
"It's a tough call to have to do something like that, and I think he did the right thing," Cole said.
Both the toxicity of King's words and his national reputation ensured that McCarthy's response was widely anticipated.
King's connections and prominence among Republicans in Iowa, which holds the first presidential nominating contest, meant that White House aspirants -- including Trump -- have embraced him openly for years, despite his inflammatory comments.
That record was an issue in his most recent campaign, yet he was reelected to a ninth term.
Affirming McCarthy's action against King, Republicans joined in approving the Democrats' resolution decrying white supremacy and disapproving of King's comments by a vote of 424 to 1. The measure, while rare, was a step below a formal censure, and far from the ultimate penalty: expulsion from the House.
Illinois Democratic Rep. Bobby L. Rush cast the sole no vote, saying disapproval doesn't go far enough.
McCarthy has not joined other Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, in urging King to resign. "That's up to Steve King. The voters have elected him," he said.
Rep. Karen Bass of Los Angeles said she was impressed by McCarthy's move, but "now he needs to go all the way."

Former top FBI lawyer James Baker under criminal investigation for media leaks

Texto completo: Former FBI general counsel James Baker is under criminal investigation for unauthorized leaks to the media.

The development was made public in a letter sent Tuesday to the office of U.S. Attorney John Durham for the District of Connecticut by Republican Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina.

In the letter, the two lawmakers cite the transcript of a congressional interview with Baker and his lawyer in October. “You may or may not know, [Baker has] been the subject of a leak investigation … a criminal leak investigation that’s still active at the Justice Department,” lawyer Daniel Levin told lawmakers, according to the transcript cited by Jordan and Meadows.

Levin then declined to answer any more questions about conversations Baker had with reporters. "As we continue our oversight and investigative work, we felt it prudent to write to you seeking an update. Without being apprised of the contours of your leak investigation and Baker’s role, we run the risk of inadvertently interfering with your prosecutorial plans," Jordan and Meadows wrote.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by newly appointed director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Jordan and Meadows were part of a House GOP effort investigating how the Justice Department and FBI acted ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

The letter comes days after a New York Times reported detailed how senior FBI officials, in the days after former FBI Director James Comey was fired in May 2017, opened an investigation into whether President Trump was working on behalf of Russia.

“Not only would it be an issue of obstructing an investigation, but the obstruction itself would hurt our ability to figure out what the Russians had done, and that is what would be the threat to national security,” Baker said in his testimony to House investigators, portions of which were read to the New York Times.

Politico reported in December 2017 that House Republicans had begun investigating Baker’s contact with Mother Jones reporter David Corn and their communications in the weeks leading up to the November 2016 election.

Corn was the first to report the existence of the Steele dossier, which has unverified allegations of ties between Trump and Russians. The revelation of Durham’s investigation marks the latest confirmation of a leak investigation into former FBI officials.

Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was fired for lying to federal investigators about his role in an unauthorized media leak pertaining to the Clinton Foundation, and his case was eventually referred to the U.S. attorney in Washington. McCabe resigned and went on paid leave in January 2018, before being fired in March 2018.

Durham is a seasoned prosecutor, who has overseen a handful of high-profile cases. From 2008 to 2012, he served as acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, where he investigated the destruction of CIA videotapes of detainee interrogations. He was also the special attorney in Massachusetts overseeing criminal conduct by FBI and other law enforcement corruption in Boston and their ties with the mafia.

Texto completo: When one hears the word “Amherst," the image of the University of Massachusetts' looming library or the clock tower of elite Amherst College might come to mind. But another small, liberal arts college also calls the town home: Hampshire College, another elite school known for its nontraditional curriculum and gradeless courses. (On Tuesday, the college announced its desire for a merger, citing financial strain).
While the school's unconventional approach might strike some as a bit new-agey, Hampshire College is known for churning out high-performing alumni. Here are some of them.
Ken Burns — The Emmy-winning documentarian known for films like “Brooklyn Bridge," “The Central Park Five," “The Civil War," and “Baseball" started at Hampshire College in 1971.
In a promotional video for the college posted to YouTube in 2015, Burns said that applying to Hampshire was a “risk."
“I was supposed to go the University of Michigan for free. Instead I went back East to a college that had just been started, that had no history whatsoever, and it changed my life."
He also said that Hampshire inspired him to take risks, go against the grain, and have the courage to challenge himself.
“Choosing that path, the Hampshire path, has made all the difference in my life," he said.
Lupita Nyong'o — The actress burst into the national spotlight for her role in “12 Years a Slave," for which she won an Oscar for her portrayal of Patsey. She has since starred in blockbuster films like “Black Panther," “The Jungle Book," and several “Star Wars" installments.
Nyong'o started at Hampshire in 2003, graduating four years later and going on to study at the Yale School of Drama. While at Hampshire, she made “In My Genes," a documentary that follows people with albinism who suffer discrimination in Kenya.
A Hampshire film professor, Baba Hillman, told Mass Live in 2013 that Nyong'o “always stood out from the beginning as a brilliant, gifted actor and exceptional filmmaker."
Liev Schreiber — Admittedly, we have a bit of a soft spot for Schreiber: He played former Boston Globe editor Marty Baron in the Oscar-winning movie “Spotlight," which portrayed the Globe's investigation into the clergy abuse scandal.
He started at Hampshire in 1985. After graduating, he went on to study at the Yale School of Drama, and has a resume chock full of roles in impressive films and shows, including “The Butler," “X-Men Origins: Wolverine," “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," “The Manchurian Candidate," and “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation." He also directed the film adaptation of “Everything is Illuminated."
The actor now plays the titular character on Showtime series “Ray Donovan."
John Krakauer— The noted nonfiction writer and Brookline native graduated from Hampshire in 1976 with a degree in environmental studies. He served as editor of the college's newspaper.
His best-seller “Into Thin Air" recounts a fateful 1996 episode — when Krakauer was on assignment for Outside magazine — in which several climbers died on their descent from Mount Everest during a storm.
His other books include “Into the Wild," “Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman"; and Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town."
David Shulkin — Shulkin earned his bachelor's degree in science in 1982. He has served as the president and CEO of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York and as several other hospitals and medical centers.
Shulkin was appointed in 2015 as the undersecretary of health for the US Department of Veteran Affairs by former president Barack Obama before becoming the secretary of Veterans Affairs under President Trump. He made headlines in March 2018 after Trump fired Shulkin and nominated White House physician Ronny Jackson. (Jackson withdrew in April; Robert Wilkie eventually got the job.) Shulkin in late March wrote a New York Times op-ed slamming D.C. culture and suggesting his ouster was the result of political forces in the Trump White House.
One Hampshire professor, Nancy Lowry, described him as “a student with a sense of direction, moral purpose, and a sense of humor, a really nice young man," according to the school's website.

Texto completo: Six award-winning and best-selling authors will travel to Des Moines this spring as part of the Des Moines Public Library's AViD author series in 2019.
The series, dubbed Authors Visiting in Des Moines, began in 2001 as a way to bring local and nationally-renowned authors to Des Moines.
"The idea was to provide our patrons with a way to see these national, accomplished authors for free without reservations or tickets," said Tim Paluch, Des Moines Public Library spokesman. "They can hear from these people on a more personal level."
The AViD series is funded by the library foundation and lasts throughout the spring. Each talk and book signing is scheduled for weeknights at 7 p.m. and attracts about 200-300 attendees.
"That's so (audience members) can just stop in without losing their weekend plans," Paluch said. "It expands horizons for some of our readers, and gives everyone a chance to see some accomplished literary icons."
For the 2019 lineup, organizers have taken special care to select authors who have written about topics relevant to current local and national issues such as economic inequality in the Midwest, Paluch said.
"This year's lineup is very exciting and interesting," Paluch said. "We have authors writing about raising a transgender child. C.J. Chivers wrote about the fighters and the effects of war on the combatants on the ground. We find not just good books, but books that provide engaging discussion and are relevant to Central Iowans and everybody."
Another author to note is Chigozie Obioma, a Nigerian-American, who wrote the acclaimed novel "The Fishermen." Obioma's latest book, "An Orchestra of Minorities," is a twist on Homer's "Odyssey" and is set to release Jan. 8.
"Some might not know his name yet, but they're going to be seeing him in coming months," Paluch said.
Susan Orlean, author of "The Library Book" and "The Orchid Thief," will be the first author to visit Des Moines during the 2019 AViD series. AViD is sponsoring Orlean at the DSM Book Festival at 4 p.m. on March 30.
The other events will take place at the Des Moines Public Library Central Library at 7 p.m.
AViD series lineup:
March 30: Susan Orlean at the DSM Book Festival. She is the author of the critically-acclaimed 2018 best-seller "The Library Book," a love letter to libraries that doubles as a true crime exploration of the unsolved 1986 fire that damaged the Los Angeles Public Library. Orlean's 1998 nonfiction classic, "The Orchid Thief," was adapted into a feature film, "Adaptation."
April 18: Laurie Frankel. She's the author of the best-selling 2017 novel "This is How It Always Is," which tells the story of a family struggling with the challenges of raising a transgender child. The story is fiction, but the author is the mother of a transgender child herself. The book was chosen as a Reese Witherspoon Hello Sunshine Book Club pick in fall 2018.
April 22: Chigozie Obioma. The Nigerian-born author burst onto the literary scene in 2015 with his debut novel, "The Fishermen," which won multiple national and international awards — including an NAACP Image Award — and was a finalist for the prestigious Man Booker Prize. That same year he was named one of Foreign Policy's 100 Leading Global Thinkers. His much-anticipated second novel, "An Orchestra of Minorities" is a twist on Homer's "Odyssey" written in the style of the Nigerian Igbo tradition.
May 2: Sarah Smarsh. Journalist, educator and author Sarah Smarsh's debut book, "Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth," was an instant best-seller upon release in 2018. It was a finalist for the Kirkus Prize and National Book Award. Heartland was named one of the best books of 2018 by NPR, Amazon, Audible, Publisher's Weekly and more. The book examines America's historic economic inequality and tells the story of her upbringing among the working poor of rural Kansas.
May 16: Madeline Miller. Madeline Miller's 2018 novel, "Circe," was a New York Times No. 1 best-seller and appeared on dozens of "Best Books of 2018" lists, including NPR, People, The Washington Post, Time, Entertainment Weekly, Buzzfeed, Book Riot and more. "Circe" was also named the Booklist 2018 Book of the Year. The novel, a retelling of the story of the villainous goddess Circe, recasts the infamous figure from "The Odyssey" into a feminist hero.
May 23: C.J. Chivers. Journalist C.J. Chivers is one of this generation's most revered war correspondents and a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner for The New York Times. His magazine story, "The Fighter," won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in feature writing. Chivers served as an infantry officer in the U.S. Marine Corps in the Persian Gulf War. In 2018, he released "The Fighters," a vivid account of modern warfare told through the stories of a half-dozen American combatants serving in the Middle East conflicts. The book explores the growing disconnect between military leaders making decisions and the men and women on the ground facing the dangerous consequences of those decisions.

Nation’s Largest Mental Health Organization Urges Supported Housing Reforms

Resumen: The National Alliance on Mental Illness has asked U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis to make “adjustments and modifications” to an ambitious plan to move mentally ill New Yorkers from troubled group homes into their own apartments, in a letter citing an investigation by ProPublica and Frontline. “The revelations in the ProPublica/Frontline investigation raise serious questions about whether all people being transferred out of adult homes are in fact receiving appropriate levels of services and supports, including adequate assessments prior to leaving adult homes,” said the letter, which was sent to the judge late last month. A spokesman for the Office of Mental Health, the lead New York state agency responsible for implementation of the settlement, said the office agreed with some of the points NAMI made in its letter, namely “that many people have successfully transitioned into supported housing and that these success stories are often not told.”

Texto completo: The National Alliance on Mental Illness has asked U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis to make “adjustments and modifications” to an ambitious plan to move mentally ill New Yorkers from troubled group homes into their own apartments, in a letter citing an investigation by ProPublica and Frontline.
Coming Soon
Frontline and ProPublica investigate where New York fails those with serious mental illness in a documentary coming soon to PBS.
“The revelations in the ProPublica/Frontline investigation raise serious questions about whether all people being transferred out of adult homes are in fact receiving appropriate levels of services and supports, including adequate assessments prior to leaving adult homes,” said the letter, which was sent to the judge late last month. “The investigation also reveals that there have been significant problems with monitoring the well-being of individuals who have been transferred from adult homes into the community.”
In 2014, Garaufis issued an order to move as many as 4,000 people out of adult homes — group living arrangements where mentally ill people were found to have suffered neglect and financial exploitation at the hands of home operators.
ProPublica and Frontline spent more than a year examining the proposed alternative, known as supported housing — independent apartments where adult home residents were expected to live on their own with minimal support from social service agencies. We found that some of the most vulnerable people who made the transition slipped through the cracks, including six whose deaths raised questions and two dozen more who were not able to care for themselves, ending up in unsafe or inhumane living conditions. We showcased the journey of Nestor Bunch, who was hospitalized multiple times and beaten nearly to death while in supported housing.
The letter, signed by NAMI Chief Executive Officer Mary Giliberti and the two top New York-based officials for the organization, points out that while many people do well in supported housing, the transition can be extremely difficult for others. This is because many adult home residents either have little experience living on their own or lost some of their ability to do so after years of reliance on adult home staff and have not been prepared to make the shift, the letter said.
“It is unrealistic to expect that all class members can live safely in unsupervised scattered-site apartments, even if that is their stated preference,” the authors wrote.
The letter echoed several more findings in the ProPublica and Frontline story, which was published in The New York Times, including that the state did not initially have a system to track the welfare of people who made the shift into supported housing; that families had struggled to obtain details of deaths and other serious adverse incidents that affected their loved ones; and that workers are often undercompensated and undertrained. The letter also said that the assessments of people who want to move out of adult homes should be improved and that the state should consider housing options that offer more supervision.
Garaufis, who is now in his 16th year presiding over this litigation, has not responded to NAMI, which is not a party in the litigation. He declined to comment for this story. But he has already called for an independent report to investigate some of the problems exposed by ProPublica and Frontline.

Living Apart, Coming Undone
Under a landmark settlement, an ambitious housing program promised a better life for mentally ill New Yorkers. But some of the most vulnerable slip through the cracks.
The day ProPublica and Frontline published their first story, Garaufis asked court monitor Clarence Sundram to examine the effectiveness of the state’s new system to report and investigate incidents in which supported housing residents have come to harm. He also got the state to promise a review of its service-coordination program and suggested the state do more to help residents learn and practice basic skills they will need to live on their own. The report is due on Jan. 31.
A spokesman for the Office of Mental Health, the lead New York state agency responsible for implementation of the settlement, said the office agreed with some of the points NAMI made in its letter, namely “that many people have successfully transitioned into supported housing and that these success stories are often not told.”
But the office disputed the idea that adult home residents are not receiving adequate assessments prior to leaving these facilities. It said that everyone receives an extensive assessment and a detailed, personalized plan of care.
As for those who struggle, the office said, “New York state is focused on improving our systems of care to ensure there are no gaps in service.”
In an interview with ProPublica, NAMI senior policy adviser Ron Honberg emphasized that he did not think the shift to supported housing should be considered a failure, but that the story has presented “a real clarion call to look closely at how people are doing and to help figure out who might need more intensive services and supports.”

Texto completo: A man walks into the Philadelphia airport and buys a Pittsburgh Pirates cap.
It sounds like the beginning of a joke -- or maybe a tragedy, given what we hear about Philadelphia sports fans.
But that's what urban fantasy novelist Kevin Hearne did on his way from his Arizona home to Greensburg. Luckily, he escaped unscathed and spent a few days working with students in the Seton Hill University Writing Popular Fiction MFA Program.
"I like baseball, I like hats, I have a huge collection of them. I do not own a Phillies hat, though," Hearne said at a Jan. 8 reception following a talk in the university's downtown Performing Arts Center.
Hearne talked with students about his writing process, and how he progressed from being "a random English teacher from Arizona following advice I found online" to a New York Times best-selling author for his 2012 novel, "Tricked."
Having a vampire and a werewolf in his first book didn't hurt, he said.
And in case anyone was looking for a good read, Hearne listed the three best books he read last year: "The City of Brass" by S.A. Chakraborty, "Empire of Sand" by Tasha Suri and "Kings of the Wyld" by Nicholas Eames.
Following the talk, students and fans queued for a few words, an autograph or a quick photo with Hearne.
Seen were pop fiction program director Nicole Peeler and instructors Scott Johnson, Heidi Ruby Miller, Jason Jack Miller, Timons Esaias and Paul Allen.

Opinion: It's not right to only hear the voices of some Nassar survivors

Resumen: Michigan's dismissal of former USA Gymnastics official cheered by some Nassar survivors and criticized by others

Texto completo: Whose voice counts?
It’s a question that should have been asked the many times girls and young women expressed concerns about Larry Nassar and his “treatments,” only to be ignored, chastised or told, patronizingly, that they must be mistaken.
And it’s a question that should be asked now, as the gymnastics community tries to put itself back together and find a way forward.
The University of Michigan announced Sunday night that it was canceling its contract with Rhonda Faehn, whom it had hired three days earlier as a consultant for its women’s gymnastics team. In her previous job, as women’s program director at USA Gymnastics, Faehn was the federation’s first top-level official to learn of gymnasts’ complaints about Nassar.
The hiring infuriated some Nassar survivors, who say Faehn didn’t do enough to protect gymnasts. Faehn said during Congressional testimony that she’d been told three gymnasts were “uncomfortable” with Nassar and his treatments. Though she immediately forwarded the concerns to her boss, then-CEO and president Steve Penny, who told her repeatedly that he had alerted authorities, she did not go to law enforcement herself.
But the hiring had also been cleared – and cheered – by other survivors.
“Please remember that a few of us on this team were affected by Nassar and if we can stand up and say we are happy to have Rhonda with us, then you can be happy for us. It’s a shame social media has such power and nobody is listening to the athletes yet again. Please reconsider!” Polina Shchennikova, now a student assistant coach at Michigan after an injury forced her to retire last fall, said on Twitter.

The Tweet was retweeted by several Michigan gymnasts, as were other Tweets asking why the wishes of the athletes – survivors – were being ignored.
There was a similar outcry from athletes when Faehn was suddenly fired by USA Gymnastics in May.
“If we are the ones that you are ‘protecting’ then why are you getting rid of the people who actually care about us?” Margzetta Frazier said in a text message to then-CEO Kerry Perry, a screenshot of which she briefly posted on social media.
So, again, whose voice counts? Are we to somehow parcel out who suffered more and judge their opinions accordingly? Are we going to proudly stand in support of some women while telling others that their feelings and concerns are unimportant and not worthy of being heard? Again?

There is no shortage of blame to go around for Nassar being allowed to prey on girls and young women for 20-plus years. But some are more culpable than others.
The coaches and administrators at Michigan State who ignored athletes’ complaints, for example. The police and prosecutors who did not thoroughly investigate multiple allegations over the years. The medical professionals who did not raise alarms after hearing, and in some cases seeing, that Nassar was performing “treatments” that no teenager or early-20 something could possibly need and that obviously constituted abuse.
What, however, do we do with the rest? The others who, in hindsight, it’s obvious could and should have done more.
Though Faehn told Penny about the athletes’ concerns in June 2015, USA Gymnastics waited five weeks while it did its own investigation. It then told the FBI, which, for reasons that are still unexplained, did nothing with the report for almost a year. No one alerted Michigan State, where Nassar was still working, or the Michigan gyms where he saw individual athletes.
Only after Rachael Denhollander and another athlete, later identified as 2000 Olympian Jamie Dantzscher, told their stories to The Indianapolis Star in September 2016 did Nassar’s horrors become public.
The New York Times reported last year that it had identified at least 40 girls and women who were abused between June 2015 and September 2016. That’s as heartbreaking as it is enraging.
But if Faehn is to be ostracized for her inaction, how far does the moral outrage extend? To the personal coaches, who also knew and didn’t go to authorities? To the parents, who, either out of trust that something was being done, concern for their daughters or a combination of both, did not report Nassar either?
Attorney John Manly and some survivors have made the case that the culpability is Faehn’s because she was a mandatory reporter under Indiana law. But when a child’s life and well-being are at stake, shouldn’t we all be mandatory reporters?
At least Faehn has cooperated with investigations by Congress and Ropes & Gray, and it was her testimony at a June hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee that revealed Penny had had medical records removed from the Karolyi ranch.
There is no way to undo the vast damage Nassar did. But there are lessons to be learned, foremost being that groupthink is toxic and when people speak out, they must be heard.
Whose voice counts? They all should.

Texto completo: There's a new diet in town, folks: the pegan diet.
The word "pegan" has seen a 337 percent increase in searches on Pinterest over the past year, with a steady climb in searches in the past six months.
It was born when Dr. Mark Hyman, New York Times best-selling author, coined the term – a mashup of paleo and vegan – in a blog post that detailed his own diet.
What is a pegan diet?
In short, a pegan diet incorporates pieces of the paleo and vegan diets.
A person on a vegan diet refrains from eating all animal products or byproducts – no meat, eggs, cheese, yogurt and sometimes gelatin. A paleo diet is a nutritional plan that mimics how people used to eat in the Paleolithic era 21/2 million years ago. So dieters eat unprocessed foods consisting mostly of vegetables, fruits, nuts, grass-fed meats and fish.
How does pegan differ?
Although vegan and paleo diets may seem they're at odds – one advocates for removing dairy, meat and fish while the other encourages eating meat and fish – the root of both of those lifestyles ultimately is the same: eating whole foods and plants.
The purpose of the pegan diet is to get people to eat whole foods that are fresh and organic and increase their vegetable intake.
There also is an emphasis on the quality of foods you're eating – the pegan diet encourages participants to eat organic products.
What are you supposed to eat?
Plants. Most of your diet will be made up of vegetables, good fats and nuts and seeds.
The physician explained that 75 percent of the diet should be fruits and vegetables while avoiding dairy and gluten.
But if you must eat dairy, the diet advises reaching for sheep- or goat-based dairy products. Maria Marlowe, a nutrition health coach and author who operates a nutrition health coaching practice in New York City, said this is because goat and sheep's milk are easier to digest than cow's milk, but it's preferable to avoid all dairy.
Hyman said that meat is not necessarily harmful and has health benefits. It depends on how much you're eating and what kind you're eating. The doctor, who is director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, suggests eating meat sparingly and eating only grass-fed and sustainably raised meat.
In short, eat meat as a side dish, not the main course.
Those on a pegan diet should also eat healthy fats such as those found in nuts, avocados, coconut oil and even saturated fat from organic meat products.
And, as with most diets, sugar should be avoided or eaten only as a treat.
Is the pegan diet safe?
Desiree Nielsen, a registered dietitian who runs a nutrition consulting practice and hosts "The Urban Vegetarian," a Canadian cooking show, doesn't recommend the pegan diet because of how restrictive it is – she advises against all diets that are restrictive. She does believe that the pegan diet is a great way to transition into a healthier and more plant-based lifestyle.
"There isn't one right way to eat," said Nielsen. "I think it's a wonderful diet to be inspired by. Eat more plants; eat more whole foods – those are wonderful messages to incorporate, but I think for many of us, living by a restrictive rule-focused diet may not be healthy for our body or our minds."
What are the benefits?
Although the pegan diet may not be right for everyone, it has helped some people.
"I grew up eating a standard American diet, which led to a slew of health problems," said Marlowe. "Eating the pegan way helped me lose 20 pounds, get rid of digestive issues, have more energy and overall improve my health."
Nielsen said that as a vegan, trying out the pegan diet left her hungry, and she suffered from low blood pressure and headaches. She said the pegan diet doesn't advocate for a lot of legumes, the source of most of the protein for plant-based eaters, and it relies some on animal protein, which vegans can't eat.
"It's a great transition towards a more plant-based diet for meat eaters," Nielsen said. "It will increase intake of valuable phytochemicals from fruits and vegetables that help you fight inflammation. It will also help you move away from a hyper-processed and packaged eating pattern."
Liz Josefsberg, a certified personal trainer and nutrition exercise specialist, tried the pegan diet for 30 days and said that though she struggled a bit in the beginning, she enjoyed the journey and the results, including losing six pounds with little effort.
"My stomach? Noticeably flatter. My skin? Bright and clear. My cravings for cheese – and even my desire to have a glass of wine – diminished," Josefsberg wrote in a blog post. "I also noticed I had a real clarity of mind and much more energy than usual."

Flu season ramps up

Texto completo: The director of Palm Beach County’s health department has some simple advice for residents who have waited to to get their flu vaccinations: The time to do so is now.
After a relatively mild start to the flu season, emergency rooms and urgent care centers have started to see more patients show up with influenza-related illnesses in recent weeks, according to doctors and county health officials.
“It’s trending up, which is normal,” said Dr. Alina Alonso, director of the Florida Department of Health for Palm Beach County.
She added that it’s not too late to get the flu vaccine for those who have not have already done so.
The flu is a contagious respiratory disease that is caused by viruses that affect the nose, the throat and sometimes the lungs. Symptoms can vary from mild to serious to, in rare cases, fatal. Those with chronic medical conditions who catch the flu are more susceptible to developing pneumonia and other complications. Children and
elderly adults may be particularly vulnerable.
In January 2018, a 12-year-old Palm Beach County middle-school student died of complications from influenza B strain. Since October, there have been two flu-related deaths involving children in Florida, according to state health officials.
The percentage of Palm Beach County patients who sought treatment for the flu during the final week of December was slightly above 2 percent, in line with the trend from the last flu season, the health department said.
Local emergency room doctors say the current flu season has been milder than last year, but add that it’s too soon to know how this season will compare.
“Last year was a really bad flu season,” said Dr. Jaime Snarski, the assistant medical director of the emergency room at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center.
Snarski said that during the past couple of weeks, Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center has seen anywhere from just a couple of patients with flu symptoms in a day to between 10 and 20.
Dr. Adam Leisy, the medical director for the emergency room at West Boca Medical Center, said that since the beginning of 2019, about 10 percent of patients coming in each day have reported flu symptoms.
“It’s a little bit milder right now, but we’re starting to see it increase,” Leisy said. “You can never really tell with the flu season how bad it’s going to get.”
In its most recent report for the first week of 2019, the health department reported that there had been a decrease in influenza activity across the state, but warned that heightened flu activity is expected for several more weeks.
Flu activity typically peaks between December and February, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which expects the peak of flu season to hit in late January.
About 6 million to 7 million people in the United States have come down with the illness so far, with half of them sick enough to have seen doctors, according to estimates released Friday by the CDC.
Nationally, an estimated 69,000 to 84,000 people ended up in the hospital during the period from Oct. 1 through Jan. 5.
“Flu activity is widespread in many states,” Dr. Alicia Fry, from the CDC’s influenza division, said in an interview. “We expect several more weeks of flu season.”
The CDC is not affected by the partial government shutdown.
The last flu season was particularly deadly, with the most cases reported since 2009. Nearly 80,000 people died in the United States.
The number of deaths from flu this season has not yet been determined. But Fry said the flu was widespread in 30 states, especially in the Southeast, and is moving northward. And the number of hospitalizations so far this season “is a reminder that flu can cause severe illness,” she added.
Alonso said influenza strain A has been the most common type of flu detected during the current season.
“That’s good because that’s actually in the vaccine,” she said. “If people are being vaccinated, even if they do get it, they will have a milder case and they will do better.”

Texto completo: Fox News host Jeanine Pirro asked President Trump if he has ever worked for Russia, prompting the commander in chief to say it was "the most insulting" question he's ever been asked.

During the late-Saturday phone interview, Trump was asked to respond to a bombshell New York Times report that said the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into him the day after he fired FBI Director James Comey in the spring of 2017.

"I’m going to ask you, are you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?" Pirro asked.

Trump replied: "I think it's the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked. I think it's the most insulting article I’ve ever had written. And if you read the article, you'd see that they found absolutely nothing."

Trump went on to his defend the firing of "liar" Comey and lob a number of insults at the "failing" New York Times.

The Times report, published Friday, said Trump was secretly investigated by the FBI on the suspicion that he may have been working for Russia knowingly or unwittingly. The counterintelligence inquiry was wrapped into the FBI's broader Russia investigation which special counsel Robert Mueller had been appointed to lead after Comey's ouster.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called the report "absurd" and said Comey was fired "because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI."

Pirro, an outspoken supporter of the president, was receptive when Trump called the report a "shame" and a "waste of time."

"It is a shame. It is a waste of time," she echoed. "It's a waste of energy, and, you know, some people have to say to themselves, how can you deal with all of this?"

Pressed on how he's able to cope with the bad press, Trump suggested it was his "good genes."

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, with dire implications for coral reefs and other marine life.

Texto completo: The family of Michael R. White, a Navy veteran imprisoned in Iran half a year ago, said Friday that he had traveled there with a valid visa to visit a female friend, rejecting any suggestion that he might have been engaged in espionage.
"We want to be very clear -- Michael spent much of his time in the Navy as a cook and recently worked as a commercial janitor -- he is not now, nor has he ever been a spy," the family said in a statement.
Mr. White, 46, also had been undergoing treatment for cancer and other "serious medical conditions that could be life-threatening without regular, specialized medical care," the statement said.
Mr. White, a 13-year Navy veteran from Imperial Beach, Calif., is the first American known to be imprisoned by Iran since President Trump took office nearly two years ago. Why Iran has taken him into custody is unclear.
Word of his arrest did not emerge until Monday, and Joanne White, Mr. White's mother, confirmed it in a telephone interview with The New York Times.
He joins at least three other Americans in Iranian custody, injecting a new irritant into what already is a confrontational relationship between Iran and President Trump.
The others -- Siamak Namazi, Baquer Namazi and Xiyue Wang -- have been accused of spying and sedition-related activities, which they have all denied. A fourth American, Robert A. Levinson, has been missing in Iran since 2007.
"Michael traveled to Iran with a valid Iranian visa to visit a woman with whom he had fallen in love -- his visits were solely for that purpose," the family's statement said.
"Joanne White wants her son back, and she's gravely concerned that he will succumb to his medical issues in prison," it said. "Michael has no part in the ongoing geopolitical dispute between the United States and Iran."
Where the Iranians have incarcerated Mr. White has not been disclosed. The identity and fate of his female friend, as well as details on how they met, also remain unclear.
Bahram Ghasemi, a spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, acknowledged on Wednesday that Mr. White was a prisoner and that American officials had been made aware of the arrest. Mr. Ghasemi offered no further information.
State Department officials have declined to comment on Mr. White's case. But the department issued a statement after word of his arrest spread that "we have no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens abroad."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON >> Law enforcement officials became so concerned by President Donald Trump's behavior in the days after he fired FBI Director James Comey that they began investigating whether he had been working for Russia against U.S. interests, The New York Times reported Friday.
The report cites unnamed former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.
The inquiry forced counterintelligence investigators to evaluate whether Trump was a potential threat to national security, and they also sought to determine whether Trump was deliberately working for Russia or had unintentionally been influenced by Moscow.
The Times reports that FBI agents and some top officials became suspicious of Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign but didn't launch an investigation at that time because they weren't sure how to approach such a sensitive and important probe, according to the sources. But Trump's behavior in the days around Comey's May 2017 firing, specifically two instances in which he seemed to tie Comey's ousting to the Russia investigation, helped trigger the counterintelligence part of the investigation, according to the Times' sources.
Robert Mueller took over the investigation when he was appointed special counsel soon after Comey's firing. The overall investigation is looking into Russian election interference and whether Trump's campaign coordinated with the Russians. The Times says it's unclear whether Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence angle.
Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the Times that he had no knowledge of the inquiry but said that since it was opened a year and a half ago and they hadn't heard anything, apparently "they found nothing." Trump has also repeatedly and vociferously denied collusion with the Russians.
The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, called the Times' report "absurd" and said Comey was fired for being "a disgraced partisan hack." She also disputed that Trump had ever been soft on Russia.
"Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia," Sanders said.

Needed in the Russia investigation: More skepticism of Manafort and the media

Texto completo: The Russia-collusion story manages to be at once frenetic and humdrum. Apparent bombshell revelations arise but without advancing the public's knowledge beyond a couple of truths we all knew back in 2016: First, when it comes to President Trump, the media can’t control itself. Second, Paul Manafort is no friend.

In perhaps the 1,000th “bombshell” report on the Russia investigation, the New York Times reported earlier this week that Manafort, as Trump’s campaign chairman, had sent internal polling data to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who is “close to the Kremlin.”

This revelation perturbed us. Seeing how close Manafort and Michael Flynn were to both Russia and Trump, we have kept an open mind about the investigation into collusion. We don’t know all the facts, and so we try to process all new information on its merits.

Yet while many media outlets — see Esquire, Talking Points Memo, and others — took the Times report as conclusive proof of collusion, we held our fire. Why? Because while we have tried to keep cool about this investigation, the largest media outlets have not. We recall ABC reporting that Flynn met with the Kremlin during the campaign. That was a “bombshell” of the first order. Except that it turned out to be false.

And so it was with the latest Times report. Manafort was sending the polling data to Ukranians, it turns out, not to Russians as the Times claimed.

This incident confirmed both of our general operating assumptions on the Russia investigation: Don’t fall for the media “bombshells,” and never count Manafort as a friend.

Manafort went to work for the Trump campaign in the spring of 2016. Trump wasn’t paying Manafort, which should have been a clear warning sign. Manafort was free to Trump for the same reason Facebook is free to you: You are not the customer; you’re the product. Manafort was working for Ukrainian oligarchs and other shady foreign clients, and part of the value he was delivering was proximity to the Republican presidential nominee and the information, such as internal polling, that proximity allowed him.

We have repeatedly warned Trump about this. “Manafort is not your friend,” we wrote in an editorial addressed to the president. “Manafort is a shady foreign agent who tried to exploit you. And if he had never been involved in the Trump campaign, there may not be a Russia investigation at all.”

There’s some worry that Trump has considered pardoning Manafort. At the very least, we’ve seen Trump praise Manafort. This praise is unwarranted.

Trump should turn his back on this double-dealer who has caused him so much trouble. And we all should show more skepticism of the media “bombshells” that have caused commentators and other reporters so much trouble.

D.C. Memo: Wall brawl turns into slat spat

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
This week in Washington, the government shutdown dragged on, leading to despair, declining functioning and an overall feeling of smelliness. (But enough about Congress!) President Trump and Democratic leaders are nowhere near a deal to end it, so POTUS “maybe definitely” will declare national emergency to build the wall, which would kill the wall, but who really cares?
This week in Washington
Good afternoon from Washington, where the lights are mostly off for a quarter of the federal government, 20 days after funding ran out. This already one of the longest government shutdowns in history, and this week’s events proved that it could get even longer.
As you know, the sticking point is the Wall: President Donald Trump is demanding $5.7 billion for his beautiful, concrete border wall, or his beautiful set of steel slats, or whatever this thing on the U.S.-Mexico border is supposed to be now.
POTUS says he won’t reopen the government unless he gets a funding bill that contains the money he’s asking for to build the wall. When Democrats took over in the U.S. House last week, they passed funding bills without a dime of wall money, but that idea was dead on arrival in the GOP-held Senate. Flashback: In December, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his conference voted to kick the funding can into the new session of Congress without any wall money. Now, they’ve mostly closed ranks around Trump.
The politics of all this are pretty rigid, and the sides are well dug in: Trump knows he can’t cave on the wall, since immigration hawks have (harshly) reminded him that his base won’t forgive him if he fails on his signature campaign promise. With public polling consistently showing most people don’t want a shutdown over the wall (or even the wall to begin with) Democrats have even less of an incentive to take the president’s “compromise” — one in which they get little in return besides ending a shutdown that Trump already declared he owns, anyway. (The Washington Post’s Dave Weigel dove a bit more into just why Democrats have few reasons to budge; the San Francisco Chronicle explored what happened to the whole “Dreamers for a Wall” trade-off that was mulled last year.)
Ostensibly in hopes of breaking the stalemate, Trump addressed the nation from the Oval Office on Tuesday night to make his case for the wall. (Which, as the New York Times reports, he only did because his communications team made him.) Reflecting a shifting White House strategy, Trump framed the border as a humanitarian and national security crisis, and a border wall as a big part of the solution. Literally everyone fact-checked this speech — which contained many of Trump’s truth-stretching greatest hits — from the New York Times to Fox News anchor Shep Smith.
Perspectives on the address: Politico editor John Harris analyzes why the traditional bully-pulpit Oval address is a particularly bad fit for this unconventional president. WaPo’s Daily 202 argues Trump’s speech fell flat and was overshadowed by a big bit of news from the Russia investigation.
Capitol Hill’s Democratic leaders — newly-minted Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate leader Chuck Schumer — jointly responded to Trump’s address on camera Tuesday night. Their shoulder-to-shoulder performance was, as WaPo reports, an illustration of how strikingly collaborative the two leaders have been in presenting a united Democratic opposition to Trump during the shutdown. (A wrinkle in this from Politico: new Democratic reps from purple and red districts are “freaking out” over the shutdown and fear they’re losing the messaging war.)
The relatively united Democratic front is good for them, because relations between Trump and “Chuck and Nancy” reached a historic low on Wednesday: An irate POTUS reportedly walked out of a White House negotiation session with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders after quickly concluding it was a waste of his time. (Trump offered the Democrats candy, according to Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , before the meeting hit a sour patch.)
McCarthy later told reporters outside the West Wing that it was Trump who was calm and Democrats who embarrassed themselves; in the same spot, Pelosi quipped Trump can’t understand what it’s like to be furloughed if you can’t ask your dad for more money. So, yeah, things aren’t going great.
What happens now? It seems increasingly likely, reports Politico, that Trump will look for other ways to get his wall — possibly by declaring a “national emergency” at the border that would open up some funds for construction but would also definitely get challenged in the courts. The realpolitik take on this move is that it gives Trump an off-ramp from the shutdown while saving face with his supporters. Republicans, who are theoretically inclined against executive overreach, mostly shrugged at the emergency idea. (Could be a good time to consider the “what if Obama did it” thought experiment.)
Politico reports that GOP leaders are privately fretting that appetite for the shutdown is waning in their camp, and there are at least a few Republican senators (most of whom are up for re-election in 2020) who are inclined to open the government without wall funding. Sen. Tina Smith told me on Wednesday that she’s hoping they will band with Democrats to pass “clean” spending bills this week — which would force Trump to use his veto pen.
After a Wednesday of failed negotiations, the president visited the border Thursday, where he said some stuff. Before taking off, POTUS told this to reporters about a national emergency: “Probably I will do it, I would almost say definitely.” (Clears things up.)
Amid all this, the government shutdown drags on, affecting people around the country. Some of the effects are relatively minor, if unpleasant: national parks are open, but many aren’t being staffed or cleaned, so piles of garbage and human excrement are literally overflowing in the country’s most beautiful places.
Others effects are more serious: Though only part of the government is closed, many crucial federal programs to support health care in tribal communities, affordable housing for vulnerable people, and highway construction are on hold or are at risk of running out of money. Like food that isn’t dangerous? Too bad: the Food and Drug Administration has reportedly suspended routine food inspections during the shutdown.
Minnesota lawmakers pointed out some other downstream shutdown effects: Federal employees who are supposed to be implementing new Farm Bill programs for farmers, Rep. Collin Peterson pointed out this week, are furloughed; elsewhere, NASA’s doors are closed as China landed a craft on the moon last week, as Sen. Amy Klobuchar pointed out in a video message on Tuesday.
The shutdown has gone on long enough that federal workers are now not getting paid. Many are struggling to make ends meet: Furloughed workers are taking up whatever side jobs they can and piling up credit card debt in order to support their families. HuffPost has a good look at how the workforce is faring.
Government agencies are helpfully coming up with alternative ideas: the Coast Guard, reports WaPo, encouraged Guardsmen to have garage sales. In D.C., where some 145,000 workers are furloughed, everyone is feeling the hurt: the NYT reports that restaurant owners are lamenting the “ghost town” the capital has become.
As a show of shutdown solidarity, several Minnesota members of Congress are refusing their salaries while the government is shut down. Freshman Reps. Pete Stauber, Dean Phillips, and Angie Craig are all donating their paychecks to local charities. GOP Rep. Tom Emmer asked administrators to withhold his pay during the shutdown. (Members of Congress make $174,000 per year.) WaPo has more on the few dozen lawmakers who are foregoing pay.
News from the administration: apparently, no one wants to run the Department of Defense in the wake of former chief Jim Mattis ’ resignation in December. Several possible successors have turned Trump down, such as former Sen. Jon Kyl and former Gen. Jack Keane . Meanwhile, the acting Pentagon chief is drawing scrutiny for his deep ties to defense and aerospace giant Boeing.
The aftermath of Trump’s abrupt decision last month to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria continues to be very weird and very hard to understand. National security adviser John Bolton , reports the NYT, is slow-walking troop withdrawals as Trump sort of backs down on his rhetoric that proclaimed the U.S. should leave immediately because ISIS is defeated.
New year, new session of Congress! Last week, five ( five !) new members of Congress from Minnesota were sworn in, meaning that exactly half of our state’s delegation is made up of newbies. The bright-eyed freshmen are taking their offices, voting on their first bills, and even getting a start on backing down from their campaign promises. (They grow up so fast!)
In the House, the new Democratic majority is getting to work: in the last week, they’ve rolled out their top legislative priority — a sweeping anti-corruption, good-government reform bill that I wrote about this week — and introduced bipartisan gun control legislation. It’s doubtful these efforts will survive the GOP Senate, but Dems don’t need the Senate’s approval to investigate the administration, and they got started on that front, too: they’re threatening to subpoena acting AG Matt Whitaker to get him to testify about Trump’s influence over the Department of Justice, and are hauling Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before lawmakers to talk about Russia sanctions.
Now that it’s 2019, I feel much better about diving into 2020 news — and there’s been a lot of it! A decision on a presidential bid is coming “soon” from Sen. Klobuchar, though there hasn’t been too much rumbling about her doing the kind of behind-the-scenes groundwork that some hopefuls are rushing to do right now. (Politico’s Playbook did report, however, that Mark Cuban — the billionaire Democratic donor and entrepreneur who was buzzed about as a 2020 candidate himself — was spotted heading into Klobuchar’s D.C. office on Tuesday.)
Elsewhere in the emerging field: California Sen. Kamala Harris is checking out campaign HQ office space ahead of a likely announcement later this month; 2018 sensation Beto O’Rourke is talking about driving around outside of Texas to “pop in” to places and meet people, which exposes him as either a presidential wannabe or, uh, Mark Zuckerberg circa 2017; CNBC reports that Harris, along with Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker , and others, are sending out feelers to Wall Street about backing possible campaigns, a traditional Democratic Party rite of passage.
Meanwhile, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is already out of the gate, having announced on New Year’s Day that she is forming a “presidential exploratory committee,” which means that she’s running and simply wants to raise a ton of money and kick the campaign trail tires before officially announcing her campaign. (Bookmark this from Vox when every other candidate does the same thing.)
This week’s essential reads
In the last year, it’s possible you may have gotten an email from Democratic groups asking you for money in apocalyptic terms, with subject lines like “Trump HUMILIATED” and “We’re on the verge of BANKRUPTCY!” The all-caps, fear-based approach to fundraising, reports WaPo, has been one of the most lucrative ways for firms to cash in on the wave of small-donor cash that fueled Democrats’ House takeover, and could be a big part of the 2020 race. They looked at one D.C. firm, called Mothership Strategies:
Its lightning-quick rise also has sparked consternation in Democratic circles, where Mothership is sometimes derided as the “M-word” because of its aggressive and sometimes misleading tactics, such as claiming in fundraising appeals that President Trump is preparing to fire the special counsel. Some critics call its approach unethical, saying the company profits off stoking fear of Trump and making the sort of exaggerated claims they associate with the president. …
The company’s three millennial founders are unapologetic about their tactics — so much so that one employee’s bio on the company’s website touts she has “mastered the ALL CAPS SUBJECT LINE.”
The tone of their email appeals, they said, is in keeping with the Trump era.
Love him or hate him, Harry Reid is one of the defining figures of Congress’ modern era, a ruthless political tactician with a lengthy list of legislative achievements (or black marks, if you’re so inclined). Recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, he may not have much longer. The New York Times Magazine’s Mark Leibovich traveled to Las Vegas to catch up with Reid, and shows how the infamous political brawler — in retirement and in his twilight — can’t really quit the fight.
Leaving Washington on the eve of Trump’s takeover, Reid insisted that he was happy to be escaping. Maybe, he allowed, it would have been different if Hillary Clinton had won. But “with this, no,” he told New York magazine at the time. “I’m not going to miss it.”
And yet, two years later, it was easy to sense him pining for not just the political action but also the particular political action of Trump’s Washington. “No one would enjoy the fight with Trump like Harry Reid would,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who lost her re-election race in November. The president “is an inherently weak man,” she said. “Harry would smell the weakness and say, ‘Damn the consequences.’ ”
In some ways, Washington, under Trump, has devolved into the feral state that Reid, in his misanthropic heart, always knew it could become under the right conditions. Politicians are always claiming to be eternal optimists; Reid is no optimist. “I figure, if you’re pessimistic, you’re never disappointed,” he told me.
The week in takes
* Former VP Joe Biden : Joe Biden is the best candidate to beat Trump
* Former neocon Max Boot : Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a Sarah Palin in the making
* Slate’s Jim Newell : Congress has the power to end government shutdowns forever, but they love shutdowns too much to do it
* Mother Jones’ Stephanie Mencimer : The “cult” of Ruth Bader Ginsburg averted what should have happened — her retirement during Obama’s presidency — and now she’s frail and sleepy
* The Week’s Matthew Walther : It’s likely that the best days of Trump’s presidency are ahead
Your weekend longread
The U.S.-Mexico border, what’s going on there, and who is there is at the center of the shutdown and the broader U.S. political conversation. So it’s as good a time as any to take in a well-reported dispatch from the border, from New York magazine’s Mattathias Schwartz, who spoke with migrants but also rode around with Border Patrol agents and spoke extensively with them for the story.
The central question: does seeing the border through the eyes of the people who guard it — a group that largely supports the president’s agenda on immigration — change your mind about what’s going on there?
The complexity of the Border Patrol’s overlapping areas of responsibility (human rights, state building, drugs, criminal gangs, counterterrorism) reminded me of a gripe that a U.S. military commander in Afghanistan had once heard from one of his lieutenants. “General, the troops you’ve got here on the ground are like a first-rate college football team,” he’d said. “And now you’re asking us to dance the ballet.”
In some ways, the dance the Border Patrol is engaged in under Trump is even more complicated than the military’s. Strict rules separate soldiers from the civilian world of politics and policy decisions; the Border Patrol, meanwhile, has been engaged in a public lobbying campaign around some of the very policies it is theoretically a neutral agent in carrying out. Listen to the running commentary on immigration issues from Border Patrol sector chiefs on Fox News, and it is easy to mistake the agency for a uniformed, gun-toting arm of the Republican Party. …
Cabrera said that family separations were “much ado about nothing” and that most parents were reunited with their children in a matter of hours. He explained that in some cases, an outsider might perceive that a family separation had occurred when really it was a child who had been matched with a stranger by an unscrupulous smuggler.
There was another case he knew of in which Border Patrol agents had misunderstood a man who claimed to be a child’s father but wasn’t able to make the case convincingly. The family was separated, and several days passed before the Border Patrol realized he had been telling the truth. As I listened to this last anecdote, it wasn’t hard to hear that the consequences of the zero-tolerance policy still weighed on him. “That’s what bothers our guys the most,” he told me. “Being called Nazis. We’re trying to help.”
What to look for next week
On Saturday, the shutdown — if it’s still going, which it likely will be — will become the longest government closure in U.S. history. Beyond that, I really have no idea what’s going on next week. Will Trump and Congress strike a deal? Will POTUS declare a national emergency and then not build the wall? Is Mexico paying for anything? We’ll find out on next week’s edition of The Apprentice: Shutdown .
In the meantime, expect to hear more about how the shutdown continues to impact the country’s functioning. I’ll have more on this for you on Friday.
Next week on Capitol Hill, we’ll get a blockbuster hearing: Trump’s nominee for attorney general, William Barr, will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his confirmation hearing. Barr, who held the AG role under President George H.W. Bush, spent the week making the customary pre-hearing visits to senators — just not Democratic ones. Klobuchar, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said on MSNBC on Wednesday that she was told Barr couldn’t meet with her due to the shutdown. (Barr did meet with several GOP senators, despite the shutdown.)
On Thursday, Klobuchar tweeted that she’d set up a meeting with Barr for this afternoon. Mission accomplished.
We’ll be watching all that and more next week. Thanks for coming along this week. Until next time, email me: sbrodey@minnpost.com.

Texto completo: Owners of Amazon’s Ring home-security systems can see inside and outside their homes remotely — but so can a bunch of tech workers in a location that’s a hotbed of cybercrime, new reports suggest.
E-commerce giant Amazon bought Ring for $853 million last year, and the New York Times’ popular Wirecutter website soon deemed Ring’s video-equipped doorbell a worthy addition to home security.
But in addition to the doorbells, and a variety of outdoor cameras and sensors, Ring also sells indoor cameras that integrate with its home-security system, and Wirecutter has now added a warning to its review: “A recent story in The Intercept alleges that Ring may have allowed its employees inappropriate and potentially unrestricted access to its customers’ video streams or recordings.”
The Intercept, a tech-focused news site, reported that despite Ring’s mission to keep homes and their occupants secure, “the company’s treatment of customer video feeds has been anything but.”
The company gave its Ukraine-based R&D team “virtually unfettered access” to “every video created by every Ring camera around the world,” according to The Intercept.
“The Ukraine team was also provided with a corresponding database that linked each specific video file to corresponding specific Ring customers,” the site reported.
Citing unnamed sources, The Intercept reported that the Ukraine team was allowed to watch the video feeds so they could improve the company’s image-recognition software by identifying objects in imagery by tagging them.
“A second source, with direct knowledge of Ring’s video-tagging efforts, said that the video annotation team watches footage not only from the popular outdoor and doorbell camera models, but from household interiors,” The Intercept reported, adding that the process appears to still be in use at the company.
“The source said that Ring employees at times showed each other videos they were annotating and described some of the things they had witnessed, including people kissing, firing guns, and stealing.”
The site’s reporting followed an article on investigative-journalism website The Information, which first exposed the purported practice, pointing to late 2016 as the estimated time it started, and noting the significance of the R&D team’s location.
“The risk was heightened in Ukraine, a hotbed of cybercrime,” according to The Information. “If the information were to fall into the wrong hands, it could give would-be thieves a virtual guide for when to break into someone’s home.”
Amazon had imposed stricter controls on Ring employees’ viewing of video, according to The Intercept. “Employees in Ukraine are no longer allowed to download and store videos on their computers, for example,” the site reported.
A Ring spokesperson on Friday acknowledged that the firm views and annotates certain Ring videos, but said Ring takes customers’ personal information very seriously.
“These recordings are sourced exclusively from publicly shared Ring videos from the Neighbors app (in accordance with our terms of service), and from a small fraction of Ring users who have provided their explicit written consent to allow us to access and utilize their videos for such purposes,” the spokesperson said.
“Ring employees do not have access to livestreams from Ring products.”
The company added that it holds employees to a high ethical standard, and said, “anyone in violation of our policies faces discipline, including termination and potential legal and criminal penalties. In addition, we have zero tolerance for abuse of our systems and if we find bad actors who have engaged in this behavior, we will take swift action against them.”
According to The Intercept, Ring describes “Neighbors” — a neighborhood-watch system that allows users to share information and imagery from their Ring cameras — without mentioning image recognition, and without warning that “those who use the feature are opting in to have their homes watched by individuals in a Ukrainian R&D lab.”
The company only addresses image recognition deep in its privacy policy, saying, “you may choose to use additional functionality in your Ring product that, through video data from your device, can recognize facial characteristics of familiar visitors,” the site reported.

Texto completo: It seems like every new year finds Lizzo nearer to superstardom, but 2019 really could be her breakout moment. After showing up on the lineup poster for April's Coachella festival late last week, the Minneapolis-weaned singer/rapper dropped a killer new single, "Juice," with a hilarious '80s-tinted video that quickly went viral. "A glorious ode to Soul Glo and retro glamour," declared the influential hip-hop blog Okayplayer, one of many websites to post the video with high praise. Others included Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, Ebony, the Fader and GQ, which called it "already the best song of 2019." Lizzo herself tweeted out a photo of a Spotify billboard in downtown Toronto touting the single, plus a clip of a drag queen breaking out a routine to the song. The song's official video -- directed by Lizzo's longtime Minneapolis collaborator Quinn Wilson -- features her in a fantasy whirlwind of TV clips ranging from body lotion and hair commercials to a Jane Fonda workout video. It ends with an infomercial-style plug for Blameitonmyjuice.com, which takes you to an Atlantic Records-branded site featuring Lizzo's other inventive and infectious videos. The faux ad also includes fine print to "allow 3-6 weeks for delivery," which could be a hint at the long-awaited arrival of her first album for Atlantic.

Early bird 'Balls'
"Balls," the weekly late-night cabaret founded by performer Leslie Ball, is shaking things up this weekend as it celebrates its 25th anniversary at the Southern Theater in Minneapolis. Usually performed at midnight, it's shifting to a 7:30 p.m. start time for what's being called "Prime Time Balls." Another change: The lineup is usually top secret, but this week's acts have been posted. Friday's acts include comedic musician Dean Johnson, journalist Neal Karlen, poet Thadra Sheridan and singer/actor Norah Long; Saturday's lineup features juggler Benjamin Domask, dancer Kaleena Miller, singer/actor Thomasina Petrus and a dozen more. Fans of "Balls" -- which started in 1991 at the Jungle Theater -- know to expect the unexpected, though. As Ball put it last year, "You might see something offensive and artless, but two minutes later there's something that takes your breath away." Saturday's show will be followed by a 10:30 reception and then, at midnight, it's back to business as usual with another late-night chapter of "Balls."
CHRIS HEWITT
You got 2 go
Paul Peterson -- or "St. Paul Peterson" to fans who remember him from the "Purple Rain" edition of the Time -- just released the first single under his own name in 15 years. Not surprisingly, "You Got 2 Love" is a big old funky slice of the Minneapolis Sound, with lyrics about one love in this divisive, segregated world. Peterson, who sang the original "Nothing Compares 2 U" with the Time spinoff the Family before exiting for a solo career, has worked as a music professor and a sideman with the likes of Kenny Loggins and Oleta Adams, resurrected the Family as fDeluxe, gigged with his jazzy family band the Petersons and led the Minneapolis Funk All-Stars. You can see how well connected he is in the video for "You Got 2 Love," with cameos by Sinbad, Fred Armisen, Tom Arnold, Donny Osmond, Victor Wooten, Jellybean Johnson, Monte Moir and Prince's sister, Tyka Nelson. He'll celebrate Friday night at the Icehouse in Minneapolis (10:30 p.m., $20).
JON BREAM
Sleight of hand
Minnesota magician Derek Hughes dazzled audiences at Acme Comedy Co. over the holidays with card tricks and mind games. But his most impressive act may be scoring a deal with Penguin Random House. The publishing giant acquired the rights to his children's book "Humpty Dumpty Lived Near a Wall," with illustrations by local actor and artist Nathan Christopher. Hughes, who recently moved back to the Twin Cities from L.A., worked on the rhyme-driven story for five years, getting helpful tips from Teller (of Penn and Teller) and performing it on NBC's "America's Got Talent" (where he reached the top 10 in 2015). He published it himself last year, investing $13,000 for 2,000 copies. "Aside from a successful piece of merchandise I could sell after my live shows, my intention from the start was to ... watch it blossom into a New York Times bestseller," said Hughes, who will participate Friday and Saturday in "Prime Time Balls" (see item above). Penguin plans a national rollout in September.

Benefit for a changemaker
The spirit was so generous and celebratory that friends of trumpeter Bill Shiell are doing it again. A Twin Cities jazz mainstay and longtime member of the Lamont Cranston blues band, Shiell is suffering from a rare form of cancer. A benefit concert in November "made Bill so happy, he was weeping," said tabla player Marcus Wise. So he and others, including guitarist Dean Magraw, bassist Billy Peterson and drummer Mac Santiago, will throw another benefit at 2 p.m. Sunday at Jazz Central in Minneapolis. "No one played trumpet like Bill," said Wise. "Bill Shiell changed the direction of the jazz scene here when he came from the East Coast." Shiell has been reclusive in recent years, says Wise. "He's very frail. But he'll be there."J.B.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein expected to leave Justice Department after Senate confirms William Barr

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
Rosenstein has been a shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers mulled removing them both.
Rosenstein’s appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions’ recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal led to Sessions’ firing after the midterm elections in November.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, which may be in its final stages. Rosenstein has helped oversee the inquiry since the appointment in November of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers before next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993 during the administration of President George H. W. Bush.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly, I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him. "
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
A career attorney at Justice before taking the No. 2 post in April 2017, Rosenstein's tenure has been inextricably joined with the Russia investigation.
Less than a month after his confirmation, he wrote a controversial memo supporting the removal of FBI Director James Comey.
Trump's dismissal of Comey is being examined by Mueller as part of his inquiry into whether the president sought to obstruct the Russia investigation.
Rosenstein announced the appointment of Mueller shortly after.
Democrats, who have unsuccessfully sought to pass legislation to protect Mueller from any attempt by the White House to remove him, expressed deep concern Wednesday after learning of Rosenstein's pending departure.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N. Y. , said the development at Justice "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.
Schumer cited a memo Barr sent to Justice last year that was critical of the Russia inquiry.
"From all accounts, Mr. Rosenstein has been an impartial actor at the head of the special counsel's investigation," Schumer said.
Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the assistant Democratic leader and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday he is concerned about Barr protecting the Mueller investigation.
“I’m concerned when this man, who has a good reputation as a lawyer and professional, volunteers to the Trump administration that they should constrain Mueller’s investigation,” Durbin said. “This is not a good starting point for someone who as attorney general would have supervisory authority over the investigation. ”
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , a member of the Judiciary Committee who met with Barr Wednesday, said the nominee was "committed to allowing Mr. Mueller to finish" his work.
Rosenstein strongly supported Barr's nomination and said the Russia inquiry was proceeding as it should.
The deputy attorney general joined the department in 1990 through the attorney general’s honors program.
During independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s investigation of President Bill Clinton, Rosenstein helped convict three associates of the Clintons – Susan McDougal, James McDougal and former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker – on fraud and conspiracy charges in May 1996.
Rosenstein became an assistant U. S. attorney in Maryland, prosecuting federal court cases and arguing appeals at the 4th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He served four years in the Justice Department’s tax division.
He served 12 years as U. S. attorney for Maryland before beginning his stint as deputy attorney general.

Texto completo: TEHRAN, Iran - Iran confirmed Wednesday it is holding U.S. Navy veteran Michael White at a prison in the country, making him the first American known to be detained during President Donald Trump's administration.
White's detention adds new pressure to the tension between Iran and the U.S., which under Trump has pursued a maximalist campaign against Tehran that includes pulling out of its nuclear deal with world powers.
Although the circumstances of White's detention remain unclear, Iran in the past has used its detention of Westerners and dual nationals as leverage in negotiations.
The semi-official Tasnim news agency, believed to be close to the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, reported the confirmation, citing Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi.
"An American citizen was arrested in the city of Mashhad some time ago and his case was conveyed to the U.S administration on the first days" of his incarceration, Ghasemi was quoted as saying.
The State Department said it was aware of reports of an American citizen's arrest, but was otherwise unable to comment.
White's mother, Joanne White, had told The New York Times that her 46-year-old son, who lives in Imperial Beach, Calif., went to Iran to see his girlfriend and had booked a July 27 flight back home to San Diego via the United Arab Emirates. She filed a missing person report with the State Department after he did not board the flight. She added that he had been undergoing treatment for a neck tumor and has asthma.
Comatose woman who had baby is hospitalized, police say
PHOENIX - An Arizona woman in a vegetative state who was sexually assaulted at a long-term care facility and had a baby is recovering at a hospital along with her child, authorities said Wednesday.
Commenting for the first time on the investigation since the Dec. 29 birth came to light, Phoenix police said finding a suspect is a top priority. Police are gathering DNA from all male employees at the facility.
Hacienda HealthCare owns the care facility and said it welcomed the DNA testing. Authorities served a search warrant Tuesday.
Local news website Azfamily.com first reported that the woman in a vegetative state for more than 10 years after a near-drowning had given birth to a boy.
It's unclear if staff members at the facility were aware of her pregnancy until the birth.
Republican senator signals interest in Trump's tax returns
WASHINGTON - Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley said he's examining his authority to obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns, a move to ensure he could see any forms his Democratic counterpart in the House potentially receives.
Grassley said he's planning to meet with nonpartisan congressional tax advisers to learn more about the process. Under a decades-old law, the heads of the tax-writing committees in Congress can request the tax returns of any taxpayer, including the president, from the Treasury Department.
Still, the Iowa Republican cautioned Wednesday that he hasn't yet made a decision about whether he would ask Treasury to release the documents. Trump refused to release his tax returns during the 2016 campaign.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and wife divorcing after 25 years
SEATTLE - Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, are divorcing, ending a 25-year marriage that played a role in the creation of an e-commerce company that made Bezos one of the world's wealthiest people.
The decision to divorce comes after a trial separation, according to a statement posted Wednesday on his Twitter account.
Left unanswered was how the assets amassed during the marriage will be divided.
Jeff Bezos' fortune hovers around $137 billion, according to estimates by Forbes and Bloomberg. Virtually all of that is tied up in the nearly 79 million shares of Amazon stock (currently worth about $130 billion) that he owns.
Because they married before Amazon was founded, it's likely that MacKenzie Bezos holds a large claim to that fortune.
Jury sees El Chapo texts sent to wife while on run
NEW YORK - Text messages exchanged between notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman and his wife while he was on the run in 2012 surfaced Wednesday at his U.S. trial, evidence the FBI says it uncovered with the help of a tech for the cartel who flipped on the kingpin.
The tech, Christian Rodriguez, also testified how Guzman was obsessed with spyware he had Rodriguez install on mobile phones he gave to members of his inner circle to keep an eye on them. The software churned out reports on phone activity that are being used against Guzman.
Also saved were text messages between Guzman and his wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, in which they touched on logistics for drug smuggling and shared encouragement as he fled a raid by authorities on a mansion in Cabo San Lucas, Baja.
Feds: Former commander at Gitmo slowed death probe
WASHINGTON - A former commander of the Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was arrested Wednesday on charges that he interfered with the investigation into the death of a civilian with whom he fought after an argument over whether the officer had an affair with the man's wife.
Navy Capt. John Nettleton remains on active duty, but he was removed from command shortly after civilian Christopher Tur was found floating in January 2015 in the waters off the base on the southeastern coast of Cuba.
Nettleton denied to his superior officer and others that he had the affair, but investigators later determined that it had happened, according to a federal indictment.
Nettleton was commander of the base since June 2012, but not the prison where suspected terrorists are held.
In LA: The union representing teachers in the nation's second-largest school district postponed a strike until Monday because of the possibility of a court-ordered delay. United Teachers Los Angeles had said its 35,000 members would walk off the job Thursday if a deal wasn't reached on pay raises and smaller classes.
Seeking asylum: A Saudi woman who fled her family to Thailand, alleging abuse, moved a step closer Wednesday to her goal of gaining asylum in Australia after a U.N. agency granted her refugee status.
Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun's father denied physically abusing her or trying to force her into an arranged marriage.

Texto completo: An American Navy veteran from California has been imprisoned in Iran since July on unknown charges, according to reports.
Michael R. White, 46, was arrested months ago while visiting his Iranian girlfriend, The New York Times reports. White should have boarded a flight on July 27 to leave Iran, but never did, mom Joanne White told the Times. She said she then filed a missing persons report with the State Department.
“All I know is that he is alive and they were putting in a request for a consular visit by the Swiss,” she told the Times.
The State Department said in a statement that it is aware of the reports of White's alleged detention but would not comment further "due to privacy concerns. "
On Monday, an online news service run by Iranian ex-patriots, IranWire, reported that a former inmate spoke to White in prison, saying White told him he was arrested in late summer of 2018 as he and his girlfriend were about to fly out of Hasheminejad Airport in Mashhad. The man was quoted saying White wasn't in good psychological condition and also had a tumor that could be cancerous.
White had underwent chemotherapy and radiation for a neck tumor before his last visit to Iran, his mother told the Times.
She told CBS News that the last time she made contact with her son was July 13.
At least three other U. S. citizens are also being held in Iranian prison under espionage charges the State Department has denounced as “fabricated. ” Chinese-American Xiyue Wang as well as Iranian-American businessman Siamak Namazi and his father, Baquer Namazi, are all serving 10-year sentences.

Texto completo: For the Monitor
Marianne Williamson sounds like she's ready to take the next step toward running for the Democratic presidential nomination.
The best-selling spiritual author and lecturer and close friend and counselor to Oprah Winfrey – who launched a presidential exploratory committee in November – will make multiple stops in New Hampshire this week, including Gibson's bookstore in Concord at 6 p.m. Wednesday.
“I started an exploratory campaign in mid-November to see what kind of support and interest there might be. And I received enough positive energy to make me feel I should take the next step,” the likely long-shot White House hopeful told the Monitor on the eve of her trip to the first-in-the-nation primary state.
She has strong feelings about a political system she thinks has been tarnished by greed.
“Our government has become a system of legalized bribery in which short-term profit maximization for multinational corporations is placed before the health and well-being of the American people,” she said.
“Where I feel like I can be of help is articulating what this means in ways that helps people re-engage with the political process, which ultimately is the only way that we can override and transcend what has become basically a form of economic tyranny,” she explained.
She said millions of American children go to schools without working toilets and struggle to learn in classrooms with no supplies.
America is “the only country in the world that funds our educational system with property taxes, which of course ensures that a child living in a poor home is going to have a poorer education, which will only extend the trajectory of poverty,” she said.
That next step in her quest may come on Jan. 28, when Williamson makes an announcement at the historic Saban Theater in Los Angeles, according to her campaign website.
Williamson, 66, gained fame after her first book – A Return to Love – became a best-seller and was featured on the Oprah Winfrey Show in 1992. She's published 12 books, including four New York Times number one bestsellers.
She's also known for her philanthropic work, including setting up HIV/AIDS centers and founding Project Angel Food in Los Angeles. And she's also an activist, supporting racial justice and feminist causes.
Williamson said she's discussed her likely White House bid with Winfrey, who herself in November said she didn't want to run for president, ending months of intense speculation.
But Williamson said Winfrey is free to support whichever candidate she chooses.
“Oprah will support the person that she feels is best for the job and I'm sure she, like everyone else in the United States, will be spending the next year listening very deeply to everyone who is running,” Williamson said.
On Wednesday, Williamson will make stops in Portsmouth at RiverRun Bookstore at 1 p.m. and in downtown Concord at Gibson's Bookstore at 6 p.m. On Thursday, she holds an event at Rivier University in Nashua and on Friday she'll be at Yoga from the Heart in Laconia.
“I will be meeting some very interesting people and I'm very much looking forward to whatever contacts I can make in the state,” Williamson said. “I'm eager, I'm open, I'm enthusiastic and I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to be there.”
While she would be a first-time presidential candidate, she has run for office before. In 2014, Williamson launched an independent campaign to succeed retiring Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman of California.
She raised $2 million and won the support of some prominent Golden State Democrats as well as celebrities such as Eva Longoria and Jane Lynch. She came in fourth out of 16 candidates, grabbing 13 percent of the vote.
She acknowledged it would be a long shot to defeat such potential well-known rivals as former vice president Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination.
“I don't think of myself as running against anyone. I think of myself as running with everyone,” she said. “I think it's very healthy for our democracy and healthy for the Democratic Party that so many people will be weighing in with their ideas.”
She said she'd also spotlight climate change and race relations in a presidential campaign.
“I want to talk about race relations in the United States and taking a next step forward in a way that helps to disrupt systemic racial problems that we have today,” she said.

A Green New Deal Revisited!

Texto completo: Back in 2007, I wrote a column calling for a "Green New Deal," and I later expanded on the idea in a book, "Hot, Flat and Crowded." Barack Obama picked up the theme and made a Green New Deal part of his 2008 platform, but the idea just never took off. So I'm excited that the new Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others have put forward their own takes on a Green New Deal, and it's now getting some real attention.
There is no agreed-upon policy road map for a Green New Deal. But as one of the leading climate bloggers, Joe Romm, recently pointed out, "Since the midterms, dozens of U.S. representatives and at least four Democratic senators have pledged support to create a Select Committee to create legislation for a Green New Deal. The goal is a 'detailed national, industrial, economic mobilization plan' to rapidly transition the country away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy, such as a solar, wind, and electric cars."
The Green New Deal that Ocasio-Cortez has laid out aspires to power the U.S. economy with 100 percent renewable energy within 12 years and calls for "a job guarantee program to assure a living wage job to every person who wants one," "basic income programs" and "universal health care," financed, at least in part, by higher taxes on the wealthy. Critics argue that this is technically unfeasible and that combining it with democratic socialist proposals will drive off conservatives needed to pass it.
Myself, I like the urgency and energy she and groups like the Sunrise Movement are bringing to this task. So for now I say: Let a hundred Green New Deal ideas bloom! Let's see what sticks and what falls by the wayside.
My own definition of a Green New Deal, which has evolved since 2007 as the technology has gotten better and the climate problem has gotten worse, remains focused on how a green revolution in America can drive innovation, spur new industries and enhance our security. Originally I also thought it could help us get our groove back after the 2007-8 recession. Success required changes in attitude, scale and innovation.
Clean energy is a problem of scale. If you don't have scale, you have a hobby. I like hobbies. I used to build model airplanes. But you can't mitigate climate change as a hobby. The reason I called for a Green New Deal was first and foremost to convey that this undertaking required a massive, urgent response commensurate with the scale and time frame posed by accelerating disruptive climate.
For too long "green" was viewed as a synonym for a project that was boutique, uneconomical, liberal, sissy and vaguely French. I wanted to recast green as geostrategic, capitalistic, economical, innovative and patriotic. My motto was, "Green is the new red, white and blue." I did not believe in being a "nice" green. I believed in being a mean green. I believed greens should be as brassy, bold, big sky and in-your-face as any oil and gas executive.
I liked the way environmental writer David Roberts put it in 2008: "Like so much of the American left, the environmental movement has become acclimated to the notion that it is operating outside the mainstream, knocking sheepishly on the door. Its rallying cry might as well be, 'If it's not too much trouble. ..."' Forget that, Roberts argued, it is time for the green movement to think big and make big demands -- something oil and gas executives do every day.
To achieve scale, though, my view was that a Green New Deal had to be embraced by more than liberals. You had to reach conservatives and even climate deniers. My way of doing that was to focus on something we can all agree on: math. There are about 7.6 billion people on the planet today and, according to the United Nations, there will be 8.6 billion in 2030. A billion more people driving, flying, eating protein, building homes and drinking water in just over a decade.
If they all adopt the per-capita consumption habits of today's Americans, we're going to burn up, heat up, eat up, plow up, choke up and smoke up the planet, whether the climate changes or not. That means that clean power, clean cars, clean manufacturing, clean water and energy efficiency have to be the next great global industries -- otherwise, we humans are going to be a bad biological experiment, whether the climate changes or not.
Who believes that America can remain a great country and not lead the next great global industry? Not me. A Green New Deal, in other words, is a strategy for American national security, national resilience, natural security and economic leadership in the 21st century. Surely some conservatives can support that.
And to make sure that they have an incentive to, I would also guarantee that a portion of every dollar raised by a carbon tax in a Green New Deal would be invested in two new community college and high-speed broadband in rural areas of every state. Each state could decide where. Every American needs to feel a chance to gain from a Green New Deal.
But which Green New Deal? Mine is focused on innovation. I believe there is only one thing as big as Mother Nature, and that is Father Greed -- a.k.a., the market. I am a green capitalist. I think we will only get the scale we need by shaping the market. If I were drafting a Green New Deal platform today, it would put in place steadily rising mileage, manufacturing and emissions standards; stronger building codes; and carbon market prices that would say to our industries and innovators: Here are the goals, here is the level of clean power or efficiency that you have to hit every year -- and may the best company win.
As I wrote in my 2007 column: "To spark a Green New Deal today requires getting two things right: government regulations and prices. Look at California. By setting steadily higher standards for the energy efficiency of buildings and appliances -- and creating incentives for utilities to work with consumers to use less power -- California has held its per-capita electricity use constant for 30 years, while the rest of the nation has seen per-capita electricity use increase by nearly 50 percent, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. That has saved California from building 24 giant power plants."
To keep it simple, my goals would be what energy innovator Hal Harvey has dubbed "the four zeros." 1. Zero-net energy buildings: buildings that can produce as much energy as they consume. 2. Zero-waste manufacturing: stimulating manufacturers to design and build products that use fewer raw materials and that are easily disassembled and recycled. 3. A zero-carbon grid: If we can combine renewable power generation at a utility scale with some consumers putting up their own solar panels and windmills that are integrated with the grid, and with large-scale storage batteries, we really could, one day, electrify everything carbon-free. 4. Zero-emissions transportation: a result of combining electric vehicles and electric public transportation with a zero-carbon grid.
That's my Green New Deal circa 2019. It basically says: Forget the Space Race. We don't need a man, or woman, on Mars. We need an Earth Race -- a free-market competition to ensure that mankind can continue to thrive on Earth. A Green New Deal is the strategy for that. It can make America healthier, wealthier, more innovative, more energy secure, more respected -- and weaken petro-dictators across the globe.
I am eager to see what other people propose, but we don't have another decade to waste. This may well be our last chance to build the technologies we need at the scale of the challenge we face in the time we still have to -- as scientists say -- manage the unavoidable aspects of climate change and avoid the unmanageable ones.
As the environmentalist Dana Meadows once put it, "We have exactly enough time -- starting now."

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.
Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.
Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle.
With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease."
Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: A secret effort to influence the 2017 Senate election in Alabama used tactics inspired by Russian disinformation teams, including the creation of fake accounts to deliver misleading messages on Facebook to hundreds of thousands of voters to help elect Democrat Doug Jones in the deeply red state, according to a document obtained by the Washington Post.
But unlike the 2016 presidential campaign when Russians worked to help elect Donald Trump, the people behind the Alabama effort - dubbed Project Birmingham - were Americans. Now Democratic operatives and a research firm known to have had roles in Project Birmingham are distancing themselves from its most controversial tactics.
Jones' narrow, upset victory over Republican Roy Moore in all likelihood resulted from other factors, political analysts say. Moore spent much of the special-election campaign battling reports in the Post that he had decades earlier made unwanted sexual advances toward teenage girls.
Recent revelations about Project Birmingham, however, have shocked Democrats in Alabama and Washington. And news of the effort has underscored the warnings of disinformation experts who long have said that threats to honest, transparent political discourse in the age of social media are as likely to be domestic as foreign.
As the scandal has expanded, with calls for federal and state investigations and Facebook also conducting a review, the tactics described in the Project Birmingham document have come under intense scrutiny. Those included a "false flag" effort that generated phony evidence that automated Russian accounts called bots had supported Moore on Twitter and the creation of a misleading Facebook page, aimed at Alabama conservatives, that sought to undermine Moore by encouraging them to vote for a rival Republican through a write-in campaign.
But all those who have acknowledged playing a role in Project Birmingham have denied knowing the full extent of the activities described in the document.
Project Birmingham got its funding from internet billionaire Reid Hoffman, who emerged as a leading underwriter of Democratic causes after the 2016 election. While acknowledging his money ended up paying for Project Birmingham, Hoffman said he did not know how his funds were used until details began to emerge in the New York Times and The Post.
Hoffman gave $750,000 to a progressive technology startup called American Engagement Technologies - founded by Mikey Dickerson, a former Obama administration official - that aimed to help Democrats, according to a person familiar with the finances who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This person said Dickerson used $100,000 of that to hire New Knowledge, a Texas-based social media research firm, to work in Alabama in support of Jones during the special election in December 2017.
Dickerson - best known for leading the effort to fix HealthCare.gov, the glitchy portal for President Barack Obama's signature health-care initiative - said in a statement to The Post that he learned of the extent of Project Birmingham only months after it was complete, when he received a report on the operation.
"I received the report in early 2018, which is when I first learned about the false flag and write-in tactics," Dickerson said in his statement, his first public comment on the controversy.
That report, he said, came from New Knowledge, a company known mainly for its efforts to investigate online disinformation. More recently, it co-authored a report last month on Russian disinformation for the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Jonathon Morgan, the chief executive of New Knowledge, has denied knowledge of most of the activities described in the Project Birmingham document and disputed Dickerson's claim that New Knowledge authored it.
What is known about Project Birmingham comes mainly from the 12-page document labeled "Project Birmingham Debrief," which was obtained by The Post. It is dated Dec. 15, 2017, three days after the Alabama vote.
The document describes the effort as "a digital messaging operation to influence the outcome of the AL senate race" by targeting 650,000 likely voters with messages on social media platforms such as Facebook, while obscuring the fact that the messages were coming from an effort backing Jones. Jones has said he had no knowledge of Project Birmingham and has called for a federal investigation.
The goal of the effort was to "radicalize Democrats, suppress unpersuadable Republicans ("hard Rs") and faction moderate Republicans by advocating for write-in candidates," the document states.
The document also makes bold but unverified claims about the effects of the operation, saying that it provided the decisive margin in an election decided by fewer than 22,000 voters - moving "enough votes to ensure a Doug Jones victory."
Political analysts expressed skepticism that any of these tactics affected the election.
"My initial gut says that the alleged disinformation campaign I've read about would not have been enough to affect this race. Roy Moore is so well known in Alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted them as their senator before the race even started," said University of Alabama political scientist Joseph L. Smith.
Last September, Dickerson presented what he said was a truncated version of the Project Birmingham debrief at a meeting of technology experts - several of them alumni of the Obama administration - in downtown Washington. The 13 attendees of that meeting were required to sign nondisclosure agreements.
In the version of the document distributed at the meeting, a black rectangle obscured part of a sentence that would have made clear the name of the entity that conducted Project Birmingham. After weeks of declining to comment, Dickerson told The Post that the redaction was "NK" - for New Knowledge.
"Prior to presenting the report in September, I edited New Knowledge's report for length and to redact identifying information," Dickerson wrote in his statement to The Post. "This was the only firsthand account of this kind of operation that I knew of, so I presented it to the group to analyze and discuss."
Dickerson declined to answer numerous other questions about the campaign, including what he knew of Hoffman's role.
Before Dickerson had sent his statement to The Post, Morgan, the New Knowledge chief, had publicly denied writing the Project Birmingham report or knowing about most of what it describes.
Morgan, in comments to The Post and in a blog post on the self-publishing site Medium, acknowledged conducting some "experiments" with disinformation tactics during the Alabama election. Those included creating a Facebook page called "Alabama Conservative Politics."

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

Civility: Keep it down; rediscover silence

Texto completo: As the decade of the teens winds down, we seem to be surrounded by a wider variety of noises and distractions than ever before. Holiday traffic and loud music, our own rushing from place to place, the just-completed political campaign with all its ads and contentious debates everywhere and the distractions of electronic devices in everyone's hands are all part of the 21st century.
In its quest for a civilized community in which all members can experience respect, kindness and the courage to do what is right, the Oshkosh Civility Project invites you to stop for a moment and consider silence.
P.M. Forni, former director of the Civility Initiative at Johns Hopkins University (and the inspiration behind our project and many others like it around the country), formulated 25 rules for maintaining a civilized society in his book "Choosing Civility."
One of these is "Keep It Down (and Rediscover Silence)." As 2019 begins, we may want to take a closer look at this idea. Forni describes the noise pollution all around us, lamenting that we live "in an age when background noises are virtually constant."
A result of this constant chatter can be rudeness and incivility, which can have an impact on our health and safety. Think of what driving in a big city or trying to find your way around a crowded store or monitoring the news on your network of choice does to your own state of mind. The din often makes it hard to concentrate on whatever you are really trying to accomplish.
Forni invites us to think about the noise we are making and the impact it is having on others. As he says, "We often surround ourselves with chatter and sundry sounds because we don't want to be alone with our thoughts."
In doing so, we lose the opportunity to think about whether what we are saying or doing is contributing to the vulgarity and coarseness around us.
When we slow down and spend just a moment to view silence as what Forni calls a "refreshing result of a choice ... (that allows us to) build bridges to our own souls," we contribute to the level of civility we so desperately need if we are to accomplish the rewarding society we all want, for everyone.
This December, Forni died at the age of 67. He had taught Italian literature for many years, and his wife, Virginia, said, in an obituary published in The New York Times, that his interest in civility came from his studies in "early Italian books of manners and courtesy."
He often pointed out that we have been dealing with the nature of how to treat each other for centuries, and in his writings on civility, he often quotes from authors he taught. Perhaps we can honor him by slowing down and considering what civility can do for ourselves and others.

Guy walks into a gas station, finds high-octane food

Texto completo: If disappointment had a flavor, it would be the taste of dinner eaten in a gas station.
Grim, greyish egg-salad sandwiches careening towards expiration, sticky wax-coated cups of diluted fountain soda, and if you're really desperate, a fistful of pork rinds that might as well be decommissioned packing peanuts. It's food as fuel, and not much more.
But Will Holmes, the owner of Standard Gastropub in Bridgton, is out to change that perspective by reinventing service-station dining. His commitment to offering locally sourced, from-scratch dishes is more like what you'd expect from an upscale restaurant. Add an entire wall of reach-in coolers stocked with craft beers and ciders - many local, some imported and rare - and Standard Gastropub starts to feel like a destination, not a mere stopover.
At the same time, the restaurant remains tethered to its role as a working gas station. Every one of the many times I've visited over the past few years, I have seen at least one driver come in to pay cash for a fill-up, only to wind up remarking at how great it smells indoors.
Standard Gastropub's enduring connection to motor vehicles also percolates into its menu, where comfort- and street-food plates live together harmoniously. "When we first opened, television food shows were really starting to make food trucks popular, and we wanted to carry that theme through into the space." Holmes said. "So we operate the kitchen as if it were a big meetup of food trucks, all in one place."
Conceptually, that idea could go in a thousand directions at once, but head chef Cameron Fernald (Fore Street, Lolita), who came on board in early 2017, has reined things in by using barbecue as a focal point.
Three house-smoked proteins (all from Maine Family Farms) are permanent fixtures on the menu. Best among these is the sweet-savory boneless pork butt ($11 for 1/3 pound) that the kitchen rubs with a blend of za'atar spices, chili pepper and coffee, then cooks for more than eight hours in the restaurant's high-efficiency smoker.
Fernald was quick to tell me where they keep that particular piece of equipment: "Being that there are gas pumps right outside, we can't have outdoor flames," he said. "Yeah. That eliminated the idea of an outdoor pit, so we have an indoor smoker on the line that runs all day. Plus we don't have Texas weather around here, so it's convenient for us that we don't have to go outside and deal with it."
The smoker produces top-notch overnight-smoked brisket ($12) and boneless chicken thighs ($10), both rubbed with the same spice mixture and sauced sparingly in a vinegary, hoisin-based sauce.
And the smoked meats don't stop there. Standard Gastropub also offers chicken wings that are quick-smoked, then fried crisp and ladled with your choice of sauce ($8). Among these are a few unusual options, including a blend of horseradish, maple and Tabasco sauce that is both sweet and sinus-clearing, even a little reminiscent of lemongrass or ginger.
When our then-reviewer visited in 2013, she too praised the restaurant's wings in her four-and-a-half-star review, noting the powerful punch of flavor from the honey-Sriracha sauce she tasted. She's right; but if you're after a surprise uppercut of fiery chile, head straight for the Red Dragon sauce.
Servers also know quite a bit about the beverage menu and are able to guide you to a lager, stout or ale that will help ease the pain of an inflamed tongue, so be sure to ask for help navigating the 250-275 ciders and beers available. And no, that's not a misprint.
"We try to have something different and exciting for customers, even if they come in three times a week," Holmes told me. "I did a review about a year ago and found we had about the same number of beers in our system as days we've been open." That's an impressive 1,200 different brews, with new options appearing every week.
I especially enjoyed a Danish sour cherry Christmas ale, To Ã˜l ($8), a fruity, extremely tart beer that was ideal for cutting through the cheese and mayonnaise in the Standard Burger ($7). The burger is engineered - through not-so-lean grass-fed beef, shredded iceberg lettuce and tangy "Standard Sauce" (also available for dipping for an extra $1) - to remind you of a Big Mac. It's a major upgrade from fast food.
Served on a paper-lined quarter-sheet tray, just like all the larger-format dishes at Standard Gastropub, the burger also fits right in with the laid-back, yet quietly refined vibe of the restaurant. Black ceilings and light-gray walls draw your eye past an aquamarine curlicue of a bar, toward new glass double doors that lead out to an expansive patio at the rear of the restaurant. On a sunny winter afternoon, it feels as bright inside as it does on the glinting slopes of nearby Shawnee Peak.
During my visit last week, the family sitting next to me at one of the custom-built wood-and-steel picnic tables had just come from the slopes. Their two tweens struggled with the extra-wide spacing of the benches, barely able to reach their plates, but as I watched them eat, it became obvious that they weren't especially interested in the Greens & Grains salad in front of them, a super-funky dish of black rice, kohlrabi, roasted North Spore mushrooms and nori vinaigrette ($11). I sympathized, finding it heavy on the umami without enough sweetness or acid to balance it out.
But they certainly weren't going hungry. Both were within an outstretched-arm's reach of an oversized basket of hand-cut French fries ($7). They dunked their fries in the same sweet-tart Standard Sauce used to top the burger, while with my own enormous portion, I dipped into excellent curried ketchup (a condiment almost nobody executes well) and a tiny cup of Green Goddess dressing.
Long after I stopped being hungry, I kept going back for another taste of the dynamic tarragon, parsley and fennel-top sauce, glancing up at the pumps outside, and wishing every gas station could be just a bit more like Standard Gastropub.

L.A. sues over weather app data; The city says IBM tracked locations of users and sold the information to hedge funds and marketers.

Texto completo: The Los Angeles city attorney's office alleges in a lawsuit that a subsidiary of IBM deceptively mined the private location data of users of the Weather Channel app and sold it to advertising and marketing companies.
When users download the app, a prompt asks them to grant access to their location so the app can provide "personalized local weather data, alerts and forecasts." The app then tracks the user's movements, allowing the Weather Co., which operates the app independent of the Weather Channel and uses its data to fuel IBM's Watson Advertising products, to sell that information to hedge funds, advertising firms and corporate clients such as McDonald's and Subway.
The suit filed Thursday alleges that the disconnect between that prompt and the company's ultimate use of the data constitutes fraudulent and deceptive business practices. The suit seeks an injunction against the company, which would require it to stop the practices, and civil penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation in California.

"Think how Orwellian it feels to live in a world where a private company is tracking potentially every place you go, every minute of every day," Los Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer said at a news conference Friday. "If you want to sacrifice to that company that information, you sure ought to be doing it with clear and advanced notice of precisely what's at stake."
The Weather Channel app has 45 million monthly users, and the company's suite of weather apps have been downloaded more than 200 million times, according to the company.
"The Weather Co. has always been transparent with use of location data," said Saswato Das, an IBM spokesperson. "The disclosures are fully appropriate, and we will defend them vigorously."
The suit cited an investigation by the New York Times last month that found at least 75 companies that collected precise location data via smartphone apps -- in one case pinging a user's location 14,000 times in one day -- then used it to fuel consumer insight research and the $21-billion location-based ad industry.
"We zeroed in on the Weather Channel app because this app touches all demographics," Feuer said. "This is not an ideologically driven app, it's not a geographically driven app -- it touches all of us."
Feuer said his office also chose to target the Weather Co. because its app "seems to be benign and innocuous," but "engages in what we have alleged are affirmative misstatements" to users about how their location data will be used. Since the New York Times investigation was published in December, IBM said that it had stopped offering location data to hedge funds, but Feuer noted that the company had not changed its data-use disclosure practices.
Users of the Weather Channel app are able to find some indication that their location information is being monetized in the app's privacy agreement, but Feuer notes that it is buried in the smartphone's settings menu.
"California law says that fine print alone can't make good what otherwise has been made obscure," Feuer said. "The bottom line here is that no American should be held to the standard of having to pore through a 10,000-word privacy policy."
The practice of collecting and monetizing location data is widespread across mobile apps. Google and Facebook are leaders in the location-based advertising industry, using data from their own suite of mobile products.
A recent study by the British privacy advocacy group Privacy International found that the Weather Channel app for Android also shares private user data with Facebook -- even if the users don't have a Facebook account -- along with other popular Android apps.
Feuer's office used the same Unfair Competition Law to go after Wells Fargo in 2015 for opening unauthorized accounts, which resulted in a $50-million settlement. The city attorney's office has pursued technology companies in the past, suing Uber in 2017 for failing to promptly report a data breach that exposed the personal data of millions of drivers and riders.
But seeking penalties for an ongoing and common business practice marks a new approach to protecting consumer privacy, and comes at a time when tech companies are facing increasing scrutiny and regulation over their collection and use of data.
The last year was marked by scandals regarding corporate handling of private user data. Millions of users' private information was compromised in data breaches at companies including Google, Facebook and Marriott. Facebook faced congressional inquiries over its sharing of data with political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which accessed the data of 87 million users without their consent.
The European Union put strict regulations on transparency and reporting in place in May 2018, when the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect. Under that law, companies can be fined up to 4% of their worldwide annual revenue.
A new California data privacy law, passed last year and set to go into effect in January 2020, requires companies to be more transparent about their use of user data, gives users more control over the use and storage of their private information, and will make it easier for consumers to sue companies found violating the law.
In response, tech giants that deal in personal data such as IBM, Google, Facebook and Amazon are lobbying for federal data privacy legislation that would nullify California's regulations and replace them with voluntary guidelines.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Marriott International said on Friday that the biggest hacking of personal information in history was not quite as big as first feared, but for the first time conceded that its Starwood hotel unit did not encrypt the passport numbers for roughly five million guests. Those passport numbers were lost in an attack that many outside experts believe was carried out by Chinese intelligence agencies.
When the attack was first reported by Marriott at the end of November, it said that information on upward of 500 million guests may have been stolen, all from the reservations database of Starwood, a major hotel chain Marriot had acquired. But at the time, the company said that the figure was a worst-case scenario because it included millions of duplicate records.
On Friday the firm said that teams of forensic and data analysts had identified "approximately 383 million records as the upper limit" for the total number of guest reservations records lost, though the company still says it has no idea who carried out the attack, and it suggested the figure would decline over time as more duplicate records are identified. The revised figure is still the largest loss in history, greater than the attack on Equifax, the consumer credit-reporting agency, which lost the driver's license and Social Security numbers of roughly 145.5 million Americans in 2017, leading to the ouster of its chief executive and a huge loss of confidence in the firm.
What made the Starwood attack different was the presence of passport numbers, which could make it far easier for an intelligence service to track people who cross borders. That is particularly important in this case: In December, The New York Times reported that the attack was part of a Chinese intelligence gathering effort that, reaching back to 2014, also hacked American health insurers and the Office of Personnel Management, which keeps security clearance files on millions of Americans.
Taken together, the attack appeared to be part of a broader effort by China's Ministry of State Security to compile a huge database of Americans and others with sensitive government or industry positions -- including where they worked, the names of their colleagues, foreign contacts and friends, and where they travel.
"Big data is the new wave for counterintelligence," James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert who runs the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said last month.
One top official of the Chinese Ministry of State Security was arrested in Belgium late last year and extradited to the United States on charges of playing a central role in the hacking of American defense-related firms, and others were identified in a Justice Department indictment in December. But those cases were unrelated to the Marriott attack, which the F.B.I. is still investigating.
China has denied any knowledge of the Marriott attack. In December, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said, "China firmly opposes all forms of cyberattack and cracks down on it in accordance with the law."
"If offered evidence, the relevant Chinese departments will carry out investigations according to the law," the spokesman added.
The Marriott investigation has revealed a new vulnerability in hotel systems: What happens to passport data when a customer makes a reservation or checks into a hotel, usually abroad, and hands over a passport to the desk clerk. Marriott said for the first time that 5.25 million passport numbers were kept in the Starwood system in plain, unencrypted data files -- meaning they were easily read by anyone inside the reservation system. An additional 20.3 million passport numbers were kept in encrypted files, which would require a master encryption key to read. It is unclear how many of those involved American passports, and how many come from other countries.
"There is no evidence that the unauthorized third party accessed the master encryption key needed to decrypt the encrypted passport numbers," Marriott said in a statement.
It was not immediately clear why some numbers were encrypted and others were not -- other than that hotels in each country, and sometimes each property, had different protocols for handling the passport information. Intelligence experts note that American intelligence agencies often seek the passport numbers of foreigners they are tracking outside the United States, which may explain why the United States government has not insisted on stronger encryption of passport data worldwide.
Asked how Marriott was handling the information now that it has merged Starwood's data into the Marriott reservations system -- a merger that was just completed at the end of 2018 -- Connie Kim, a company spokeswoman, said: "We are looking into our ability to move to universal encryption of passport numbers and will be working with our systems vendors to better understand their capabilities, as well as reviewing applicable national and local regulations."
The State Department issued a statement last month telling passport holders not to panic, because the number alone would not enable someone to create a fake passport. Marriott has said it would pay for a new passport for anyone whose passport information, hacked from their systems, was found to be involved in a fraud. But that was something of a corporate sleight of hand, since it provided no coverage for guests who wanted a new passport simply because their data had been taken by foreign spies.
So far the company has ducked addressing that issue by saying it has no evidence about who the attackers were, and the United States has not formally accused China in the case. But private cyberintelligence groups that have looked at the breach have seen strong parallels with the other, Chinese-related attacks underway at the time. The company's president and chief executive, Arne Sorenson, has not answered questions about the hacking in public, and Marriott said he was traveling and declined a request from The Times to talk about hacking.
The company also said that about 8.6 million credit and debit cards were "involved" in the incident, but those are all encrypted -- and all but 354,000 cards had expired by September 2018, when the hacking, which went on for years, was discovered.
So far, there are no known cases in which stolen passport or credit card information was found in fraudulent transactions. But to cyberattack investigators, that is just another sign that the hacking was conducted by intelligence agencies, not criminals. The agencies would want to use the data for their own purposes -- building databases and tracking government or industrial surveillance targets -- rather than exploiting the data for economic profit.

Alternative Fact of the Week; Our view: Trump is consistent about one thing - he won't be walled in by reality

Texto completo: If Americans harbored any hope that President Donald Trump might turn over a new leaf in 2019 and resolve not to misrepresent the truth so much, their wishes were dashed quickly and completely on - of course - Twitter. Either on New Year's Day when Mr. Trump was tweeting about how Democrats embraced "open borders" or (if you excuse such misrepresentation as political rhetoric rather than lies) when he was reiterating how Mexico would pay for it on Jan. 2, it's pretty clear that the guy who racked up 7,600 false and misleading claims during the first two years of his presidency, according to The Washington Post, isn't going anywhere.
And if deceptive claims on social media aren't proof enough, President Trump was only too happy to restate many of them in his rambling pre-Cabinet meeting chat with reporters Wednesday during which he made a misleading comparison with the Vatican City walls, claimed there were 30-35 million undocumented immigrants in the United States costing the government "$250 billion" annually and that former President Barack Obama built a formidable wall around his "compound" in Washington. For the record, Vatican City is not surrounded by walls (anyone can walk into St. Peter's Square), and many of those that do exist date to the ninth century. The best estimate of undocumented in the U.S. is around 11 million. As to what that "costs," estimates vary wildly, but the most pessimistic pegged it at $116 billion a year, though that is hotly disputed. And Mr. Obama doesn't have a "10-foot wall" around his house in Northwest D.C. - he has a combination of a low-rise retaining wall and iron and chain link fencing, The New York Times has dutifully reported.
As we've noted so often before, "alternative facts" aren't just about telling the occasional whopper, it's about creating (and sticking to) a pattern of lies and then telling even more lies to bolster them - and then usually a few more to top it off. Mr. Trump's wall fixation has generated more than its share of such prevarications heaped upon prevarications. And that's one of the reasons why the current standoff over funding for the project, and the president's choice to embrace a partial shutdown of the federal government, doesn't look to be ending anytime soon. How can two sides agree to anything when they can't even agree on the basic facts?
At its core, the dispute over the wall isn't about national security or curbing drug trafficking. It's about a president feeling under siege who wants to rally his base once more around fear of dark-skinned invaders. Never mind the the flow of undocumented into this country is not at a crisis point or that many who enter do so legally and then overstay their visas, or that the $5.6 billion would have a negligible effect on a nearly 2,000-mile-long border. Better to point a finger at Paulo Virgen Mendoza, the 32-year-old accused of killing a California police corporal who pulled him over on suspicion of drunk driving on Dec. 26. What Mr. Mendoza did was horrific, and he may face the death penalty for it, but it is not typical of undocumented immigrants who, on the whole, are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the U.S.
Make no mistake, Democrats are capable of overstating their case against wall funding, too. The most recent example is their claim that the Trump administration has spent only about 6 percent of the money Congress has already appropriated for border fencing and repairs. But that calculation is based on a perspective that money isn't "spent" until contracts are fully completed. A more reasonable definition ought to be when contracts are awarded and funding committed, in which case, it's more than 90 percent spent. Now if Congressional Democrats make about a dozen similarly misleading claims, they'll be in presidential territory.
It's no big surprise that the border wall kerfuffle generates the rhetorical equivalent of a 40-foot impediment to honest dialogue. It's been doing so for years. But, as a certain newly elected Republican senator from Utah has recently noted, the president shapes the character of the nation. "With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable," Mitt Romney wrote in his recent Washington Post op-ed. "And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring." And while Mr. Trump and his supporters may see that as an attack, it's also difficult to dispute. In fact, it keeps getting easier to prove.

Ex-Trump club worker: Name left off vetting list because of legal status

Texto completo: A former kitchen employee at one of President Trump's golf clubs in New Jersey said her superiors kept her name and those of other undocumented workers off a list of people to be vetted by the Secret Service before a Trump visit to the club in 2016.
Emma Torres, 43, an immigrant from Ecuador, said that she informed a human resources official at the club that she did not have papers to live legally in the United States when she was asked to submit her information for a clearance check. She said the names of undocumented workers were then excised from a list turned over to the Secret Service.
Torres could not recall the name of the person who modified the list or the exact date of the incident. But she said she continued in her job at the club and was later working in the kitchen when Trump visited the club under Secret Service protection.
Torres's account, first reported by the New York Times, suggests that the presence of undocumented workers at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., was known by at least some managers. Last month, several women went public to say that they worked at the club without legal immigration status.
Trump Organization officials and White House officials declined to comment.
The presence of undocumented workers at one of the president's signature golf clubs stands in sharp juxtaposition to his staunch rhetoric against illegal immigration. Since launching his White House bid, Trump has vowed to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out undocumented migrants, accusing them of bringing drugs and crime into the country. His demand for more than $5 billion to build the wall has led to the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.
During his presidential campaign, Trump touted his company's hiring practices. In the fall of 2016, when he opened a new Trump hotel in Washington, he told the assembled audience: "We didn't have one illegal immigrant on the job. Everybody knows it."
Anibal Romero, a Newark-based immigration attorney, said he now represents five immigrants who say they had worked at Trump's Bedminster club without legal status in recent years. Investigators with the FBI and the New Jersey attorney general's office have collected employment documents on his clients in recent months, he said, an indication that the agencies may be scrutinizing the hiring practices of the president's club.
Meanwhile, Torres's experience and that of another worker suggest that the Secret Service may not have had a full picture of who was in proximity to Trump and his guests when they visited the Bedminster club.
Victorina Morales, 45, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala who said she worked as a housekeeper cleaning Trump's villa, said Secret Service agents gave her a pin to wear every time Trump visited.
"I had to wear the pin to get into the golf club," Morales said in an interview Thursday. Morales said she recalls one pin having an American flag and another with a design that she did not recall.
Secret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan said a Secret Service pin bearing the U.S. flag is a novelty item and "is not used by the Secret Service as a means of identification, verification or access control." She declined to discuss what kind of pins agents may have provided Morales.
Official pins indicating someone has permission to enter secure areas have other designs; they are provided to venue staffers by the Secret Service only after a background check, according to former officials.
It is unclear whether Morales received such a screening. She said she did not recall being asked to submit her information in advance but said she assumed her supervisor provided it.
"If that person got a pin without being screened, that's a serious violation of the protocol," according to a person familiar with the Secret Service screening process who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
Milhoan said the agency "does not comment on our protective operations, including the administration of our name-check program." She declined to say whether officials ever screened Morales or Torres for a Trump visit to the Bedminster club.
The revelations about undocumented workers at Bedminster surfaced publicly in the Times last month, when Morales and Sandra Diaz, a 46-year-old Costa Rican native, said they were hired by the New Jersey club despite their lack of legal immigration status.
Morales said Thursday that she told a supervisor when she applied for the housekeeping job in 2013 that she did not have proper immigration papers to work legally in the United States. She recalled being told: "It's no problem here. You don't need papers."
Romero, her attorney, provided The Washington Post with payroll and tax documents from recent years that list her employment at the Bedminster golf course.
Trump Organization officials have repeatedly declined to address the specific allegations by the workers. Last month, spokeswoman Amanda Miller said in a statement: "We have tens of thousands of employees across our properties and have very strict hiring practices. If any employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately."
A person close to the organization said an internal investigation of claims made by former workers at Bedminster produced no credible information to support a range of allegations they made, including that managers were aware of employees without legal status.
Torres said she began working at the club in early 2015 doing housekeeping and then moved to the kitchen staff, first as a dishwasher and later in food preparation, earning $14.50 per hour. She said she got the job with a fake Social Security number.
Morales said she worked with Torres in housekeeping and said she recalled her transferring to the kitchen staff.
Trump visited Bedminster at least a half-dozen times during the 2016 campaign, according to news coverage of his travel. Around the time he became the Republican nominee, Torres said, security got tighter at the golf club, particularly when he was visiting.
For presidential candidates under Secret Service protection, the agency seeks to check the backgrounds and criminal records of anyone who will be in proximity to the candidate at events.
At one point, Secret Service agents arrived at the Bedminster club and kitchen supervisors asked all kitchen staffers to put their names, ages and Social Security numbers on a list, Torres said.
Torres said she and other undocumented employees gave their information but then grew concerned that it would be used to discover their immigration status.
She said she grabbed a golf cart and drove to an administrative office, where she asked a human resources employee to remove her name from the list. When asked why, she recalled, she said: "Because I'm undocumented. I don't have papers."
Torres said the human resources official agreed to take her and several other undocumented Hispanics off the list. "She took a pen and crossed it out," she said. "She crossed out our names."
Torres said she was later working at the club on occasions when Trump visited. At times, Secret Service agents who accompanied him were Hispanic, Torres said, and the kitchen staffers would chat with them in Spanish.
Torres said she left her job in Bedminster in 2017 because she felt uncomfortable as a woman in a mostly male kitchen. She also said she did not like Trump's comments about immigrants.

Texto completo: Abby Goudnough's New York Times article in The New Mexican concerning addiction treatment centers was very sad ("When more drugs may be the best medicine," Dec. 31). Medication-assisted treatment "[is] really the linchpin of our strategy," according to Daniel Knect, vice president of clinical strategy and policy at Aetna. As the article points out, many of these "treatments" are themselves addictive. So, to lessen costs for insurance companies and create profit for big pharma, legal drugs are being prescribed to take the place of illegal drugs.
We have a societal problem created by poverty that has its root causes in discrimination, an educational system that does not adequately address the needs of those who most need help, and the desire for a quick fix rather than a thoughtful, caring examination of the root causes of the drug epidemic. In the long run, it will be cheaper and our country will be stronger and healthier if we address the root causes of the problem.

Asking is good
Congratulations to Wise Fool New Mexico for its two decades in Santa Fe ("Feats of political theater," Dec. 30). Parents, be happy and proud that your children, even young ones, are stimulated to ask questions after a performance that might deal with controversial issues. A stimulative theatrical experience is what lively circus should be able to present. The visit to Santa Fe by Vermont's Bread and Puppet Theater must have been an inspiration to the folks at Wise Fool. Parents should not be afraid of controversial subject matter and children's questions. Even opposition always can be discussed in a positive way. Young children asking questions is always good.

Not Christian principles
I was disgusted to find an article in The New Mexican about Pedro Gonzalez ("Latino support for GOP steady despite Trump," Dec. 29). Who exactly is this Colombian immigrant, pastor, so-called Christian? I grew up in a Christian church and I never once read or was directed to believe that a Christian should be prejudiced, hedonistic, self-serving, a liar -- the list is endless. Donald Trump's principles are ones that serve him at the moment. He does not care about anyone but himself (and his ratings). When was Trump known to be a Christian until it worked in his favor?
Something is terribly wrong with Pedro if he believes in Trump. He has no business leading people. He should be ashamed of himself and his church. Here in New Mexico, there are lots of immigrants, and they deserve respect.

Don't give in
I hope Congress doesn't give in to Trump's tantrum. As every parent knows, if you give in to one tantrum, the next time the child wants something he can't have, the tantrum will be worse. Democrats should remember the old adage: Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me.

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump invoked the term "American carnage" in his inaugural address, he wasn't referring to gun violence, but the label undeniably fits: Record numbers of Americans are killing themselves or each other with firearms.
During the first year of Trump's presidency, guns were used to kill 39,773 Americans, the greatest number of such deaths since the government began tracking them in 1979, according to a recent report from federal health officials. Suicides made up more than half the total.
A United States awash in firearms, approximately one for every resident, continues to lead the world in gun-related homicides at a rate four to 16 times higher than any other advanced nation.
Two of the five worst mass shootings in recent U. S. history occurred in 2017, including in Las Vegas where a gunman barricaded in a high-rise hotel slaughtered 58 people at a music concert below. Mass killings kept happening last year: at a high school in Parkland, Florida; another school in Santa Fe, Texas; a synagogue in Pittsburgh; and a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. Then, of course, there was the daily toll of less-publicized shootings and self-inflicted fatalities.
SEN. JOHN KENNEDY: Don't trample on the Second Amendment
Even with Democrats taking power in the House on Thursday, relying on Congress to do anything about this growing national health crisis seems a distant dream, particularly given the power of the national gun lobby and continued Republican control of the Senate and White House.
The good news is that after the Parkland shooting, more than half the states enacted new restrictions on firearms. Absent new federal gun-control legislation, here are three ideas to staunch the killing:
►More states could follow Massachusetts' lead and require an identification card to purchase rifles or shotguns, and a license to buy handguns. The restrictions go further than federal background checks. Applicants pay a $100 fee and are photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed, and they take a gun safety course. Licensing extends to private sales, negating the so-called gun-show loophole. Finally, police can deny a handgun license to an applicant deemed a public threat.
It's surely no coincidence that Massachusetts boasts the lowest gun-death rate in the nation at 3. 4 per 100,000.
►Financial institutions could alert authorities to highly unusual credit card activity related to purchasing guns and ammunition. A New York Times analysis of 13 mass shootings during the past decade revealed that in at least eight cases, killers racked up thousands of dollars on credit cards buying firearms and ammo, often where they couldn't otherwise have afforded the arsenal.
►Slightly more than half of suicides in America are committed with a firearm. More states could adopt “red flag” laws that allow families, often in voluntary cooperation with the relative who is suicidal, to obtain a temporary court order for seizing that person’s firearm for a limited period of time until the crisis passes. The order would also prevent that person from purchasing a gun during the same period. Thirteen states have such laws.
Despite the disconnect between the majority of Americans who want sensible gun control and a Congress that does nothing about it, headway is possible through the states and by pressuring commercial businesses such as banks. American carnage doesn't have to be a tragedy without end.

Roy J. Glauber, 93, who shared the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics

Texto completo: At first, Roy J. Glauber thought it might have been a prank when the phone rang in his Arlington home at 5:36 a.m. in October 2005 and a voice with a Swedish accent said he would share that year's Nobel Prize in physics. “I could scarcely believe him," Dr. Glauber said hours later at a news conference.
His skepticism was understandable. At the time, Dr. Glauber was an 80-year-old Harvard University professor. The Nobel was for work he had done more than four decades earlier: an influential paper he published in 1963 that furthered the understanding of how matter and light interact.
Along with fielding congratulatory calls and speaking before a bank of cameras that October day, Dr. Glauber had other work he wouldn't set aside. A devoted and passionate teacher of students at all levels, he arrived right on schedule to teach “The Atomic Nucleus on the World Stage" — a freshman physics class.
Dr. Glauber, who had been recruited as an 18-year-old to join the Manhattan Project during World War II, and who was still at work last year, died Dec. 26 in Newton-Wellesley Hospital of respiratory failure. He was 93 and had lived in Arlington.
The Nobel committee said Dr. Glauber's half of the 2005 physics prize was “for his contribution to the quantum theory of optical coherence." John L. Hall and Theodor W. Hansch shared the other half “for their contributions to the development of laser-based spectroscopy."
Dr. Glauber's research “helped clarify how light could have both wave and particle characteristics, and explained the fundamental differences between the light emitted by hot objects, such as electric light bulbs, and the light emitted by lasers," The Optical Society said in a memorial tribute that is posted online.
Known for his humor in and out of the classroom, Dr. Glauber added a little levity to the beginning of his Nobel lecture, when he accepted the award two months after being awakened by that early-morning call.
“We have had light quanta on earth for eons, in fact ever since the good Lord said, 'Let there be quantum electrodynamics' — which is a modern translation, of course, from the biblical Aramaic," he quipped.
For many years, Dr. Glauber was also a regular at the irreverent Ig Nobel Prize ceremony at Harvard, where annual awards recognize quirky scientific achievements. He was the keeper of the broom — sweeping paper airplanes from the stage — and sometimes handed out the prizes.
The Mallinckrodt professor of physics emeritus at Harvard, Dr. Glauber taught there and at other schools for more than 65 years. He attended a conference in Barcelona just last summer, and “literally only retired from Harvard last year," said his daughter, Valerie Glauber Fleishman of Newton.
Into his 90s, Dr. Glauber still accepted interview requests from young students who were preparing science or history projects — he spoke with some of them via Skype. “He just loved supporting young people and he was completely dedicated to advancing education and science," his daughter said.
Although “some professors will only teach graduate students, he taught undergraduates, he taught freshman core curriculum courses, he even taught in the extension school," said his son, Jeffrey Glauber of Doylestown, Pa.
At one point, Dr. Glauber gave lectures one night a week to students from 24 high schools, providing “a panoramic view of the structure of light and of matter." It was a version of Harvard's “waves, particles, and the structure of matter" core curriculum course for non-science majors. “The course itself is not intended to be very formal; it is meant to be as enjoyable as it is instructive," he told the Globe in 1988.
Indeed, Dr. Glauber “always turned teaching into a production," his son said. “He would bring in the Harvard band to play, and then show on the screen the waves of their music, and what it looked like. He brought science to life."
The older of two children, Dr. Glauber was born in New York City on Sept. 1, 1925. His father, Emanuel Glauber, was a traveling salesman. His mother, Felicia Fox, had studied to be a teacher.
In his early boyhood, “we rarely spent more than two days in any one town, mostly in the eastern US," he said in a 2013 interview for Voices of the Manhattan Project, run by the Atomic Heritage Foundation and the Los Alamos Historical Society. “And my only playmate, my only companion at the time, was my mother."
Because of her education background, “she was teaching him as they went from city to city," Dr. Glauber's son said.
When Dr. Glauber's sister was born, the family settled in New York City, living at various times in Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx.
Dr. Glauber was in the first class to graduate from the Bronx High School of Science, and he received an award for outstanding achievement. Several months earlier, he had created telescopes for a science contest. His prize was a trip to the Pittsburgh manufacturing plant of Westinghouse, The New York Times reported.
Having skipped a couple of grades, he turned 16 in the fall of 1941 as he entered Harvard. In October 1943, when Dr. Glauber was barely 18, “a stranger in a dark suit appeared in the physics department office evidently asking for me," he wrote in his Nobel biography. The man offered the chance to engage in “interesting work" somewhere “out west."
That turned out to be the Manhattan Project. Dr. Glauber worked in the theory division and witnessed the Trinity Test of the first nuclear weapon. He recalled seeing the bomb's flash “and some of the glow that followed from a distance of over a hundred miles."
After the war, he returned to Harvard and graduated with a bachelor's degree and a doctorate. J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the Manhattan Project, invited Dr. Glauber to conduct postdoctoral research at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., where he met and spoke with Albert Einstein. “Our paths thus crossed quite a few times," Dr. Glauber said in his Nobel lecture, in which he included a photo he had shot of Einstein during an encounter in 1951.
The following year, Dr. Glauber returned to Harvard, which was his academic home the remainder of his life.
In 1960, he married Cynthia Rich. They had two children and their marriage ended in divorce in 1975. Subsequently, he raised his children as a single parent, an experience he described as “immensely rewarding."
“I'm sure there is some number of papers I never got to write as a result," he wrote in his Nobel biography, “but raising those children and seeing them succeed was not an experience I would trade for the missing papers or any sort of recognition."
A private burial will be held for Dr. Glauber, who in addition to his children leaves his sister, Jacqueline Gordon of San Juan Capistrano, Calif.; Atholie Rosett of Cambridge, his girlfriend during his final 13 years; and five grandchildren.
Modest despite his many accomplishments, Dr. Glauber wore lightly the honor of winning many prestigious awards, topped by the Nobel.
“I just received a telephone call, believe it or not, from Stockholm," he said in a phone message he left for his daughter a few minutes after he was awakened in October 2005. He chuckled and said: “It's a little too much to believe. I've just won the Nobel Prize."
Dr. Glauber added that he had won half the prize and then, rather than talk about himself, praised his fellow scientists instead. “Ted Hansch and John Hall have, between them, won half the prize," he said. “I would have told you they had done a lot more than I've done."

Resolve to pick realistic resolutions this year

Texto completo: Reprinted from The Journal, Martinsburg
A new year is upon us, meaning many are pledging to leave bad days in the past and making resolutions about what we'll accomplish or transform in 2019.
Many of us share resolutions during our New Year celebrations, vowing to do all measure of things before the calendar changes again. There are some stereotypical staples, like losing weight, reading more and traveling, all of which are perfectly fine choices. Some of the common ones, though, do end up falling to the wayside come February or March, when the normal routine of any year sets in.
A resolution is essentially a goal and just like any other goal, you need a plan of attack if you actually plan on accomplishing it.
The resolutions that don't end up lasting can be traced back to being too vague, being based on someone else's standards for you or not having a realistic achievement plan, according to a New York Times report.
When deciding on your goals for the year, it's important to see if they check those boxes. So, if you want to lose weight, you should have a specific goal for your weight loss in mind and have a plan of how to do it. This way, it will be much easier to actually stick to it. Individuals should also make sure they really want to lose weight and are not doing it because someone else - or society - is saying they should.
Goals are important for anyone to have, and they shouldn't be limited to a New Year's proclamation. We should always be trying to improve and evolve in some way, so setting long- and short-term goals for ourselves can happen all year long. When you're making resolutions, try to decipher whether it's a short- or long-term goal, so you don't try to rush into an accomplishment and lose steam.
As you consider what improvements or advancements you can make personally in 2019, also think of what you can do to help others in the coming year. The spirit of charity and giving is strong during the holiday season, but often tapers off as pages of the calendar turn. This is unfortunate, as those in need do not suddenly stop facing hardships once Christmas trees come down and weather warms. Pick a charity or cause close to your heart and pledge your time or money to it, making a schedule and plan so you will continue your dedication. From animal shelters to mentor programs, you can make a real impact on your community all year long.
Some may view resolutions as corny or hollow, and that can be true if they aren't carried out properly. So if you're someone who wants to make a resolution, take the opportunity to pick some good ones and make a plan to accomplish your goals. It could just make the difference in how your year, and others' progresses.

Texto completo: "Aquaman" * 1/2
PG-13, 2:23, action
The DC Comics superhero Aquaman takes center stage, on land and under the sea, in "Aquaman." Jason Momoa ("Game of Thrones") is surly and charismatic, with eyebrows that suggest all sorts of fun. Screenwriters David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and Will Beall stumble all over the place trying to set up simple origin-story exposition - how Arthur Curry, the lighthouse keeper's son, was born to Queen Atlanna of Atlantis, and how he must prevent war waged by Orm and associates, while aquamanning up to claim a leadership role down where the fishies go. The film's just sincere enough where it counts to float this soggy mediocrity for a global audience. - Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Mary Poppins Returns" ** 1/2
PG, 2:11, family
"Mary Poppins Return" is director Rob Marshall's hectic sequel to the 1964 Disney musical cherished by millions. Emily Blunt's incarnation of the magical, gently fearsome nanny suggests a hint of the imperious sparkle Julie Andrews brought to Mary Poppins. Then, Blunt adds streaks of witty, sly playfulness that are more her thing. "Mary Poppins Returns" takes place 24 years after "Mary Poppins." The effects of the global economic downturn feed into screenwriter David Magee's misery-adjacent storyline concerning the grown-up Banks children. The original "Mary Poppins" was exuberant. "Mary Poppins Returns" is often just pushy. - Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"Bumblebee" ** 1/2
PG-13, 1:53, action
Downsizing was the only answer for the "Transformers" franchise after 2017's epic, sprawling "Transformers: The Last Knight." Paramount decided to pare back to an origin story and getting at what makes this franchise tick: the friendly yellow Transformer known as Bumblebee. Hailee Steinfeld stars as Charlie. All she wants is her own set of wheels, so when a dusty yellow VW Beetle shows up at the junkyard, she finagles a way to take it home. You'll come away with a newfound sense of affection for the most lovable alien vehicle in the universe. - Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" *** 1/2
PG, 2:00, action
The animated "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" gives ensemble superheroism a good name while giving audiences a really good time. It derives most of its story from the character of Miles Morales, an Afro-Latino Brooklyn teenager whose father is a vigilante-hating cop. Exploring the subway tunnels with his uncle Aaron, Miles is bitten by a genetically altered problem spider. Soon he learns that he, like Peter Parker, has been chosen to take on the Spidey mantle. The second half's a bit of a letdown, but by the end, we're back where we need to be: captured, happily, by Miles' story and the "Spider-Verse" notion of the mask being for everyone up to the task. - Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune
"The Mule" * 1/2
R, 1:56, action
Producer, director and star Clint Eastwood's latest film, "The Mule," takes its inspiration from Sam Dolnick's 2014 New York Times Magazine feature on Leo Sharp. Sharp was a World War II Bronze Star veteran, a horticulturist and day lily "hybridizer" of some renown. When his business stumbled with the rise of online commerce, he tried running drugs for the Sinaloa cartel headed by Joaquin Guzman, better known as El Chapo. "The Mule" retells it as if terrified of giving the main character a strong point of view, or viewing him through a stimulating clash of perspectives. The movie's version of Sharp is Earl Stone. "The Mule" struggles to find a rhythm. - Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune

Texto completo: IT’S SHANAHAN’S TURN: After a brief phone call between the two men New Year’s Eve, outgoing Defense Secretary Jim Mattis turned over to his former deputy Patrick Shanahan the awesome responsibility of leading the Pentagon’s 1.4 active duty military, 700,000 civilians, and another 1.1 million Guard and Reserve troops. Shanahan’s name is now on the gold plaque outside the defense secretary’s third-floor office.


Shanahan spent 30 years at Boeing building airplanes, where he was known as a “Mr. Fix-it.” While Shanahan has no prior military or government experience, he has been working hand-in-glove with Mattis. Aides insist he has been instrumental in policy, including fashioning the new National Defense Strategy, which calls for shifting away from counter-terrorism and focusing more on countering near-peer competitors Russia and China. He’s no dummy, holding an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering, as well as two advanced degrees from MIT — including an MBA.


“As acting secretary of defense, I now look forward to working with President Trump to carry out his vision,” Shanahan said in a statement. “Under the direction of President Trump, the Department of Defense remains focused on safeguarding our nation.”


HOW LONG WILL HE SERVE? Mattis’s retirement letter was widely portrayed as a rebuke of the president, prompting him to fire the retired general in anger. Trump said at the time he would move expeditiously to get a permanent replacement confirmed by the Senate. “A new Secretary of Defense will be named shortly,” Trump tweeted the day Mattis resigned.


Now that he’s named the Number 2 at the Pentagon the acting secretary, Trump seems to be in no hurry to find anyone else. “He could be there for a long time. I mean, I'm in no rush,” Trump told reporters traveling with him to Iraq after Christmas. Trump sees Shanahan as a deal-maker, as opposed to the military officers who he has criticized for knowing nothing about business. “He's a good buyer. I wanted somebody that could buy, because I'm giving a lot of money and I don't want it to be wasted.”


Those with long memories will recall that in 1994, William Perry was seen by many as a bookish technocrat when he elevated from deputy defense secretary to the top job by President Bill Clinton . Perry, a mathematician, turned out to be a major influence on policy.


WILL HE PUSH BACK? Shanahan has been the point-man making Trump’s Space Force a reality, a project that Mattis saw as bureaucratic overkill. Mattis tempered some of Trump’s more impulsive instincts, including withdrawing from NATO, targeting Bashar Assad, canceling U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises, and using the military to build parts of tent cities and engage in law enforcement on the southwest border. The question is whether Shanahan, in his caretaker role, will be more of a “go along, get along,” Department of Defense leader.


“Q's for Shanahan: agree w/immediate Syria withdrawal? Will you express full support for NATO? Restart full exercises with ROK? Is ISIS defeated? How does partial w/d from Afghanistan meet goals? Will you say No to POTUS ever? Yemen and KSA? 700/733/750?” tweeted Democrat Rep. Rick Larson , Wash., shortly after Trump announced he was dispatching Mattis two months early.


WILL MATTIS TESTIFY? Mattis is lying low and expected to soon head back to his home state of Washington. But with Democrats in charge of Congress, he could be called to testify about his policy differences with Trump. While serving as secretary Mattis kept a relatively low profile and carefully avoided directly contradicting Trump in public.


WHO WILL SPEAK FOR HIM? Mattis’ chief spokesperson Dana White also resigned Monday, the same day Mattis left. “It is with a heavy heart that I have submitted my letter of resignation to Secretary Mattis,” said White in a memo to her staff.


White was under the cloud of an investigation by the Pentagon’s inspector general for her management style and had ceased public briefings as of May of 2017. She will now be replaced by her deputy, Charles Summers , a captain in the Navy Reserve and former state legislator in Maine, who will now be the acting assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs.


Late last year, Mattis tapped an active-duty Marine, Maj. Gen. Burke Whitman , a to serve as the on-camera face of the Pentagon. The two-star general was expected to start briefing reporters next month.


WILL DUNFORD SERVE OUT HIS TERM? Trump has already announced he plans to replace retiring Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford with Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley. But like Mattis, Dunford, who was appointed by President Barack Obama , was often the bearer of unwelcome advice. He is currently involved in the effort to get Trump to slow down his Syria withdrawal plan. Dunford’s office has said he plans to serve until September when he is scheduled to retire.


MATTIS’ FAREWELL: In his farewell letter to the troops and civilians in the Department of Defense, Mattis, a student of history quoted a favorite letter Abraham Lincoln sent then- Lt. Gen. Ulysses Grant in 1865. “Let nothing which is transpiring, change, hinder, or delay your military movements, or plans.”


Mattis kept a copy of the letter in his Pentagon office to remind himself to stay focused on his mission amid the turmoil and tumult of Washington. “So keep the faith in our country and hold fast, alongside our allies, aligned against our foes,” he wrote.


AND GOODBYE TRAVIS: Sharp-eyed readers will have noticed that my partner Travis Tritten’s photo no longer appears alongside mine on the masthead. Travis is starting the new year with a new job. As of today, Travis is a senior reporter for Bloomberg Government, based at the Pentagon.


Travis was my eyes and ears on Capitol Hill, as well as covering the Pentagon, and much of our reporting last year on the budget and other congressional machinations was the result of his diligence and persistence.


I wish him good luck and know I’ll be seeing him around the C-ring off the 9th corridor, where the Pentagon press corps has its desks.

HAPPENING TODAY, ‘LET’S MAKE A DEAL’: President Trump has invited congressional leaders of both parties to the White House at 3 p.m. today to discuss a fight over his proposed border wall, which prompted a partial government shutdown. A congressional source confirmed to the Washington Examiner that Trump proposed the meeting, framing it as a briefing on “border security.”


“Border Security and the Wall ‘thing’ and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let’s make a deal?” Trump tweeted yesterday afternoon. Attending on the Republican side will be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Ky., and soon-to-be House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , Calif. and Minority Whip Steve Scalise, La. Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , N.Y., will represent the Democrats.


The meeting comes one day before the Democrats take control of the House, and one day after the U.S. fired tear gas onto the Mexican side of the border near Tijuana’s beach to repel about 150 migrants trying to breach the border fence. The migrants, including women and children, told The Associated Press they arrived last month with the caravan from Honduras.


BOLD PREDICTION: F-35 WILL BEAT THE GOAL: Before Mattis left, he ordered the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps to fix the problem of aircraft readiness by the end of the year. He set an ambitious goal for seven of the various front-line combat aircraft planes to have a mission-capable rate of 80 percent, meaning on any given day only 20 percent of the fleet could be down for maintenance.


Just last month the GAO told Congress the goal may be too much of a stretch, given how far behind maintenance has fallen after years of congressionally-mandated spending caps. But in an interview is this week’s Washington Examiner magazine, Vice Adm. Mat Winter , program executive officer for the F-35’s Joint Program Office says he’s betting the plane will meet or beat the goal.


“The answer is yes, but ... this is a tough challenge,” Winter said, explaining that with a new plane the problem is the supply chain, getting spare parts where they are needed. “We want to make sure all our parts are in the garage or with our warfighter so that the downtime of an aircraft is measured in minutes and hours, not days and weeks.”


WHAT’S THE RUSH? Was it Lindsey Graham or Benjamin Netanyahu who got to Trump? In any event, after meeting with the Republican senator from South Carolina and talking to the Israeli prime minister by phone, Trump has changed his tune about a rapid immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria,


“I never said that I'm gonna rush out," Trump said in a New Year's Eve interview with Fox News. "We’re going to get out. We’re getting out of Syria; we’re bringing our young, great troops home after so many years."


That’s not how it sounded two weeks ago, when Trump recorded a twitter video on the White House lawn, in lieu of addressing the nation about his pullout plans. “Now we’ve won, it’s time to come back. They’re getting ready. You’re going to see them soon,” Trump tweeted Dec. 21. “Our boys, our young women, our men, they are all coming back. And they are coming back now.”


Graham, who has been apoplectic about the prospect of a precipitous withdrawal that would hand eastern Syria over to Bashar Assad and the Russians, and possibly lead to another 9/11-level attack, had lunch with Trump Sunday and pronounced himself reassured.


“We talked about Syria. He told me some things I didn’t know that made me feel a lot better about where we’re headed in Syria,” Graham said. “I think the president’s taking this really seriously.”


The New York Times reports Trump will give the military about four months to pull 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, citing administration officials.


LET ME MAKE THIS MCCHRYSTAL CLEAR: One thing you can count on if anyone criticizes President Trump, he won’t hesitate to hit back. In response to an interview former Afghanistan commander retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal gave ABC, Trump tweeted, “‘General’ McChrystal got fired like a dog by Obama. Last assignment a total bust. Known for big, dumb mouth. Hillary lover!”


“I think it's important for me to work for people who I think are basically honest, who tell the truth as best they know it,” McChrystal said in the interview, which aired Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” Asked by co-anchor Martha Raddatz if Trump is a liar, McChrystal answered, “I don’t think he tells the truth.”


“Is Trump immoral, in your view?” Raddatz asked. “I think he is,” McChrystal said.


McChrystal added, "What I would ask every American to do is ... stand in front of that mirror and say, 'What are we about? Am I really willing to throw away or ignore some of the things that people do that are — are pretty unacceptable normally just because they accomplish certain other things that we might like?'”


ROMNEY’S NEXT: Utah Sen.-elect Mitt Romney who lost the 2012 presidential race to Barack Obama, and who famously excoriated Trump in a 2016 speech in which he called Trump “a con man, a fake,” is blasting Trump again. This time, on the eve of his swearing-in as a senator. “On balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office,” Romney writes in an op-ed in the Washington Post, citing the departures of “Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly , the appointment of senior persons of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies who fight beside us, and the president’s thoughtless claim that America has long been a ‘sucker’ in world affairs,” which Romney argues have “all defined his presidency down.”


“A president should demonstrate the essential qualities of honesty and integrity, and elevate the national discourse with comity and mutual respect … And it is in this province where the incumbent’s shortfall has been most glaring,” he writes. “I will support policies that I believe are in the best interest of the country and my state, and oppose those that are not. I do not intend to comment on every tweet or fault. But I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.”


POMPEO IN BRAZIL: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel on Tuesday after a visit with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose team was caught off-guard by President Trump's plan to withdraw from Syria. Pompeo met with Netanyahu in Brazil, writing in a Twitter post: “The United States fully supports Israel's right to defend itself. The U.S.-Israeli alliance is strong.”


KIM’S NEW YEAR’S WARNING: North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un gave his traditional New Year’s address to his nation yesterday, and the message was clear, says Harry Kazianis , director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest. “Pyongyang is clearly willing to engage in dialogue while working towards denuclearization with Washington and Seoul — but on its terms.”


In his speech yesterdy, Kim said, “I am ready to meet the US president again anytime, and will make efforts to obtain without fail results which can be welcomed by the international community.” But then added a caveat, that he wants sanctions relief first, something the U.S. has refused up to now.


“If the United States does not keep the promise it made in the eyes of the world, and out of miscalculation of our people’s patience, it attempts to unilaterally enforce something upon us and persists in imposing sanctions and pressure against our Republic, we may be compelled to find a new way for defending the sovereignty of the country and the supreme interests of the state and for achieving peace and stability of the Korean peninsula.”


“Will Team Trump be willing to back away from its position of zero sanctions relief until Kim entirely dismantles his nuclear program?” ask Kazianis. “If the answer is no, then we very well could be headed back to the days of ‘fire and fury,’ as Kim remarks seem to suggest his patience with America is wearing thin.”


It may be time for the U.S. to test the sincerity of Kim’s denuclearization intentions, Kazianis argues. “A grand bargain on denuclearization that matches action-for-action, where both sides make corresponding moves to ease tensions — such as a phased reduction in sanctions for a phased ending of Kim’s nuclear program — could be the way to secure peace on the Korean Peninsula once and for all.”


You can read the full English translation of Kim’s speech here.


TRUMP’S RESPONSE: “Kim Jong Un says North Korea will not make or test nuclear weapons, or give them to others - & he is ready to meet President Trump anytime.” Trump tweeted, citing a report on the “PBS NewsHour”. “I also look forward to meeting with Chairman Kim who realizes so well that North Korea possesses great economic potential!” he said.


PROPER USE OF A B-2: Col. Mat Calhoun and Lt. Col. Bob Bryant flew their B-2 stealth bomber, the “Spirit of America,” over the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., yesterday in the traditional pregame fly-over. Fortunately, the Whiteman Air Force Base pilots did not engage their cloaking device so the batwing bomber was clearly visible in the bright blue California sky. (That’s a joke, folks. Don’t write.)


IMPROPER USE OF B-2: The U.S. Strategic Command tweeted a video New Year’s Eve a showing a nuclear-capable B-2 dropping a MOAB “Mother of All Bombs” 30,000-pound conventional bomb, and included the tongue-in-cheek message, “#TimesSquare tradition rings in the #NewYear by dropping the big ball...if needed, we are #ready to drop something much, much bigger.’


The tweet was subsequently deleted by STRATCOM, which apologized, “Our previous NYE tweet was in poor taste & does not reflect our values. We apologize. We are dedicated to the security of America & allies.” One wag, on STATCOM’S Twitter page commented, “If you can't be trusted with twitter, how can we trust you with nukes?”


The MOAB, officially named the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, is not a nuclear bomb. It was last dropped in combat on an ISIS cave complex in Afghanistan in April 2017.


MARINE DEATH UNDER INVESTIGATION: A U.S. Marine stationed in Washington, D.C., died on duty from a gunshot wound. Washington D.C. Police Department responded to the scene at the Marine Barracks at 8th and I early yesterday morning. The Marine Corps did not provide the name of the victim, or provide additional information about how he died.


The Washington Post quotes two officials with knowledge of the investigation as saying the initial reports indicate the Marine appeared to have been struck by an accidental discharge from another Marine’s weapon.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – When Rashida Tlaib stands for her ceremonial swearing-in Thursday as the first Palestinian-American woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, it will be with her hand on a copy of the Koran.
But this won't be just any Koran: She will use Thomas Jefferson's personal copy of George Sale's 1734 translation of the Koran into English, a two-volume work that resides in the Library of Congress.
"It's important to me because a lot of Americans have this kind of feeling that Islam is somehow foreign to American history," said Tlaib, who also will become, with Minnesota's Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women sworn into the U.S. House. "Muslims were there at the beginning. ... Some of our founding fathers knew more about Islam than some members of Congress now."
She won't be surprised, however, if her using the Koran raises hackles for some people who believe she shouldn't be allowed to do so. Twelve years ago, when U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., used the same Koran for his swearing-in as Congress' first Muslim member, some commentators argued that only a Bible was suitable for the purpose.
Already, conservative pastor and radio commentator E.W. Jackson has complained following Tlaib's and Omar's elections that, "The floor of Congress is now going to look like an Islamic republic" and argued that the U.S. is a "Judeo-Christian country."
Tlaib, a Detroit Democrat who was elected to the seat formerly held by U.S. Rep. John Conyers, said she's unfazed by comments such as Jackson's and expects that the objections will extend well beyond her being sworn into office the first week of January, even though she says she's far more concerned with economic and environmental help for her constituents than pushing any religious agenda.
"My mere existence, that I'm even of Muslim faith, is going to be a problem for them with or without me swearing in on any Koran."
No book, of any kind, is needed for a member's swearing-in Contrary to some beliefs, there is no requirement that new members of Congress be sworn in on the Bible or any other book. In fact, when they are officially sworn in, no book at all is used, though each member can hold one — any one — if they wish.
As the New York Times once put it, one could use "a comic book, a lesser Shakespeare play or nothing at all" for the function.
That official swearing-in happens at the beginning of every new Congress, around noon on Jan. 3, shortly after the election of the House speaker, who then asks the members to rise together, raise their right hands and take the oath of office, required by the Constitution and written into law:
"Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter, so help you God?"
The members respond en masse: "I do," after which they are, officially, members of Congress.
After that, however, new U.S. House members generally attend individual — and ceremonial — swearings-in inside the speaker's office. Flanked by family and friends, the new member stands with the speaker for a photo, often placing one hand on the Bible and raising his or her other hand — though again, no book is mandated, no book is required.
It's at this ceremonial swearing-in that Tlaib will use Jefferson's Koran.
Jefferson's Koran dates to his days in law school That Koran — otherwise known in Sale's work as the Alcoran of Mohammed — is an edition that represents the first English translation of the text in North America and one that Jefferson purchased as a law student at the College of William & Mary in 1765.
And while there are no existing examples of Jefferson citing this Koran, it's thought that he bought it at a time when it might have been useful to his studies under noted law professor George Wythe, said Chris Warren, with the Rare Book & Special Collections Division at the Library of Congress.
"He probably purchased it because he was studying law and to get a better understanding on Islam's influence on the legal systems of the world," Warren said. "Jefferson wasn't only thinking about and studying western law ... a lot of those (early American) tenets come from places like the Bible and the Koran and the Old Testament."
He noted that Jefferson wrote Virginia's Statute on Religious Freedom — and intended it to apply to Muslims, Hindus and Jews as well as Christians — and that a large number of slaves brought into the U.S. were Muslim, which could also have piqued the interest of Jefferson, who was a slave owner.
"Islamic people have been in this country as long as everybody else, one way or another," added Warren.
The volume isn't entirely pristine — it was rebound in the early 1900s — but it's in good shape, said Warren.

Texto completo: Republican U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and her Democratic opponent Mike Espy spent more than a combined $6.6 million in the closing weeks of a race that wound up being closer than many originally expected, according to Federal Election Commission filings posted last week.
In the days after the general election Nov. 6 through the runoff contest at the end of last month, Hyde-Smith spent about $1.7 million on the way to her win, while Espy dropped nearly $4.9 million.
The late stages of the race were marked by a frenzy of national attention — and fundraising — after a video of Hyde-Smith talking about how she would be "on the front row" if a supporter invited her to a "public hanging."
Hyde-Smith ultimately beat Espy by about eight points.
The filings show Espy brought in about as much as he spent over that period, with Hyde-Smith raising about $1.6 million.
They also show Hyde-Smith has not refunded a number of donations major companies asked to be returned in the wake of the hanging remarks, which drew sustained controversy considering Mississippi's long history of racial violence.
The Hyde-Smith campaign did return donations to three people, including $2,700 maximum donations from both San Francisco Giants' principal owner Charles Johnson and his wife, Ann.
The campaign also gave back a maximum contribution from Peter Zieve, after coming under fire in November for accepting the donation from the Seattle businessman. Zieve is known for being sued over discriminating against Muslims in his hiring practices.
Three political action committees also got their $5,000 contributions back, though the filings indicate two of the refunds — to Amgen and Major League Baseball — were because the companies cancelled their checks.
The campaign gave the National Cattlemen's Assocation PAC its money back.
Companies that asked but have not received their money back, according to the filings, include Union Pacific, Wal-Mart, Walgreens, AT&T and a number of others. Many of the companies indicated to The New York Times recently they did not expect to get the money back, despite their requests.
Campaign finance rules don't require candidates to refund contributions from donors who ask for them back.
Hyde-Smith will have significant fundraising to do for a 2020 reelection campaign; she has about $64,000 remaining in her campaign account following the most recent race.
Espy, who has also filed to run again in two years, has about $238,000 on hand.
Hyde-Smith had been appointed in April to temporarily take the seat of retiring longtime Sen. Thad Cochran, before winning the remainder of Cochran's six-year term on Nov. 27.

Texto completo: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel on Tuesday after a visit with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose team was caught off guard by President Trump's plan to withdraw from Syria.

Pompeo met with Netanyahu in Brazil, writing in a Twitter post: “the United States fully supports Israel's right to defend itself. The U.S.-Israeli alliance is strong.”

Critics of Trump’s decision to leave Syria, which prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have said it will empower Iranian-allied fighters in the war-torn country at a time when Israel is already worried by the Iran's growing influence.

Netanyahu has vowed to compensate for the U.S. withdrawal by escalating Israel's fight against Iranian-backed troops supporting the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The country has mounted attacks against Iranian targets in Syria in recent months.

Trump’s Syria decision "in no way changes anything that this administration is working on alongside Israel," Pompeo said Tuesday.

"The counter-ISIS campaign continues, our efforts to counter Iranian aggression continue and our commitment to Middle East stability and the protection of Israel continues in the same way it did before that decision was made," he said.

Trump will allow the military about four months to withdraw the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, backtracking from his previous order, announced on Twitter, that the military leave within 30 days, according to reports by the New York Times and others.

Texto completo: They say out with the old and in with the new when the year turns, but don't shelve last year's books quite yet: The titles you devoured in 2018 can help determine what to pick up in 2019. Here are 10 options to consider based on some of last year's favorites.
If you enjoyed "The Woman in the Window," by A.J. Finn, read "My Lovely Wife," by Samantha Downing (Berkley, March 26) In this "Dexter"-like debut thriller, a couple gets bored and, naturally, spice things up with murder. They get away with it - until they don't, of course, which is when things start to get interesting in this dark, disturbing exploration of family, marriage and murderous compulsions.
If you enjoyed "Educated," by Tara Westover, read "A Good Wife," by Samra Zafar (HarperCollins, March 5) At 17, Zafar was forced to marry a stranger and move to Canada, leaving her family - and dreams - behind in Pakistan. Years of emotional and physical abuse followed, inflicted by a husband who isolated her. In her searing debut memoir, Zafar describes mustering the strength to concoct an escape plan for herself and her daughters, and risking cultural isolation by walking away to build a new future.
If you enjoyed "The Tattooist of Auschwitz," by Heather Morris, read "The Huntress," by Kate Quinn (William Morrow Paperbacks, Feb. 26) During the final days of World War II, the Huntress - a Nazi - commits horrific acts before fleeing to America. Three people, including an English journalist and Russian bomber pilot, embark on a hunt to find her. Their stories converge with that of 17-year-old Jordan McBride, whose pretty new stepmother has a past shrouded in secrecy.
If you enjoyed "Bad Blood," by John Carreyrou, read "Bitcoin Billionaires: A True Story of Genius, Betrayal, and Redemption," by Ben Mezrich (Flatiron Books, May 21) Mezrich's "The Accidental Billionaires" - his 2009 account of Facebook's founding - was the basis for "The Social Network," that little movie starring Jesse Eisenberg. Parts of the book examined Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss's lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg claiming that the idea for the site had been stolen from them. In "Bitcoin Billionaires," Mezrich returns to the identical twins' story: In the wake of their legal battle with Facebook, the Winklevosses went all in on cryptocurrency, and in 2017, became the first bitcoin billionaires. Expect a deeply reported "only in Silicon Valley" saga.
If you enjoyed "The Golden State Killer," by Michelle McNamara, read "Stay Sexy & Don't Get Murdered: The Definitive How-To Guide," by Georgia Hardstark and Karen Kilgariff (Forge Books, May 28) It stands to reason that the late McNamara's obsessive search for the Golden State Killer resonated with many of the same people who tune in to cult-favorite true-crime podcast "My Favorite Murder." In their upcoming book, charmingly brash co-hosts Hardstark and Kilgariff reflect on their struggles with depression, eating disorders and addiction. They also impart advice on the importance of personal safety and, well, how to stay alive in this dangerous world.
If you enjoyed "The Kiss Quotient," by Helen Hoang, read "Things You Save in a Fire," by Katherine Center (St. Martin's, Aug. 13) A spirited, independent heroine meets a smoking-hot fireman in Center's smart romance. On Page 1, Cassie Hanwell becomes the youngest person - and only female ever - to win the Austin Fire Department's Valor Award. Shortly thereafter, she's forced to relocate to an old-school Boston firehouse with hazing, poor facilities and firemen who aren't thrilled to have a woman on the crew. Except, of course, for a dapper rookie.
If you enjoyed "There There," by Tommy Orange, read "The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America From 1890 to the Present," by David Treuer (Riverhead, Jan. 22) Treuer grew up on the Leech Lake Reservation in northern Minnesota, part of the Ojibwe tribe, and then pursued a doctorate in anthropology, with an emphasis on past and present native life. His forthcoming counternarrative blends memoir - a retelling of his own family and tribe's experiences - and in-depth, detailed reporting on 125 years of native history.
If you enjoyed "An American Marriage," by Tayari Jones, read "The Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls," by Anissa Gray (Berkley, Feb. 19) Gray's debut introduces a trio of reeling sisters: Althea, who's just been sentenced to prison for food stamp fraud and charity embezzlement, and Viola and Lillian, who return to the home where they were raised to care for Althea's resentful daughters. Each chapter is narrated by an alternating sister, revealing layers of complex family history and demons. It all fuses into an absorbing commentary on love, family and forgiveness.
If you enjoyed "Children of Blood and Bone," by Tomi Adeyemi, read "The Gilded Wolves," by Roshani Chokshi (Wednesday Books, Jan. 15) In glitzy 1889 Paris, hotelier Séverin Montagnet-Alarie's team of teenage miscreants is helping him exact revenge against those who denied him an heirship 10 years prior. When Séverin is approached by a powerful society that promises to restore his inheritance if he helps execute a dangerous heist, he's thrust into an occult world that will kill him if he doesn't tread carefully.
If you enjoyed "My Ex-Life," by Stephen McCauley, read "Fleishman Is in Trouble," by Taffy Brodesser-Akner (Random House, June 18) This satiric debut comes from Brodesser-Akner, the New York Times Magazine writer you might know for that viral profile of Gwyneth Paltrow. Newly separated Dr. Toby Fleishman is enjoying a sexual resurgence - not one woman he meets can resist him. But then his ex drops their kids off at his place and never returns. Toby adopts the appealing persona of "spurned husband" as he attempts to juggle women, kids and patients, but figuring out what has become of his missing ex will require unfamiliar - and uncomfortable - introspection.
